According to a report from Politico, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a key negotiator for the Republican side, expressed optimism that a new draft of the bill could be released this week. Lummis aims to have the bill ready for markup before Congress adjourns for the holiday break, stating, “Knock on wood, I hope to share a draft at the end of this week that reflects our best efforts to date.” Lummis Urges Swift Progress On Crypto Legislation During a panel discussion hosted by the Blockchain Association, Sen. Lummis emphasized the urgency of progressing with the legislation. She remarked that it might be advantageous for lawmakers to finalize a product and proceed with the markup next week, allowing everyone to take a break for the Christmas holidays. In related developments, Politico reported that Senate Banking Republicans submitted a proposal to their Democratic counterparts last week, suggesting over 30 amendments to a previous draft of the legislation.

Predictions Point To A $150,000 Rally In 2026 The three-page document, which comes from GOP senators on the Banking Committee, seeks to maintain certain elements of the original bill while incorporating adjustments acceptable to Democratic lawmakers. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and other Republicans are eager to finalize the markup next week, although some Democrats have expressed skepticism about this ambitious timeline. Following a meeting on Monday, Democrats sent a response to the GOP offer, but details of their feedback remain unclear. Concessions In GOP’s Proposal The GOP’s proposal outlines the aspects from a September crypto market structure framework that they agree to integrate into a bipartisan bill, hoping to reconcile differences with their Democratic colleagues. The proposal includes a two-column table delineating 38 concessions the Republicans are willing to make, in exchange for retaining or modifying 32 sections of the original Responsible Financial Innovation Act discussion draft.

Additionally, the proposal contains ethics provisions aimed at addressing scrutiny over the Trump family’s business connections in the crypto sector. However, Lummis noted a previous ethics proposal she negotiated with Sen. Ruben Gallego was rejected by the White House, and she plans to collaborate further with Democrats to revisit the issue. Other notable concessions from the Republicans include a section on consumer protection standards for digital assets, proposed language regarding bankruptcy, the establishment of a federal baseline for crypto ATMs, and risk management standards for digital asset intermediaries.

Saylor generated a buzz with his comments during his keynote at the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on December 8, 2025. Saylor’s tour across the Middle East puts the Bitcoin proponent in direct contact with large investors from wealthy petrodollar countries. Strategy’s stock is far from its historical highs as BTC slowly fights back from a collapse in BTC price to the $80,000 range. What did Saylor say at Bitcoin MENA? According to him, BTC is not just a simple investment, but should be regarded as the foundation for a new era of “digital capital” and yield-generating financial products. During his keynote in Abu Dhabi, he talked about Strategy and its accumulation strategy. He described the market as a “$200 trillion opportunity,” referring to the potential scale of global credit markets that could be unlocked via Bitcoin-backed banking, custody, and lending. He likened BTC to “digital gold,” acknowledging its current valuation level and highlighting bullish projections expected in 4 to 8 years, implying that if the Middle East moved now, it could become a global hub for BTC innovation. And that’s how the region could attract “trillions” in foreign capital seeking yield. The wealth funds in these areas collectively manage trillions in assets, much of which comes from oil revenues, and are traditionally invested in assets like U.S. Treasuries, real estate, and equities. However, Saylor wants them to pivot toward BTC to future-proof their economies amid the declining petrodollar system. “All the money will come to you,” he said. Critical MSCI decision looms for Strategy The firm is now navigating the most complex period in its storied history as a corporate Bitcoin treasury. In the past, the Tysons Corner-based firm operated with a distinct advantage that allowed its equity to trade at a significant premium to the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium was the engine of the company’s capital strategy and helped management raise billions in equity and convertible debt to acquire Bitcoin, effectively engaging in regulatory arbitrage that benefited mainly from the lack of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. While naysayers like Peter Schiff delight have rolled out the drums as Strategy fell on hard times recently, Saylor made a big statement with the firm’s latest BTC purchase of almost $1 billion on Monday, as Cryptopolitan reported . While the vanishing premium has stalled the company’s growth engine, the looming decision by MSCI Inc. has become a more immediate structural threat. The index provider is currently conducting a consultation on the classification of digital asset treasury (DAT) companies. A decision is expected on January 15, 2026, after the review period ending December 31. Should Strategy be reclassified as a DAT , it could be pushed out of flagship equity benchmarks, potentially triggering forced selling of between $2.8 billion and $8.8 billion by passive funds.

The answer carries immense weight, determining which regulator oversees a project and what rules it must follow. In a revealing interview, former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Paul Atkins provided crucial clarity, stating that a significant number of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are not securities . This perspective from a seasoned regulator cuts through the noise and offers a more nuanced view of crypto asset classification. What Did the Former SEC Commissioner Actually Say? Paul Atkins, who served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, spoke with Decrypt to share his expert analysis. He argued that many tokens sold during ICOs possess clear non-security characteristics. His core point is that tokens designed for specific utility within a network—like accessing a service, representing digital collectibles, or functioning as tools—should not fall under traditional securities laws. Therefore, he believes a blanket application of SEC rules to all ICOs is incorrect. Why Does It Matter If ICOs Are Not Securities? The distinction between a security and a non-security token is not just legal jargon; it’s the difference between two entirely different regulatory worlds. When the SEC classifies a token as a security, the project faces stringent registration, disclosure, and compliance requirements designed for traditional investments like stocks. This can stifle innovation and burden early-stage projects with immense cost and complexity. Atkins suggests that tokens with genuine utility should instead be overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates commodities like gold and oil. This framework could be more appropriate for digital assets that function as a medium of exchange or a consumable product within an ecosystem, rather than an investment contract. What Types of ICOs Might Avoid Security Classification? Based on Atkins’s comments and existing legal guidance like the Howey Test, several token models may legitimately argue they are not securities. Here are key examples: Utility Tokens: Tokens that grant access to a current or future software service, platform, or network function. The primary purpose is use, not investment. Digital Collectibles (NFTs): Unique tokens representing ownership of a digital or physical asset, such as art, music, or in-game items, where value is derived from scarcity and ownership rights. Payment & Exchange Tokens: Tokens designed primarily to be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, similar to traditional currency. Governance Tokens: Tokens that provide holders with voting rights on protocol decisions, focusing on ecosystem participation rather than profit expectation from the efforts of others. What Are the Challenges for Crypto Projects? Despite this clarifying perspective, the path forward is not simple. The main challenge is the lack of clear, formal rules from regulators. Projects often operate in a gray area, unsure of how their token will be viewed. This regulatory uncertainty can deter serious developers and legitimate investors. Furthermore, the SEC’s current enforcement-focused approach has created a climate of fear, where the threat of action looms over even well-intentioned projects trying to build functional networks. Actionable Insights for Investors and Builders So, what can you do with this information? For investors, it underscores the importance of deep due diligence. Look beyond the hype and ask: What is this token’s actual utility? Is there a working product, or just a promise? Understanding the difference between a security token offering and a utility token sale is critical for assessing risk and regulatory exposure. For project founders, the message is to design with intention. If your goal is to create a functional network, structure your tokenomics to emphasize utility, access, and consumption from the very start. Document this purpose clearly. Proactive engagement with legal experts who understand the evolving ICOs are not securities argument is no longer optional—it’s essential for longevity. Conclusion: A Step Toward Sensible Crypto Regulation Paul Atkins’s comments are a vital contribution to the debate on crypto regulation. They highlight that a one-size-fits-all approach is ineffective and potentially harmful. Recognizing that many ICOs are not securities is the first step toward creating a regulatory environment that protects investors without crushing innovation. The future of cryptocurrency depends on this kind of nuanced understanding, where utility is distinguished from investment, and rules are fit for purpose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean no ICOs are securities? A> No. Atkins stated that “many” ICOs are not securities, not “all.” Tokens that represent an investment contract where buyers expect profits primarily from the efforts of others are likely still securities under the Howey Test. Q: What is the Howey Test? A> It’s a legal test derived from a 1946 Supreme Court case used to determine if a transaction qualifies as an “investment contract” and is therefore a security. It examines if there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits (4) derived from the efforts of others. Q: If a token isn’t a security, who regulates it? A> As Atkins suggested, the CFTC may have jurisdiction if the token is considered a commodity. Other aspects might fall under consumer protection laws, money transmission rules, or, in some cases, no specific financial regulator at all. Q: How can I tell if a token I’m interested in is a utility token or a security? A> Analyze its stated purpose. Is it used to power a network or app right now? Or is the main pitch about its future value and the development team’s work to increase that value? The latter leans toward a security. Q: Will the current SEC change its stance based on this? A> While insightful, this is the opinion of a former official. The current SEC leadership, under Chair Gary Gensler, has generally taken a broader view, suggesting most crypto tokens are securities. However, it adds weight to the ongoing legal and political debate. Join the Conversation Regulatory clarity is essential for the healthy growth of the crypto ecosystem.

Most analysts are expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates, something which has increased positivity in the crypto market after a difficult couple of months. As for SHIB, it has experienced a 248% increase in its burn rate over the past 24 hours, as chain activity increases. This suggests that a recovery could be on the way, and when combined with some bullish chart patterns, the Shiba Inu price prediction is starting to look very good. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Market Thinks SHIB Is Dead – But This Chart Pattern Says a Monster Move Is Coming Soon As the Shibburn X account revealed today, Shiba Inu has burned 75.7 million SHIB tokens in the past week and 14.3 million SHIB tokens in the past 24 hours. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00000846 (1hr -0.61% ▼ | 24hr 0.42% ▲ ) Market Cap: $4,984,165,047 (0.43% ▲) Total Supply: 589,246,095,654,536 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 14,288,659 (248.18% ▲) Past 7 Days: 75,668,582 (-35.14% ▼) — Shibburn (@shibburn) December 9, 2025 This 24-hour figure is encouraging, indicating a growth in activity as we approach tomorrow’s FOMC rate decision. And if we look at SHIB’s price chart, we see that it may have begun a sustained recovery after weeks in a heavily oversold position. Its relative strength index (yellow) is about to rise above 50, having spent the previous three months below this level almost constantly. Source: TradingView Similarly, its MACD (orange, blue) is also on its way up and could turn positive in the next few days. This could signal a breakout, and if the Fed does provide a rate cut tomorrow, such a breakout could arrive quickly. As far as the longer term is concerned, Shiba Inu does have some things to look forward to, including the possible launch of a multi-crypto ETF from T. Rowe that classes SHIB as an eligible token . Such a launch could drive considerable interest in SHIB, although so far there’s no indication of how much of an allocation the meme coin would receive, if any. Otherwise, Shiba Inu has been having a problem attracting significant investment, with its price down by 71.5% in the past 12 months. Despite attempts to make itself fundamentally stronger and more valuable (e.g., by launching layer-two network Shibarium in 2023), the market seems to have lost interest, with shibariumscan.io recording only 2,635 transactions on Shibarium in the past 24 hours. Hopefully, upcoming upgrades can make layer two more attractive next year, boosting the Shiba Inu price over the longer term. Shibarium aiming for a privacy upgrade in 2026 says something bigger than just SHIB news. It shows where the entire industry is heading: 𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀, 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀.

What’s exciting about presale coins is that, if they generate enough momentum during their sales, they can often rally hard when they list for the first time. Accordingly, one of the most interesting presale tokens available right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $2.3 million. Upgrading Nodes is like leveling up in life. Suddenly everything feels easier. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/FHs8HwglBs — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 5, 2025 Its sale will end in just under 30 days, giving newcomers only a limited window in which to buy the token at what could end up being a steep discount. It has attracted lots of interest by virtue of its unique slant on mining, with its platform giving users the opportunity to grow and operate virtual mining rigs. Rather than needing expensive – and power-hungry – physical hardware, PEPENODE enables users to mine simply by spending PEPENODE tokens on virtual nodes. By purchasing more nodes and upgrading, users can earn more mining rewards, which PEPENODE will pay out in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. This system could make PEPENODE incredibly profitable and popular, with demand potentially surging for the PEPENODE token. Holders will also be able to stake the token for a regular income, making the coin doubly profitable. Latecomers to the sale can join it by going to the PEPENODE website , but should remember that it will end in 30 days. The token is currently selling for its final presale price of $0.0011873, although this could rise much higher once it goes live in the next few weeks.

Analysts believe this could push the Bitcoin price prediction beyond the current cycle high of $126,000.

Moreover, the Bitcoin hash ribbon indicator has now flashed green, historically signaling favorable entry points for market participants. The hash chart reveals the 30-day moving average of hashrate dropping below the 60-day MA, a pattern indicating miner capitulation that typically coincides with major price discounts and long-term accumulation opportunities. This comes as Bitcoin experienced a short squeeze that propelled the price through the $94,000 resistance level. Crypto analyst Trader Mayne notes Bitcoin is currently testing the yearly open around $93,000, with potential to extend gains toward $98,000 and subsequently $106,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $106K Next as MACD Flips Bullish The daily chart shows Bitcoin attempting to break free from a multi-week descending trendline after spending most of November in controlled decline. Price is now pushing above diagonal resistance with noticeably increased volume, indicating buyers are re-entering the market. The MACD has crossed bullish and is accelerating upward from deeply oversold levels, a configuration that typically precedes mid-term reversals rather than temporary bounces. Price is also reclaiming the daily pivot zone, suggesting momentum is shifting from defensive consolidation toward early recovery. Source: TradingView If this breakout holds, Bitcoin is positioned to retest major pivot levels around $98,000–$100,000, which will serve as the first significant barrier to trend reversal. A decisive close above that range would unlock movement toward $105,000–$110,000. However, failure to maintain support above the trendline would pull the price back toward the $85,000–$82,000 support band, where lower pivot levels align with the former breakdown zone. Bitcoin’s First Real Layer 2 Token $HYPER Could Skyrocket Next Bitcoin isn’t the only asset investors anticipate experiencing a supercycle in 2026 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is another project generating substantial attention as it develops the first genuine Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, utilizing Solana-based technology to deliver speed and scalability while preserving Bitcoin’s security model. Powered by a fast and scalable Solana-based Layer 2 infrastructure, the project has raised over $29M to enable developers to launch Bitcoin-native decentralized applications. This provides BTC holders with new opportunities to deploy their assets productively, using on-chain tools built specifically for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As leading wallets and exchanges integrate this scaling solution, demand for $HYPER is anticipated to go up very fast. To acquire $HYPER before the next price increase, visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your preferred wallet (such as Best Wallet).

Earlier in October, total market capitalization reached a record level of approximately $4.27 trillion. That momentum proved short-lived, as prices retreated sharply following widespread selling pressure days later. Since then, the global market has struggled to regain its earlier strength. After briefly recovering to around $3.9 trillion in mid-November, the market faced renewed resistance and reversed course once again. At present, the global crypto market stands at $3.22 trillion, reflecting a loss of more than $1 trillion from the early October peak. These developments have affected nearly all large-cap assets, including XRP. XRP’s Position Amid the Downturn XRP, currently ranked among the largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, has also experienced a substantial decline during this period. Over the past month, its market value has dropped by roughly $40 billion, leaving XRP with a market capitalization of around $137 billion. This decline has occurred alongside a broader downturn affecting the entire sector. Despite the reduction in value, XRP’s share of the total market has not decreased at the same pace. On October 6, the asset held approximately 4.28% of the market. As of now, its share stands at about 4.25%, representing only a slight change. This indicates that most major cryptocurrencies have been impacted in a similar manner, preserving their relative positions. Even with this stability in relative terms, XRP’s dominance remains below its yearly peak of 5.53%, recorded earlier in July. This suggests that the asset has experienced a gradual decline in comparative influence over the past several months, even before the most recent downturn. Evaluating a 15% Market Share Scenario Several analysts maintain that XRP could eventually regain some of its lost share, with a few expressing confidence that it could even surpass Ethereum’s current level of market dominance, which is near 11.9%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Based on this sentiment, a hypothetical scenario was examined to determine the potential valuation of XRP if the asset reached 15% dominance within the current market environment. Historically, XRP has reached far higher dominance levels. In early 2017, the asset accounted for more than 31% of the total market, though this figure corresponded to a much smaller global market size at that time. If XRP were to secure 15% of today’s $3.22 trillion market, its capitalization would rise to roughly $483 billion. With an estimated circulating supply of 60 billion units, this valuation would imply a price near $8 per token . Compared to the current price of approximately $2.27, this would reflect an increase of more than 250%. Analyst Expectations and Outlook Predictions of a potential rise to the $8 range are not new within the XRP community. Some market analysts, including Dark Defender, have proposed that the asset could reach this level based on technical wave patterns. Others, such as Cobb, expressed confidence earlier in the year that XRP has the potential to approach or reach $8 under favorable market conditions. While such projections remain speculative, the analysis illustrates how a relative gain in market dominance, even without an expansion of the global crypto market, could significantly affect XRP’s valuation.

The company will also expand its three existing regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune. Microsoft is introducing Sovereign Public Cloud and Sovereign Private Cloud solutions that are designed to give Indian organizations more control over data compliance and operational sovereignty. Microsoft 365 Copilot will allow India’s data to be processed inside the country by the end of 2025, making India one of the top four global markets to receive this option. The company now plans to equip 20 million Indians with essential AI skills by 2030, up from its earlier goal of 10 million. Through its ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative, Microsoft has already trained 5.6 million people since January 2025. Its programs have enabled more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. Microsoft announced plans to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two government platforms operated by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The e-Shram and National Career Service platforms will use Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, and automated resume creation for more than 310 million informal workers. Microsoft employs over 22,000 people in India across cities, including Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, and Noida. The company has operated in the country for more than three decades and continues to expand its presence to support growing demand for cloud services and AI tools. Why is India attracting massive tech investments? With approximately one billion internet users, India represents one of the largest potential customer bases for cloud services and AI applications. The nation can also boast of millions of software developers and engineers who can build and support AI infrastructure. The Indian government has introduced financial incentives aimed at attracting global chipmakers and major technology companies. Data centers are viewed as India’s best opportunity to participate in the AI boom, given that the country has limited chip manufacturing capabilities. Total data center capacity in India is expected to more than triple to about 4.5 gigawatts by 2030. In October 2025, Google announced a $15 billion investment to last over a period of five years to build an AI data center in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The AI data center is Google’s largest investment in India and one of its biggest AI infrastructure projects globally. The facility will feature gigawatt-scale data center operations and an international subsea cable gateway. Microsoft also announced plans to invest $10 billion in AI infrastructure in Portugal and $15 billion in the United Arab Emirates last month. On the same day as the India announcement, Microsoft revealed it would invest more than $5.4 billion in Canada over the next two years, expanding its Azure Local cloud offering and partnering with Canadian AI startup Cohere. Microsoft and other big U.S. cloud providers are expected to spend more than $400 billion on AI this year to build data centers needed to support services like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini.

Most major tokens have not escaped this decline, although Zcash has posted a 7% gain in the past 24 hours, while newcomer MemeCore has risen by 9%. Despite the wobble, the market could be in a prime position for an end-of-year rally, especially if the Fed does cut rates by another 0.25%. Assuming a surge in positivity, we’ve picked our best new meme coin to buy today, which is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new Ethereum-based token that’s aiming to innovate mining. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today Under 1 Cent – 9 December PEPENODE’s presale will end in 30 days, giving latecomers a limited window of opportunity in which to buy the token early. The sale has already raised $2.3 million , a sign that, even in a bearish market, it has generated considerable interest from investors. The PepeNode countdown has begun! Fire up your virtual mining rigs and get ready to upgrade some nodes. In 30 days the Presale will end! https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/a3m07joFrH — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 8, 2025 As noted above, its unique selling point is that it takes a unique approach to mining, enabling users to mine tokens without having to invest in expensive mining equipment and facilities. It will launch a virtual mining platform in which users can build and run their own virtual rigs, complete with virtual nodes that they can buy and sell. By buying more nodes using PEPENODE tokens, users will increase their mining rewards, which they can increase even further by upgrading nodes and combining them in novel ways. Because the PEPENODE token is necessary to build mining rigs, it could attract massive demand, pushing up its price over time. Demand will also come from the fact that holders can stake the token, earning themselves a passive income in the process. In fact, PEPENODE’s staking yield currently stands at 562% APY , and while this will decline in proportion to staking volumes, it remains a hugely competitive rate. PEPENODE Launches in 30 Days: How to Buy Before Listing These tokenomics and features make PEPENODE more than just another Pepe-themed meme token, which is why it’s our best meme coin to buy at the moment. Again, its sale will end in 30 days, at which point presale buyers will receive their tokens, in time for exchange listings. While the clock is ticking, investors can still join the sale by going to the official PEPENODE website . By connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), they can buy any amount of PEPENODE, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat. The coin is now selling at its final presale price of $0.0011873, and judging by its early successes, it could eclipse this price once it lists. Indeed, in 30 days, crypto may have reentered a bull market, giving PEPENODE the ideal platform for strong growth.

The designation allows firms licensed by the ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) to conduct regulated activities involving USDT on Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos, TON, and Tron blockchain networks. Extending USDT’s Regulated Footprint The move follows what the company described as ongoing engagement with the FSRA to demonstrate the resilience, transparency, and compliance elements of its operations. The latest approval expands on earlier ADGM recognition of USDT on Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, thereby broadening the regulatory coverage of the stablecoin across a wider range of blockchain networks. According to the official press release, the combined approvals create a multi-chain framework that lets ADGM-licensed firms support more networks while operating within one of the sector’s established regulatory jurisdictions. With this decision, USDT is now recognised in ADGM on nearly all major blockchains supported by the issuer. Tether said the multi-chain approval increases interoperability and allows USDT to be used as a settlement asset for trading and decentralized applications, while meeting AFRT requirements set by the FSRA. Following the development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said “The UAE continues to set the global standard for digital asset regulation, and Tether is proud to contribute to this leadership. This milestone highlights Tether’s dedication to advancing financial inclusion and innovation on a global scale. Introducing USDT within ADGM’s regulated digital asset framework reinforces the role of stablecoins as essential components of today’s financial landscape. It also creates fresh opportunities for collaboration and growth throughout the Middle East. By extending recognition to USDT on several major blockchains, ADGM further strengthens Abu Dhabi’s position as a global hub for compliant digital finance.” In November, Tether expanded its presence in Bitcoin-backed finance through a strategic investment in Ledn, a lending platform that provides credit secured by BTC. Ledn offers products such as risk management tools, advanced custody, liquidation systems, and allows users to access loans without selling their digital assets. Tether said the investment aligns with its goal of supporting real-world credit markets and broadening access to both retail and institutional borrowers. Circle’s UAE Expansion Meanwhile, the latest approval for USDT in ADGM comes as rival stablecoin issuer Circle also strengthens its foothold in the UAE. Circle announced securing a Financial Services Permission license from the FSRA of Abu Dhabi Global Market, which will allow the company to operate as a Money Services Provider within the international financial center. Alongside the regulatory milestone, the fintech also said it has appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar as Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa. Dr. Jaffar, who joins from Visa where she served as Senior Vice President and Group Country Manager for the Gulf Cooperation Council, will oversee the company’s regional operations and lead efforts to advance partnerships with financial institutions and enterprises. The USDC issuer also stated that her focus will include supporting the adoption of digital dollars and on-chain payment solutions across the UAE and wider MEA markets.

The altcoin is growing in scarcity this market cycle, with adoption channels like staking, restaking, layer-2s, digital asset treasuries, and private wallets siphoning off exchange liquidity. These pipelines have created the tightest supply conditions to date. Exchanges now control just 8.7% of circulating Ethereum, the lowest share since Ethereum went live in 2015. Ethereum Exchange Supply. Source: Glassnode . Fresh exposure through U.S. TradFi products such as ETFs deepens the trend. Institutional-grade demand has driven aggressive accumulation under long-term holding strategies. With fewer tokens available, traders are watching for signs of a supply squeeze. Scarcity could trigger sharp upside volatility as demand collides with shrinking liquidity. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Ready To Surge? This scarcity could help fuel the breakout of a bullish head and shoulder pattern, now unfolding. The Ethereum price has confirmed a local bottom at $2,750 , forming higher lows in a fresh uptrend that solidifies the right shoulder. ETH USD 1-day chart, bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. Source: TradingView . Momentum indicators add validity to the trend. The RSI has made a decisive move above the 50 neutral line for the first time since the downtrend began in October, a telling sign of a bottom. The MACD follows suit, continuing to widen its lead above the signal line and demonstrating a lasting uptrend. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 60% move . But as the bull market matures, scarcity only stands to increase, compounding the effects of mainstream adoption and use cases. The move could extend 200% to $10,000 .

The TRUMP memecoin, a digital asset inspired by the 45th U.S. President, has just announced plans to launch a President Trump-themed mobile game. This bold move blends political meme culture with the fast-growing play-to-earn gaming sector, offering a total of $1 million in TRUMP tokens to participants. But what does this mean for investors and gamers alike? Let’s dive into the details of this ambitious project. What is the TRUMP Memecoin Game All About? The official announcement came via the project’s X account, revealing a mobile game built around a presidential theme. The core incentive is powerful: a massive $1 million prize pool in TRUMP tokens, distributed to users who simply join a free waitlist before the launch. This strategy aims to create immediate buzz and user acquisition. The game will operate using OpenLoot technology, a platform known for facilitating blockchain-based in-game assets and economies. This suggests the game might integrate NFTs or other tradable digital items, adding a layer of true digital ownership for players. Why is This a Big Deal for the TRUMP Memecoin? This announcement represents a significant pivot from being a pure speculative asset to having a tangible utility. Memecoins often struggle with long-term viability, but providing a fun, engaging product can foster a stronger, more active community. Here are the key potential benefits: Utility Creation: The game gives the TRUMP memecoin a purpose beyond trading, potentially increasing its intrinsic value. Mass Adoption: Mobile gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry. A fun, free-to-play game could introduce countless new users to the TRUMP token effortlessly. Community Engagement: It transforms holders from passive investors into active players and promoters of the ecosystem. However, challenges exist. The success hinges entirely on the game’s quality and fun factor. A poorly executed game could damage the token’s reputation. Furthermore, the volatile nature of memecoins means the $1 million prize’s dollar value could fluctuate wildly. How Does OpenLoot Technology Power the Experience? The choice of OpenLoot is a critical technical detail. OpenLoot provides the infrastructure for Web3 gaming, allowing for: Seamless wallet integration for players. Secure management of in-game tokens and NFTs. A marketplace for players to buy, sell, or trade their earned assets. This means players might earn unique, tradeable digital items (like themed NFTs) while playing, which they can truly own and sell. It moves beyond simple point-scoring to a player-owned economy, a core philosophy of Web3 gaming. For the TRUMP memecoin, this technology is the engine that could drive real, sustainable engagement. Should You Join the TRUMP Memecoin Game Waitlist? Joining the waitlist is a no-risk, high-reward opportunity for anyone curious about crypto gaming or the TRUMP memecoin. It’s free and positions you for potential token rewards. For crypto enthusiasts, it’s a fascinating case study in how memecoins are evolving. For gamers, it could be a gateway into the world of earning digital assets through play. The actionable insight is simple: if the theme intrigues you, sign up. It costs nothing but could provide early access and a shot at the prize pool. In conclusion, the TRUMP memecoin’s foray into mobile gaming is a daring and innovative experiment. It seeks to solve the utility problem plaguing many meme-based cryptocurrencies by building an engaging product around its brand. While its ultimate success depends on execution and market reception, it undeniably sets a new precedent. It shows that the future of memecoins may not lie in speculation alone, but in building vibrant, interactive ecosystems that reward participation. This game could be the spark that transforms the TRUMP memecoin from a cultural token into a gaming powerhouse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to own TRUMP memecoin to play the game? A: Based on the announcement, no. The game is free-to-play, and joining the waitlist is the primary requirement to be eligible for the $1 million prize pool. Q: What is OpenLoot? A: OpenLoot is a Web3 gaming infrastructure platform. It handles the blockchain elements of the game, like digital wallets and NFT marketplaces, making it easy for players to manage their crypto assets earned in-game. Q: When will the TRUMP memecoin game launch? A: The announcement did not specify a precise launch date, only stating the game is “slated” to come. Interested users should follow the official TRUMP X account for updates. Q: Is the $1 million prize guaranteed in US dollars? A: No. The prize is $1 million worth of TRUMP tokens. The actual dollar value will depend on the market price of the TRUMP memecoin at the time of distribution. Q: What kind of mobile game will it be? A: Specific gameplay details haven’t been revealed yet. The theme is “President Trump-themed,” but the genre (strategy, runner, simulation, etc.) remains to be announced. Q: Is this an official product endorsed by Donald Trump? A> There is no indication this is an officially licensed product.

With technical indicators also flashing buy signals, the question now is whether this consistent inflow will fuel a breakout and shift the current Solana price prediction toward new highs. Last week, $20 million flowed to Solana ETFs despite the latest decline that the token has experienced. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) is currently the largest of these vehicles with assets under management of $660 million, followed by Grayscale’s Solana Trust ETF (GSOL), with nearly $160 million in assets. The staking rewards offered by the Solana blockchain make these vehicles quite attractive for passive investors, especially now that the token has hit an 8-month low at around $125. The odds that the downturn will continue are much lower than they were a couple of months ago. Hence, buying Solana at this level could offer both an attractive opportunity to generate passive income and capital gains if the token starts to recover after the upcoming FOMC meeting. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Needs a Bullish Breakout Above $160 to Start Recovering SOL rose near the $140 level yesterday, but the selling pressure is once again pushing the token back to the low 130s. Trading volumes remain relatively low at $4 billion, accounting for less than 6% of the asset’s circulating market cap. Historically, SOL needs trading volumes above $10 billion to get moving. Source: TradingView Thus far, SOL has found strong support at $130. However, volumes need to confirm that buying interest is picking up its pace before jumping to conclusions. Ideally, the price should break through the $160 level to reverse its downtrend and confirm a bullish outlook for the next few weeks. If that happens, the next stop will likely be $200 as SOL may commence a new uptrend as a result of this move. Top meme coins in the Solana ecosystem had their moment earlier this year, and now seems to be the time for crypto presales to shine. One of this cycle’s hidden gems could be Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a project that has raised $4 million by tapping into the same energy as Dogecoin’s early days. Maxi Doge Is Reviving Dogecoin’s Early Hype And $4 Million Says It’s Working Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised $4 million by channeling the same breakout energy that fueled Dogecoin in its early days. More than just a meme coin, MAXI is creating a hub where holders can share early opportunities , trading setups, and alpha . By building a high-energy, community-driven ecosystem, MAXI is designed to thrive in the next crypto cycle. Through fun competitions like Maxi Ripped and Maxi Gains, traders will get the chance to earn rewards and bragging rights by sharing their best-yielding traders. In addition, the project plans to invest up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds in promising projects, using the returns to reinvest in Maxi Doge for marketing purposes. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

Since early October, the broader digital asset market has been affected by global economic uncertainty, including recent developments in Japan’s monetary policy. These conditions have contributed to XRP’s inability to maintain earlier support zones. The asset is currently trading near $2.14, which reflects a decline of roughly 30% over the past two months. November’s performance has also been weak, with the token showing additional losses that place it on course to record its third straight month of negative returns. The last time XRP experienced three consecutive monthly declines was during the aftermath of the FTX collapse in late 2022. Analyst Identifies Two Price Barriers Before Wave 3 Completion Even with the ongoing deterioration in market sentiment, several analysts note that XRP has shown resilience by remaining above the $2 mark. Among these analysts is Tara, a widely followed market observer who recently reviewed XRP’s technical structure and highlighted two major resistance areas that must be cleared before the asset can advance toward the upper boundary of its current Wave 3 formation. This is exactly what we want to see on #XRP My next target is $2.73 for Wave 3. What we're waiting for now is an impulse wave UP breaking past the 2 local resistances at $2.18 and $2.30. Once those levels break, #XRP will be able to reach W3. I have W4 and W5 measured but keep… pic.twitter.com/wdG0PQ1HOP — TARA (@PrecisionTrade3) December 8, 2025 Tara’s projection places the potential Wave 3 peak around $2.73. This figure represents an increase of approximately 32% from the present value and aligns with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level used in her analysis. The market last reached this price in early October, just before the sharp downturn that began on October 10. To move toward this projected target, Tara emphasizes that XRP must first break through its nearest resistance at $2.18, which aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement zone. Clearing this point would represent the first sign of a meaningful reversal. The second critical barrier lies at $2.30 , marked by a persistent horizontal resistance line that has repeatedly halted upward attempts. Tara argues that overcoming both levels would position XRP for a potential move toward the expected Wave 3 completion. Path Beyond Wave 3 and Future Projections According to Tara, preliminary targets for Waves 4 and 5 are already outlined, although she notes that adjustments may be necessary once the Wave 3 point is confirmed. She expects these developments to shape XRP’s performance throughout 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Her analysis also flags additional resistance near $2.80, another level that has historically limited progress upward. If XRP successfully surpasses this area after completing Wave 3, the market may see an attempt at $3 for the first time since early October. While resistance areas remain central to the immediate outlook, analysts are also monitoring key support zones. Tara points to $2.07 as an essential level that needs to be held to maintain the broader upward structure. XRP briefly dipped below this level, moving to $2.06 at the time of analysis, but has not yet confirmed a deeper breakdown. Another market participant, known as “Guy on the Earth,” identifies the $2 threshold as the primary support to watch. In his view, losing this level would introduce considerably more downside risk. Conversely, he suggests that reclaiming price action above $2.20 could create favorable conditions for a more substantial recovery. XRP’s path forward hinges on how it performs around the tight cluster of support and resistance levels that now define its short-term structure. Analysts like Tara maintain that the asset still has a viable setup for completing Wave 3 , but progress depends on clearing the hurdles at $2.18 and $2.30. At the same time, holding firm above $2.07, and especially above $2, remains essential for preserving the broader upward pattern.

55572961,642541,1765324818,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55572961.jpeg,"Week of Heavy ETF Inflows Pushes XRP Into Compression Zone, Is a Major Move Coming?",https://bitcoinist.com/week-of-heavy-etf-inflows-pushes-xrp-compression/,"XRP spent the past week caught between rising institutional demand and stagnant price action, creating a compression zone that traders say is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Even as U.S. spot XRP ETFs approach the $1 billion AUM milestone, the asset continues to trade within a narrow band, leaving market participants to question whether the prolonged consolidation is setting the stage for a larger move. The disconnect between inflows and price has become one of the week’s most notable themes. Analysts note that while institutional capital continues to accumulate, XRP’s chart remains muted, indicating heavy profit-taking following November’s rally and lingering sell-side pressure across higher timeframes. ETF Momentum Builds as XRP Price Stalls The XRP price is hovering near $2.06, slipping slightly despite consecutive days of ETF inflows. Analysts highlight that large holders likely sold into strength, offsetting the fresh demand entering through regulated products. Even so, XRP ETFs have outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in terms of relative inflow strength, indicating that institutions are positioning themselves early. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that XRP became one of the fastest-growing U.S. crypto ETFs of the year, arguing that broader access through traditional investment accounts is expanding the asset’s investor base. The market reaction remains mixed, with some traders viewing ETFs as a stabilising force, while others see them as limiting upside volatility. Regulatory and Structural Developments Add New Variables Beyond market flows, regulatory commentary added another layer of attention. Former SEC Chair Paul Atkins emphasized tokenization as a practical path forward, highlighting its benefits, including increased transparency and faster settlement. His remarks sparked debate within the XRP community, particularly among those who argue that the XRP Ledger is well-positioned for enterprise-grade tokenization systems. Meanwhile, Ripple’s recent $500 million equity round, structured with downside protection for Wall Street investors, reinforced how closely the company’s valuation is tied to its XRP holdings. Funds reportedly concluded that around 90% of Ripple’s net worth derives from its XRP treasury, underscoring the token’s central role in the firm’s long-term outlook. Technical Picture Shows Compression, Not Capitulation On the charts , XRP remains locked between the $2.07 support level and the $2.18 and $2.30 resistance levels. Analysts note weakening momentum indicators but stable underlying demand. If XRP breaks above these levels, a move toward Wave 3 targets near $2.73 becomes more likely, though failure to do so could trigger another retest of lower support. The XRP price continues to compress, supported by some of the strongest ETF inflows of the year, but constrained by steady selling and broader market caution. Whether this tension resolves upward or downward is the question traders will carry into the next week.

Twenty One Capital Moves 43,500 BTC Amid Major Losses As the token trades around $0.14, its price behavior reflects a broader phase of consolidation, characterized by tighter volatility and increasing on-chain engagement. With new real-world use cases emerging and traders watching for a breakout, DOGE’s long-term trajectory is becoming a point of renewed discussion. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Network Activity Strengthens as Dogecoin Price Holds Key Support Despite muted market reaction to Dogecoin’s 12th anniversary, activity on the network continues to rise. Daily active addresses reached over 67,000 earlier in December, marking the second-highest level in three months. This increase comes as DOGE repeatedly defended the $0.14 support, forming a tight compression range between $0.1406 and $0.1450. Short-term charts indicate multiple rebounds from the $0.14 level, accompanied by decreasing sell volume, an early sign of accumulation. Analysts identify $0.16 as the threshold that would shift DOGE from range-bound movement into a potential trend continuation. Failure to hold support, however, could expose deeper downside toward $0.081, an area highlighted by realized on-chain distribution clusters. Adoption Expands Beyond Market Narratives Recent developments show Dogecoin slowly expanding beyond its memecoin label. In Argentina, certain taxes can now be paid using DOGE, while Alternative Airlines has begun accepting the token for ticket purchases. These integrations, although still modest, indicate real-world traction that supports a longer-term use case narrative. Broader sentiment, however, remains closely tied to macroeconomic conditions. Analysts note that liquidity trends, regulatory developments, and institutional risk appetite continue to shape DOGE’s outlook. The launch of the first Dogecoin ETF in November drew little initial inflow, signaling that large investors remain cautious despite the token’s growing visibility. Long-Term Structure Points to Potential Upside From a structural standpoint, Dogecoin continues to follow a multi-year pattern that some analysts view as constructive. Long-term charts show price action moving within a large triangle formation dating back to 2021, with a cup-and-handle structure still intact on higher timeframes. Weekly RSI levels near 50 resemble conditions seen before DOGE’s 2021 rally, while MACD indicators approach bullish crossovers on both weekly and monthly charts. Forecasts place Dogecoin’s path toward $1 as a possibility later in the decade, with projections suggesting a climb toward that level by 2030. In the near term, the $0.145–$0.16 zone remains the defining barrier that could determine whether DOGE transitions into a stronger upward phase or remains confined to its current band.

This signals a crucial shift from preliminary discussions to actionable frameworks that could reshape the entire digital asset landscape. For investors and builders in the crypto space, understanding this accelerated timeline is now more important than ever. Why is the SEC Accelerating Cryptocurrency Policy Now? According to reports from The Block, Chairman Atkins stated that current regulatory efforts are merely the opening act. He emphasized that several key initiatives are in advanced preparation and will soon yield tangible results. This acceleration addresses years of industry calls for clarity and aims to bridge the gap between rapid technological innovation and existing financial regulations. The move suggests regulators now recognize the urgent need for a structured approach to digital assets. What Are the Key Pillars of the New Cryptocurrency Policy? The accelerated push will focus on three major projects designed to create a more coherent regulatory environment. Atkins highlighted these as foundational to the SEC’s strategy. Token Taxonomy: This initiative seeks to establish clear criteria to determine whether a digital token qualifies as a security. A definitive taxonomy would resolve the long-standing “Howey Test” debates that have created uncertainty for countless projects. Project Crypto: This is a dedicated effort to amend and update existing digital asset regulations. The goal is to tailor rules specifically for the unique properties of blockchain-based assets, moving beyond applying old securities laws to new technology. Innovation Exemption: Perhaps most anticipated, this would create a temporary safe harbor for cryptocurrency startups. It would allow companies to develop and test their networks without immediately facing the full burden of securities regulations, fostering responsible innovation. How Will Accelerated Policy Impact Crypto Markets? The move to fast-track cryptocurrency policy is a double-edged sword for the market. On one hand, clear rules reduce regulatory risk, which is a major barrier for institutional investment. Defined guidelines can legitimize the sector, potentially leading to increased capital inflow and more stable market growth. For developers, it means knowing the rules of the game before building, reducing the chance of costly legal battles down the line. However, acceleration also means change is coming quickly. Projects operating in gray areas may need to adapt their models rapidly. The specific details of the “token taxonomy” will be critical; a broad definition of a security could place significant compliance burdens on many existing tokens. The market’s reaction will likely hinge on the perceived fairness and practicality of the final rules. What Challenges Remain in Crypto Regulation? Despite the positive momentum, significant hurdles persist. The SEC must coordinate with other U.S. agencies like the CFTC, which views many cryptocurrencies as commodities. Achieving a unified, non-contradictory cryptocurrency policy across the government is a complex task. Furthermore, the global nature of blockchain technology means U.S. rules must be considered alongside international frameworks to avoid stifling domestic innovation. Another challenge is ensuring the rules are flexible enough to accommodate future technological advances without requiring constant revision. The SEC’s ability to balance investor protection with the permissionless ethos of crypto will be its ultimate test. A Turning Point for Digital Asset Regulation Chairman Atkins’s commitment marks a potential turning point. The shift from slow, reactive enforcement to proactive, accelerated cryptocurrency policy development is a welcome change for an industry starved for guidance. While the devil will be in the details, the stated focus on taxonomy, tailored rules, and innovation spaces provides a coherent blueprint. The coming year will be decisive, revealing whether this accelerated timeline delivers the clarity needed to unlock the next phase of crypto’s growth in the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did SEC Chair Paul Atkins actually say? He stated the SEC intends to accelerate its push for cryptocurrency policy in the coming year, moving beyond preliminary work to deliver tangible results from several key initiatives. What is the “token taxonomy” project? It’s an effort to create clear criteria for determining if a digital token is a security, aiming to resolve the major legal uncertainty that has plagued the crypto industry. How will an “innovation exemption” help crypto companies? It would provide a temporary safe harbor, allowing startups to develop and test their networks without immediately facing the full scope of securities regulations, encouraging experimentation. When can we expect to see these new policies? While no exact date is given, the “accelerated” timeline and mention of initiatives being prepared suggest proposed rules could emerge within 2025. Will this affect Bitcoin and Ethereum? Policies focused on token taxonomy could impact how all digital assets are classified. However, the SEC has previously suggested Bitcoin is a commodity, and Ethereum’s status may be clarified through this process. What should crypto investors do now?

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed four points to a reading of 26, officially moving the market out of ‘Extreme Fear’ and into the ‘Fear’ zone. This improvement in sentiment, while cautious, offers a revealing glimpse into the collective psychology of crypto investors. But what does this shift really mean for your portfolio? What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? According to data from Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rose from 22 to 26 in a single day. This tool is a crucial barometer, measuring emotions and sentiment from a scale of 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A move from 22 to 26 might seem small, but it represents a meaningful psychological threshold. It suggests that the pervasive panic that often leads to capitulation is receding, replaced by a more measured, though still nervous, outlook. How Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. Understanding its components helps explain why sentiment is improving. The index analyzes six key market factors: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. Reduced extreme volatility can calm fears. Market Volume (25%): Tracks trading activity. Sustained volume can indicate renewed interest. Social Media (15%): Gauges the buzz and conversation tone on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search volume for cryptocurrency terms. The recent rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicates positive movement across several of these metrics. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Shift? Market sentiment is a powerful, often self-fulfilling, force. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a contrarian indicator for many seasoned traders. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes presented buying opportunities for long-term believers, while periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have signaled potential market tops. Therefore, a move away from extreme fear can be an early sign of stabilizing conditions. However, it is vital to remember that this is not a timing tool. A reading of 26 still firmly sits in ‘Fear’ territory, suggesting caution remains the dominant emotion. Navigating the Market with a Clear Head So, how should you respond to this change in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? First, use it as context, not a crystal ball. It confirms the market mood is thawing but is far from euphoric. Second, combine this sentiment data with fundamental analysis of the projects you believe in. Third, consider dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to navigate ongoing uncertainty without trying to predict the exact bottom. The index reminds us that emotions drive markets, and recognizing that can be your greatest advantage. In conclusion, the climb of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from 22 to 26 is a noteworthy development. It marks a psychological shift from the depths of despair to a state of wary apprehension. For the astute observer, this transition phase highlights the importance of disciplined investing over emotional reacting. While the road ahead may still be bumpy, this subtle improvement in sentiment is a reminder that market cycles are always in motion. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 26 mean? A: A score of 26 falls into the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that overall market sentiment has improved from ‘Extreme Fear’ but investors are still predominantly cautious and nervous about price declines. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy/sell signal? A: Not by itself. It is best used as a contrarian sentiment indicator. Extreme values (near 0 or 100) can signal potential market turning points, but it should always be combined with other technical and fundamental analysis. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, typically once per day, based on the latest available data for its component metrics. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A: While it heavily weights Bitcoin-related data (like dominance and search volume), it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as many altcoins move in correlation with Bitcoin. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me, which provides the daily score, historical data, and a breakdown of its components.

Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis finds herself locked in difficult negotiations with the White House over a pivotal crypto bill . The core disagreement? A potentially explosive ethics clause that could prevent government officials from trading digital assets they oversee. This impasse highlights the complex challenge of creating clear rules for a rapidly evolving industry. Why is the Crypto Bill Ethics Clause So Controversial? According to reports from CoinDesk, negotiations have reached a critical impasse. Senator Lummis is championing a strict provision within the broader crypto bill that would block senior officials from personally profiting from the cryptocurrency sector they help regulate. The goal is clear: to prevent conflicts of interest and build public trust in the regulatory process. However, the White House reportedly views this proposal with significant skepticism, creating a major roadblock. The tension stems from the clause’s potential implications. Media reports suggest the disagreement is particularly thorny because it indirectly involves figures from the previous administration, including former President Donald Trump and his associates. This historical context adds a layer of political complexity to what is already a technically challenging legislative effort. What Are the Stakes for the Cryptocurrency Market? This isn’t just political theater. The outcome of this debate over the crypto bill carries real weight for investors and companies. Clear, fair regulation is widely seen as the missing piece needed for mainstream institutional adoption of digital assets. A strong ethics clause could signal a commitment to a transparent and stable regulatory environment. Conversely, a weakened or removed clause might raise concerns about insider advantages and regulatory capture. Market Confidence: Strong ethics rules can boost long-term investor confidence in a fairly regulated U.S. crypto market. Innovation vs. Protection: Legislators must balance fostering innovation with protecting consumers from potential abuses of power. Global Leadership: The U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions if it cannot pass coherent crypto legislation. Can This Impasse Be Resolved? Finding common ground will require compromise from both sides. Senator Lummis may need to adjust the scope or specifics of the ethics provision. Meanwhile, the White House might need to articulate clearer safeguards it would accept to achieve its policy goals. The path forward likely involves: Redrafting the clause to address specific administrative concerns. Seeking bipartisan support to increase the bill’s negotiating power. Clearly communicating how ethics rules benefit the entire ecosystem, not just target individuals. The deadlock over this crypto bill provision is a microcosm of the larger struggle to govern Web3 technologies with Web2-era political frameworks. The core question remains: can the U.S. political system craft rules that are both effective and equitable for a decentralized future? The Bottom Line for Crypto Investors While the political process grinds on, the market watches closely. Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, which is often a catalyst for growth. Therefore, any progress on the comprehensive crypto bill , ethics clause included, should be viewed as a positive long-term signal. However, investors should prepare for continued volatility as these high-level debates continue to influence market sentiment. The key takeaway is that the push for definitive U.S. cryptocurrency regulation is active, complex, and fraught with political challenges that extend far beyond technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main point of disagreement in the crypto bill? The central conflict is over an ethics clause proposed by Senator Lummis that would prevent senior government officials from trading or profiting from cryptocurrencies they regulate. The White House opposes this specific provision. Why does the White House oppose the ethics clause? While not stated explicitly in reports, the skepticism likely relates to the clause’s breadth, enforceability, and its perceived connection to officials from the previous administration, making it a politically sensitive issue. How would this crypto bill affect the average investor? A passed bill with clear rules, including strong ethics standards, could lead to a more stable and trustworthy market, potentially encouraging more institutional investment and consumer protection. Has Senator Lummis proposed crypto legislation before? Yes. Senator Lummis is a leading advocate in the Senate for comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation and has previously co-sponsored the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, aiming to create a full regulatory framework for digital assets. What happens if they can’t agree on the ethics clause? The entire bill could be delayed or fail. Alternatively, the ethics provision could be removed or heavily diluted to secure enough votes for passage, which would be a significant setback for its proponents. Is this the only cryptocurrency bill being discussed in Congress? No. Several bills addressing different aspects of crypto regulation, from stablecoins to market structure, are circulating in both the House and Senate. This bill is one of the most comprehensive efforts. Found this breakdown of the Washington crypto clash helpful? The debate over regulation affects everyone in the digital asset space.

GME's U.S. sales grew 12% y/y, outperforming key competitors and demonstrating resilience despite macro headwinds and divestiture of underperforming international segments. The collectibles division surged 50% y/y to $256.1 million, driving a favorable shift in sales mix and boosting GAAP gross margins to 33.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 7.8%, and YTD free cash flow reached $410 million, reflecting operational efficiency post-Canada exit. As we look to wrap up a very volatile 2025, I'm preparing for a downside in the stock market next year, which is encouraging me to look for more contrarian rebound investments to put in my portfolio in place of large-cap growth stocks. GameStop Corp. ( GME ) is looking increasingly appealing. Undoubtedly, GameStop's fall this year is tied to waning enthusiasm for Bitcoin (BTC-USD), into which GameStop has made a significant balance sheet/treasury investment. Yet we shouldn't let this smaller issue distract us from the real improvements in GameStop's core business as a specialty retailer, which is showing U.S. sales growth despite macro headwinds. Data by YCharts I last wrote a Buy article on GameStop in October, when the stock was trading around $23 per share. GameStop just released fresh Q3 results that showcased continued growth in the company's collectibles division, alongside substantial gains in adjusted EBITDA and operating margins amid the company's exit from unprofitable markets. I'm reiterating my Buy rating here, and think the post-earnings dip is a terrific time to buy into this stock at a modest price. Healthy sales trends and improving margins post-Canada exit Let's first address the positive signals coming from GameStop's latest earnings release . GameStop's revenue in Q3 declined -5% y/y to $821 million. GameStop Q3 results by market (GameStop Q3 earnings release) This decelerated versus 22% y/y sales growth in Q2, but we note one important factor: in May of this year, the company divested of its entire Canada segment, with an individual entrepreneur buying out all of GameStop's Canada stores and rebranding it as ""EB Games."" We note as well that alongside the Canada sale, the company in February 2025 also approved the sale of its France stores , which is driving the y/y declines in Europe. As such, the company faces a tough comp in Q3, which is its first quarter operating without the Canadian arm. And yet, we note that with the Canada segment operating at a negative -7% operating margin last quarter (its worst-performing market in terms of profitability), this sale has brought greater bottom line efficiency. Meanwhile, sales in the U.S. grew 12% y/y, which is a healthy indicator amid a more challenging macroeconomy. We note that Best Buy ( BBY ), which is one of GameStop's core rivals in gaming and electronics, reported just 2.4% U.S. comp sales growth in the same quarter (though it primarily faced headwinds from poorer-performing appliances, while entertainment sales grew double digits). Still, we find it reassuring that GameStop isn't afraid to shed off non-core, underperforming country segments and return its focus to a profitable, growing U.S. market. We note as well that the collectibles division is driving substantial growth for GameStop. Collectibles sales of $256.1 million grew 50% y/y to $256.1 million in revenue, or 31% of overall sales (inclusive of the tough prior-year comps in France and Canada). GameStop sales by product (GameStop Q3 earnings release) The shift in sales mix away from lower-margin hardware has helped GameStop boost its GAAP gross margins to 33.3% in Q3, from 29.9% in the year-ago quarter. Eliminating the burden of OPEX in Canada has also substantially helped overall profitability. As shown in the chart below, adjusted EBITDA jumped to a $64.4 million profit, or a 7.8% adjusted EBITDA margin, nine points improved from a -1.3% loss in the year-ago quarter. We note that the company's adjusted EBITDA this quarter adds back asset impairments, which represent the accounting loss from divesting the company's underperforming Canada and France segments. GameStop adjusted EBITDA (GameStop Q3 earnings release) Similarly, we note that YTD free cash flow of $410 million has returned to substantial profit, versus a -$29 million cash burn in the year-ago period: GameStop FCF (GameStop Q3 earnings release) Bitcoin losses So with these metrics—improving gross and operating margins, expanding cash flow, and double-digit U.S. sales growth despite a chillier macro environment—it's difficult to argue that GameStop's core business is thriving. That said, it's difficult to ignore the distraction that Bitcoin poses for GameStop investors, so we'll address that here. In the company's latest 10-Q filing , the company disclosed that it's holding 4,710 BTC, unchanged from the previous quarter. GameStop Bitcoin holdings (GameStop Q3 10-Q filing) The assets are marked to market each quarter, and on GameStop's latest balance sheet (shown below), these Bitcoin holdings are valued at $519.4 million, listed under its digital asset holdings. GameStop balance sheet (GameStop Q3 earnings release) This suggests that the market value for GameStop's Bitcoin holdings is around $110,270 (indeed where Bitcoin was trading at the beginning of November). Bitcoin prices have been extremely volatile over the past few weeks, and at the time of writing, BTC is hovering around $92,500. This means that there's ~$84 million of mark-to-market losses that haven't flowed through to the balance sheet yet. But in my view, focusing on these losses is a mistake. GameStop earned a roughly equivalent amount of adjusted EBITDA from operations. Moreover, Bitcoin holdings are just a small slice of GameStop's massive balance sheet, which has $8.83 billion in cash (offset against $4.16 billion in debt, which translates to $4.67 billion in net cash, or nearly ~10x the company's value of Bitcoin holdings). Valuation, risks, and key takeaways Now, we continue to remind investors that valuation is tricky for GameStop, given the moving parts on its balance sheet plus the lack of any Wall Street coverage and consensus estimates on the stock. Also, GameStop provides far less information than most companies, only issuing a press release with limited details in each quarter, without adding context via an earnings call or providing an outlook. Nevertheless, especially after the recent downside, I continue to see potential upside in the stock's multiples. At current post-earnings share prices near $22, GameStop trades at a $9.83 billion market cap. Netting off the $4.67 billion in aforementioned net cash, plus 4,710 BTC valued at current ~$92.5k market prices ($436 million in current Bitcoin value), gives us an enterprise value of $4.72 billion. Let's take Q3 - the company's first quarter excluding Canada and France - as a proxy for the company's profit potential after its reorganization and slimming down of international operations. In FY24, Q3 represented 16.3% of full-year sales (revenue grew by ~50% sequentially into Q4, the holiday quarter) across all geographies - unfortunately we can't exclude Canada or France here, since the company didn't report geo-level breakouts for each quarter last year. If similar seasonality holds throughout the next 12 months, GameStop's annual revenue would be ~$5.04 billion (down compared to $5.27 billion in FY24 and $5.93 billion in FY23, thanks to the company's elimination of markets). A 7.8% adjusted EBITDA margin against this revenue profile would imply ~$393 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. This would translate to a multiple of 12.0x EV/EBITDA. Of course, there are risks to the bull thesis here and to these projections. GameStop's sales growth right now is being held up by strong collectibles results, as well as by the recent release of the Nintendo Switch 2, which was long awaited after the initial 2017 release of the first generation of Nintendo's hit handheld console. Needless to say, trading cards are subject to fad cycles, and fervor could die down (especially as there may be a ""halo effect"" on Pokemon cards right now after the release of the new, highly anticipated Pokemon Z-A Legends title on Switch 2). Also, GameStop has had a choppy profitability history in the past, with adjusted EBITDA negative in the COVID years. We'll have to monitor closely to confirm that the company's current margin levels can be sustained. In the absence of guidance from the company or any helpful management commentary, GameStop is a bit of a wild card and a shot in the dark. That said, we like the fact that U.S. sales are growing and that balance sheet cash (plus Bitcoin holdings) represents a huge chunk of the company's outstanding market value.

Lummis made this statement while addressing the audience during the Blockchain Association Policy Summit held on Tuesday, December 9. At this time, the Senator shared that she anticipates the markup hearing for the Responsible Financial Innovation Act —the Banking Committee’s take on market structure—will occur before Congress takes a break for the holiday season. Senator Lummis hints at the finalization of the crypto market structure bill next week Following concerns raised about the delay in the bill , the senator acknowledged that it was gradually progressing, as drafts underwent several alterations every few days during talks between the two parties . For now, Lummis highlighted that her staff are worn out, referring to both Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s team and her team. Therefore, to effectively finalize a version of the bill, she suggested that it would be best to let the team work on it next week and then grant everyone a break for Christmas to recharge. “My goal is to share a draft at the end of this week that represents our best efforts so far and let the industry review it, along with Republicans and Democrats, before we go to markup next week,” the senator added. Notably, a markup hearing is a specific type of congressional event in which a congressional committee or subcommittee debates, amends, and ultimately votes on proposed legislation before it is sent to the full House or Senate for a floor vote. Although the banking committee had publicly shared the draft of the market structure bill in July this year, sources close to the situation mentioned that progress lagged following the approval of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act by the US House of Representatives. These sources attempted to explain that the delay took place due to the longest government shutdown that occurred in the United States, and some lawmakers’ opposition to specific DeFi parts of the bill. Several individuals anticipate that the crypto market structure bill will be beneficial to the market A report from a reliable source, dated Monday, December 8, indicated that bipartisan talks regarding market structure are progressing, with plans for a markup scheduled to take place in December this year. This report aligns with Lummis’s September remarks, in which she predicted that the bill would be implemented as law in 2026. However, even with this announcement, analysts raised concerns about whether the Republicans will abide by this timeline. They also highlighted that even if senators decided to move forward with a markup, issues such as political disagreements could possibly delay the bill’s voting process. To fully become a law, sources familiar with the situation mentioned that the bill still needs to go through both the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Banking Committee. Nonetheless, several individuals in the crypto industry back Congress’s move to push this legislation forward. According to them, this legislation would promote clarity and benefit the market. “More finance will shift on-chain under [SEC Chair Paul Atkins]’s leadership once Congress passes a market structure law,” stated Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal , on Wednesday, December 10. “Our leaders must agree on the final details of the bill without any delays.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-10 00:45:08

Those sorts of things would not fall, as we would define it, into the definition of a security.” Paul Atkins, a longtime advocate of lighter-touch financial regulation, has become one of the most market-friendly SEC chairs in recent years. His stance carries weight because previous SEC leadership took the opposite view, arguing that virtually all ICOs were securities. Atkins’ comments, therefore, signal a notable ideological shift at the top of the agency, one that could influence rulemaking debates across Washington and ongoing enforcement strategies. Atkins signals major shift in SEC’s crypto approach Atkins was pointing to a token taxonomy he established last month, in which he categorized the crypto industry into four general token types. Among the four categories, Atkins argued last month that three—network tokens, digital collectibles, and digital tools—should not be considered securities in and of themselves. On Tuesday, Atkins stated that ICOs involving those three token categories should likewise be treated as non‑security transactions and, as such, would fall outside SEC regulation. The only category of token the SEC chair said his agency should regulate, when it comes to ICOs, are tokenized securities—representations of securities already regulated by the SEC that trade on-chain. “ICOs transcend all four topics,” Atkins said. “Three of those areas are on the CFTC side, so we’ll let them worry about that, and we’ll focus on tokenized securities.” The development could mark a significant boon for companies seeking to raise capital by creating and selling tokens to investors and the public. Most ICOs could escape SEC oversight under new taxonomy ICOs were all the rage during the crypto boom of 2017—until the SEC, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office, poured cold water on the lucrative fundraising mechanism by suing numerous ICO issuers because they were selling illegally unregistered securities Atkins’ remarks on Tuesday imply the trend could regain popularity, with or without a crypto market structure bill . Under the SEC chair’s proposed taxonomy, the majority of crypto tokens would fall outside the agency’s regulatory scope. Instead, they would likely be overseen by the more lenient CFTC, along with numerous similarly structured ICOs, according to Atkins. Atkins’ strategy also recasts the old fight between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over jurisdiction. Because most tokens fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, an agency with a lighter enforcement footprint, the proposal may further weaken the SEC’s central role in crypto regulation. Some legal experts argue that the move reflects broader congressional efforts to empower the CFTC to lead the charge in regulating digital commodities within a regulatory environment more akin to how cryptocurrencies are being regulated in the UK and certain parts of Asia. Tokens that Atkins has indicated should not be classified as securities include those connected to decentralized blockchain networks, tokens tied to “internet memes, characters, current events, or trends,” and tokens that serve a practical purpose, such as tickets or memberships. Tokens that are associated with decentralized networks, internet culture, or practical utilities — say, tickets or memberships — could, therefore, be eligible for ICOs. Atkins noted in July that the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative could also support ICO activity through exemptions and safe harbors.

The cryptocurrency market just received a sobering signal. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has fallen to 18, dropping another point and moving further away from the critical threshold that defines an altcoin season. For investors watching market cycles, this number tells a compelling story about where capital is flowing right now. Let’s decode what this shift means for your portfolio. What is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index serves as the market’s pulse check. It currently sits at a mere 18, a clear indicator that Bitcoin is commanding the stage. This index is calculated by comparing the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) against Bitcoin itself. A reading above 75 signals an altcoin season, where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Therefore, a score of 18 is a stark contrast, highlighting strong Bitcoin dominance. Why is Bitcoin Dominating the Market? Several factors are converging to fuel Bitcoin’s strength while the Altcoin Season Index languishes. First, macroeconomic uncertainty often drives investors toward perceived safe-haven assets within crypto, with Bitcoin being the primary beneficiary. Second, major institutional products like Spot Bitcoin ETFs are funneling significant capital directly into Bitcoin, not the broader altcoin market. Finally, the market cycle theory suggests periods of Bitcoin leadership typically precede altcoin rallies, making this a phase of accumulation and patience for altcoin investors. Key Implications for Crypto Investors Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are the immediate takeaways: Risk Appetite is Low: A low index suggests a risk-off environment where capital retreats to the largest, most established asset. Timing Your Entry: For altcoin buyers, this period can be an opportunity to research and identify strong projects at relatively lower prices before a potential season shift. Portfolio Rebalancing: It may be a prudent time to review your allocation between Bitcoin and altcoins based on your risk tolerance. Historically, the index doesn’t stay at extreme lows forever. However, predicting the exact turn is challenging. The current trend emphasizes that we are firmly in a Bitcoin season. When Could the Altcoin Season Return? While the Altcoin Season Index is low, it’s not a permanent state. Market cycles rotate. A return to altcoin season typically requires a sustained period of Bitcoin stability or consolidation, allowing investor confidence and capital to trickle down into smaller-cap projects. Key triggers to watch include: Bitcoin establishing a strong, steady price floor. Increased development activity and positive news flow from major altcoin ecosystems. A general improvement in global liquidity and risk sentiment. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index weekly can provide an early, data-driven hint of this sentiment change. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Winter for Altcoins The Altcoin Season Index at 18 is a clear, quantitative message: patience is essential. Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. For the savvy investor, this isn’t a time for fear, but for strategic preparation. Use this phase to conduct thorough research, build watchlists, and plan your strategy for when the market dynamics eventually shift. Remember, the most successful investors understand cycles, not just prices. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 18 mean? An index value of 18 means only a small percentage (far less than 75%) of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, indicating strong Bitcoin dominance and a ‘Bitcoin season’. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market performance trends between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index indicates a market phase, not a verdict on every project. It’s a signal to reassess your portfolio’s risk and potentially rebalance, but panic selling is rarely a good strategy. Can the index predict future prices? No, it is a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance. It describes the current market structure but does not forecast future price movements of individual assets. What is a good Altcoin Season Index score for buying altcoins? There’s no perfect score. However, a rising trend above 50 can signal increasing altcoin strength. Some investors use a crossing above 75 as a confirmation signal for altcoin season. Where can I check the Altcoin Season Index? The index is publicly available on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market data or research sections. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

With its current pricing at $0.035 and having registered a 250% increase in its presale fueled by overwhelming public interest, this project is gaining life at a rate unprecedented for any other fresh crypto presales today. Also the project has more than 18,400 participants and more than $19.25 million has been raised so far. Perhaps more remarkable than its presale performances is the DeFi-based platform for lending and borrowing being created by this project that offers much more than anyone can wish for today. The impending testnet on Sepolia for V1 is one such important milestone towards realizing this reality for all participants. For any investment that offers so much from today and for the coming future, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto offering real utility and the best cheap crypto to buy now. Phase 6 Of MUTM Presale Approaches Sell-Out as Investor Demand Runs Hot Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently gaining substantial momentum as its presale continues to sell at Phase 6. Initially launched in Q1 2025 with a token price of $0.01 per token, the current presale stage at Phase 6 sees the token sold at $0.035 per token, a whopping rise of 250% prior to being listed on the exchange. With well over 95% of Phase 6 sold out, just a few tokens at $0.035 are left. Phase 7 kicks in with a steep rise in the token price by 20% to $0.04, nearing the estimated launch price of $0.06. So far, the presale has managed to raise over $19.25 million from more than 18,400 participants. From a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, no less than 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) has been allocated for presale alone. It is increasingly clear that Mutuum Finance is the best cheap crypto to buy now for investors seeking early-stage exposure. Enhanced Risk Management and Platform Security Mutuum Finance is integrating advanced risk management features within its protocol. The LTV ratios and liquidation levels are adjusted depending on the volatility levels of the assets; assets that are less volatile can be given higher LTV ratios than assets that are highly volatile. Reserve multipliers vary from 10% for less risky assets to 35% for highly risky assets. In relation to the above-mentioned aspects for timely and trusted pricing information, Mutuum Finance utilizes the services of the Chainlink oracle referencing token prices with highly traded coins such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback and aggregation oracle services and various in-chain feeds are utilized uniformly for obtaining real-time and accurate pricing information. These services essentially constitute the framework for the pricing and risk formulation and liquidation process for the protocol and therefore make the protocol run efficiently and be stable under varying circumstances within the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing incredible momentum for such a young project with more than 18,400 investors joining and $19.25 million raised during the presale. Phase 6 is almost sold out at $0.035 per token, while Phase 7 is set to increase the token price by 20% to $0.04 with a limited time window for entry. Scarcity, usability, and community support make MUTM the best cheap crypto to buy now and a leading DeFi crypto for investors seeking growth potential.

With ETF inflows slowing down, the price lacks the momentum to break through overhead resistance. The highly anticipated FOMC meeting is expected to provide the necessary catalyst to end the current consolidation and dictate Bitcoin’s next major directional move. BTC Compression Intensifies: Scaling Back Intraday Scalps According to a recent update from Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin continues to tighten within a compression phase. The market has been trading in an increasingly narrow range, signaling that a larger move is approaching. Snyder noted that the scalp long and short setups from his previous analysis played out well. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Shows Shocking Similarities To 2012-2015, But What Happened Last Time? He explained that as compression increases, the reward-to-risk ratio naturally declines. While the trades were profitable, they still fell into the category of “C-setups,” meaning they lacked the cleaner momentum and clarity found at range boundaries. Snyder emphasized that the best trading opportunities always emerge at the edges of a range. With the current setup, his focus remains on the key resistance area around $94,000. A breakout above that level could offer long opportunities, while a failure there may open the door for shorts. On the downside, if price sweeps the lows and returns to the $87,400 support region, long entries are likely following signs of reversal. However, he added that if Bitcoin fails to show strength during this phase, he is not eager to take new long positions. A deeper retest of the $83,200 zone could become the next area of interest, though he expects any move toward that level to come with a liquidity sweep. Snyder also mentioned that he remains in shorts as a hedge, with scalp shorts still acceptable for traders who understand the increased risk at this stage. He concluded by highlighting the importance of the upcoming FOMC meeting, noting that the market is likely to stay muted until then. Upcoming FOMC Meeting Dictates Bitcoin’s Next Major Move Analyst Ted, in a recent update, revealed that BTC is currently in a state of consolidation around the $90,000 level. This tight range-bound movement suggests that while selling pressure is not dominant, buyers are also struggling to push the price higher aggressively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Records 21% Crash In November Trading Volume – What This Means For Price Ted attributed the market’s current stagnation and its inability to break above major resistance levels to a slowdown in institutional investment. Specifically, he noted that recent ETF inflows have slowed down, removing a major source of directional buying pressure that typically drives breakouts. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted that a critical macroeconomic event is pending: the FOMC meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, and the market’s next significant directional move will be heavily dependent on the outcome.

Even more impressive, they plan to push this ratio above 99%. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a fortress-like commitment to protecting billions in digital wealth. For any crypto investor, understanding this shift is crucial for evaluating where to trust your assets. What Are Cold Wallets and Why Is Upbit’s 98% Ratio a Game-Changer? First, let’s break it down simply. A cold wallet is a method of storing cryptocurrency completely offline, disconnected from the internet. Think of it as a digital safe deposit box. In contrast, a ‘hot wallet’ is connected online for daily transactions but is more vulnerable to hackers. Upbit’s operator, Dunamu, reported that as of October’s end, over 98% of assets were in this ultra-secure, offline state. This ratio is exceptionally high, demonstrating a security-first philosophy that prioritizes asset protection over convenience. How Does Moving to 99% Cold Storage Make Upbit Safer? Upbit’s goal to reduce hot wallet assets to under 1% is a strategic masterstroke for risk management. Here’s what this ambitious target means for security: Dramatically Reduced Attack Surface: Hackers can only target what’s online. By keeping 99%+ offline, the amount of ‘stealable’ assets at any moment becomes minuscule. Enhanced User Confidence: This transparent metric acts as a powerful trust signal, showing users the exchange values security above all else. Industry Leadership: This move pressures other exchanges to follow suit, potentially raising security standards across the entire crypto landscape. Therefore, this isn’t just an internal policy update; it’s a public declaration of their security posture that benefits the entire ecosystem. What Are the Real-World Benefits for Crypto Investors? For the everyday trader or long-term holder, Upbit’s cold wallet strategy translates to tangible peace of mind. Major exchange hacks have historically resulted in catastrophic losses. By architecting their systems to hold virtually all assets in cold wallets , Upbit makes a successful large-scale breach nearly impossible. Your Bitcoin or Ethereum isn’t sitting in a server waiting to be plundered; it’s in deep freeze, accessible only through stringent, multi-layered internal controls. This operational model directly protects your investment. Could There Be Any Challenges with This Approach? While the security benefits are monumental, a near-total reliance on cold wallets introduces a different set of considerations. The primary trade-off is liquidity speed. Moving assets out of cold storage for withdrawals requires a manual or semi-manual process, which can be slower than purely automated hot wallet systems. However, for most users, a slight delay for vastly superior security is a welcome compromise. Upbit’s challenge is to streamline this process without compromising the integrity of their cold wallet vaults. Conclusion: A New Benchmark for Exchange Security Upbit’s plan to hold over 99% of assets in cold wallets is more than a technical goal; it’s a foundational shift in how crypto exchanges manage risk. It prioritizes unbreakable security over marginal convenience, setting a formidable benchmark that others will be measured against. For investors, it provides a clear, quantitative metric—the cold storage ratio—to assess an exchange’s commitment to safeguarding your funds. In the volatile world of crypto, this kind of proactive, transparent security is the ultimate asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a cold wallet in cryptocurrency? A cold wallet is a method of storing cryptocurrency private keys completely offline, making them inaccessible to online hackers. Common forms include hardware wallets (like USB devices) or paper wallets. Why is Upbit’s 98% cold wallet ratio significant? It is one of the highest publicly disclosed cold storage ratios for a major exchange. It indicates an extreme commitment to security, as it drastically limits the amount of assets vulnerable to an online attack at any given time. Does using cold wallets slow down withdrawals? It can introduce a slight processing delay, as moving assets from cold storage often requires manual security checks. However, this trade-off is widely accepted for the massive increase in fund security it provides. Are my funds completely safe if an exchange uses cold wallets? While cold storage greatly reduces the risk of a remote hack, no system is 100% foolproof. Security also depends on the exchange’s internal controls, employee practices, and insurance policies. Cold storage is a critical, best-practice layer of defense. How can I check an exchange’s cold wallet policy? Look for transparency reports or proof-of-reserves audits published by the exchange. Reputable platforms will openly communicate their storage practices and security protocols. What’s the difference between cold storage and a custodial wallet? Custodial wallet means the exchange holds your private keys for you (as Upbit does). Cold storage is the *method* (offline) they use to secure those keys. Upbit uses cold storage for its custodial wallets. Found this deep dive into crypto exchange security valuable?

In a move that has sent ripples through the crypto community, Ethena Labs has executed a colossal withdrawal of its native token. The firm pulled a jaw-dropping 1.59 billion ENA tokens, worth approximately $440 million, from Coinbase Prime. This single transaction, reported by Onchain Lens, highlights a pivotal moment for the project and raises critical questions for every investor watching the ENA token. What does this massive shift in assets mean for the market, and what signals is Ethena Labs sending? Why Did Ethena Labs Withdraw $440M in ENA? The sheer scale of this transaction demands attention. When a project like Ethena Labs withdraws such a significant portion of its token supply from a major custodian like Coinbase Prime, it’s rarely a routine event. This action typically points towards a strategic shift. The primary reasons could include preparing for a new phase of distribution, moving tokens to secure dedicated treasury wallets, or facilitating upcoming protocol integrations. Therefore, this move is a strong indicator of active, large-scale planning behind the scenes for the ENA ecosystem. Understanding the Immediate Impact on the ENA Token So, what happens when $440 million worth of tokens suddenly leave an exchange? The immediate mechanical effect is a reduction in the readily available supply of ENA on Coinbase Prime. This can influence market dynamics in a few key ways: Supply Shock Potential: A large withdrawal reduces sell-side pressure, which can, in theory, support the token’s price if demand remains steady or increases. Investor Sentiment: Such a confident move by the founding team can be interpreted as a long-term commitment, potentially boosting investor confidence in the ENA token. Market Speculation: The crypto market thrives on speculation. This event will undoubtedly lead to theories about upcoming announcements, partnerships, or staking rewards related to Ethena Labs. Decoding the Signal: What This Means for ENA Holders For current and prospective ENA holders, this isn’t just an on-chain footnote; it’s a communication. Major token movements by a core team are a form of signaling. By withdrawing this capital, Ethena Labs demonstrates operational control and a clear roadmap that requires direct access to these funds. It suggests the tokens are earmarked for specific, value-driving initiatives rather than being held in a general exchange account. Consequently, holders should watch for official communications from Ethena Labs regarding the use of these funds, as it will directly impact the token’s utility and value proposition. The Bigger Picture: Staking, Governance, and Ecosystem Growth This monumental withdrawal likely ties into the broader growth strategy for the Ethena ecosystem. The ENA token is central to several functions: Protocol Governance: Token holders can vote on key proposals shaping the project’s future. Staking Rewards: ENA can be staked to earn rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. Ecosystem Incentives: Tokens are often used to reward users, developers, and liquidity providers. Moving $440 million likely prepares Ethena Labs to aggressively fuel these areas, driving adoption and locking in value. This proactive management is a positive sign for the project’s health and ambition. Conclusion: A Strategic Pivot for Ethena Labs and ENA The withdrawal of $440 million in ENA from Coinbase Prime is far more than a large transaction. It is a strategic declaration from Ethena Labs. This move indicates preparation for significant ecosystem development, reduces immediate market liquidity, and reinforces the team’s long-term vision for the ENA token. For the astute observer, it underscores the importance of monitoring foundational actions, not just market prices, to understand a project’s trajectory. As the dust settles, all eyes will be on Ethena Labs to reveal the next chapter this capital is meant to write. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Ethena Labs withdrawing ENA mean they are selling it? A: Not necessarily. A withdrawal from an exchange custodian like Coinbase Prime typically means moving tokens to a private, controlled wallet. This is often for treasury management, staking, or ecosystem development, not an immediate sale. Q: How could this affect the price of the ENA token? A: By reducing the supply readily available on the market, it could decrease selling pressure. This often leads to bullish sentiment, but the ultimate price impact depends on broader market conditions and future announcements from Ethena Labs. Q: What is Coinbase Prime? A: Coinbase Prime is a specialized custodial and trading platform offered by Coinbase, designed for institutional investors and large-scale crypto transactions, offering enhanced security and services. Q: Should I buy ENA after this news? A: This news indicates active project development, which is a positive fundamental signal. However, investment decisions should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and understanding of the Ethena Labs project, not on a single event. Q: Where can I track transactions like this? A: On-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) allow anyone to view large wallet movements. News aggregators and crypto analytics firms often report on major transactions. Q: What is Onchain Lens? A: Onchain Lens refers to analytics platforms or observers that monitor and report significant blockchain transactions and activities, providing real-time insights into whale movements and project actions.

CEO Michael Intrator’s recent defense of so-called ‘circular deals’ reveals a company charting its own path through turbulent markets. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching this space, Coreweave’s journey from crypto-miner to AI infrastructure powerhouse offers crucial insights into how compute resources are becoming the new digital gold. Coreweave’s Rocky Road to Public Markets Coreweave’s March IPO arrived with tremendous anticipation but faced immediate headwinds. The company debuted at $40 per share amidst economic uncertainty, including impending tariffs that created what Intrator called “one of the most challenging environments.” Despite these obstacles, the CEO maintains pride in what the company accomplished, framing the IPO as successful given the circumstances. The stock’s journey since March has been anything but smooth: Peaked above $150 within eight months of trading Currently rests around $90 per share Experienced an 8% drop after recent debt announcement Faced comparisons to meme stocks due to volatility Michael Intrator’s Vision for Disruptive AI Infrastructure Coreweave’s CEO doesn’t shy away from the company’s unconventional approach. “When you introduce a new model, when you introduce a new way of doing business, when you disrupt what has been a static environment, it’s going to take some people some time,” Intrator stated during Fortune’s AI Brainstorm summit. This philosophy extends to their financial strategy, where the company borrows against its valuable collection of Nvidia GPUs to finance operations—a move that has drawn both criticism and admiration. The company’s transformation from crypto-miner to AI infrastructure provider represents one of the most significant pivots in recent tech history. Today, Coreweave provides critical GPU resources to major players including: Partner Relationship Type Microsoft Cloud Partnership OpenAI Infrastructure Provider Nvidia Supplier & Investor Meta Infrastructure Customer The Controversy Around AI Circular Deals Perhaps the most revealing moment came when Intrator addressed criticism of “circular” business deals within the AI industry. These arrangements, where a small group of powerful AI companies invest in one another, have raised questions about market concentration and long-term stability. Intrator’s response was unequivocal: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.” This defense carries particular weight given Coreweave’s relationship with Nvidia—both as a supplier of GPUs and as an investor in Coreweave. The CEO’s framing of these deals as necessary collaboration rather than problematic circularity offers a window into how AI infrastructure leaders view the current market dynamics. Coreweave’s Aggressive Expansion Strategy Despite stock market turbulence, Coreweave has pursued an ambitious acquisition and expansion strategy: March: Acquired Weights and Balances, an AI developer platform Recent: Acquired OpenPipe for AI agent deployment October: Added Marimo and Monolith to their portfolio Future: Plans to enter federal market with government cloud services The company also recently expanded its cloud partnership with OpenAI, signaling continued strength in core relationships despite external skepticism. Challenges in Cloud Computing Innovation Coreweave’s journey highlights broader challenges in cloud computing innovation. The company’s substantial debt load—and recent decision to issue more debt for data center expansion—has contributed to stock volatility. Yet Intrator sees this as part of pioneering a “new business model” for how cloud infrastructure can be built and operated. The failed acquisition of Core Scientific in October, due to shareholder skepticism, represents another setback. However, it also demonstrates Coreweave’s ambition to vertically integrate and control more of its infrastructure stack. FAQs: Understanding Coreweave’s Position What is Coreweave’s relationship with Nvidia? Coreweave relies on Nvidia GPUs for its AI infrastructure services, and Nvidia is also an investor in Coreweave. This dual relationship has drawn attention to potential conflicts in circular deals. Who is Michael Intrator? Michael Intrator is the co-founder and CEO of Coreweave. He has led the company’s transformation from crypto-mining to AI infrastructure provision. Which major tech companies use Coreweave’s services? Coreweave provides infrastructure to several tech giants including Microsoft , OpenAI , and Meta . These partnerships form the core of their business model. What happened with the Core Scientific acquisition? Coreweave’s planned acquisition of Core Scientific faltered in October due to skepticism from the target company’s shareholders about the deal terms and valuation. How has Coreweave’s stock performed since IPO? The stock debuted at $40 in March, climbed above $150, but currently trades around $90. This volatility has led some critics to compare it to meme stocks. Conclusion: A Company Defining Its Own Path Coreweave’s story is one of bold transformation and unwavering conviction. From crypto-mining origins to AI infrastructure leadership, the company has consistently defied expectations. Michael Intrator’s defense of circular deals as necessary collaboration rather than problematic entanglement reflects a company comfortable with controversy as it builds what it believes is a new paradigm for cloud computing. For observers of both cryptocurrency and AI markets, Coreweave offers a compelling case study in how compute resources are being reimagined and repurposed for the AI era. The company’s willingness to take on substantial debt, pursue aggressive acquisitions, and defend unconventional business practices suggests they’re playing a long game—one where temporary stock volatility matters less than securing position in what may become the defining infrastructure layer of the AI revolution.

This strategic play isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful signal of conviction from within the traditional finance world, aiming to funnel half a billion dollars directly into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s break down what this Strive $500 million Bitcoin purchase means for the market and for investors like you. What Is Strive Planning with Its $500 Million Raise? Strive is not a newcomer to cryptocurrency. The firm already holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, demonstrating an early belief in its value. Now, it’s doubling down. The company plans to issue Series A perpetual preferred stock to raise a staggering $500 million. A significant portion of these fresh funds is explicitly earmarked for acquiring additional BTC. This structure is crucial. By using preferred stock, Strive is appealing to investors who want exposure to Bitcoin through a regulated, traditional finance vehicle, rather than dealing with private keys and crypto exchanges themselves. It’s a bridge between Wall Street and the blockchain. Why Is This Strive Bitcoin Move So Significant? This announcement matters for several key reasons. First, it represents a massive, direct capital inflow. A $500 million Bitcoin purchase from a single institution can have a tangible impact on market liquidity and price discovery, especially when such buys are executed over time. Second, it reflects a maturing narrative. Institutions are no longer just “exploring” Bitcoin; they are actively deploying capital to accumulate it as a core strategic asset. Strive’s move follows a growing trend of public companies and funds using their balance sheets to gain exposure. Institutional Validation: A Nasdaq-listed firm making this commitment adds legitimacy and reduces perceived risk for other traditional investors. Long-Term Focus: The use of “perpetual” preferred stock suggests a long-term holding strategy, not short-term speculation. Market Confidence: This scale of investment indicates strong internal confidence in Bitcoin’s future value proposition. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Investors? For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, Strive’s $500 million Bitcoin strategy is a bullish indicator worth noting. It suggests that sophisticated asset managers see current prices as an attractive entry point for substantial, long-term allocations. This kind of demand can create a firmer price floor and reduce volatility over time. However, it’s also a reminder of the changing landscape. As large institutions like Strive become major holders, their actions will increasingly influence market cycles. Retail investors should pay attention to these flows. The Strive $500 million Bitcoin purchase is a data point in a larger story of adoption, where digital assets are being woven into the fabric of global finance. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future Strive Asset Management’s pursuit of $500 million to buy Bitcoin is more than a fundraising round; it’s a declarative statement. It signals that for forward-thinking institutions, Bitcoin has transitioned from a speculative experiment to a legitimate, strategic reserve asset. This move will likely encourage other firms to follow suit, further cementing Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios. While markets will always fluctuate, commitments of this magnitude highlight a fundamental and growing belief in the enduring value of decentralized digital scarcity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Strive Asset Management? Strive is an asset management firm listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It is known for its focus on merit-based capitalism and, increasingly, for its investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. How is Strive raising $500 million? The firm is conducting an offering of Series A perpetual preferred stock. This is a type of equity share that often pays dividends and has no maturity date, appealing to long-term investors. Will all $500 million be used to buy Bitcoin? No. The official announcement states that a “portion of the proceeds” will be used for additional BTC purchases. The exact percentage or amount has not been publicly specified. Why does this matter for the price of Bitcoin? Large, institutional purchases increase demand and can reduce the available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges. This sustained buying pressure from credible entities is generally viewed as a positive, long-term fundamental for the asset’s price. Can individual investors participate in this offering? Typically, preferred stock offerings like this are targeted at institutional and accredited investors. However, individuals can gain similar exposure by investing in Strive’s public shares or, of course, by buying Bitcoin directly. Does Strive hold other cryptocurrencies? While the firm’s public focus has been prominently on Bitcoin (BTC), its broader investment strategy regarding other digital assets is not fully detailed in this specific announcement.

This Bitcoin OG has added a staggering $50 million to an existing leveraged ETH long position , signaling powerful conviction in the second-largest cryptocurrency. Let’s dive into the on-chain data to unpack this bold strategy and its potential implications. What Does This Massive Leveraged ETH Long Position Entail? According to data from on-chain analyst Onchain-Lenz, the investor known by the address “1011short” deposited 50 million USDC into the perpetual futures exchange Hyperliquid. This fresh capital was used to expand an existing five-times leveraged bet that Ethereum’s price will rise. Therefore, for every dollar of their own capital, they control five dollars worth of ETH. The total position is now colossal, valued at approximately 80,985 ETH. Here are the key details of this high-profile trade: Entry Price: $3,108 per ETH Current Liquidation Price: $1,653 Unrealized Profit: Approximately $16.9 million This data reveals a trader who entered the market at a specific level and is currently sitting on significant paper gains. However, the liquidation price shows the fine line they are walking; a sharp drop to $1,653 would wipe out the entire position. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Make Such a Bold Ethereum Bet? This action raises a fascinating question: why would a seasoned Bitcoin holder, often called an “OG,” place such a massive, leveraged bet on Ethereum? Firstly, it demonstrates a sophisticated, multi-asset strategy. True crypto veterans often understand the value and technological narratives across different blockchains. Secondly, a leveraged ETH long position of this magnitude is a clear statement of bullish medium to long-term sentiment. The trader is not just buying ETH; they are amplifying their exposure, betting that the current price is a strong foundation for future growth. Moreover, using a decentralized perpetual futures platform like Hyperliquid highlights a preference for the transparency and self-custody features of DeFi protocols over traditional, centralized exchanges. This aligns with the core ethos of many early crypto adopters. What Are the Risks and Rewards of Leveraged Trading? While the current $16.9 million profit is impressive, this trade is a textbook example of high-risk, high-reward. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses. The trader’s leveraged ETH long position is highly sensitive to market volatility. A sudden market downturn could trigger a cascade of liquidations, potentially pushing the price toward that critical $1,653 level. Conversely, if Ethereum’s price continues to climb, the profits on this position could become astronomical. For everyday investors, this serves as a crucial lesson: Leverage is a double-edged sword. It can create wealth rapidly but can destroy it just as fast. On-chain data is powerful. Watching large wallets (“whales”) can provide insights into market sentiment. Never risk more than you can afford to lose, especially with leveraged products. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? The confidence displayed by this Bitcoin OG is a significant sentiment indicator. When large, experienced capital makes a definitive move, it often draws attention and can influence market psychology. This massive leveraged ETH long position adds to the narrative of institutional and sophisticated investor interest in Ethereum, particularly around its ongoing ecosystem development and potential regulatory clarity for spot ETFs. However, it is vital to remember that this is a single trade. While noteworthy, it should not be the sole basis for any investment decision. The market is influenced by countless factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and technological advancements. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Vote of Confidence In summary, the decision by a Bitcoin OG to pour an additional $50 million into a leveraged ETH long position is a dramatic display of conviction in Ethereum’s trajectory. It underscores the evolving strategies of crypto’s earliest investors and highlights the advanced financial instruments now available on-chain. For observers, it provides a real-time case study in risk management, market sentiment, and the potent—and perilous—mechanics of leverage. As always in crypto, only time will tell if this bold bet pays off. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “leveraged long position”? A: A leveraged long position is a trade where an investor uses borrowed funds (leverage) to amplify their buying power, betting that the price of an asset will increase. It magnifies potential profits but also significantly increases the risk of loss. Q2: Who is a “Bitcoin OG”? A: “Bitcoin OG” (Original Gangster) is a term of respect in the crypto community for individuals who have been involved with Bitcoin since its early days, often implying significant experience, insight, and sometimes holdings. Q3: What is a liquidation price? A: The liquidation price is the market price at which a leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange or protocol because the trader’s collateral can no longer cover potential losses. It is the point of total loss for the initial margin. Q4: Is following whale trades like this a good investment strategy? A: While monitoring large trades can offer valuable sentiment clues, it is not a standalone strategy. Whales have different risk profiles and capital access. Always conduct your own research and never invest based solely on the actions of others. Q5: What is Hyperliquid? A: Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual futures exchange that allows users to trade leveraged positions directly from their self-custodied wallets, offering a non-custodial alternative to centralized exchanges. Q6: What’s the difference between unrealized and realized profit? A: Unrealized profit (or “paper profit”) is the current profit on an open position that has not yet been closed. Realized profit is the actual profit captured after closing the position and settling the trade. Join the Conversation Do you think this Bitcoin OG’s massive bet on Ethereum will pay off?

Aave Labs, the core development team behind the leading decentralized lending protocol, has just put forward a governance proposal that could redefine efficiency. The plan? To launch the sophisticated Aave V3 on the nascent MegaETH network. This isn’t just another deployment; it’s a strategic bet on a future where DeFi is faster, cheaper, and more accessible than ever before. What Does Launching Aave V3 on MegaETH Actually Mean? Let’s break it down simply. Aave V3 is the most advanced version of the Aave protocol, packed with features like improved risk management, cross-chain asset portals, and gas optimization. However, operating directly on the Ethereum mainnet can be slow and expensive due to network congestion. This is where MegaETH enters the picture. MegaETH is an emerging Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. Think of it as a high-speed express lane built next to the main Ethereum highway. By proposing to launch Aave V3 on MegaETH , the team aims to migrate lending and borrowing activity to this faster, cheaper lane. Therefore, users could interact with Aave’s full suite of services while paying minimal fees and experiencing near-instant transaction confirmations. Why Is This Proposal Such a Big Deal for DeFi? The potential benefits of deploying Aave V3 on MegaETH are substantial and address key pain points in decentralized finance today. Radically Lower Costs: Transaction fees (gas) could drop significantly, making small deposits and frequent interactions economically viable. Blazing-Fast Speeds: Transactions settle in seconds, not minutes, improving the user experience for trading and leveraging positions. Enhanced Scalability: MegaETH can handle more transactions per second, allowing Aave to serve a much larger user base without performance hiccups. Innovation Catalyst: Lower fees and high speed create a fertile ground for new, complex financial products built on top of the Aave protocol. Moreover, this move signals strong confidence in the Layer 2 ecosystem. A major protocol like Aave choosing a new L2 can provide immense validation and attract a wave of liquidity and developers to the MegaETH chain. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While the vision is compelling, launching Aave V3 on MegaETH is not without its hurdles. The governance proposal will need to pass a vote by AAVE token holders, who will carefully weigh the risks. The primary concern is security and network maturity. MegaETH is a newer entrant in the competitive L2 space. Users and developers must be confident in its security model and the robustness of its technology before locking in significant value. Furthermore, the success of this deployment hinges on achieving sufficient liquidity and user adoption on the new chain. Aave’s features are powerful, but they need an active ecosystem to thrive. What’s the Future if This Proposal Passes? If the community approves the plan to launch Aave V3 on MegaETH , we could witness a fascinating domino effect. We might see a migration of liquidity from other chains or the mainnet, seeking better yields and lower costs. It could also pressure other major DeFi protocols to consider similar expansions onto high-performance Layer 2s. For the average user, the future looks convenient. Imagine seamlessly supplying assets to earn yield or taking out a flash loan for arbitrage with fees that are mere cents instead of dollars. This proposal brings that reality closer. Conclusion: A Vote for a More Efficient DeFi Future The proposal to deploy Aave V3 on MegaETH is more than a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic vision for mass adoption. By tackling the twin demons of high cost and low speed, Aave Labs is positioning its flagship protocol at the forefront of the next wave of decentralized finance. The upcoming governance vote will be a crucial referendum on this vision. A ‘yes’ could ignite a new phase of growth, making sophisticated DeFi tools accessible to everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Aave V3? A: Aave V3 is the latest and most feature-rich version of the Aave decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. It includes upgrades for efficiency, safety, and cross-chain functionality. Q2: What is MegaETH? A: MegaETH is an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. It processes transactions off the main Ethereum chain to provide faster speeds and much lower fees, while still being secured by Ethereum. Q3: Who decides if Aave V3 launches on MegaETH? A: The decision is made through decentralized governance. Holders of the AAVE token will vote on the official governance proposal submitted by Aave Labs. Q4: How will this affect current Aave users? A: Initially, it creates a new deployment option. Users on the Ethereum mainnet can continue as usual. Those who want lower fees can choose to use the new Aave V3 on MegaETH instance once it’s live. Q5: Is my money safe on a new Layer 2 like MegaETH? A: Security is paramount. The proposal will involve rigorous audits and a risk assessment. Users should always review official documentation and understand the security assumptions of any network before depositing funds. Q6: When will the vote happen? A: The timeline depends on the governance process. Typically, a proposal goes through a temperature check, followed by a formal on-chain vote lasting several days.

That world is now here. Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), recently dropped a bombshell: more than half of ICE’s institutional clients are actively exploring prediction markets . This seismic shift signals that crypto-based forecasting platforms are moving from niche curiosities to mainstream financial instruments. Why Are Major Institutions Flocking to Prediction Markets? For decades, ICE clients focused on tangible commodities like oil and cocoa. However, the landscape is transforming. Sprecher notes a significant change in client sentiment. These sophisticated investors now see prediction markets as a new frontier for data-driven insights and potential alpha generation. The appeal lies in their ability to aggregate crowd-sourced intelligence on everything from elections to economic indicators. This isn’t mere curiosity; it’s strategic positioning. Institutions recognize that these platforms offer a unique, real-time pulse on global sentiment. Therefore, they provide a complementary dataset to traditional market analysis. The move represents a fundamental expansion of what constitutes a tradable asset. What Does the $2 Billion Polymarket Bet Mean? In October, ICE made its intentions crystal clear with a monumental $2 billion investment in Polymarket, a leading crypto-based prediction market . This partnership isn’t just a financial injection; it’s a blueprint for the future. The collaboration includes plans for joint tokenization initiatives, aiming to bridge traditional finance with blockchain innovation. Legitimacy Boost: ICE’s backing provides unprecedented institutional credibility to the entire sector. Infrastructure Scale: Polymarket gains access to ICE’s vast regulatory and technological framework. Market Expansion: The deal paves the way for more regulated, accessible prediction products for retail and institutional users alike. This investment acts as a powerful catalyst. It demonstrates that major financial players are not just observing but actively building the infrastructure for decentralized forecasting. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? Despite the excitement, significant hurdles remain. Regulatory clarity is the most pressing issue. Prediction markets often operate in a legal gray area concerning gambling and securities laws. However, ICE’s involvement suggests a concerted effort to navigate these complexities and establish compliant frameworks. Moreover, the technology must prove its resilience and scalability. The promise of prediction markets hinges on security, transparency, and liquidity. Success will depend on building trust through robust, user-friendly platforms that deliver accurate, tamper-proof results. The opportunity, however, is staggering. These markets could revolutionize how we understand probability and risk. They empower individuals to hedge against real-world outcomes, from weather events to corporate earnings. For institutions, they offer a novel tool for risk management and speculative positioning. How Will This Reshape the Future of Finance? The trend is unmistakable: prediction markets are entering the institutional mainstream. When over half of a giant like ICE’s clientele expresses interest, it’s a trend, not a fad. This shift points toward a more integrated financial ecosystem where blockchain-based information markets sit alongside stocks and bonds. We are likely to see: New, regulated financial products based on event outcomes. Increased merger and acquisition activity in the crypto forecasting space. Greater convergence between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional market infrastructure. In essence, the line between “betting” and “trading” is blurring, creating a new asset class built on collective wisdom. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Decentralized Forecasting The revelation from ICE’s CEO is a watershed moment. It confirms that prediction markets have captured the imagination of the world’s most powerful financial institutions. This isn’t just about Polymarket or crypto; it’s about the digitization and democratization of foresight itself. The traditional investment playbook is being rewritten, and prediction platforms are emerging as a critical new chapter. The institutional dam has broken, and a flood of capital and innovation is poised to follow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a prediction market? A prediction market is a platform where users can trade shares based on the outcome of future events. Prices reflect the crowd’s collective probability estimate of that outcome occurring. Why is ICE’s interest in Polymarket such a big deal? ICE owns the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Its $2 billion investment signals that major, regulated traditional finance institutions now see long-term value and legitimacy in crypto-based prediction platforms. Are prediction markets legal? The legal status varies globally. They often exist in a regulatory gray area. ICE’s involvement is likely aimed at working with regulators to create clear, compliant frameworks for their operation. What can you trade on prediction markets? Markets can be created for almost any verifiable future event, including political elections, sports results, technological milestones, and economic data releases. How do prediction markets differ from sports betting? While conceptually similar, prediction markets are often framed as tools for information aggregation and hedging rather than pure gambling. The goal is to reveal the “wisdom of the crowd” for forecasting purposes. What does “tokenization initiatives” mean in the ICE-Polymarket deal? It refers to creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent real-world assets or rights. This could involve tokenizing shares in prediction market outcomes or creating new financial instruments.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is now trading at $91,999.86. This sudden move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about market direction and portfolio strategy. What does this drop signal, and how should savvy traders respond? What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market analysts point to a confluence of factors driving the sell-off. First, broader macroeconomic concerns, including potential interest rate hikes, often trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting assets like Bitcoin. Second, significant sell orders clustered around the $92,500 resistance level created a ceiling that bulls could not break. When the Bitcoin price failed to hold above $92,000, it triggered automated stop-loss orders, accelerating the downward momentum. This is a classic example of technical levels dictating short-term price action. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For long-term holders, a dip can represent a strategic entry point. However, the context is everything. Key questions to consider include: Market Sentiment: Is fear dominating trader conversations on social media and forums? On-Chain Data: Are large holders (“whales”) accumulating or distributing their coins? Support Levels: Where is the next major support? Analysts are now watching the $89,000 and $85,000 zones closely. Therefore, while a lower Bitcoin price may seem attractive, it’s vital to assess whether the fundamental investment thesis remains intact. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating volatility requires a plan, not panic. Here are immediate steps you can take: Review Your Portfolio: Reassess your asset allocation. Is your exposure to Bitcoin still aligned with your risk tolerance? Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you believe in the long-term trend, consider setting up small, regular buys to average your entry Bitcoin price . Set Clear Limits: Define your exit strategy beforehand. Decide at what price you would cut losses or take profits to remove emotion from trading. Remember, sharp corrections are a feature, not a bug, of the cryptocurrency markets. The current Bitcoin price action, while dramatic, is part of a larger cycle. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin Market structure often resets after a sharp decline. This pullback could create a healthier foundation for the next leg up by shaking out over-leveraged positions. Moreover, institutional interest, regulatory developments, and adoption metrics continue to be the primary long-term drivers, not daily price fluctuations. Keeping a focus on these fundamentals is crucial when the Bitcoin price chart turns red. In conclusion, the break below $92,000 is a significant technical event that demands attention. It underscores the inherent volatility of digital assets and the importance of disciplined risk management. While short-term sentiment is bearish, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin remains driven by its core value propositions as a decentralized store of value. Strategic investors use these moments to educate themselves, refine their strategies, and prepare for the market’s next move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $92,000? The drop was likely caused by a mix of technical selling pressure at a key resistance level, broader macroeconomic worries affecting risk assets, and the triggering of automated stop-loss orders. Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is lower? This depends on your investment strategy. Some see it as a discount, while others wait for the price to stabilize. Conduct your own research and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. What is the next major support level for Bitcoin? Traders are closely watching the $89,000 and $85,000 price zones as the next potential areas where buying interest might increase to halt the decline. How does this drop affect other cryptocurrencies (altcoins)? Bitcoin often sets the trend for the broader crypto market. A sustained drop in BTC’s price typically leads to increased selling pressure across most altcoins, as investors flee to stablecoins or cash. Is this the start of a larger bear market? One daily move does not define a trend. It’s too early to tell. Monitor whether the price reclaims key levels and watch for shifts in on-chain and derivatives market data for clearer signals. Where can I reliably track the live Bitcoin price? Use reputable aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, or data from major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase for real-time, accurate pricing information.

According to banking giant JPMorgan, it might be too early to make that call. Despite recent market turbulence, the firm maintains a surprisingly optimistic stance, suggesting a significant crypto rally could still be on the horizon. This perspective comes at a crucial time for investors navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Why Does JPMorgan Believe a Crypto Rally is Still Possible? JPMorgan analysts recently published a note arguing against declaring a full-blown crypto winter. They point to several underlying strengths within the ecosystem that suggest the current downturn may be temporary rather than structural. The bank’s analysis provides a nuanced view that contrasts with the prevailing fear in the market. Their report highlights that Bitcoin closed November down 9% from January, marking its first year-over-year decline since May 2023. However, JPMorgan attributes part of this correction to a temporary price inflation following the U.S. election, not a fundamental breakdown of crypto technology or adoption. What Key Metrics Support This Optimistic View? Instead of focusing solely on price drops, JPMorgan draws attention to positive activity within the stablecoin sector. This data offers a more complete picture of ecosystem health. Stablecoin Volume Growth: Total stablecoin trading volume has increased for 17 consecutive months, indicating sustained utility and transactional use. Ecosystem Resilience: The bank notes that the current correction does not necessarily signal a structural deterioration of the underlying crypto infrastructure. Long-Term Viability: Despite a >20% drop in total market capitalization, core blockchain activity and development continue. How Has JPMorgan’s Stance on Crypto Evolved? This optimistic report aligns with a notable shift in tone from JPMorgan’s leadership. CEO Jamie Dimon, once a vocal critic who famously called Bitcoin a “fraud,” has recently acknowledged cryptocurrencies and blockchain as key future technologies in media interviews. This evolution reflects a broader institutional recognition of digital assets’ potential. When one of the world’s largest traditional banks adjusts its perspective, it often signals changing tides in mainstream finance. Their analysis suggests that patient investors might still see a substantial crypto rally materialize as the market absorbs recent shocks. What Does This Mean for Current Market Conditions? The current environment presents a complex picture. While prices have corrected significantly from recent highs, fundamental adoption metrics tell a different story. JPMorgan’s analysis suggests we might be witnessing a healthy market consolidation rather than the beginning of a prolonged bear market. For investors, this creates a critical distinction. A price correction driven by speculative excess unwinding is different from one caused by a loss of faith in the technology itself. The bank’s data implies the former scenario is more likely, which would support the case for a future crypto rally . Conclusion: Navigating the Path Forward JPMorgan’s message is clear: don’t count crypto out just yet. While short-term volatility is undeniable, the long-term trajectory for blockchain technology and digital assets remains promising. The potential for a powerful crypto rally persists, supported by growing stablecoin adoption and continued institutional interest. The most successful investors often look beyond daily price fluctuations to underlying trends. As the market digests recent events and stabilizes, the foundations for the next growth phase are quietly being built. The coming months will reveal whether this optimistic outlook translates into the sustained upward movement that defines a true market recovery. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did JPMorgan say about a potential crypto rally? JPMorgan stated it is premature to declare a “crypto winter” and that the potential for price increases remains, citing positive metrics like 17 consecutive months of stablecoin volume growth. Why is Bitcoin down year-over-year according to their report? BTC closed November down 9% from January, marking its first year-over-year decline since May 2023. JPMorgan suggested prices were temporarily inflated post-election before correcting. Has JPMorgan’s CEO changed his view on cryptocurrency? Yes, Jamie Dimon has shifted from being a vocal critic to acknowledging cryptocurrencies and blockchain as key future technologies in recent interviews, aligning with the bank’s more nuanced analysis. What is the most positive metric JPMorgan highlighted? The consistent growth in total stablecoin trading volume for 17 straight months, which indicates sustained utility and transactional activity within the crypto ecosystem. Does JPMorgan believe the current downturn is permanent? No, the bank concluded the downturn does not necessarily indicate structural deterioration and maintains a positive outlook on the crypto ecosystem’s long-term health. What should investors take away from this analysis? Investors should consider that short-term price corrections may not reflect long-term potential, and underlying adoption metrics can provide a more complete picture of ecosystem strength.

Shari’ah Approval And Partnership Ruya said it worked with Fuze, a regulated virtual-asset infrastructure provider, to manage custody, settlement and compliance for trades. The bank framed the service as a Shari’ah-approved investment option rather than a tool for quick speculation. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin is the initial digital asset offered at launch. UAE Crypto Flows And Local Context Between July 2023 and June 2024 the UAE recorded roughly US$30 billion in virtual-asset inflows, a rise of 42% year-on-year according to figures circulated around the launch. Ruya Bank CEO: Bitcoin Is Now Shari’ah Compliant — A New Chapter for Islamic Digital Finance https://t.co/sijVZfAJne via @unlockbc @myruyabank #islamicFinance #isBitcoinHalal #Shariah_compliant #Bitcoin #adoption #BitcoinNews #UAE — Unlock Blockchain (@unlockbc) December 8, 2025 That growth has come as regulators in the UAE lay out clearer rules for virtual-asset service providers, making banks and fintechs more willing to add crypto features inside regulated apps. How The Offering Works Users who meet the bank’s terms can execute Bitcoin buys and sells inside the Ruya app. Trade execution and custody are handled by Fuze under the arrangements described. The bank says its Shari’ah board reviewed the structure to ensure compliance with Islamic finance principles, with an emphasis on transparency and clearer risk controls. Potential Impact On Muslim Investors For Muslims who have avoided crypto because of religious concerns, this gives a regulated route inside an established bank. Analysts quoted in coverage suggested the move could nudge more conservative savers toward holding some Bitcoin when they otherwise would not have. Adoption will depend on demand and on whether other Islamic banks follow Ruya’s example. What Comes Next Ruya has signaled it will consider offering other virtual assets later, depending on demand and regulatory clarity. Based on reports, the bank wants to position this service as part of longer-term wealth planning rather than short-term trading. This step marks a notable moment: a Shari’ah-compliant bank rolling Bitcoin trading into its core app with a regulated custodian. It could widen access for Muslim investors in the UAE and beyond, while also testing how Islamic finance rules and modern crypto systems can be combined in practice.

Less supply on exchanges can lower immediate selling pressure, making price swings more dependent on fresh buy orders. Price Range And Key Levels Ethereum has gained 2.5% in the last 24 hours and is trading near $3,050. According to an analyst’s chart, ETH has been moving inside a tight range between $3,050 and $3,200, with $3,100 acting as a support line. Traders say a clear break above the $3,300–$3,400 band could open the way toward $3,700 to $3,800. Failure at that resistance would likely push prices back toward $3,000, where buyers may step in again.

Gensyn, a pioneering firm in this space, has just announced a major milestone: its public AI token sale is launching on the Sonar platform. This event represents a significant opportunity for investors and crypto enthusiasts to get involved with a project at the forefront of machine learning computation. What makes this launch particularly exciting are the substantial bonuses reserved for its dedicated testnet community. What is the Gensyn AI Token Sale All About? Gensyn is conducting its public token generation event on Sonar, a platform built on the Ethereum mainnet. The company will allocate 300 million AI tokens, which equates to 3% of the total token supply. The pricing mechanism is intriguing, as it will be set within a fully diluted valuation (FDV) range of $100 million to $1 billion. This broad range reflects both the project’s ambitious potential and the current market’s valuation of AI and crypto projects. Participation is straightforward. Interested buyers can use USDC or USDT on the Ethereum network, with a minimum bid threshold set at $100. This accessibility opens the door for a wide range of participants, from retail investors to larger crypto funds. Why Should Testnet Users Pay Attention to This AI Token Sale? Gensyn is not just launching a token; it’s rewarding its early supporters. The project has emphasized that its testnet is experiencing rapid growth. To acknowledge this community, Gensyn plans to offer special incentives. These rewards are designed to thank early adopters and align their success with the network’s growth. The announced bonuses include several key benefits: Priority Allocation: Testnet participants may receive preferential access to the token sale. Purchase Multiplier: A bonus multiplier could increase the amount of tokens a user is able to acquire. GPU Workstations: Top contributors might even earn physical GPU hardware, directly supporting their future work on the network. This strategy demonstrates Gensyn’s commitment to building a strong, engaged community from the ground up. How Does This AI Token Sale Fit into the Broader Crypto Landscape? The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain is one of the most compelling narratives in technology today. Gensyn’s protocol aims to create a decentralized marketplace for machine learning compute power. By tokenizing access and contribution to this network, the AI token sale serves as the economic engine for a new model of AI development. Choosing Sonar as the launchpad is also a strategic move. Sonar provides a secure and transparent environment for token sales, which helps build trust with potential investors. This partnership underscores the professional approach Gensyn is taking towards its public offering. What Are the Key Considerations for Potential Participants? While the bonuses and project vision are attractive, participants should conduct thorough due diligence. The wide FDV range indicates significant potential volatility and uncertainty in initial pricing. Furthermore, the success of the Gensyn network depends on the adoption of its decentralized compute model. However, the project’s clear incentive structure for testnet users is a positive signal. It shows a team that values community contribution and is willing to share the project’s upside with its earliest believers. This AI token sale is more than a fundraising event; it’s a community-building exercise. In conclusion, Gensyn’s announcement marks a pivotal moment for decentralized AI. The public AI token sale on Sonar, coupled with its generous testnet rewards program, creates a unique entry point. It rewards early faith while opening the doors for new investors to support a vision for a more accessible and democratized AI infrastructure. The coming weeks will reveal market appetite for this fusion of two transformative technologies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When is the Gensyn AI token sale happening?

This colossal SOL transfer represents one of the most significant institutional movements for the Solana network this year, immediately sparking intense speculation about its implications for the market. What Does This Massive SOL Transfer Actually Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s more than just numbers on a screen. This SOL transfer from an anonymous ‘whale’ wallet to a major regulated exchange like Coinbase Institutional suggests a strategic shift in asset management. Typically, such moves indicate one of several possibilities: an institution preparing to stake the assets for yield, a fund rebalancing its portfolio, or potentially, a precursor to selling pressure. However, the destination—Coinbase’s institutional arm—often points towards long-term, compliant holding strategies rather than a quick sell-off. Why Are Whale Transactions So Important to Watch? Whale activity serves as a critical barometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. These large holders, often institutions or early investors, possess the capital to influence prices significantly. Therefore, analyzing a SOL transfer of this scale provides valuable insights. Key aspects to consider include: Market Sentiment: Movement to a custody solution can signal confidence in the asset’s long-term value. Liquidity Impact: While moved to an exchange, the coins may not immediately hit the open market. Institutional Adoption: It underscores the growing institutional interest in Solana beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Could This SOL Transfer Impact the Price of Solana? The immediate market reaction to such news is often nuanced. A direct dump of $229 million in SOL could create temporary downward pressure. However, the structured nature of this SOL transfer to an institutional custodian suggests a more measured approach. Historically, large inflows to institutional platforms have sometimes preceded periods of price consolidation or accumulation, as these entities often have longer investment horizons. The key for retail investors is to monitor trading volume and order book depth on exchanges following such announcements. What This Tells Us About Solana’s Institutional Future This transaction is a powerful testament to Solana’s maturation within the digital asset ecosystem. For a SOL transfer of nearly a quarter-billion dollars to occur seamlessly highlights the network’s scalability and the robust infrastructure now supporting it. Moreover, it reinforces a growing trend: major financial players are not just dipping their toes but are moving substantial capital into smart contract platforms like Solana. This institutional validation can drive further developer activity, application growth, and overall network security through increased stake. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers How should you process this information? First, use whale tracking services as one data point among many—not a standalone signal. Second, consider the context of the entire crypto market. Was this an isolated SOL transfer , or part of a broader trend of capital rotation? Finally, focus on fundamentals. While whale movements are flashy, the long-term value of Solana will be determined by its technology, developer community, and real-world utility, not single transactions. In conclusion, the movement of 1.66 million SOL is a landmark event that underscores the deepening integration of traditional finance with blockchain networks. It demonstrates significant capital commitment, highlights robust institutional-grade infrastructure, and serves as a reminder of the market’s dynamic and interconnected nature. While the exact motive behind the transfer remains private, its scale and destination speak volumes about the confidence large players have in the future of the Solana ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency terms? A: A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their trading activity can potentially influence the market price. Q2: Why would someone transfer SOL to Coinbase Institutional instead of regular Coinbase? A: Coinbase Institutional offers services tailored for large clients, such as hedge funds or family offices, including enhanced security, custody solutions, dedicated support, and OTC (Over-The-Counter) trading desks to minimize market impact. Q3: Does this transfer mean the whale is about to sell all their SOL? A: Not necessarily. Moving assets to an institutional custody platform is often a step for secure long-term holding, staking, or using the assets as collateral. It provides optionality but doesn’t guarantee an immediate sale. Q4: How can I track large cryptocurrency transactions like this one? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Solscan for Solana, or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which monitor major blockchains for large transactions. Q5: What is the difference between SOL and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin? A: SOL is the native token of the Solana blockchain, which is designed for high-speed and low-cost smart contracts and decentralized applications. Bitcoin is primarily a decentralized digital currency and store of value on its own slower, proof-of-work blockchain. Q6: Could this transaction be related to an ETF or other financial product? A: While speculative, large inflows to institutional custodians can sometimes be linked to the creation of financial products like private trusts or the preparation of assets for potential future ETF considerations, though no official link has been announced.

This decisive action sends a clear signal to the market and raises crucial questions for every crypto investor. If you’re holding DICE or care about exchange accountability, you need to understand the implications of this move. What Triggered the Bithumb Investment Warning for DICE? Bithumb did not make this decision lightly. The exchange’s official statement points to a fundamental breach of trust. The core issue was the project’s failure to promptly disclose information critical to its valuation. This includes details about business plans and other developments that could significantly sway the asset’s price. In the volatile world of crypto, timely and transparent communication from project teams is not a courtesy; it’s a necessity for investor protection. Furthermore, Bithumb conducted a thorough review. They examined Klaydice’s business progress and its trading activity both in South Korea and on international markets. This comprehensive audit revealed what the exchange termed “numerous shortcomings.” While Bithumb hasn’t publicly listed every specific flaw, the label itself is a powerful red flag for market participants. Why Should Every Crypto Investor Pay Attention? This Bithumb investment warning is more than just news about a single token. It represents a growing trend of proactive regulation and risk management by leading exchanges. Here’s why it matters for you: Enhanced Investor Protection: Exchanges are taking a more active role in vetting the assets they list, moving beyond mere technical integration. Market Sentiment Indicator: Actions by a top-tier exchange like Bithumb can influence broader market confidence and set a precedent for others. Due Diligence Blueprint: It highlights the exact type of project behavior—poor disclosure—that should trigger your own research alarms. What Are the Immediate Consequences for DICE? Designation as an “investment warning item” carries immediate practical effects. Typically, such a label on Korean exchanges means the token faces heightened scrutiny and potential trading restrictions. For holders of DICE, the path forward involves several key considerations. They must assess the project team’s response and its ability to rectify the cited disclosure issues. Moreover, investors should watch for similar actions from other exchanges, which could compound liquidity and price challenges. How Can You Protect Your Portfolio from Similar Risks? This event is a perfect case study for refining your investment strategy. You can shield your portfolio by applying these actionable insights: Prioritize Transparency: Favor projects with regular, detailed updates and clear roadmaps. Monitor Exchange Communications: Pay close attention to official exchange announcements and warnings. Diversify Thoughtfully: Avoid over-concentration in assets from projects with small teams or vague long-term plans. In conclusion, Bithumb’s decision to flag DICE is a significant development that underscores the maturing landscape of cryptocurrency regulation. This Bithumb investment warning serves as a crucial reminder that exchanges are increasingly acting as gatekeepers for market integrity. For the savvy investor, it reinforces the timeless principle: conduct relentless due diligence. The responsibility for protecting your capital ultimately rests on your shoulders, supported by the warning signs provided by institutions like Bithumb. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an “investment warning” designation mean on Bithumb? It means Bithumb has identified significant risks with the project, often related to disclosure failures or business shortcomings. The token may face trading restrictions, and investors are strongly advised to exercise caution. Should I sell my DICE tokens immediately? This is not financial advice. However, you should urgently review the reasons for the warning, assess the project’s response, and make an informed decision based on your risk tolerance. The warning is a serious red flag. Can a token recover from an investment warning? Yes, but it is challenging. Recovery depends on the project team decisively addressing the exchange’s concerns, improving transparency, and rebuilding market trust, which can be a lengthy process. Does this affect DICE trading on other exchanges? Not automatically, but it can influence sentiment. Other exchanges may review their own listings, and investors globally may become wary, potentially impacting price and liquidity everywhere. How often does Bithumb issue such warnings? While not an everyday occurrence, leading Korean exchanges periodically review listed assets. Warnings are issued when projects fail to meet ongoing standards for disclosure and business conduct. What is the difference between a “warning” and a “delisting”? A warning is a cautionary step that puts the project on notice. A delisting is the final action where the token is removed from the exchange entirely. A warning often precedes a potential delisting if issues are not resolved.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin edged up toward $92,000 on Wednesday while Asian stocks slipped, as traders braced for the US Federal Reserve’s final rate decision of the year and tried to gauge how hawkish the central bank will sound after an almost certain cut. Equity markets across the region tracked a soft lead from Wall Street. The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Tuesday, with JPMorgan acting as the biggest drag after the bank warned of hefty expenses in 2026, adding another layer of caution to a market already on edge about policy signals. The Fed began its two-day meeting on Tuesday, and futures markets still point to a quarter percentage point cut, even though inflation remains above the 2% target. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,479, up 2.5% Ether : $3,308, up 6.4% XRP : $2.09, up 1.2% Total crypto market cap: $3.24 trillion, up 2.8% Traders Brace For Hawkish Messaging Even As A Cut Appears Likely For crypto traders, the question is less about whether the Fed moves this week and more about what Chair Jerome Powell signals on the path ahead. In focus as the Fed gathers to consider another cut this week: -whether Powell can stitch together enough consensus to minimize dissents to the same two that opposed the 25 bps cut last time -how many policymakers issue a ""soft"" dissent via their year-end policy rate in the… — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) December 9, 2025 Some in the market see politics creeping into the calculus. Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, said an expected cut amid slightly rising inflation “may be driven more by political considerations than by sound economic reasoning.” He added that he expects Powell to try to offset the move with hawkish language, a mix he believes could weigh on risk assets. “A hawkish message could increase selling pressure on the already fragile US equity markets, which could, in turn, negatively affect BTC and the broader crypto market,” he said. Others are already tempering their year-end Bitcoin hopes. Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co founder of The Coin Bureau, said, “If Powell does indeed deliver a hawkish speech, the likelihood of a Santa rally for Bitcoin diminishes.” He noted that momentum has not been on Bitcoin’s side recently despite fresh purchases from Michael Saylor’s firm, and said the market “may well finish 2025 under $100,000.” Inflation And Labor Data Add To Confusion Over Policy Direction The macro backdrop is not offering much clarity. Fed officials have sent mixed messages, with some warning that inflation could reaccelerate and others sounding more concerned about the labour market. A Labor Department report on Tuesday showed job openings rising only marginally in October and hiring still subdued, while a separate survey from the National Federation of Independent Business pointed to plans for new hiring in the months ahead. That tension has pushed more attention onto the Fed’s dot plot, its economic projections and every line of Powell’s press conference. Swings around rate decisions have become one of the main drivers of equity volatility over the past six weeks, often overshadowing debates about an AI bubble or the impact of President Donald Trump’s trade policies on corporate earnings and risk sentiment. Slower Easing Path Threatens Liquidity Trade That Crypto Relies On Pricing in money markets shows how expectations have cooled. Traders now see around two cuts in 2026 after a likely quarter point reduction on Wednesday, a pullback from the more optimistic views that circulated only weeks earlier. For Bitcoin and other digital assets, a slower easing path can mean tighter dollar liquidity and more pressure on the “liquidity trade” that helped fuel previous rallies. Personnel questions at the Fed are also in the mix. Kevin Hassett, viewed as the frontrunner in Trump’s search to replace Powell, said at an event on Tuesday that he sees room to lower rates substantially, and even more than a single quarter point move. His comments fed speculation that the longer term policy stance could shift if the White House reshapes the central bank’s leadership in 2026.

The capital, denominated in the USDT stablecoin, comes from Payward Interactive, the powerhouse behind the Kraken exchange. This landmark KindlyMD USDT loan deal represents a significant evolution in how major players in the digital asset space access and manage capital. What Are the Key Details of the KindlyMD USDT Loan? The Block first reported this strategic financial agreement. According to the terms, the KindlyMD USDT loan carries an annual interest rate of 8% and is set to mature on December 4, 2026. This three-year financing provides KindlyMD with substantial runway and flexibility. The use of USDT, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, for such a large transaction highlights its critical role as a settlement and treasury asset within corporate crypto finance. This deal is not just about raising funds; it’s a strategic refinancing play. KindlyMD has stated the primary purpose of the capital is to repay an existing loan from Antalpha, a known partner of Tether. Therefore, this move optimizes the company’s debt structure with potentially more favorable terms from a new, highly credible lender. Why Is This Loan a Big Deal for Crypto Markets? This transaction is a powerful signal for several reasons. First, it demonstrates that established crypto-native institutions like Payward (Kraken) are actively deploying their capital to fund other major industry players. This creates a sophisticated, internal capital market within the crypto ecosystem. Institutional Validation: A publicly-traded company using a stablecoin loan for nine-figure financing legitimizes this method. Ecosystem Maturity: It shows movement beyond simple trading into complex corporate treasury management using digital assets. Credit Market Growth: The 8% interest rate points to the development of a credit yield environment in crypto. Moreover, the involvement of Kraken’s operator adds a layer of trust and credibility. It suggests that due diligence on KindlyMD’s business and collateral passed the scrutiny of one of the world’s largest and longest-running exchanges. What Challenges and Opportunities Does This Present? While groundbreaking, this KindlyMD USDT loan also brings certain considerations to light. The reliance on a specific stablecoin (USDT) ties the company’s debt obligations to the health and stability of that asset. Any significant de-pegging event or regulatory action against Tether could create unforeseen risk. However, the opportunities are substantial. For KindlyMD, this loan likely provides capital at a competitive rate compared to traditional finance, especially for a firm deeply involved in Bitcoin. It frees them from their previous obligation to Antalpha and partners them with Kraken, potentially opening doors to deeper collaboration. For the market, it sets a precedent. Other public crypto companies may now explore similar USDT loan structures for liquidity, acquisitions, or expansion, further weaving stablecoins into the fabric of corporate finance. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Finance The $210 million KindlyMD USDT loan from Kraken’s operator is more than just a headline. It is a concrete example of the maturing cryptocurrency infrastructure being used for serious, large-scale corporate finance. This deal blurs the line between traditional debt markets and the digital asset world, proving that stablecoins can facilitate efficient capital allocation between major industry institutions. It underscores a future where crypto-native capital markets operate with growing sophistication and scale. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is lending the money to KindlyMD? A1: The lender is Payward Interactive, which is the parent company and operator of the well-known Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. Q2: Why is the loan in USDT and not US dollars? A2: Using USDT, a stablecoin on blockchain networks, allows for faster, global settlement and leverages the existing crypto treasury management systems of both companies. It demonstrates the practical utility of stablecoins in institutional finance. Q3: What will KindlyMD do with the $210 million? A3: The primary stated use is to repay an existing loan the company had from Antalpha, a partner of Tether. This refinances their debt under new terms. Q4: What does an 8% annual interest rate mean in this context? A4: It means KindlyMD will pay 8% of the $210 million principal per year as interest to Payward until the loan matures in December 2026. This rate reflects the risk and terms agreed upon by both parties. Q5: Is this a sign of more institutional crypto lending? A5: Absolutely. This deal is a high-profile benchmark that will likely encourage other large crypto firms to explore similar debt financing options within the ecosystem, signaling growth in institutional crypto credit markets. Q6: Does this involve Bitcoin directly? A6: While KindlyMD is a known Bitcoin buyer, this specific loan transaction is conducted using the USDT stablecoin. However, the company’s overall business strategy and potential collateral may be tied to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Found this deep dive into the landmark KindlyMD USDT loan insightful?

CEO Brian Armstrong recently revealed a crucial shift: the Coinbase staking lawsuit , which began with actions from ten U.S. states, has now been whittled down to just five. This update arrives as the financial consequences for users in restrictive states continue to grow, highlighting the high stakes of this regulatory clash. What’s the Latest in the Coinbase Staking Lawsuit? Brian Armstrong took to social media platform X to announce the progress. He confirmed that half of the original ten states have stepped back from their legal action against the exchange’s staking program. However, the battle is far from over. The remaining five states are pressing forward, creating a fragmented legal landscape for a service that allows users to earn rewards on their crypto holdings. This situation underscores the ongoing tension between innovative crypto services and evolving state-level regulations. Why is Maryland’s Staking Ban a Major Concern? Armstrong specifically called out the situation in Maryland as a prime example of the lawsuit’s real-world impact. The state has implemented a complete ban on staking through Coinbase. This aggressive regulatory stance has had a direct and costly effect on local users. Locked Rewards : Maryland users are currently prevented from accessing approximately $8 million in earned staking rewards. Growing Damages : Armstrong emphasized that this total is not static. The amount of user funds being withheld continues to increase every day the ban remains in effect. Customer Impact : This ban directly impacts everyday investors who chose staking as a method to generate passive income from their cryptocurrency assets. How Does This Staking Lawsuit Affect the Broader Crypto Market? The ongoing Coinbase staking lawsuit is more than just a corporate legal issue; it’s a bellwether for regulatory acceptance. Staking is a fundamental process for proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum, and services like Coinbase’s have made it accessible to millions. A successful crackdown by states could set a precedent, potentially chilling innovation and limiting consumer choice. Conversely, Coinbase’s ability to defend its service could pave the way for clearer, more favorable regulations. The outcome will signal how U.S. regulators at both state and federal levels view the core mechanics of the modern crypto economy. What Are the Potential Outcomes of This Legal Fight? The path forward remains uncertain, but several scenarios are possible. The reduction from ten to five states suggests some regulators may be reconsidering their approach or seeking settlements. A final ruling in favor of Coinbase could force the remaining states to lift their bans and release user funds. However, a loss could empower other states to enact similar restrictions, creating a patchwork of laws that complicate crypto operations nationwide. This legal battle is therefore a critical test case for the future of staking services in America. In conclusion, the Coinbase staking lawsuit has entered a new, more concentrated phase. While the reduction in participating states is a positive sign for the exchange, the severe financial penalties on users in places like Maryland reveal the tangible costs of regulatory uncertainty. The industry and its customers are now watching closely, as the resolution of this case will likely influence how cryptocurrency earning services are governed for years to come. The mounting damages underscore the urgent need for regulatory clarity that protects consumers without stifling technological progress. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Coinbase staking lawsuit about? Several U.S. state securities regulators sued Coinbase, alleging its staking service should be registered as a security. Coinbase disputes this, arguing it simply provides a service for users to participate in blockchain validation. Which states are still part of the lawsuit? While the exact five states were not all named in Armstrong’s statement, Maryland is confirmed as one. The initial suit included states like California, New Jersey, and Alabama. Can Maryland users get their staking rewards back? Currently, no. The $8 million in rewards is locked and cannot be paid out due to the state’s enforcement action and ban on the service. What happens if Coinbase wins the lawsuit? A victory would likely allow Coinbase to resume staking services in all states, release held user rewards, and set a precedent limiting states’ ability to regulate staking as a security. Is my staking on Coinbase safe in other states? For users in the 45 states not involved in the lawsuit, the service continues to operate normally. However, the ongoing case creates general regulatory uncertainty. What is cryptocurrency staking? Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network. In return, participants earn additional tokens as rewards.

Macro commentator plur daddy (@plur_daddy) describes it bluntly via X: “The Trump Fed takeover being underpriced is my primary theme going into 2026 (hence my gold bet). This is a momentous shift: the bigger and more convex the catalyst, the more difficult it is for markets to price it in properly.” Former Fed trader Joseph Wang known as “Fed Guy” echoes the concern from inside the plumbing, warning: “The market underestimates the likelihood of a Trump Fed. The Administration is showing resourcefulness and determination for lower rates. That could set off the blow off top in equities, where implied vol shows speculation still has room to run.” The Trump Fed Takeover Isn’t Price In That determination is colliding with a bond market that appears to be pushing back via term premium. Plur highlights the spread between the 12-month T-bill and the 10-year Treasury as a clean gauge of that tension. He notes that the spread “peaked right before inauguration on the generic ‘Trump will run it hot’ viewpoint,” then “got crushed lower as DOGE and Tariffs got priced in.” It bottomed near the tariff lows and “is now back to the highs,” a pattern he reads as term-premium expansion as “a form of protest to [Kevin] Hassett,” Trump’s presumed Fed pick. Related Reading: Italy’s Market Watchdog Gives Crypto Firms A Clear Order: Act Or Exit Against that backdrop, the administration still has powerful tools to compress term premium without formally announcing quantitative easing. Plur identifies three levers. First, de-regulating banks so they are allowed – in practice, pressured – to hold more Treasuries, boosting structural demand for government paper. Second, reducing the Treasury’s weighted-average maturity by shifting issuance “to bills over longer dated notes,” which cuts the duration the market has to absorb. Third, specifically for mortgages, “lever up the GSEs to buy MBS,” narrowing mortgage spreads and transmitting easier policy to the housing market even if the policy rate moves more slowly. He argues that “all of these are quite bullish for risk overall but will take time to play out.” For now, the environment remains awkward for directional risk bets, including crypto. “In the meantime, it has been a choppy and difficult market, across the board. Equity indices have grinded higher but the underlying rotations have been tricky to navigate. QT ended but liquidity is still relatively thin, and the fact that we are going into year end does not help. Better times will come.” The bullish pivot in his framework arrives with the calendar. “In the new year, fiscal accommodation will re-expand on the implementation of OBBBA (+$10–15bn/mo). Meanwhile we have sell-side macro teams calling for $20–45bn/mo in T-bill repurchasing by the Fed, as soon as Jan 1.” Related Reading: 75% Chance Crypto Is ‘Crossing The Chasm’ Now, Says Moonrock Capital Boss This mix would directly ease pressures visible in funding markets: “This would go a long way towards easing the current liquidity issues (see the SOFR–IORB spread chart below). This is not classic QE in that there is very little duration being absorbed from the private sector, and mainly has the effect of expanding bank reserves. This is still bullish because bank reserves are tight at the time, which is tied to the repo liquidity issues.” Will The Crypto Market Rise Again? On that basis, Plur expects the macro backdrop in 2026 to look “better than H2 ’25 has been, perhaps more on par with parts of 2024.” His expression of the trade is clear: “This should be enough for strong performance on gold given the Fed takeover angle, and continued melt-up in equities and select commodities.” For Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, however, his stance is notably more cautious. “For BTC it is more difficult to say. My base case continues to be a frustrating period of chop and re-accumulation.” Improved liquidity “should be favorable for BTC,” but he questions whether there will be “a material shift in the supply/demand imbalances we have been seeing,” concluding: “I will keep watching it for now.” In other words, the Trump Fed trade is already driving high-convexity bets in gold, equities and commodities. Crypto stands to benefit indirectly from easier reserves and lower term premium, but in this framework, the key constraint is no longer just macro liquidity – it is whether fresh demand is strong enough to meet an increasingly inelastic supply in the crypto market. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.05 trillion.

55579754,642523,1765335656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55579754.jpeg,Bitcoin OG Doubles Down On Ethereum With A Massive $209.8M Long – Find Out His Liquidation Price,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-og-doubles-down-ethereum-with-massive-long/,"Ethereum is holding above the $3,000 level for the fourth consecutive day as the market enters a decisive week dominated by the upcoming FOMC meeting. Traders are cautiously positioning ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement, aware that liquidity signals and rate expectations could determine whether this recovery continues—or breaks down. Despite the recent stabilization, fear remains firmly in control. Many analysts warn that if ETH loses the $3K floor, the market could face a deeper retracement, especially with volatility expected to spike around the macro event. Amid this uncertainty, on-chain data from Lookonchain has revealed a striking development: BitcoinOG, the same whale who famously shorted the market during the violent October 10 crash , has now dramatically increased his bullish exposure to Ethereum. According to the data, he has ramped up his long position to 67,103.68 ETH, valued at approximately $209.8 million. Whale Positioning Adds a New Layer of Volatility According to Lookonchain, the BitcoinOG whale is now sitting on more than $4 million in unrealized profit from his massive Ethereum long. His position of 67,103.68 ETH, currently valued at over $209 million, comes with a liquidation price of $2,069.49, a level far below current market conditions but still within the realm of possibility if macro pressure intensifies. This liquidation threshold is especially important because it reveals the whale’s risk appetite and how aggressively he’s leveraging this bet. A liquidation level near $2,070 implies confidence that Ethereum won’t revisit its deeper range lows, even as the market remains fragile ahead of the FOMC meeting. It also shows he has a significant margin buffer behind the trade, suggesting strategic positioning rather than impulsive speculation. However, large leveraged positions can act as double-edged swords for the broader market. If price begins trending toward his liquidation zone, cascading liquidations across other longs could accelerate downside momentum. Conversely, whales with deep pockets often defend key levels to protect their positions. ETH Higher-Timeframe Trend Remains Fragile Ethereum’s weekly chart shows the market fighting to stabilize above the $3,000–$3,150 zone, a level that now acts as the primary support band after weeks of heavy selling. The recent bounce from the mid-$2,700s has created a short-term relief structure, but ETH still trades well below its 50-week moving average, which is beginning to curl downward—a signal that the broader trend is losing momentum. The chart highlights a clear pattern: each rebound over the past six months has produced lower highs, reflecting persistent seller dominance whenever ETH approaches the $3,500–$3,800 region. This repeated rejection zone marks a key resistance cluster that bulls must reclaim to shift the medium-term outlook back toward bullish continuation. Volume also remains relatively muted compared to earlier stages of the cycle, suggesting that current buying interest is hesitant. Without a surge in spot demand, rallies may continue to fade quickly. On the positive side, ETH has reclaimed the 200-week moving average, an important long-term support that historically acts as a pivot between macro bull and bear phases. As long as this level holds, Ethereum retains structural strength. ETH is in a neutral-to-bearish consolidation, and a decisive weekly close above $3,300 is needed to confirm regained momentum.

This is no longer a futuristic fantasy. French fintech innovator Lyzi has partnered with Lamborghini to integrate crypto payments at their official centers, marking a seismic shift in how luxury assets are acquired. What Does This New Crypto Payments Partnership Mean? According to a report by Bitcoin.com, Lyzi’s platform will facilitate transactions for Lamborghini’s elite clientele. This service isn’t limited to just Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it supports a staggering array of over 80 digital currencies, including major players like BTC, Tezos (XTZ), and various stablecoins. This move directly answers a growing demand from high-net-worth individuals who hold significant wealth in digital assets. Why Are Luxury Brands Embracing Crypto Payments? The collaboration between Lyzi and Lamborghini is a strategic masterstroke. For Lamborghini, it taps into a new, tech-savvy, and liquid customer base. For the crypto ecosystem, it provides a powerful use case that moves beyond speculation into tangible, high-value commerce. This partnership signals that crypto payments are maturing into a legitimate and preferred transaction method for substantial purchases. The benefits are clear for both sides: For Buyers: Utilize existing crypto portfolios without converting to fiat, potentially simplifying the process and offering portfolio management flexibility. For Lamborghini: Attract a global clientele, reduce certain transaction fees associated with traditional finance, and position the brand at the cutting edge of technology. For Crypto Adoption: Provides a prestigious, real-world validation that boosts mainstream confidence in digital currencies. How Do These Crypto Payments Actually Work? While specific technical details are proprietary, the process likely involves Lyzi acting as a secure payment gateway. A customer selects their vehicle, agrees on a price, and initiates a crypto payment . Lyzi’s system would then handle the conversion, either instantly settling in fiat for the dealer or managing the crypto settlement, ensuring a smooth experience akin to using a credit card. This infrastructure is crucial for handling volatility, especially with non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies. What Challenges Remain for Widespread Crypto Adoption? Despite this exciting news, hurdles persist. Regulatory clarity varies dramatically by country, affecting which centers can offer the service. Price volatility remains a concern for accounting and valuation at the moment of sale, though stablecoins mitigate this. Furthermore, the environmental narrative around some cryptocurrencies is a consideration for brands conscious of their ESG footprint. However, this move by a marquee name like Lamborghini actively works to overcome these very challenges by normalizing high-stakes crypto transactions. The Future of Commerce with Crypto Payments The Lyzi and Lamborghini deal is more than a niche novelty; it’s a harbinger. It demonstrates that crypto payments are scalable and secure enough for the most exclusive markets. This will likely create a domino effect, encouraging other luxury sectors—real estate, art, jewelry—to follow suit. The integration of digital assets into everyday high-value commerce is accelerating faster than many anticipated. In conclusion, the alliance between Lyzi and Lamborghini is a landmark moment. It successfully bridges the world of cutting-edge digital finance with the pinnacle of automotive luxury. This partnership doesn’t just sell cars; it sells a vision of the future where crypto payments are a standard, powerful tool for financial freedom and acquisition. It’s a bold statement that digital currency is here, it’s valuable, and it’s ready for the real world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which cryptocurrencies can I use to buy a Lamborghini? A: Lyzi’s platform supports over 80 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Tezos (XTZ), Ethereum (ETH), and multiple stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Q: Will this service be available at all Lamborghini dealerships worldwide? A: Initial rollout may be selective. Availability will depend on local regulations and the integration process at individual Lamborghini centers. Q: How does Lamborghini handle the price volatility of cryptocurrencies during the sale? A> Lyzi’s payment system is designed to manage this, likely using real-time conversion or stablecoins to lock in the fiat value at the point of transaction, protecting both the buyer and the dealership. Q: Is this just a marketing stunt, or a serious payment option? A> This is a serious fintech integration by Lyzi, a established payment provider. It represents a strategic business decision to access new capital and cater to evolving customer payment preferences. Q: What does this mean for the average crypto investor? A> It’s a significant step for mainstream adoption. It enhances the perceived utility and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies, demonstrating their use beyond trading and into acquiring major real-world assets.

The bank noted that decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols have become the primary focus for regulatory scrutiny. Tokenization involves issuing digital representations of real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity on a blockchain. According to HSBC, tokenization, which was once an experimental idea, has become a serious consideration for both TradFi and DeFi firms that aim to operate regulated on-chain trading venues. Citadel Securities says many DeFi protocols meet exchange standards HSBC revealed on Monday that the recent meeting of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Investor Advisory Committee showed divisions on how a potential market for tokenized U.S. equities should be regulated. According to the bank, several TradFi representatives at the meeting argued that the commission should apply the existing exchange obligations to decentralized trading protocols. In contrast, some crypto executives called for frameworks that specifically target DeFi infrastructure. Citadel Securities, a market-making giant, recently submitted a 13-page letter to the SEC, arguing that many DeFi trading protocols meet the statutory definition of an exchange and should therefore be regulated as such . According to Citadel, granting broad exemptions to DeFi platforms may enable regulatory arbitrage and create a parallel market for tokenized stocks that lacks the investor protections present in TradFi. Scott Bauguess, Vice President for Global Regulatory Policy at Coinbase, told the committee that decentralized exchange models function differently from centralized exchanges and should not be treated as traditional exchanges. According to Bauguess, the new market structures require modernized rules that reflect decentralization, open-source infrastructure, and automated liquidity systems. SEC Chair Paul Atkins reiterated that tokenization is part of the agency’s broader effort to modernize the U.S. capital markets. Atkins emphasized that any pathway must consider regulatory compliance. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, on the other hand, raised concerns over the risks associated with tokenized equities, including market integrity, custody, and investor protections. HSBC plans to expand its Tokenized Deposit Service to the U.S. and the UAE HSBC has added its tokenized portfolio across several markets and recently launched its Tokenized Deposit Service, a blockchain-based system that enables corporate clients to move funds across borders quickly. The service is already live in the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. The bank plans to extend the service to the U.S. and UAE during the first half of 2026. Daragh Maher and Nishu Singla, HSBC’s analysts, revealed that while the regulators have shown openness to innovation, the SEC is unlikely to allow a domestic on-chain equities market to operate under lighter standards than the traditional exchanges. According to HSBC’s analysts, the SEC may consider a controlled-environment model that allows for limited experimentation under predefined rules to test tokenized equities and determine if they can operate within the U.S. regulatory landscape. According to HSBC analysts, regulatory pressure across the U.S. may ultimately force tokenized equities systems to be built on fully permissioned and regulated blockchains. They noted that such environments would allow regulators to maintain oversight of identifiable teams and U.S.-facing market activities without putting investors at unregulated protocol risks. The SEC is expected to issue its decision in the coming months, which may define how and whether on-chain markets for U.S. stocks will develop within the country’s existing securities framework. HSBC noted that despite the differences, the most consistent theme across TradFi leaders, DeFi advocates, and U.S. regulators is that tokenization is expected to grow significantly from its current base.

The past 24 hours delivered a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in digital asset trading. A staggering wave of crypto futures liquidations swept across major exchanges, wiping out over $321 million in leveraged positions. This event highlights the critical risks and rapid shifts that define the futures market. Let’s break down what happened and, more importantly, what it means for your trading strategy. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidations Tell Us? The data paints a clear and dramatic picture. In the last day, traders faced massive liquidations, primarily from bets that went the wrong way. Here is the breakdown for the top assets: Bitcoin (BTC): $170 million liquidated, with a whopping 79.85% of those being short positions. Ethereum (ETH): $136 million liquidated, where 76.8% were also shorts. Solana (SOL): $15.63 million liquidated, with 60.8% shorts. This pattern is crucial. The dominance of short liquidations suggests a strong, unexpected price surge caught many traders off guard. When prices rise rapidly, traders who borrowed assets to sell (shorting) are forced to buy back at higher prices to close their positions, often triggering a cascade of automatic crypto futures liquidations . Why Should Every Trader Understand Liquidations? Liquidation events are not just numbers on a screen; they are market-moving forces. A high volume of crypto futures liquidations can accelerate price movements. Forced buying from liquidated shorts can fuel a rally further, creating a feedback loop known as a ‘short squeeze.’ This mechanism is a core part of futures market dynamics and can lead to explosive volatility. Therefore, monitoring liquidation levels is a vital tool for risk assessment. It helps gauge market sentiment, identify potential leverage bubbles, and anticipate periods of heightened instability. Savvy traders use this data to adjust their position sizes and set more conservative stop-losses. How Can You Navigate This Volatile Landscape? Witnessing such significant crypto futures liquidations can be intimidating. However, you can use this knowledge to trade more wisely. First, always use proper risk management. Never over-leverage your account, as this is the primary cause of liquidation. A good rule is to use only a small percentage of your capital for any single leveraged trade. Second, stay informed. Tools that track estimated liquidation prices across exchanges can help you see where clusters of positions might be at risk. Finally, consider the emotional discipline required. The fear of missing out (FOMO) or the desire to revenge-trade after a loss can lead to the very mistakes that end in liquidation. The Bottom Line on Major Market Moves The recent crypto futures liquidations serve as a stark, real-time lesson in market mechanics. They underscore that while leverage can amplify gains, it dramatically increases the risk of a total loss. The data clearly shows that the market punished overly confident short sellers during this particular move. For the broader ecosystem, such events test the resilience of trading platforms and the maturity of market participants. In conclusion, these events are inevitable in a leveraged market. Your goal should not be to avoid volatility but to understand and respect it. By prioritizing capital preservation, continuously educating yourself, and maintaining emotional control, you can navigate these turbulent waves instead of being swept away by them. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto futures liquidations? A liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange because they no longer have enough funds (margin) to keep it open. This happens when the market moves against their bet. Why were most of the recent liquidations short positions? The data shows a majority were shorts because the price of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum rose sharply. Traders who bet on prices falling (shorting) faced losses and were liquidated when they couldn’t meet margin calls. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use low leverage, fund your account with ample margin (collateral), and always use stop-loss orders to automatically exit a trade before it reaches your liquidation price. Do liquidations cause prices to go up or down? They can do both. Mass short liquidations involve forced buying, which can push prices up (a short squeeze). Mass long liquidations involve forced selling, which can push prices down. Where can I track liquidation data in real-time? Several cryptocurrency data websites and analytics platforms provide real-time and historical liquidation data across multiple exchanges. Is trading futures riskier than spot trading? Yes, significantly. Futures involve leverage, which magnifies both profits and losses, making the risk of liquidation a primary concern that does not exist in simple spot buying and holding.

The platform will delist eight specific spot trading pairs from its marketplace. This move directly impacts portfolios holding CHR, ENJ, HAEDAL, LISTA, POWR, PROVE, UMA, or ZRX against major pairs like BTC, BNB, or FDUSD. If you’re active in these markets, understanding the implications is not just helpful—it’s essential for protecting your assets. Which Spot Trading Pairs Is Binance Delisting? Binance has set a firm date for the removal. The delisting will take effect at 03:00 UTC on December 12. The specific spot trading pairs being removed are: CHR/BTC ENJ/BTC HAEDAL/FDUSD LISTA/BNB POWR/BTC PROVE/BNB UMA/BTC ZRX/BTC It is crucial to note that this action only affects these specific trading pairs. The underlying tokens themselves (like CHR or ENJ) may still be available for trading against other currencies, such as USDT or on other exchanges. However, the removal of a BTC or BNB pairing is often a significant liquidity event. Why Would Binance Delist Trading Pairs? Exchanges like Binance regularly review all listed markets. The decision to delist spot trading pairs is not taken lightly. Typically, it follows a periodic review based on several critical factors. These include poor liquidity, low trading volume, or concerns about a project’s development activity and commitment. By removing underperforming pairs, Binance aims to maintain a healthy, efficient marketplace for its users and protect them from highly illiquid or volatile markets. For traders, this is a reminder of the importance of due diligence. Investing in tokens with strong fundamentals, active development, and healthy exchange volume can help mitigate the risk of sudden delistings. What Should You Do If You Hold These Assets? First, don’t panic. A pair delisting does not mean your tokens vanish. However, you must take proactive steps before the deadline. Here is your actionable checklist: Check Your Holdings: Immediately review your Binance spot wallet for any of the affected tokens in the delisted pairs. Sell or Convert: Before December 12, you can sell these tokens for another cryptocurrency that you wish to hold. Alternatively, you can convert them into a different, stable trading pair that remains active. Consider Withdrawal: If you believe in the long-term potential of the token, you can withdraw it to a private, self-custody wallet. From there, you could hold it or trade it on another supporting exchange. Do Not Leave Orders Open: Cancel any open orders (like limit buys or sells) for these pairs, as they will be automatically removed by Binance at the time of delisting. How Does This Affect the Broader Crypto Market? While a single exchange delisting eight pairs is a routine market hygiene event, it sends a signal. It highlights the importance of liquidity and project vitality in the volatile crypto space. For the projects involved, losing a major trading pair on the world’s largest exchange can impact price and accessibility in the short term. Therefore, it often prompts community discussion and can lead to increased development transparency from the project teams. For the ecosystem, such periodic reviews by major exchanges help maintain overall market integrity. They encourage projects to stay compliant, innovative, and engaged with their communities to retain their listing status. Final Summary: Stay Informed and Proactive In summary, Binance’s decision to delist these eight spot trading pairs is a standard operational procedure focused on market quality. The immediate impact is confined to traders actively using those specific markets on Binance. The key takeaway is to always stay informed about exchange announcements and manage your portfolio actively. By understanding the reasons behind such moves and knowing your options, you can navigate these events smoothly and keep your trading strategy on track. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does delisting a trading pair mean the token is being removed completely? A: Not necessarily. Binance is only removing specific pairings (like CHR/BTC). The CHR token may still be tradable as CHR/USDT or on other exchanges. Always check the token’s other available markets. Q2: What happens if I don’t do anything before the delisting date? A: After delisting, you will no longer be able to trade that specific pair on Binance. Your tokens will remain in your spot wallet, but you will need to trade them via a different active pair or withdraw them to trade elsewhere. Q3: Will this delisting cause the token price to crash? A: It can create selling pressure as traders exit the delisted pair, potentially impacting the price. However, the long-term price depends more on the project’s fundamentals and its liquidity on other platforms. Q4: Can a delisted trading pair be relisted in the future? A: Yes, if the token project addresses the issues that led to the delisting (e.g., improves liquidity or development activity), Binance could potentially relist the pair after a future review. Q5: Are other exchanges likely to follow Binance and delist these pairs? A> While other exchanges make independent decisions, a delisting by a major player like Binance often prompts other platforms to review the token, though it doesn’t guarantee they will delist it.

First, it could indicate preparation for a large sell order, which can create downward pressure on the asset’s price. Alternatively, it might be part of a strategic portfolio rebalancing or a move to utilize exchange-based services like staking or lending. The anonymity of the sender adds a layer of intrigue, making it essential to analyze the context. Therefore, while alarming on the surface, this ADA transfer to Binance requires a measured look at market conditions. Could This Impact Cardano’s Market Price? The immediate concern for any ADA holder is price action. A potential sell-off of this magnitude could lead to increased selling pressure. However, the actual market impact depends on several factors: Order Execution: Will the whale sell all 750 million ADA at once, or drip-feed it into the market? Market Depth: Does Binance’s order book have enough buy-side liquidity to absorb such a sale without a major price dip? Market Sentiment: Are broader crypto market trends bullish or bearish, which can amplify or dampen the effect? Historically, not all large exchange deposits result in immediate price drops. Sometimes, they precede major institutional moves or are simply routine for large-scale traders. How to Interpret Whale Alerts Like a Pro Seeing a giant ADA transfer to Binance on Whale Alert can trigger a fear response. However, savvy market participants use these alerts as one data point among many. Here is a simple framework for analysis: Context is King: Check Cardano’s recent price trend and news. Was the price rising sharply before the transfer? Exchange Flow: Monitor if other large wallets are moving funds to or from exchanges. A single transaction is less significant than a trend. On-Chain Metrics: Look at other indicators like active addresses, staking activity, and network growth for a holistic view. This approach helps separate signal from noise, preventing reactionary decisions based on a single event. What’s Next for ADA After This Major Movement? The long-term trajectory of Cardano is tied to its fundamentals—network upgrades, developer activity, and adoption—not a single transaction. While this ADA transfer to Binance is noteworthy for its size, it is a momentary event in the lifecycle of a blockchain. Investors should focus on the project’s roadmap, including developments in smart contracts and decentralized applications. Moreover, the very ability to track such a transaction transparently highlights the strength and security of the Cardano blockchain itself. In conclusion, the transfer of 750 million ADA to Binance is a powerful reminder of the market’s scale and the influence of major holders. It underscores the importance of vigilance and sophisticated analysis in cryptocurrency investing. Rather than panic, use this event as a catalyst to review your investment thesis, risk management strategies, and understanding of on-chain data. The crypto market thrives on volatility, and informed participants are best positioned to navigate its waves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is a transfer to an exchange like Binance considered bearish? A: Transfers to exchanges are often the first step to converting crypto to fiat currency or other assets, suggesting a potential sale. However, it is not always the case, as whales also use exchanges for custody, staking, or trading between pairs. Q2: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Cardanoscan or services like Whale Alert on social media platforms. These tools track large transactions in real-time across multiple blockchains. Q3: Could this ADA transfer be related to institutional investing? A> It is possible. Large transfers can sometimes indicate activity from investment funds, staking pools reallocating assets, or over-the-counter (OTC) desk movements, which may not directly impact the public order book. Q4: What is the “unknown wallet” mentioned in the alert? A: An “unknown wallet” typically refers to a private, non-custodial wallet address not explicitly linked to a known entity like an exchange, foundation, or public company. It emphasizes the transaction’s anonymity. Q5: Should I sell my ADA because of this news? A> Making investment decisions based solely on a single transaction is not advisable. Consider your long-term goals, portfolio diversification, and conduct thorough research on Cardano’s fundamentals before taking action. Q6: Has a transfer this large happened before with ADA? A> Yes, the Cardano network has seen several large transfers throughout its history. Whale activity is a common feature in mature cryptocurrency markets and reflects the presence of large-scale investors. Found this analysis of the major ADA transfer to Binance helpful?

A colossal sum of 227,070,031 USDT, valued at approximately $227 million, was just transferred from the major exchange OKX to an unknown wallet. This single USDT transfer represents one of the largest movements of stablecoin capital seen recently, immediately triggering questions about its purpose and potential impact on the market. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s rarely a simple retail move. The sheer size points directly to the activity of a ‘whale’—an entity or individual holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency. The destination being an ‘unknown wallet’ is particularly intriguing. This typically means a private, non-custodial wallet not directly linked to a major exchange’s known addresses. Therefore, this USDT transfer likely signifies capital moving off-exchange into cold storage or being prepared for a different use case entirely. Why Are Crypto Whales Moving Funds Off Exchanges? Large holders often move assets for strategic reasons. Moving such a significant amount of USDT off an exchange like OKX could signal several intentions. Let’s break down the most common motivations behind these major moves: Security and Custody: Whales may move funds to private, hardware-based wallets for enhanced security, reducing counterparty risk. Preparing for a Major Trade: This capital could be positioned to swiftly purchase another cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) on a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a different trading platform. Institutional Treasury Management: A company or fund might be rebalancing its digital asset holdings between different wallets or entities. Earning Yield: The funds could be moved to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to earn interest or yield on the stablecoin. Each scenario carries different implications for market liquidity and sentiment. For instance, if the goal is to buy Bitcoin, it could be a bullish signal. If it’s simply for custody, the market impact might be neutral. How Does a USDT Transfer of This Size Affect Market Stability? Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are the lifeblood of the crypto trading ecosystem, acting as the primary dollar-pegged settlement layer. A movement of over $227 million represents a significant shift in available liquidity. When USDT leaves a major exchange, it can temporarily reduce the buying power available on that platform. However, it’s crucial to remember this is a transfer within the crypto ecosystem, not a withdrawal to traditional banks. The capital remains in the digital asset space, poised for its next move. This specific USDT transfer highlights the opaque yet powerful forces that shape cryptocurrency markets. While transactions are transparent on the blockchain, the identities and intentions behind the wallet addresses often remain a mystery, fueling speculation and analysis. Key Takeaways from the $227 Million Transaction For everyday investors and traders, monitoring whale activity provides valuable context, but it shouldn’t dictate strategy alone. Here are the actionable insights from this event: Watch for Follow-On Activity: The most telling sign will be what happens to this USDT next. Tracking the destination wallet for subsequent transactions is key. Assess Exchange Flows: Large outflows from exchanges can sometimes precede volatility, as they may indicate accumulation or preparation for large trades. Understand the Limits of Data: Blockchain analytics give us the ‘what’ and ‘where,’ but rarely the definitive ‘why.’ Avoid jumping to conclusions based on a single data point. Conclusion: Deciphering the Signals in a Sea of Data The movement of 227 million USDT is a powerful reminder of the scale at which major players operate in the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate reason for this USDT transfer is unknown, it underscores the importance of on-chain analytics and liquidity tracking. For a market built on transparency, the biggest moves often come from the most opaque actors. Therefore, savvy participants use this data not for fear, but for a clearer understanding of the underlying capital flows that drive price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an “unknown wallet” in cryptocurrency? An “unknown wallet” is a blockchain address not publicly associated with a known entity like a major cryptocurrency exchange, custodian, or company. It is typically a private, user-controlled wallet. Why is a USDT transfer to an unknown wallet significant? It is significant because it represents a large amount of capital moving away from the immediate trading liquidity of an exchange. This can signal a whale’s intent to hold long-term, trade elsewhere, or use the funds in decentralized finance (DeFi). Can the owner of the unknown wallet be identified? Blockchain addresses are pseudonymous. While the transaction history is public, identifying the real-world person or entity behind a private wallet is extremely difficult without other off-chain information. Does a large USDT transfer like this affect the price of USDT itself? Typically, no. USDT is a stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. Large transfers don’t directly affect its price, which is managed by Tether’s reserves and arbitrage mechanisms. However, it can affect liquidity on specific exchanges. What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking and analytics service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions (typically over $100,000) and reports them publicly via social media and its website. Should I be worried about such a large transaction? Not necessarily. Large transactions are a regular part of the cryptocurrency market. They reflect the normal movement of capital by institutions and large holders. It’s a data point for context, not a direct cause for alarm. Found this analysis of the major USDT transfer helpful?

A colossal 227,070,031 USDT, valued at approximately $227 million, was transferred from an unknown wallet to the major exchange OKX. This single USDT transfer is more than just a number on a screen; it’s a significant event that sends ripples through market sentiment and raises critical questions about the intentions of major holders, often called ‘whales’. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When such a large sum of stablecoin moves onto a centralized exchange like OKX, analysts immediately look for clues. Typically, this action suggests one of two primary intentions. First, the holder may be preparing to convert their USDT into other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which could signal an upcoming large buy order. Alternatively, they might be moving funds for safekeeping or to take advantage of exchange-based financial products. The mystery of the ‘unknown wallet’ origin adds a layer of intrigue, as it obscures whether this is an institutional player, a fund, or a wealthy individual. Why Should Crypto Traders Care About Whale Movements? Whale transactions are a vital pulse check for the crypto market. Their moves can act as leading indicators. For instance, a large USDT transfer to an exchange often precedes increased buying pressure, potentially lifting prices. Conversely, moving assets *off* an exchange can indicate a long-term holding strategy. Understanding these flows helps traders gauge market sentiment. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation is not causation. One transaction does not guarantee a specific market outcome, but it provides valuable context. Market Sentiment Gauge: Large inflows to exchanges can hint at impending trading activity. Liquidity Signal: It shows where large pools of capital are being positioned. Price Volatility Warning: A sudden large sell order after a conversion could temporarily impact an asset’s price. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Bitcoin or Ethereum Prices? This is the million-dollar—or rather, $227 million—question. The direct impact depends entirely on the whale’s next move. If the USDT is used to purchase Bitcoin, the sheer size of the order could create noticeable upward momentum, especially if placed on the open market. For Ethereum or other altcoins, the effect could be even more pronounced due to their smaller market caps. Therefore, monitoring exchange order books for large bids following such a deposit becomes a key activity for seasoned traders. The Bigger Picture: Stability and Scrutiny in Crypto Beyond short-term price action, this event highlights two enduring themes in cryptocurrency: transparency and stability. The public nature of the blockchain allows anyone to see this USDT transfer , demonstrating the transparent audit trail that defines this technology. Simultaneously, the movement of such a large sum of the world’s leading stablecoin underscores the critical role USDT plays in providing liquidity and a stable trading pair across global crypto markets. It’s a reminder of how interconnected and sensitive this ecosystem is to major capital flows. In conclusion, the mysterious transfer of $227 million in USDT to OKX is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and whale-driven nature of cryptocurrency markets. While it sparks immediate speculation, its true significance will only be revealed by the holder’s subsequent actions. For investors, it serves as a case study in the importance of monitoring on-chain data while maintaining a balanced perspective, avoiding knee-jerk reactions to single data points. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A: A “whale” is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Q2: Why is transferring USDT to an exchange considered significant? A: Moving stablecoins to an exchange is typically a preparatory step for trading. It signals an intent to buy other assets, making it a potential indicator of future market demand. Q3: What is Whale Alert? A: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various networks in real-time. Q4: Can a single transaction really affect the crypto market? A: While one transaction rarely changes long-term trends, a trade of this magnitude ($227M) can cause short-term price volatility, especially if executed quickly on the open market for a smaller-cap asset. Q5: What does “unknown wallet” mean? A: An “unknown wallet” is a blockchain address not publicly linked to a known identity, such as an exchange, company, or individual. Its owner remains anonymous. Q6: Is USDT the same as USD? A: No. USDT (Tether) is a cryptocurrency stablecoin *pegged* to the value of the US Dollar. It operates on blockchains and is issued by a private company, not a government central bank. Did this deep dive into the major USDT transfer help you understand market dynamics better?

The country’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) has decided to reverse its previous ban, now permitting the sale of crypto exchange-traded notes to retail investors. This move signals France’s alignment with broader European trends toward regulated crypto accessibility. What Are Crypto ETNs and Why Does This Matter? Crypto ETNs are debt instruments that track the performance of underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Unlike directly buying crypto on exchanges, these products trade on traditional stock exchanges. This provides retail investors with a familiar, regulated framework for crypto exposure. The AMF’s decision represents a crucial step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption in Europe’s second-largest economy. Why Did France Reverse Its Crypto ETN Ban? France initially prohibited crypto ETNs in October 2023, citing concerns about retail investor protection. The regulator worried that inexperienced investors might not fully understand the volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrency products. However, the landscape has evolved significantly in recent months. The AMF observed several developments that influenced their reversal: Growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrency products Improved regulatory frameworks across Europe Successful implementation of similar products in other jurisdictions Increasing retail demand for regulated crypto access points What Are the New Safeguards for Investors? The regulator isn’t opening the floodgates without precautions. The revised rules include specific requirements designed to protect retail investors. Most notably, providers must display prominent warnings about the products’ risks and characteristics. These warnings must be clear, unavoidable, and written in language that everyday investors can understand. This balanced approach allows access while maintaining consumer protection. The AMF recognizes that complete prohibition might push investors toward unregulated offshore platforms with fewer safeguards. By offering regulated crypto ETNs, France provides a safer alternative for those seeking crypto exposure. How Does This Fit Into Europe’s Crypto Landscape? France’s decision follows similar moves by other European nations, particularly the United Kingdom. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority recently approved the listing of crypto ETNs on regulated exchanges. This creates a growing trend of European regulators embracing cryptocurrency products within controlled frameworks. The timing is particularly interesting as Europe implements its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. France’s move demonstrates how national regulators can work within broader European frameworks while addressing local market needs. This could encourage other EU members to develop their own balanced approaches to crypto regulation. What Does This Mean for Retail Investors? For French retail investors, this development offers several advantages. First, it provides access to cryptocurrency exposure through familiar investment channels. Second, the regulated nature of these products offers greater transparency and oversight compared to direct crypto purchases. Third, it eliminates the technical complexities of managing private keys and wallets. However, investors should remain cautious. Crypto ETNs still carry significant risks, including: High volatility in underlying cryptocurrency prices Counterparty risk with the issuing institution Potential tracking errors between the ETN and its underlying assets Liquidity concerns during market stress The Future of Crypto Regulation in France This policy reversal suggests France is positioning itself as a forward-thinking crypto hub. By creating regulated pathways for retail participation, the country acknowledges cryptocurrency’s growing role in modern finance. The AMF’s approach balances innovation with protection, potentially setting a template for other regulators. Looking ahead, we might see further developments in France’s crypto regulatory framework. The success of crypto ETNs could lead to additional product approvals or regulatory refinements. France appears committed to fostering innovation while maintaining robust investor protections. Conclusion: A Balanced Approach to Crypto Adoption France’s decision to allow crypto ETNs represents a pragmatic evolution in regulatory thinking. Rather than outright prohibition, the AMF has chosen regulated access with clear safeguards. This approach acknowledges cryptocurrency’s permanence in financial markets while addressing legitimate concerns about retail investor protection. The move positions France alongside other progressive European nations embracing cryptocurrency within regulatory frameworks. For retail investors, it offers new opportunities while emphasizing the importance of understanding risks. As crypto continues to mature, such balanced regulatory approaches will likely become increasingly common across global markets. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are crypto ETNs? Crypto ETNs are exchange-traded notes that track the performance of cryptocurrencies. They are debt instruments issued by financial institutions and trade on traditional stock exchanges, providing regulated exposure to crypto assets. When can French investors start buying crypto ETNs? The AMF’s decision is effective immediately, but financial institutions need time to develop and list products. Investors should check with their brokers for availability timelines. Are crypto ETNs safer than buying cryptocurrency directly? They offer different risk profiles. Crypto ETNs provide regulatory oversight and eliminate technical risks like wallet management, but they introduce counterparty risk and may not perfectly track underlying assets. What cryptocurrencies will these ETNs track? Initial products will likely track major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the AMF may approve additional underlying assets as the market develops. Will there be investment limits for retail investors? The AMF hasn’t specified investment limits, but individual product issuers or brokers might implement their own restrictions based on risk assessments. How does this affect France’s position in European crypto regulation? This move positions France as a progressive regulator within the EU’s MiCA framework, potentially attracting crypto businesses and establishing the country as a European crypto hub.

The MSCI is mulling excluding DATs that have invested over 50% of their assets in Bitcoin or other crypto, claiming they are more investment funds than operating firms. However, the idea has not only drawn fierce backlash from the industry but also from industry leaders such as Michael Saylor of Strategy and Viek Ramaswamy of Strive Asset Management. The MSCI announced its possible exclusion plans in October, with a final decision expected to be reached at the beginning of next year. Meanwhile, players in the crypto market emphasize that the MSCI’s exclusion of DATs from its indexes is a mistake. Adam Levine, Fireblocks’ CEO, said the MSCI plan might backfire and will likely not play well with institutional investors. He noted that these institutional investors have already warmed up to crypto in recent years and may be forced to rebalance their holdings to track the index. Levine claims businesses could miss out on tokenized equity The Fireblocks CEO pointed out that the MSCI is introducing the risk of missing key market players if it leaves out companies that have a meaningful presence in the crypto space. He further compared it to the equivalence of intentionally ignoring early internet companies 30 years ago, especially now that businesses are innovating with tokenized equity and stablecoins. Meanwhile, Spencer Hallarn, the head of OTC trading at GSR, said the decisions by the MSCI and other index providers to exclude DATs have real implications on the broader industry, and by extension, the crypto they hold. He, however, believes that the rumored exclusion has been well planned for, so it would be reasonable to assume that the market has already priced it in. It is unlikely to come as a surprise, he added. The Business Insider also predicts that the MSCI’s potential exclusion of DATs has already been factored into the market’s outlook despite the likely adverse implications for DATs. Meanwhile, Wojciech Kaszycki, BTCS S.A.’s chief strategy officer, predicts that Bitcoin can still recover from the bear market and the rebound is definitely coming. Strive urges MSCI to scrap exclusion plans Nasdaq-listed Strive Asset Management is among the many crypto-related firms urging the MSCI to scrap its potential exclusion plans. The company emphasizes that cutting off BTC-focused DATs is unfair because they are crucial to structured finance and AI infrastructure. The MSCI’s chairman and CEO, Henry Fernandez, believes that the exclusion risks shutting down passive investors from a fast-growing market. Meanwhile, JPMorgan cautions that Strategy stands to lose nearly $2.8 billion if the MSCI index decides to exclude such Bitcoin treasuries. Strategy’s Saylor has confirmed that talks with MSCI are ongoing, as the company remains opposed to the move. Strive’s CEO, Matt Cole, also argues that the proposed exclusion misunderstands the role played by large Bitcoin firms in emerging industries, particularly in the field of AI. However, he notes that potential exclusion targets, such as MARA, Riot Platforms, and Hut 8, are expanding into AI by repurposing data centers for high-intensity compute workloads. On the other hand, Cole further noted that these companies will continue holding substantial Bitcoin reserves amid increasing AI revenue. He points out that the MSCI’s exclusion would permanently isolate a sector of the crypto industry that sits at the intersection of the next generation of computing and crypto. Strive further challenged the practicality of the MSCI’s exclusion threshold of 50% or more, highlighting the Trump Media & Technology Group as an example. The Trump-backed company narrowly avoided the initial MSCI exclusion because its BTC exposure is currently below the cutoff. Meanwhile, Strive suggests a parallel version of MSCI’s index for ex-DATs, rather than a blanket rule. The company says this will allow asset managers to avoid crypto-heavy firms as they await the MSCI’s final decision.

Related Reading: Wall Street Storms Ripple In Explosive $500 Million Deal What was once a retail-driven ecosystem is now increasingly shaped by institutional flows, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting substantial assets, while on-chain activity trends in the opposite direction. The result is a market that moves, but with participation patterns very different from those seen in earlier cycles. Bitcoin ETF Flows Rise as Retail Activity Falls Since the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, the network has experienced a steady decline in active on-chain addresses. Analysts attribute this partly to the “convenience trade,” in which retail investors opt for exposure through traditional brokerage accounts rather than managing their own Bitcoin wallets. BlackRock’s IBIT and similar products now capture a growing share of BTC demand, even as the blockchain itself shows a decline in grassroots participation. Industry experts argue that this shift fundamentally changes how value circulates in the Bitcoin economy. ETF issuers, not miners or network users, are now capturing a higher share of revenue. SwanDesk CEO Jacob King describes this as a structural pivot toward off-chain monetization, with Bitcoin functioning more as a financial instrument than a peer-to-peer asset. BTC Price Pressure Intensifies Around Macro Events Bitcoin’s recent price behavior reflects both macro uncertainty and intraday volatility patterns. BTC has repeatedly slipped below $90,000 despite developments that historically would support bullish sentiment, such as Strategy’s (formerly MicroStrategy) latest purchase of over 10,600 BTC. Traders remain cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, where expectations for a quarter-point rate cut are high. Yet the hesitation is evident: rallies toward $92,000 continue to meet resistance, and liquidity remains thin across spot and derivatives markets. Consequently, analysts warn that Bitcoin must hold above a key support level near $88,000 to avoid a deeper downside. Institutional Trading Dynamics Shape Market Movements A growing number of analysts suggest that predictable sell-offs around the U.S. market open reflect coordinated execution rather than organic selling. Market watchers point to high-frequency firms, such as Jane Street, which hold large ETF positions, as possible contributors to these recurring patterns. While unproven, the consistency of these drops has added to trader frustration. Meanwhile, miners face their own pressures. Hashprice has fallen to near-record lows, prompting operators to pivot toward AI infrastructure as mining profitability erodes.

A Mild Bear Cycle Compared To History As of now, Bitcoin has recorded a modest year-to-date decline of 4%. However, the cryptocurrency has shown some stability this week, consolidating in the range of $89,000 to $94,000, with the latter figure serving as immediate resistance. According to Adler, this current correction, which stands at approximately -32%, is considered less severe compared to previous bear cycles. He emphasizes that approximately 88% of Bitcoin holdings remain in unrealized profit, while only about 12% of the total supply is currently at a loss. Adler points out that Bitcoin’s price action has remained relatively steady within the $90,000 zone, reflecting a mild drawdown in historical context. Related Reading: Shiba Inu’s Volume Explosion: Leading Meme Coin Barrels Ahead In This Metric The crucial question as the year approaches its end is whether this correction will stabilize between -35% and -40% from its all-time high, indicating a new, more “flattened” cycle, or if the market will follow historical trends that typically lead to deeper declines of -60% to -70%. Analyzing past cycles, Adler notes that major bear markets in 2011, 2016, 2019, and 2023 were characterized by a significant increase in the percentage of coins at a loss, often rising to around 60%. These levels typically marked capitulation points in the market. In contrast, the current landscape shows only 12% of holders experiencing unrealized losses, which diverges sharply from the patterns observed during past bear markets. Can Bitcoin Avoid Deeper Declines? The expert further noted that during recent local cycle peaks, only about 17% of coins were in the red, a figure that remains three to four times lower than traditional capitulation levels. This unusual configuration suggests that the current market may resemble a correction within a bullish supercycle rather than the final downturn of a full-blown bear market. Adler believes that the market appears to be testing the resilience of this correction structure, which stands at -32% from its peak, while maintaining a high ratio of profitable positions. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 He argues that if Bitcoin can sustain this maximum drawdown above the -35% zone alongside moderate unrealized losses, it could bolster the case for a shift towards more “flat” corrections influenced by institutional demand and a structural supply deficit. On the contrary, should Bitcoin’s correction extend beyond the -40% mark, the likelihood of entering a classic bear market increases significantly. Such a scenario would pave the way for deeper declines, potentially reaching the -60% to -70% range, and could trigger a full capitulation phase in terms of unrealized loss metrics. At the time of writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency is trading at $93,000, marking gains of 5% and nearly 9% in the 24-hour and 14-day time frames, respectively.

This decision carries immense weight, not just for traditional finance, but for the volatile and reactive world of cryptocurrency. The choice will signal the future direction of U.S. monetary policy, interest rates, and financial regulation—factors that directly influence Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Why Does the Federal Reserve Chair Matter for Crypto? The Federal Reserve Chair controls the nation’s money supply and interest rates. When the Fed raises rates or tightens policy, it often strengthens the dollar and can pull investment away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a dovish Fed Chair who favors low rates and stimulus can create an environment where digital assets thrive. Therefore, the upcoming appointment is a pivotal moment for market sentiment. According to a Financial Times report, the reappointment of current Chair Jerome Powell is now uncertain. The White House is reportedly reviewing a shortlist of four candidates. This uncertainty itself can trigger market volatility as investors speculate on each candidate’s potential policy leanings. Who Are the Leading Contenders for Fed Chair? The final interview pool highlights key figures with varying economic philosophies. Understanding their backgrounds helps predict their potential impact. Kevin Hassett: Former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and a current member of the National Economic Council (NEC). He is considered the leading contender. Hassett is known for his support of Trump’s tax cuts and has a background in market analysis. His approach to inflation and bank regulation would be closely watched. Kevin Warsh: A former Fed Governor, Warsh has been critical of the Fed’s post-2008 crisis policies. He might favor a quicker normalization of interest rates, which could present headwinds for crypto markets accustomed to easy money. Jerome Powell: The incumbent. His tenure has seen both aggressive stimulus and a recent hawkish turn to fight inflation. His reappointment would offer continuity but not necessarily predictability for crypto. President Trump recently hinted he already has a specific candidate in mind, with a final announcement expected in January. This timeline gives markets several weeks to digest the possibilities. What Are the Immediate Implications for Investors? The selection process creates a period of heightened sensitivity. Cryptocurrency prices often react sharply to macroeconomic news from the Fed. Here’s what to watch: Policy Statements: Listen for any comments from candidates on digital assets or financial innovation. Dollar Strength: A candidate perceived as hawkish could boost the USD, potentially pressuring Bitcoin. Market Volatility: Expect increased volatility in crypto markets around official announcements and leaks. For long-term crypto holders, this underscores the importance of understanding macroeconomics. The Federal Reserve Chair is a key architect of the financial landscape in which decentralized assets operate. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights While we cannot control the outcome, we can manage our response. Consider these steps: Diversify: Ensure your portfolio isn’t overly exposed to assets most sensitive to interest rate shocks. Stay Informed: Follow credible financial news for updates on the selection process. Avoid Knee-Jerk Reactions: Volatility based on speculation can create buying opportunities but also significant risk. The bottom line is that this political decision has real financial consequences. The next Federal Reserve Chair will help steer the U.S. economy through potential recessions, inflation battles, and technological disruptions like CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), which compete directly with existing cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A Decision with Far-Reaching Ripples President Trump’s final interviews for the Federal Reserve Chair are more than a personnel decision. They represent a fork in the road for monetary policy. For the cryptocurrency community, this process is a stark reminder that digital assets do not exist in a vacuum. Their valuation and adoption are inextricably linked to the decisions made in traditional halls of power. The chosen candidate will shape regulatory attitudes, influence global capital flows, and ultimately, help determine whether crypto winters are mild or severe in the years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will the new Federal Reserve Chair be announced? A: President Trump indicated a final decision is expected in January of next year, following this week’s final interviews. Q2: Is Jerome Powell likely to be reappointed? A: Current reports suggest his reappointment is uncertain. He is one of several candidates being reviewed, and the President has hinted at having a specific alternative in mind. Q3: Who is Kevin Hassett and why is he a leading candidate? A: Kevin Hassett is a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and currently serves on the National Economic Council (NEC). He is seen as a leading contender due to his alignment with the President’s economic policies and his experience. Q4: How does the Fed Chair appointment affect Bitcoin? A: The Fed Chair influences interest rates and monetary policy. Hawkish policies (higher rates) can strengthen the dollar and reduce risk appetite, often negatively impacting Bitcoin. Dovish policies (lower rates) can have the opposite effect. Q5: What should a crypto investor do during this selection process? A: Investors should stay informed on news regarding the candidates, avoid making impulsive trades based on speculation, and consider the long-term macroeconomic landscape when making portfolio decisions. Q6: Could this decision impact crypto regulation? A: Indirectly, yes. The Fed Chair influences broader financial stability views and the pace of innovation like CBDCs, which can shape the regulatory environment for private cryptocurrencies.

On December 9th, these funds collectively attracted a net inflow of $150 million. This positive movement occurred even as one of the largest players, BlackRock, experienced a significant withdrawal. The data reveals a fascinating shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation within the cryptocurrency market. What Do the Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflow Numbers Really Show? According to data from TraderT, the headline figure is a robust $150 million net inflow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the real story lies beneath the surface. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded a substantial net outflow of $136 million on the same day. This means other spot Bitcoin ETFs had to perform exceptionally well to not only offset this loss but also generate a strong overall gain. The activity highlights a diverse and dynamic market where flows are not dependent on a single fund. Which Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Winning Investor Confidence? The inflows were not evenly distributed. Several funds emerged as clear winners, attracting the capital that flowed out of BlackRock’s offering. Here is a breakdown of the major inflows: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): Led the pack with a massive $190 million inflow. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust: Attracted $33.79 million. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC): Saw $17.48 million in new capital. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB): Gained $16.22 million. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): Received $5.26 million. This distribution shows that investor interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs is broadening beyond the initial launch giants. Why Is This Movement Significant for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? This data point is crucial for several reasons. First, it proves the market for spot Bitcoin ETFs has depth and liquidity. A major outflow from one fund does not cripple the entire sector. Second, it indicates that investors are becoming more sophisticated. They are actively choosing between different spot Bitcoin ETF products based on factors like fees, the issuer’s reputation, or specific fund structures. Finally, a net positive day amidst volatility reinforces the thesis that these ETFs are becoming a permanent, legitimate gateway for institutional and retail capital into Bitcoin. What Challenges Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Face? Despite the positive flow, challenges remain. The market is highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s price movements. A sustained bear market could test the resilience of these inflows. Furthermore, competition is fierce, with issuers potentially engaging in fee wars to attract assets. Regulatory scrutiny also remains a constant backdrop for all spot Bitcoin ETFs. Navigating these hurdles will be key to their long-term success. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For investors watching this space, the flow data offers valuable signals. The diversification of inflows suggests it may be wise to research beyond the most prominent spot Bitcoin ETF. Monitoring these weekly flow reports can provide insight into institutional sentiment. Moreover, understanding that outflows from one fund can be offset by others underscores the overall health of the product category. It’s a reminder that the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape is maturing rapidly. In conclusion, the $150 million net inflow for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is a powerful testament to the product’s growing acceptance. The ability to absorb a large outflow from a major issuer like BlackRock and still post a significant gain marks a milestone. It shows the market is not a monolith but a competitive arena where capital seeks the best opportunity. This resilience bodes well for the future of regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that holds actual Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency directly. Why did BlackRock’s IBIT have an outflow? Specific reasons for daily flows are rarely disclosed. It could be due to profit-taking by a large investor, portfolio rebalancing by an institution, or a shift to another spot Bitcoin ETF with lower fees or different features. Are net inflows always good for Bitcoin’s price? Generally, yes. Net inflows mean new money is entering the market to buy Bitcoin, which creates buying pressure. However, many other macro and crypto-specific factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. How can I track these spot Bitcoin ETF flows? Data is regularly published by analytics firms like Farside Investors and TraderT. Many financial news websites covering cryptocurrency also summarize this data daily or weekly. What’s the difference between GBTC and the Grayscale Mini Trust? The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the original, larger fund. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust is a newer, lower-fee spin-off product designed to be more competitive with other spot Bitcoin ETFs. Is investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF safe? While they are regulated financial products, spot Bitcoin ETFs carry the same volatility risk as Bitcoin itself. They are not risk-free but eliminate the technical risks of self-custody.

But while price action keeps traders on edge, on-chain indicators are painting a surprisingly different picture beneath the surface. According to a new CryptoQuant report by XWIN Research Japan, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have continued to fall sharply throughout 2025, even as price corrected toward the $90K range. Related Reading: Smart Whales Align: Top Performers Go All-In On Ethereum Long Positions With Over $425M in Exposure The data shows that the total amount of BTC held on centralized exchanges has dropped to 2.76 million BTC, reaching one of the lowest levels ever recorded. What makes this trend even more striking is its timing: during the steep November–December sell-off, exchange balances did not rise—they fell faster. The report highlights this behavior in the red-marked zone of the chart, showing accelerating outflows while the price was dropping. This pattern signals something unusual: investors are not sending coins to exchanges to sell into weakness. Instead, they continue withdrawing BTC into long-term custody, suggesting confidence rather than capitulation. As volatility builds ahead of the FOMC decision, the contrast between short-term price fear and long-term accumulation is becoming one of the most important dynamics in the current Bitcoin market. Shrinking Exchange Reserves Signal Structural Strength The report emphasizes that Bitcoin’s rapidly shrinking exchange reserves carry important structural implications for the market. When fewer coins sit on centralized exchanges, it means less Bitcoin is available for immediate sale, effectively tightening the liquid supply. According to the data, this decline is not being driven by short-term speculators but by long-term holders and institutional entities steadily moving BTC into self-custody or cold storage. What makes this trend remarkable is its timing. Historically, sharp price declines trigger a wave of inflows to exchanges as investors prepare to sell or panic-exit their positions. This cycle, however, tells a very different story. Even as Bitcoin corrected into the $90K region, exchange balances kept falling, suggesting that buyers with a long-term outlook are actively accumulating rather than retreating. This divergence between price action and on-chain behavior signals underlying strength. While short-term volatility may continue—especially around macro catalysts like the FOMC meeting—the broader structure points toward a market quietly tightening its available supply. As reserves move toward historic lows, a future “supply shock” becomes increasingly plausible. Despite the weak spot market performance, on-chain metrics are slowly turning bullish, hinting that the foundation for the next major trend may already be forming beneath the surface. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Momentum While OI Holds Steady: Binance Data Shows A Market Reset BTC Tests Critical Support as Market Awaits Direction Bitcoin’s price action on the 3-day chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after a sharp corrective phase. BTC is currently trading around $90,437, hovering just above the 200-day moving average — a level that has historically acted as a major dynamic support during mid-cycle retracements. The recent bounce from the $87K–$88K region suggests that buyers are defending this zone, but the structure remains fragile as long as the price stays below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, both of which are now sloping downward. The chart reveals a clear shift in momentum. After months of steady higher lows, Bitcoin broke its ascending structure in late November, leading to a fast drop toward the high-$80K range. Volume increased during the decline, indicating stronger participation on the sell side. However, the subsequent candles show shrinking sell volume, hinting at exhaustion among short-term sellers.

Failure to break that zone would likely keep the market in a consolidation phase, with risks of another retest of the 200-day MA.

55581956,642621,1765342856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55581956.jpeg,Classic Bitcoin Buy Signal Returns: Are Miners Hinting The Next Accumulation Phase?,https://bitcoinist.com/classic-bitcoin-signal-returns-miners-accumulation/,"Bitcoin is trading at a decisive moment, holding just above the $90,000 mark after several days of tight consolidation. Despite reclaiming this key level, the market continues to struggle with upward momentum, leaving traders uncertain about the next major move. Yet beneath the surface, a key on-chain indicator has triggered fresh interest among analysts. According to top analyst Darkfost, the Hash Ribbons have just flashed a new buy signal — a development that historically aligns with strong medium-term performance for Bitcoin. Darkfost emphasizes that this signal is not a cue to rush blindly into the market, but rather a meaningful piece of data worth highlighting. Hash Ribbon signals typically appear during periods of miner stress, when mining difficulty forces weaker miners to shut down. These moments often precede significant accumulation phases, as selling pressure from distressed miners fades. With the exception of the unprecedented 2021 mining ban in China, every previous Hash Ribbon buy signal has produced profitable outcomes for patient investors. Understanding The Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Signal Darkfost explains that the Hash Ribbons indicator is built around the evolution of Bitcoin’s hashrate, comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages to detect periods of miner stress. When the 30-day MA of the hashrate falls below the 60-day MA, it signals that mining difficulty is rising relative to miner profitability. In these phases, less efficient miners are often forced to scale back operations or shut down entirely, reducing the overall network hashrate. While mining difficulty itself is influenced by several factors — including electricity costs, hardware efficiency, block rewards, and, of course, Bitcoin’s price — the key point is that miner capitulation tends to create short-term selling pressure. Miners may liquidate part of their reserves to stay afloat, often contributing to temporary weakness in the market. However, Darkfost emphasizes that these periods of stress historically present strong mid-cycle accumulation opportunities. As weaker miners exit and difficulty adjusts downward, the market often enters a healthier phase where selling pressure subsides, and long-term participants begin to accumulate BTC at discounted prices. Over the years, Hash Ribbon buy signals have frequently marked early stages of major recoveries, offering investors a structural, data-driven advantage even when sentiment appears uncertain. Testing Support as Momentum Weakens Bitcoin continues to trade just above the $90,000 level, showing signs of stabilization after several weeks of heavy downside momentum. The chart reveals that BTC has bounced off the 100-day moving average (green), which is now acting as a key dynamic support zone. This level has historically served as an important midpoint during major pullbacks, and the market’s ability to hold above it suggests that selling pressure may be easing. However, the price remains well below the 50-day moving average (blue), which has begun to curve downward — a signal that short-term momentum still leans bearish. For a stronger recovery, Bitcoin must reclaim this moving average and convert it into support. Until then, rallies may struggle to extend meaningfully. Volume has also compressed significantly compared to the earlier stages of the uptrend. This decline indicates hesitation from both buyers and sellers, often typical during consolidation phases following sharp corrections. The lack of aggressive selling is a constructive sign, but the absence of strong buy-side interest keeps BTC vulnerable to further swings. If Bitcoin holds above the $90K–$88K area, it could build a base for a broader rebound. A breakdown below this region, however, would open the door to deeper retracements toward the mid-$80K range.

The analysis compares the current weekly structure with past market cycles, focusing on how XRP behaved after similar dips. In previous instances, marked on the chart as June 2022 and July 2024, XRP formed clear lows before rallying by approximately 226.6%, 789.35% and later 126.2%. These moves are shown as measured percentage expansions from the identified bottom to the next significant high. According to the chart, XRP is again positioned near a weekly low, indicated by a circle around late December 2025. The analyst uses a dotted upward projection to illustrate the potential path if XRP repeats its earlier pattern of recovering strongly from comparable points. The intention is not to predict an exact price but to highlight how the structure resembles previous phases that preceded major upward moves . $XRP HISTORICAL BUYING OPPORTUNITY! pic.twitter.com/8huYQtuy9a — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 6, 2025 Sentiment Levels Reinforcing the Setup The lower section of the shared image displays the weekly Crypto Fear and Greed Index. Stephiscrypto notes that every time the indicator reached similarly low levels in the past, XRP was close to forming a bottom. These low readings appear around the same periods as the price lows marked on the chart. The most recent sentiment dip falls within this same range, which the analyst views as supportive of the idea that the market may be nearing exhaustion on the downside. The alignment between sentiment lows and price turning points is presented as an additional signal rather than a guarantee. It is meant to show that current market conditions resemble earlier stages where XRP eventually shifted from decline to recovery. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Perspective from the Community A user named David commented on the analysis, noting that while he supports XRP, he remains cautious due to the broader influence of Bitcoin . He points out that Bitcoin’s chart still shapes overall market movement and believes XRP’s weekly performance has not yet displayed its potential. The analyst’s chart does not dismiss this point. The recurring patterns shown are tied to general market cycles, suggesting that correlation remains an important factor. Stephiscrypto’s post outlines a technical case for why XRP may be entering a historically favorable zone for accumulation. The argument is based on repeating weekly structures, previous recovery percentages, and sentiment lows that match present conditions. While this does not assure the same outcome, it offers a structured way to understand where XRP currently stands in relation to its past cycles.

Here’s the implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-breaks-below-its-3-day-gaussian-channel-heres-the-implication/,"Crypto analyst StephisCrypto flagged a breach of XRP’s 3-day Gaussian Channel, noting that each prior breakdown from this indicator preceded deeper declines and extended periods of bearish price action. The chart attached to the analyst’s update overlays multiple historical episodes — labelled breaks in 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2022 — and highlights the duration, in bars and days, of the consolidation and drawdown phases that followed those breaks. The current break is presented alongside those prior instances to emphasize the historical tendency for follow-through weakness after a channel breach on this timeframe. $XRP has broken below its 3-day Gaussian Channel and historically, every breakdown has led to significantly more downside followed by a long stretch of bearish price action. Should we be worried? pic.twitter.com/eaiwXHzP7n — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 7, 2025 Market implications and timeframe considerations The analyst’s framing treats the 3-day XRP Gaussian Channel as a multi-year structural tool rather than a short-term oscillator. In prior episodes shown on the chart, the market did not resume sustained upward momentum immediately after a channel breach; rather, prices experienced additional downside and lengthy consolidations that extended for many months. By comparing the most recent breach with previous ones, the analyst suggests that traders and longer-term holders should view a break below this channel as a risk factor for further price erosion and protracted market neutrality. The chart annotations quantify prior consolidation windows in bars and days, reinforcing the view that the timeframe of meaningful market responses to these breaks is measured in months rather than days. XRP Community’s reactions and trading posture Community responses to the update demonstrate a cautious stance among active traders. One respondent recommended against initiating fresh long positions and urged observers to monitor structural support and key zones before considering entries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another participant expressed a personal view that lower levels would be preferable for accumulation ahead of a seasonal liquidity event, while acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in the current price action. These comments reflect a split between tactical caution and opportunistic accumulation depending on individual risk tolerances and objectives. Risk management and practical takeaways The analyst’s post is essentially a technical risk signal: a breach of a multi-day channel that historically preceded further weakness. For market participants, the key practical considerations are to reassess position sizing, confirm support levels on lower timeframes, and avoid assuming that a channel breach will automatically lead to an immediate recovery. Because the chart focuses on historical patterns , the appropriate response depends on each participant’s investment horizon, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance.

The launch is powered by Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform, marking a major step forward in the integration of digital assets into the country’s traditional banking system. Today marks a major milestone for institutional crypto adoption. @Coinbase ’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform is now powering @PNCBank ’s launch of direct bitcoin trading for PNC Private Bank clients – the first to market with such an offering among the major U.S. banks. pic.twitter.com/wwuOIRuBfK — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) December 9, 2025 The partnership pairs PNC’s scale as a top-10 U.S. bank with Coinbase’s leading crypto infrastructure, creating a seamless experience for clients who want to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin directly within their trusted banking environment. The move arrives at a time when institutional pathways into crypto are expanding at record speed. A First-of-Its-Kind Bitcoin Trading Experience for U.S. Bank Clients With this rollout, PNC Private Bank clients now gain the ability to access direct Bitcoin trading without opening accounts on external exchanges. Everything happens inside PNC’s existing banking platform, an experience designed to feel familiar, secure, and fully integrated. Clients can buy, sell, and hold bitcoin through the bank’s interface in the same way they manage their traditional financial assets. Coinbase provides the backend infrastructure, execution, custody architecture, and compliance rails, while PNC delivers the client-facing experience. This approach removes friction, simplifies onboarding, and places bitcoin alongside conventional investment tools. For many high-net-worth clients who prefer to operate within long-trusted financial institutions, this model unlocks digital assets in the most comfortable way possible. Why Coinbase’s Infrastructure Matters Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform is engineered to integrate directly with large financial institutions. The product allows banks to offer digital-asset services natively, without needing to build trading, custody, or compliance systems from scratch. By partnering with Coinbase, PNC gains access to: • Market-grade execution infrastructure • Regulated custody systems • Compliance and transaction monitoring tools • Scalable digital-asset architecture • Crypto liquidity with institutional protections Coinbase says this collaboration is part of a broader mission to enable “seamless access to digital assets within trusted financial systems,” reinforcing the idea that crypto is moving from standalone platforms into mainstream finance. Today marks a major milestone for institutional crypto adoption. @Coinbase ’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform is now powering @PNCBank ’s launch of direct bitcoin trading for PNC Private Bank clients – the first to market with such an offering among the major U.S. banks. pic.twitter.com/wwuOIRuBfK — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) December 9, 2025 For Coinbase, this continues a trend of high-profile institutional partnerships. For PNC, it represents a forward-moving shift toward a new class of financial services that blend traditional banking with emerging asset classes. The Broader Regulatory and Market Context Behind PNC’s Timing The timing of PNC’s launch is not accidental. Several developments across U.S. financial markets have accelerated the movement of traditional institutions into digital assets. Earlier this year: • The CFTC allowed Bitcoin to be used as derivatives collateral, marking a new level of institutional recognition. • Vanguard enabled access to crypto ETFs for over 50 million customers, signaling that even legacy conservative institutions could adopt certain forms of digital-asset exposure. These shifts reflect a broader normalization of crypto in mainstream finance. As regulatory clarity improves and market infrastructure matures, banks are beginning to deliver crypto services directly rather than pushing clients toward external exchanges. PNC’s decision positions the bank as an early mover at a moment when institutional adoption is not only growing, but accelerating. Why This Integration Sets a New Standard for U.S. Banking PNC is the first major U.S. bank to deploy direct bitcoin trading, but this breakthrough signals a much broader shift in how banks may approach digital assets in the coming years. The partnership introduces a new model: • Bitcoin trading happens inside the banking platform, not through third-party accounts. • Custody and trading infrastructure are handled by Coinbase, a regulated and publicly traded company. • Clients access bitcoin through channels they already trust. • Banks keep client relationships, compliance visibility, and data control. This combination, a trusted bank front-end with a regulated crypto infrastructure back-end, creates a template that other U.S. institutions may now look to replicate. For high-net-worth clients, this solves the biggest barriers they face: security concerns, complex onboarding, fragmented platforms, and the lack of integrated wealth-management oversight. For the banking industry, it offers a pathway to meet rising demand without building full crypto systems internally. A Milestone That Signals the Next Phase of U.S. Crypto Adoption PNC’s launch with Coinbase is more than just a new product offering. It represents a structural shift in how the banking sector views digital assets. Bitcoin is no longer treated as an experimental category held at arm’s length. Instead, it is being embedded into the same systems that manage deposits, credit, wealth management, and estate planning. The move also reflects changing expectations among affluent clients. Crypto is no longer just for retail traders or niche investment platforms. It is becoming a component of diversified portfolios, long-term planning strategies, and institutional wealth management frameworks. With PNC stepping forward as the first major U.S. bank to offer direct bitcoin trading, the financial industry now enters a new phase, one where digital assets sit inside the traditional banking experience rather than outside it. As Coinbase and PNC frame it, the goal is simple: Enable seamless access to digital assets inside the world’s most trusted financial systems. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

We think this… pic.twitter.com/8n8NgEekxO — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 9, 2025 BITW enters the market as the largest crypto index fund in the world, holding $1.25 billion in assets under management as of today. The fund’s eight-year track record now extends to a fully tradable exchange-listed product, giving investors a way to own a diversified basket of major crypto assets in a single ticker. A New Option for Investors Who Don’t Want to Pick Winners Crypto continues to grow, but for many investors the challenge remains the same: choosing which assets to back and keeping up with daily market changes. Bitwise argues that BITW solves this problem directly. The fund gives investors exposure to the largest crypto assets by market capitalization, whatever they happen to be at any point in time. Instead of predicting which blockchain ecosystem will dominate, BITW provides a broad index that automatically adjusts to market trends. This makes the product attractive to investors who believe in crypto’s long-term potential but prefer not to make individual asset bets. The listing offers a simple message: rather than guess the next big winner, an investor can choose BITW and let the index determine the allocation. How BITW Works: A Monthly-Rebalanced Basket of Top 10 Crypto Assets BITW holds a single basket of ten leading crypto assets, ranked by market cap, screened for risk, and rebalanced every month. The structure is flexible, and there is no cap on the largest position. This means allocation follows market reality without artificial limits. If the market consolidates and Bitcoin becomes the only asset with lasting value, BITW would automatically tilt toward almost entirely Bitcoin. If instead the market expands and eight different assets emerge as strong long-term players, the fund adjusts to include them too, even if some of those assets have not yet been created. The core idea is straightforward: BITW adapts as the crypto landscape shifts. Investors don’t need to forecast which tokens will succeed or collapse; the index handles that filtering. Screened for Liquidity, Security, and Compliance The underlying Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index is built to navigate the unique risks of digital assets. It uses strict screening rules that incorporate liquidity thresholds, security considerations, and compliance checks. These filters matter. In 2022, during the market turmoil, LUNA reached top-10 status by market cap. But despite its size, it was never admitted into the index because the screening process flagged concerns about the asset’s fundamentals and stability. BITW investors were therefore shielded from one of the most dramatic asset collapses in crypto history. To keep the process transparent, Bitwise publishes monthly updates showing which assets are entering or exiting the index. This information is released publicly, at the same time, to the entire market, no private access, no preferential treatment. A Product With High Potential and High Risk Bitwise emphasizes that BITW is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, it does not offer the same investor protections that govern mutual funds or traditional ETFs. The company outlines this clearly. BITW is not suitable for all investors. It carries significant risk and heightened volatility, and there is always the possibility of losing the entire invested amount. An investment in BITW is not a direct investment in crypto assets themselves. Instead, it tracks the performance of the index it is designed to replicate. Foreside Fund Services, LLC serves as the Marketing Agent for BITW. Bitwise states these disclosures openly to make sure investors understand the structure and risk profile before engaging with the product. Bitwise’s Long Road to Bringing Crypto Indexing to the U.S. Market Bitwise has been building toward this moment since 2017. Over the years, the firm has positioned itself as a key player in expanding investor access to digital assets. With the launch of BITW on NYSE Arca, the company says it is delivering a product investors have asked for repeatedly: a regulated exchange-traded product that captures the broad crypto market through a single index. The company’s announcement on X reflects that sentiment directly. Bitwise calls 2025 a breakout year for the space and says it has never been more optimistic about the opportunities ahead. Today: The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF ($BITW) begins trading on @NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product! Thanks to our dedicated investors, BITW is the largest crypto index fund in the world, with $1.25B in AUM (as of today) alongside an eight-year track record. We think this… pic.twitter.com/8n8NgEekxO — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) December 9, 2025 The listing reinforces Bitwise’s bet that indexed exposure, not single-asset speculation, will become a core part of the crypto investment landscape. As more investors look for structured ways to participate in digital assets, BITW offers a familiar ETF-style wrapper built around the sector’s largest names. With the product now trading live on NYSE Arca, Bitwise says it is excited to continue working alongside the investors who helped make the fund the largest crypto index product in the world.

According to data from Arkham Intelligence reported by The Block, these wallets transferred approximately $3.14 million in Bitcoin to an anonymous address. This mysterious activity raises critical questions about market impact, ownership, and the long shadow of crypto’s most infamous marketplace. Let’s unravel this cryptic event. What Exactly Happened with the Silk Road Wallets? The activity was not a single transaction but a coordinated movement. A cluster of 312 separate Silk Road wallets began transferring their holdings to a single, anonymous Bitcoin address starting with “bc1q.” The total value moved was $3.14 million. Crucially, this is not a complete liquidation. The wallets involved still hold a staggering $41.3 million in Bitcoin , meaning this could be just the beginning of a larger movement. The timing is particularly intriguing. This flurry of transactions occurred shortly after former President Donald Trump commuted the life sentence of Silk Road founder, Ross Ulbricht. While no direct link has been established, the coincidence has fueled intense speculation within crypto circles. The core mystery remains: who controls these wallets now, and what is their intent? Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Transfer? This event is more than a historical footnote; it has real implications for today’s market. Large, sudden movements from dormant wallets can influence Bitcoin’s price through several mechanisms: Market Sentiment: The movement of “sleeping” coins, especially from a notorious source, can create uncertainty and volatility. Sell Pressure: If the transferred $3.1 million in BTC is sent to an exchange and sold, it adds immediate selling pressure to the market. Regulatory Scrutiny: Activity linked to Silk Road inevitably draws the attention of regulators and law enforcement, potentially impacting broader market sentiment. Furthermore, blockchain analysts are now closely watching the destination address. Any subsequent movement to a known exchange address could signal an imminent sell-off. For investors, monitoring these Silk Road wallets provides a unique window into potential market-moving events. What Are the Possible Explanations for This Activity? The purpose behind the transfer is shrouded in mystery. However, several plausible theories have emerged from industry observers: Consolidation by an Owner: A current controller may be gathering funds from many old wallets into one for easier management or future action. Law Enforcement Action: Authorities could have finally gained access and are securing the assets, possibly for eventual auction or seizure. Private Key Discovery: Someone may have rediscovered or cracked the private keys to these dormant addresses after a decade. Each scenario carries different consequences. A private sale could drip coins into the market slowly, while a government auction would likely be a single, large, and public event. The anonymity of the receiving address makes it impossible to know for sure, keeping the crypto community on alert. How Does This Relate to Ross Ulbricht’s Pardon? The proximity of these transactions to Ross Ulbricht’s commutation is the elephant in the room. Ulbricht himself has stated he does not control these assets. The funds are widely believed to be held by the U.S. government, which seized them years ago. Therefore, the most logical explanation is that this is an administrative move by a government agency, perhaps preparing for asset disposal or transfer between internal wallets. This theory is bolstered by the methodical, batch-transfer nature of the transactions, which resembles treasury management rather than a private individual’s action. Regardless of the actor, the awakening of these Silk Road wallets is a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s immutable and transparent ledger, where history is never truly forgotten. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call from Crypto’s Past The sudden activity from the Silk Road wallets is a captivating narrative that blends crypto history, market mechanics, and ongoing mystery. It demonstrates how dormant blockchain assets can resurface without warning, potentially affecting market dynamics. For investors, the key takeaway is vigilance. Tracking such movements is part of understanding the complex, on-chain ecosystem that drives Bitcoin. This event underscores that in the world of cryptocurrency, the past can—and does—suddenly become very present. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who owns the Silk Road Bitcoin wallets now? A1: The prevailing belief is that the U.S. government controls most of these seized assets, though the recent transfer’s executor has not been officially identified. Q2: Could this Bitcoin transfer affect the price of BTC? A2: Yes, potentially. If the moved $3.1 million is sold on an exchange, it creates sell pressure. The news itself can also influence trader sentiment and cause short-term volatility. Q3: What is the connection to Ross Ulbricht’s pardon? A3: The timing is coincidental but notable. Ulbricht has denied control of the funds. The transfer is likely an unrelated action by the current asset holder, possibly the government. Q4: How can I track these wallets? A4: You can monitor the addresses using blockchain explorers like Arkham Intelligence, Etherscan (for ETH-based trackers), or Mempool.space, which provide real-time transaction data. Q5: Are the remaining $41.3 million in BTC likely to move soon? A5: There is no certainty. The movement of the first $3.1 million suggests the wallets are active, making further transfers a possibility that market watchers are preparing for. Q6: Is it illegal to own Bitcoin from Silk Road? A6: Owning Bitcoin itself is not illegal. However, knowingly receiving or transacting with assets that are proven to be the direct proceeds of crime can have legal consequences, depending on jurisdiction and circumstances.

The project arrives as a number of major financial firms accelerate their exploration of stablecoins after the US GENIUS Act. Companies like Citigroup, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Western Union and Visa are testing or expanding blockchain-based settlement tools. Circle Unveils Private USDCx Stablecoin issuer Circle is taking a big step toward bringing blockchain payments deeper into the institutional mainstream by developing a new privacy-enhanced version of USDC. The token is known as USDCx, and it is designed specifically for banks and enterprises that want the speed and efficiency of blockchain payments without exposing sensitive financial data on public ledgers. According to a report from Fortune , the new token is being built in collaboration with privacy-focused blockchain developer Aleo. Co-founder Howard Wu said the goal is to offer “banking-level privacy,” which has long been missing from traditional public blockchains, where wallet addresses and transaction details are openly viewable. The goal of USDCx is to strike a balance between confidentiality and regulatory compliance. While the token’s on-chain activity will be shielded from public view, Circle will still be able to produce compliance records upon official request from law enforcement or regulators. This hybrid model could solve one of the biggest barriers preventing major financial institutions from using blockchain rails: the fear that exposing internal payment flows could compromise competitive or confidential information. Aleo firmly believes that transparency, which is often called a core blockchain strength, becomes a weakness in real enterprise settings where privacy is not optional. Circle is not the only company working on privacy-preserving digital dollars. Digital asset infrastructure provider Taurus recently introduced a private smart-contract framework that enables stablecoin transfers without revealing counterparties or transaction details. This design is tailored for corporate payrolls and intracompany settlements. The rollout of the US GENIUS Act, the first comprehensive US regulatory framework for dollar-based stablecoins, triggered what some analysts are calling a corporate stablecoin race. Citigroup is now collaborating with Coinbase to test stablecoin-powered payment rails, while JPMorgan and Bank of America are experimenting with their own early blockchain settlement concepts. Western Union is building a digital asset settlement platform on Solana and plans to issue its own US Dollar Payment Token, and Visa expanded its stablecoin integrations to stay competitive in the global payments landscape. USDC and Tether’s USDT alone make up about 85% of all stablecoin activity , while synthetic dollars and PayPal’s PYUSD have grown into major players.

Across Asia, currency traders are navigating a complex web of signals: a hesitant Federal Reserve, persistent China deflation , and a US dollar that has lost its decisive momentum. For investors watching global liquidity and capital flows, this moment of caution in traditional Asia FX markets could signal shifting tides that impact digital asset valuations and cross-border investment strategies. The immediate question is whether this is a pause or a pivot. Why is the US Dollar Muted Despite Global Uncertainty? The US dollar index (DXY), a measure against a basket of major currencies, has been trading in a tight range. This lack of direction stems directly from the Federal Reserve’s communication. Recent minutes and speeches have emphasized a data-dependent approach, creating what analysts call ‘Fed caution.’ The market is parsing every economic indicator, looking for clues on the timing and pace of potential rate cuts. This uncertainty has removed a key driver of dollar strength—the clear expectation of aggressive monetary policy divergence from other central banks. China’s Deflation Problem: A Drag on Asia FX Sentiment New data confirms a troubling trend for the world’s second-largest economy. China’s consumer prices fell for a third consecutive month, while producer prices extended a long-running decline. This persistent China deflation presents a multi-faceted challenge: Domestic Demand: Falling prices encourage consumers and businesses to delay spending, waiting for cheaper goods tomorrow, which further weakens economic activity. Currency Pressure: Deflation typically increases the real value of debt and can lead to calls for more aggressive monetary stimulus, which may weaken the yuan. Regional Spillover: As the economic engine of Asia, China’s weakness dampens growth prospects and trade flows for its neighbors, weighing on their currencies. The People’s Bank of China faces a delicate balancing act: providing enough support to combat deflation without triggering excessive capital outflows or currency depreciation. How Are Major Asia FX Pairs Reacting? The reaction across the Asia FX spectrum has been mixed but generally subdued, reflecting the wait-and-see environment. Currency Pair Recent Trend Key Driver USD/CNY (Offshore Yuan) Stable with slight weakening bias PBOC fixing, deflation data USD/JPY (Japanese Yen) Consolidating near multi-decade highs Bank of Japan policy divergence from Fed AUD/USD (Australian Dollar) Range-bound, sensitive to China news Iron ore prices, Chinese import demand USD/INR (Indian Rupee) Resilient, supported by central bank intervention Strong domestic growth, RBI forex reserves This table shows that while the broad forex market theme is caution, local factors and central bank actions are creating important divergences. The Federal Reserve’s Next Move: What’s Priced In? The core of the current forex market stalemate is Fed caution . Market-implied probabilities from the CME FedWatch Tool show traders have significantly dialed back expectations for rapid interest rate cuts in 2024. The focus has shifted from ‘when’ the Fed will cut to ‘if’ and ‘by how much.’ This repricing has removed a tailwind for risk-sensitive Asian currencies, which often benefit from a weaker dollar and lower US yields. Until the Fed provides clearer guidance—likely dependent on upcoming inflation and jobs reports—the US dollar may lack a sustained trend, keeping Asia FX pairs in their recent ranges. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Navigating this environment requires a nuanced approach. Here are key considerations: Watch the Data: High-impact US data (CPI, NFP) will be critical for breaking the dollar’s stalemate. In Asia, watch for any shift in Chinese policy response to deflation. Central Bank Rhetoric: Listen for any change in tone from Fed officials. Similarly, statements from the PBOC, Bank of Japan, and Reserve Bank of India will guide their respective currencies. Correlation Awareness: Understand that in a risk-off environment driven by Fed caution or China worries, correlations can break down. Traditional safe-havens may behave differently. Range-Trading Strategies: In the absence of a clear trend, strategies that profit from currency pairs bouncing between established support and resistance levels may be more effective than directional bets. Conclusion: A Market at an Inflection Point The current pause in the forex market is not a sign of calm, but of concentrated tension. Asia FX movements are trapped between the rock of Fed caution and the hard place of China deflation . The muted US dollar reflects this equilibrium. The coming weeks will be decisive. Stronger US data could revive the dollar’s uptrend, pressuring Asian currencies. Conversely, a decisive shift from the Fed toward easing or a successful policy push from China to reflate its economy could unlock the next leg of weakness for the dollar and strength for regional currencies. For now, patience and selective positioning are the watchwords.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is causing deflation in China? China’s deflation is driven by weak consumer demand following the pandemic, a prolonged crisis in the property sector, and high local government debt, which is limiting fiscal stimulus. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has room to cut rates but is proceeding cautiously. Who is the current Chair of the Federal Reserve? The Chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell . His public statements and congressional testimonies are closely watched by the forex market for signals on US monetary policy. Which Asian central bank is most likely to intervene in currency markets? The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) are known for active management of their exchange rates to ensure stability. The Bank of Japan also intervenes occasionally to curb excessive yen weakness. How does China’s economy affect the Australian Dollar? China is Australia’s largest trading partner. Weakness in Chinese demand, especially for key Australian exports like iron ore, directly pressures the Australian Dollar (AUD). Therefore, China deflation data is a critical release for AUD traders.

It later revealed plans to acquire 75,000 BTC, then valued at over $8 billion, from claims related to the defunct Mt. Gox exchange bankruptcy. Strive’s recent Bitcoin buying spree reflects Michael Saylor’s playbook, representing another public company focused on increasing Bitcoin per share. The company has also urged index provider MSCI to rethink its plan to exclude digital asset treasury (DAT) firms from its global indexes. Strive submitted a seven-page letter to the MSCI chairman , arguing that the proposal risks shutting passive investors out of key growth markets.

This expansion of its Binance USD1 spot pairs offering provides users with more direct trading options against a major stablecoin, set to go live at 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 11. Let’s explore what this means for the market and your trading strategy. What Are the New Binance USD1 Spot Pairs? Binance is introducing direct trading avenues between three major cryptocurrencies and the USD1 stablecoin. The specific pairs are BNB/USD1, ETH/USD1, and SOL/USD1. This listing allows traders to buy and sell Binance Coin, Ethereum, and Solana directly using USD1, potentially simplifying transactions and improving liquidity for these assets. The launch is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 11. Therefore, traders should mark their calendars and prepare their accounts for this new opportunity. This move highlights Binance’s ongoing commitment to expanding its market offerings and catering to diverse trader needs. Why Does Listing New Spot Pairs Matter? Adding new Binance USD1 spot pairs is more than just a technical update. It has real implications for market dynamics and user experience. Firstly, it increases accessibility. Traders can now execute trades between these popular coins and a stablecoin without needing to use an intermediate trading pair, which can reduce complexity and transaction costs. Secondly, it enhances liquidity. By providing a direct market, Binance can concentrate trading volume, which typically leads to tighter bid-ask spreads and better price discovery for BNB, ETH, and SOL. This is beneficial for both retail and institutional participants. Simplified Trading: Direct conversion between asset and stablecoin. Potential for Better Pricing: Concentrated liquidity can improve spreads. Strategic Expansion: Signals Binance’s support for these specific blockchain ecosystems. How Can Traders Prepare for the Launch? With the launch of these Binance USD1 spot pairs approaching, being prepared is key. Ensure your Binance account is verified and funded. You may want to deposit USD1 or the relevant cryptocurrencies (BNB, ETH, SOL) ahead of time to be ready for the market open. Furthermore, consider your trading strategy. New pairs can sometimes experience high volatility in the initial minutes or hours as order books establish. Decide in advance if you are looking to trade immediately for short-term movement or if you are using this as a long-term entry point. Always remember to use risk management tools like stop-loss orders. What Is the Broader Impact on the Crypto Market? Listings on a major exchange like Binance often serve as a bullish signal for an asset. It increases visibility, accessibility, and legitimacy. The introduction of these specific Binance USD1 spot pairs reinforces the standing of BNB, ETH, and SOL as core portfolio assets in the crypto space. Moreover, it underscores the growing importance of stablecoin-based trading pairs. As regulatory landscapes evolve, trading against compliant stablecoins like USD1 may become increasingly standard. This move by Binance could be seen as positioning ahead of that trend, offering users a stable and familiar quote currency. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Accessibility Binance’s decision to list the BNB/USD1, ETH/USD1, and SOL/USD1 spot pairs is a strategic enhancement to its platform. It simplifies the trading process for three top cryptocurrencies, potentially improves market efficiency, and aligns with broader industry shifts towards stablecoin liquidity. For traders, it presents new, direct avenues to manage portfolios and react to market movements starting December 11. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What time exactly do the new Binance USD1 spot pairs go live? A1: The BNB/USD1, ETH/USD1, and SOL/USD1 spot trading pairs will be available for trading at 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 11. Q2: Is USD1 a different stablecoin from USDT or USDC? A2: Yes, USD1 is a distinct stablecoin. It is crucial to confirm it is the specific stablecoin supported in your region on Binance before depositing.

Key Takeaways: Solana is undergoing a “full liquidity reset,” with realized losses exceeding profits and liquidity falling. Exchange outflows and steady ETF inflows are providing structural support despite thinning liquidity. Analysts see potential recovery by early January, but near-term volatility remains high. According to Glassnode , Solana’s 30-day average realized profit-to-loss ratio has remained below 1 since mid-November, a level typically associated with bear-market behavior. A reading under 1 means traders are realizing losses more often than profits, signalling deteriorating sentiment and reduced liquidity. Analysts Say Solana Entering “Full Liquidity Reset” On-chain research group Altcoin Vector described the current environment as a “full liquidity reset,” a pattern that has historically marked the beginning of new liquidity cycles and preceded market bottoms. If the structure mirrors April’s setup, analysts said liquidity could begin to recover in roughly four weeks, pointing to early January for potential renewed momentum. A key lesson in alt positioning: when liquidity ignites, the move is fast. $SOL is under a full liquidity reset, setting a new liquidity cycle, as in past bottoming phases. Forced selling exhausts, the ecosystem cleans from the inside out, and SOL begins building the base for… pic.twitter.com/tiLw6gwhdb — Altcoin Vector (@altcoinvector) December 5, 2025 Despite the pressure, Solana isn’t without support. Persistent withdrawals from centralized exchanges have steadily reduced available supply, while demand from ETF buyers continues to build. Spot Solana ETFs recorded $17.72 million in net inflows so far this week, nearly matching last week’s $20.30 million, according to SoSoValue. Still, the broader environment remains fragile. Elevated leverage across crypto markets has amplified volatility, with CoinGlass reporting $432 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. Solana accounted for $15.6 million of that, making it the third-most liquidated asset behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the token climbed 3.2% on the day, per CoinGecko. Analysts say the mid- to long-term outlook for Solana remains slightly constructive, especially if macro uncertainty clears and liquidity returns to the market. However, in the near term, shrinking profitability, thinning liquidity, and heavy leverage leave the asset vulnerable to sharp swings. As reported, Pye Finance has revealed a $5 million seed round led by some of the major players in the space. The goal is to turn billions in locked SOL stakes into an active yield market. Variant and Coinbase Ventures led this round, with participation from Solana Labs, Nascent, Gemini, and others, according to the press release. Pye says that it’s building bond markets for validators and stakers on Solana (SOL) . The platform enables validators to draw and keep stake. They can offer rewards across more than a thousand validators. Fed Liquidity Boost Could Send Bitcoin “Sharply Higher” As reported, Bitcoin’s climb above $92,000 has stirred fresh optimism among market watchers who now believe this week’s Federal Reserve meeting could set off a far bigger rally. Analysts at the London Crypto Club say a liquidity boost from the Fed on Wednesday may act as a powerful catalyst, potentially driving the world’s largest cryptocurrency “sharply higher.” In their latest note, David Brickell and Chris Mills argue that the central bank is poised to deliver a “dovish surprise,” forecasting that policymakers will inject liquidity through a creative bond-buying mechanism rather than explicit quantitative easing. “We’re moving into a continued rate-cutting cycle accompanied by balance sheet expansion as the Fed effectively turns on the money printers to monetise the deficit,” they wrote. Meanwhile, a key on-chain indicator known as “liveliness” is climbing again , even as Bitcoin’s price action remains subdued. Analysts say the divergence suggests renewed underlying demand, with dormant coins moving at levels not seen in years, a sign that long-term holders may be re-entering the market. Last week, Bitfinex said the market is showing “seller exhaustion” following a period of heavy deleveraging and panic-driven exits by short-term holders.

After months of enthusiasm surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new data has shown that ETF flows have sunk to their worst monthly total since their launch. The sharp drop reflects a broader cooldown in investor demand, as market volatility and shifting risk appetite weigh on crypto allocations. Will Staking ETFs Emerge To Stabilize Flows? In an X post, a crypto analyst known as Milk Road revealed that the Ethereum ETFs had just printed their worst month on record since launch, which is roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, the largest single-month withdrawal that ETH has ever encountered. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows Signs Of Accumulation As CVD Strengthens And Correlation Stays Elevated Historically, ETF flow reversals tell more about liquidity pressure in the broader financial system than the long-term fundamentals of the asset itself. When redemptions spike this hard, it’s usually a sign that broader risk sentiment is cracking, not that the asset itself broke. Meanwhile, most investors don’t know that while ETFs were handing back, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) stepped in as aggressive buyers. BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) quietly added over 300,000 ETH, worth nearly $800 million at the time, to its treasuries. If the ETF outflow continues to accelerate, the near-term price action will remain choppy as liquidity gets strained at the edges. However, if DAT inflows continue scaling, it builds the foundation for a tighter supply setup into 2026. The tension between this panicked short-term selling pressure and the quiet structural long-term accumulation is the most important dynamic for positioning. Why ETH Reserves Are Becoming Strategic Corporate Assets Crypto trader Bull Theory has noted that last week, BitMine bought an astonishing 138,452 ETH, worth $437.7 million. This single transaction solidifies their position as the largest ETH treasury in the world, holding 3.86 million ETH, valued at $12.4 billion and accounting for 3.2% of the entire circulating supply. Related Reading: Here’s Why Ethereum Emerges As The Global Capital Rails For On-Chain Finance The true source of rising ETH demand is that Wall Street is quietly building on ETH. BlackRock, with $13.5 trillion AUM, has launched tokenized funds on ETH and has filed for a staked ETH ETF. JPMorgan, with $4 trillion, Deutsche Bank, with $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered, with $800 billion, are developing tokenization and DeFi infrastructure using ETH and its Layer-2 networks. Institutions like Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are all using ETH rails for custody and settlement or rollup infrastructure for scaling and security. Furthermore, large companies are now holding and staking ETH for yield. BitMine alone expects to generate $400 million+ a year in staking revenue from its position. Tom Lee believes that as staking demand grows and institutions scale tokenization increases, ETH could reach $12,000 in 2026. “A Bitcoin miner is now the largest Ethereum whale, Wall Street is building on ETH, and treasuries are shifting toward yield. ETH is quickly becoming part of the Global Financial System.” Bull Theory noted.

55584037,642582,1765346408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55584037.jpeg,Why 2026 Is Unlikely To Be Crypto’s Next Bust Year: Bitwise CIO,https://bitcoinist.com/why-2026-unlikely-crypto-next-bust-year-bitwise-cio/,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the crypto market is anchored to the wrong mental model. Speaking on the Empire podcast recorded 5 December and released on 8 December, he argued that the traditional “four-year Bitcoin cycle” has lost its explanatory power – and that 2026, which many expect to be a brutal post-halving down year, is far more likely to be an “up year” driven by institutional flows and regulatory tailwinds. “2026 will not be a bad year, Jason,” Hougan told host Jason Yanowitz. “I think 2026 will be a good year I just don’t understand the logical reason why [the four-year cycle] would repeat again. It’s not like built into a mechanical clock. It was driven by specific factors and those factors no longer exist, so it won’t keep happening.” He acknowledged that recent price action has unnerved investors, with Bitcoin giving back a “ Vanguard pump” and selling off into a weekend on no obvious news. But he framed that as positioning and microstructure, not the start of a structural unwind. “People in crypto over the last two months have learned to be nervous on weekends,” he said, pointing to thin weekend liquidity and Friday macro headlines. He noted that sentiment is depressed even though “the market is flat for the year,” adding: “We’re freaking out about a market that is flat for the year.” Why The 4-Year Crypto Cycle Is Dead Hougan broke down the four main explanations traditionally used to justify the Bitcoin cycle and argued each is now materially weaker. First is the halving itself. “The halving cycle is just not that important,” he said. “It’s half as important as it was four years ago […] a fraction of, you know, a quarter as important as it was eight years ago, a sixteenth, etc. There’s just not that much supply being removed.” As issuance becomes a smaller fraction of total supply and ETF and derivatives flows grow, the mechanical supply shock carries less weight. Second is the rate cycle. Prior “down years” such as 2018 and 2022 coincided with aggressive rate hikes. “Interest rates are going down,” he said. “So that thesis is just completely invalidated, right? It’s completely different.” Third is the “blow-up” pattern – Mt. Gox , ICOs, FTX – that historically capped euphoric phases. Hougan allowed that balance-sheet stress in parts of the market is “the strongest case for the four-year cycle repeating,” but he does not expect forced liquidations on the scale of prior collapses. In his view, potential problem entities are more likely to “just not buy as much in the future” rather than being compelled sellers. Fourth is simple randomness: three similar cycles do not make a law of nature. “Across those four, they’re all much weaker than they were in the past,” he summarised. Why 2026 Is Poised To Be Better Than 2025 Against that, Hougan set what he sees as a once-in-a-generation shift in regulation and institutional behaviour. “You have a once-in-a-generation regulatory change from severe regulatory headwinds to strong regulatory tailwinds,” he said, and “more importantly, you have this institutional adoption narrative that’s going to overwhelm everything.” In the last six months, he noted, major US wirehouses have “green-lit crypto exposure.” He singled out Bank of America : “They have $3.5 trillion in assets. One percent is $35 billion. Four percent is like $140 billion. That’s more than the total flows into Bitcoin ETFs so far.” He stressed it is not just one bank: “There are four wirehouses. They’re basically all on now […] the biggest advisory groups all managing many trillions of dollars.” The catch is timing. Institutional allocations are slow and process-driven. “The average Bitwise client, I think, invests after eight meetings with us,” he said, and some of those are quarterly. That “eight-meeting” lag means the ETF era is still in its early innings; the full impact of platforms being switched on is more likely to manifest through 2026 than in a single explosive quarter. Hougan also emphasised that advisers optimise for client retention, not absolute performance. “The one thing a financial adviser doesn’t want to do is have a meeting with their client where something is down 50% and their client fires them,” he said. That is why reduced volatility, cleaner regulation and mainstream narratives like “Bitcoin as digital gold ” and “stablecoins and tokenization as new financial rails” matter so much. On supply dynamics, he pushed back on two recurring fears: “ OG whales dumping ” and MicroStrategy as a forced seller. He argued that much of the apparent “selling” by long-term holders is actually upside being sold via covered calls. Whales come to Bitwise and similar firms, he said, saying: “I have a hundred million of Bitcoin […] can you write covered calls against this?” That “effectively introduces new supply into the market” without coins moving on-chain. On MicroStrategy, he was categorical: “From a data perspective [it is] just strictly untrue that it will be forced to sell its Bitcoin.” The company has meaningful cash to service interest, no principal due until 2027, and manageable maturities relative to its Bitcoin holdings. He agreed with Jeff Dorman’s framing that MicroStrategy is no longer a major marginal buyer but also “not a forced seller.” Too much pessimism on the timeline. Brought on @Matt_Hougan to tell us why 2026 will be FAR better than 2025. Tons of good nuggets in here related to institutions, financial advisors, cycles, and more. Enjoy the optimism! pic.twitter.com/WZJb55yENF — Yano (@JasonYanowitz) December 8, 2025 Looking ahead, Hougan expects investors to eventually reframe the current period not as a failed bull cycle but as a behavioural transition through a key level. “We might look back at 2025 at some point and say, ‘Huh, you know what? $100,000 was like a big behavioral cliff we had to get over. Took us like a year,’” he said. For 2026 specifically, his message is clear: the old four-year pattern “won’t keep happening,” and the combination of regulatory clarity and institutional inflows sets up what he calls an “extraordinarily strong” backdrop rather than a programmed bust. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.06 trillion.

55584095,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=241490,1765346412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent CBDC Ban: US Lawmaker Moves to Block Federal Reserve Digital Currency,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-lawmaker-cbdc-ban-amendment/,"BitcoinWorld Urgent CBDC Ban: US Lawmaker Moves to Block Federal Reserve Digital Currency In a bold political maneuver, a US lawmaker has launched a direct challenge to the future of digital money in America. Representative Keith Self has submitted a critical amendment aiming for a complete CBDC ban , embedding this financial fight within the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act. This move signals a deepening political battle over who controls the future of US currency. What Does This Proposed CBDC Ban Actually Do? The amendment, if passed, would create a legal firewall. It explicitly prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or launching a central bank digital currency for direct use by individuals. This isn’t just a policy suggestion; it’s an attempt to write a permanent CBDC ban into law through the powerful NDAA, which funds the entire US military. The strategy is clear: attach the controversial digital currency prohibition to a bill that Congress must pass. Therefore, lawmakers would have to vote on the defense budget and the CBDC ban as a single package, increasing its chances of success. Why Is There Such Strong Opposition to a US Digital Dollar? Proponents of the ban cite major concerns that resonate with privacy advocates and financial freedom supporters. Their core arguments include: Financial Surveillance: A digital currency could allow unprecedented government tracking of every transaction. Programmability Risks: The government could theoretically impose restrictions on how and when money is spent. Centralization of Power: It places immense monetary control directly in the hands of a central bank. Privacy Erosion: Moving away from physical cash eliminates anonymous transactions. However, supporters of a US CBDC argue it could modernize payments, increase financial inclusion for the unbanked, and help the dollar compete with digital currencies from China and other nations. The debate, therefore, pits innovation and global competitiveness against core American values of privacy and liberty. What Are the Immediate Next Steps for This CBDC Ban Proposal? The amendment’s journey is just beginning. First, it must pass the House Rules Committee, which decides what amendments get a floor vote. This is a crucial hurdle. If it clears the committee, it proceeds to a full vote in the House of Representatives. Its inclusion in the NDAA is particularly significant. Initially, House Republican leadership released a version of the defense bill without any CBDC ban language. Representative Self’s amendment forces the issue back onto the agenda, demonstrating persistent and organized opposition within Congress to a digital dollar. Could This CBDC Ban Actually Become Law? The path to becoming law is complex but possible. The amendment must survive the House, then be reconciled with the Senate’s version of the NDAA, which may not contain a similar provision. The final, decisive battle would happen in a conference committee where lawmakers from both chambers negotiate the final bill. Even if the CBDC ban fails this year, its introduction sets a powerful precedent. It mobilizes opposition, frames the public debate, and establishes a legislative blueprint for future attempts to block a Federal Reserve digital currency. The fight over a US CBDC is now officially a congressional battle. The Bottom Line: A Defining Moment for Digital Currency This proposed CBDC ban represents more than a single amendment; it is a watershed moment. It crystallizes the deep philosophical divide over the future of money. On one side is the push for technological efficiency and state-controlled financial systems. On the other is a defense of financial privacy and decentralized economic freedom. The outcome of this political clash will shape the US monetary system for decades, determining whether the digital future of the dollar is centralized or remains in the hands of its users. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the NDAA and why does it matter for a CBDC ban? The National Defense Authorization Act is the annual bill that authorizes funding for the US Department of Defense. It is considered a ‘must-pass’ piece of legislation. Attaching the CBDC ban to it is a strategic move to force a vote on the issue and increase its chances of becoming law. Who is Representative Keith Self? Keith Self is a Republican Congressman representing Texas’s 3rd congressional district. He is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and has been a vocal critic of a US central bank digital currency, framing it as an issue of government overreach and financial privacy. Has the Federal Reserve already created a CBDC? No. The Federal Reserve has only been researching the potential for a digital dollar. It has repeatedly stated that it would not proceed without clear support from the executive branch and authorizing legislation from Congress. This amendment seeks to preemptively deny that authorization. Do other countries have CBDCs? Yes. Several countries, including China with its digital yuan, have already launched or are in advanced testing phases of their own central bank digital currencies. This global shift is a key reason the US is debating the issue, with some arguing America risks falling behind. What happens if this amendment passes the House but not the Senate? If only one chamber of Congress approves the ban, it will not become law. The final NDAA bill is negotiated between the House and Senate. The CBDC ban provision would be a key point of negotiation, and could be removed, modified, or kept in the final compromise bill sent to the President. Can the President veto a CBDC ban? Yes, the President can veto any bill passed by Congress, including the NDAA. However, overriding a presidential veto requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, which is a very high bar. The political dynamics surrounding a potential veto would depend on the administration in power at the time.

This has allowed Ethereum to outpace its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, showcasing a nearly 12% recovery for the leading altcoin over the past week. ETH Grows In Demand Analysts from Bull Theory attribute this resurgence to several key factors, including significant institutional interest in Ethereum. The firm highlighted BitMine, which holds the largest public company collection of ETH, as a major player in this recovery phase. In a recent social media update on X (formerly Twitter), the analysts pointed out that demand for ETH is on the rise as Wall Street quietly builds on the Ethereum platform.

BlackRock, which manages $13.5 trillion, is launching tokenized funds and has filed for a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other notable players include JPMorgan with $4 trillion in assets, Deutsche Bank at $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered with $800 billion. These firms are developing tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure specifically on Ethereum and its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In addition, well-known financial entities such as Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, and Robinhood (HOOD) are incorporating Ethereum into their operations for functions like custody, settlement, and rollup infrastructure. As a result, these large companies are holding and staking ETH to generate yield, significantly increasing the altcoin’s demand. BitMine, for instance, anticipates earning over $400 million annually from its staking position. Could The Ethereum Price Hit $12,000? Such institutional involvement has led market experts like Tom Lee to speculate that the Ethereum price could potentially reach $12,000 by 2026, driven by growing staking demand and the scaling of tokenization efforts. Adding to the momentum, Arkham reported that Tom Lee’s Ethereum treasury firm acquired 138,452 ETH since last week, valued at approximately $431.97 million. BitMine currently holds $12.05 billion in ETH and has an additional $1 billion allocated for further purchases. Related Reading: Wall Street Giant Bernstein Predicts Bitcoin Price To Hit $1 Million By 2033 In a different development that could bolster the Ethereum price further, Chris MacDonald, an analyst for The Motley Fool, highlighted reports indicating that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed US banks can now legally conduct “riskless principal” transactions in crypto assets. The analyst asserted that this new regulatory approval may lead to an influx of capital into digital assets, which would likely benefit the Ethereum price and holders, as well as other top cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,325. Despite recent gains, the price is still nearly 33% below the all-time high of $4,946, which was reached earlier this year.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Binance Coin (BNB) stands as one of the most watched assets in the digital economy. Investors and traders are constantly asking: will BNB hit the coveted $1000 mark? This comprehensive analysis examines the factors that could drive Binance Coin price prediction models from 2025 through 2030, providing insights into potential growth trajectories and market dynamics. Understanding Binance Coin’s Current Market Position Binance Coin operates as the native token of the Binance ecosystem, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, BNB serves multiple functions including transaction fee discounts, participation in token sales, and powering the Binance Smart Chain. This utility foundation provides BNB with intrinsic value beyond speculative trading. The BNB price forecast must consider both its utility within the Binance ecosystem and its position in the broader cryptocurrency market analysis. Key Factors Influencing BNB Price Forecast Several critical elements will determine whether BNB can reach $1000 by 2030. First, the continued growth of the Binance exchange directly impacts BNB demand. As more users join the platform, the utility of BNB as an exchange token increases. Second, regulatory developments surrounding cryptocurrency exchanges globally could significantly affect Binance’s operations and, consequently, BNB’s value. Third, the expansion of the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem creates additional use cases for BNB beyond simple exchange utility. Other important considerations include: Market adoption of decentralized applications on Binance Smart Chain Competition from other exchange tokens and layer-1 blockchain platforms Overall cryptocurrency market cycles and investor sentiment Token burn mechanisms that reduce BNB supply over time Binance Coin Price Prediction: 2025 Outlook Looking toward 2025, most analysts project moderate growth for BNB assuming continued expansion of the Binance ecosystem. The BNB future value depends heavily on whether the cryptocurrency market enters another bull cycle. If historical patterns repeat, 2025 could see increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, potentially benefiting established tokens like BNB. However, increased regulatory scrutiny of centralized exchanges presents a significant challenge that could impact this cryptocurrency market analysis. Scenario 2025 Price Range Probability Bullish $800 – $950 30% Moderate $550 – $750 50% Bearish $350 – $500 20% BNB Price Forecast: 2026-2028 Projections The mid-term outlook for BNB depends on several technological and market developments. As an exchange token, BNB’s value proposition extends beyond simple price appreciation. The continued development of the Binance Smart Chain could position BNB as more than just a utility token for fee discounts. If decentralized finance and other applications gain mainstream adoption on the chain, demand for BNB could increase substantially, positively impacting the BNB price forecast. Will BNB Hit $1000? The 2030 Milestone Analysis Reaching $1000 represents approximately a 2.5x increase from current levels, assuming no major market disruptions. This Binance Coin price prediction considers both optimistic and conservative scenarios. On the optimistic side, continued growth of the Binance ecosystem, successful expansion into new markets, and increased utility through additional use cases could drive BNB to surpass $1000 well before 2030. However, this cryptocurrency market analysis must also account for potential challenges including regulatory hurdles, increased competition, and market volatility. Key milestones that could signal BNB’s path to $1000: Sustained growth in Binance exchange user base exceeding 200 million Expansion of Binance Smart Chain to host over 1,000 active dApps Successful navigation of regulatory challenges in major markets Continued token burns reducing circulating supply by 20%+ from current levels Comparative Analysis: BNB Versus Other Exchange Tokens When evaluating BNB future value, it’s essential to consider its position relative to other exchange tokens. BNB currently leads this category by market capitalization, but competitors are emerging. The success of BNB as an exchange token depends on maintaining Binance’s dominant market position while expanding utility beyond simple fee discounts. This comparative analysis suggests that BNB’s integrated ecosystem approach provides advantages over simpler exchange tokens. Risks and Challenges in BNB Price Prediction No cryptocurrency market analysis is complete without considering potential risks. For BNB, regulatory uncertainty represents the most significant challenge. As governments worldwide develop cryptocurrency regulations, centralized exchanges like Binance face increased scrutiny. Additionally, technological risks including security vulnerabilities, competition from other blockchain platforms, and market sentiment shifts could impact the BNB price forecast. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating long-term Binance Coin price prediction models. Actionable Insights for BNB Investors Based on this comprehensive analysis, investors considering BNB should focus on several key areas. First, monitor regulatory developments affecting centralized exchanges globally. Second, track adoption metrics for the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Third, pay attention to token burn rates and supply dynamics. Fourth, consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market. Finally, maintain a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio rather than concentrating heavily in any single asset, including BNB. Frequently Asked Questions What is Binance Coin (BNB)? Binance Coin is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance exchange ecosystem, created by Changpeng Zhao (CZ). It serves multiple functions including transaction fee discounts, participation in token sales, and as the native asset of the Binance Smart Chain. How does BNB differ from Bitcoin? Unlike Bitcoin, which functions primarily as digital gold and a store of value, BNB operates as a utility token within a specific ecosystem. While Bitcoin was created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralized currency, BNB serves practical functions within the Binance platform. What factors most influence BNB’s price? Key factors include Binance exchange growth, regulatory developments, Binance Smart Chain adoption, overall cryptocurrency market trends, and BNB token burn mechanisms that reduce supply over time. Is BNB a good long-term investment? As with any cryptocurrency investment, BNB carries both potential rewards and risks. Its connection to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange provides unique advantages, but regulatory challenges and market competition present significant uncertainties that investors must consider. Conclusion: The Path Forward for BNB The journey to $1000 for BNB involves navigating a complex landscape of technological innovation, regulatory developments, and market dynamics. While the potential exists for significant appreciation, particularly if the Binance ecosystem continues to expand and diversify, investors must approach BNB price predictions with balanced expectations. The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and even well-established tokens like BNB face uncertainties. A thoughtful investment strategy considers both the promising aspects of BNB’s utility-driven model and the challenges inherent in the rapidly evolving digital asset space.

The BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio serves as a powerful, real-time gauge of trader positioning and collective bias. The latest data reveals a fascinating, albeit narrow, lean towards optimism. Let’s break down what the numbers from the top exchanges truly mean for your next move. What Does the Current BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratio Tell Us? The aggregate 24-hour data paints a clear picture: the market is delicately balanced but leaning bullish. Across the three largest exchanges by open interest—Binance, OKX, and Bybit—the overall BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio shows 50.26% of positions are long, versus 49.74% short. This marginal majority suggests a cautious optimism among derivatives traders. However, the real story often lies in the details of individual platform data. Exchange-by-Exchange Breakdown: Where is Sentiment Strongest? While the overall trend is slightly bullish, sentiment varies by platform. This divergence can offer nuanced insights into different trader demographics. Binance: 50.84% long / 49.16% short. The world’s largest exchange shows a definitive, though not overwhelming, preference for long positions. OKX: 50.38% long / 49.62% short. Here, the balance is almost even, indicating highly neutral or conflicted sentiment. Bybit: 51.12% long / 48.88% short. This platform exhibits the most pronounced bullish tilt in the current BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio data. These variations remind us that trader behavior is not monolithic. A deeper look at one exchange’s data can sometimes foreshadow a broader market shift. How Can Traders Use This Long/Short Ratio Data? This metric is more than just a number; it’s a tool for strategic decision-making. A high long ratio can sometimes act as a contrarian indicator, signaling that the market might be overly optimistic and due for a correction. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could indicate pervasive fear, potentially setting the stage for a squeeze. The current data, showing a slight long bias, suggests a market that is hopeful but not yet euphoric. Therefore, savvy traders monitor trends in this BTC perpetual futures long/short ratio over time, watching for sharp divergences that often precede volatility. What Are the Risks of Relying Solely on This Metric? While invaluable, the long/short ratio is not a crystal ball. It should never be used in isolation. Consider these critical points: It reflects derivatives market sentiment, not necessarily spot market conviction. It doesn’t account for the size of positions; a few large whales can skew the data. External macro factors, like regulatory news or economic data, can instantly override technical sentiment indicators. Always combine this analysis with other on-chain metrics, price action, and fundamental news.

The platform announced it will list WET perpetual futures , opening new avenues for market participation. This contract, paired against USDT, goes live on December 10th at 7:00 a.m. UTC and supports leverage of up to 20x. For anyone involved in the WET ecosystem or crypto derivatives, this is a pivotal development worth understanding in detail. What Are WET Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? If you’re new to crypto derivatives, you might wonder what the fuss is about. A perpetual futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price, but unlike traditional futures, it has no expiry date. This allows for continuous trading. Binance listing WET perpetual futures provides several immediate benefits for the market. First, it increases liquidity for the WET token. Second, it offers traders more sophisticated tools for hedging or speculating on WET’s price movements. Finally, it signals growing institutional and retail confidence in the asset’s longevity. How Can You Trade WET Perpetual Futures on Binance? Starting December 10th, accessing this new market is straightforward. You will find the WET/USDT perpetual contract listed in the Binance Futures trading section. The exchange has set the leverage multiplier at a maximum of 20x. This means you can control a position worth 20 times your initial margin. However, while this amplifies potential gains, it also magnifies potential losses. Therefore, it’s crucial to approach leverage with a clear risk management strategy. Key steps to get started include: Ensuring your Binance account is verified and funded. Transferring funds to your Binance Futures wallet. Familiarizing yourself with the futures trading interface and order types. Setting stop-loss and take-profit orders to manage risk automatically. What Are the Key Opportunities and Risks to Consider? The introduction of WET perpetual futures creates exciting opportunities. Traders can now speculate on WET’s price direction without owning the underlying token, potentially profiting from both upward and downward moves. It also allows for more complex strategies like arbitrage. For the WET project itself, this listing on a major exchange like Binance enhances visibility and credibility. However, the 20x leverage is a double-edged sword. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, and high leverage can lead to rapid liquidation if the market moves against your position. Always trade with capital you can afford to lose. How Does This Fit Into the Broader Crypto Landscape? Binance’s decision is part of a larger trend of crypto exchanges expanding their derivatives offerings. Perpetual futures have become a cornerstone of crypto trading, offering the flexibility that traditional expiry-based contracts lack. By adding WET to its roster, Binance is responding to user demand and validating the token’s market presence. This move could potentially lead to increased trading volume and price discovery for WET, influencing its spot market dynamics as well. It’s a clear sign of the maturing infrastructure surrounding digital assets. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Traders and the WET Ecosystem In summary, the listing of WET perpetual futures on Binance is a strategic development that benefits multiple parties. It provides traders with a powerful new instrument, grants the WET project increased market exposure, and reinforces Binance’s position as a comprehensive trading hub. As with any leveraged product, education and caution are paramount. By understanding the mechanics of perpetual contracts and implementing sound risk management, traders can navigate this new opportunity effectively. The market will be watching closely when trading commences on December 10th. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When exactly will Binance list WET perpetual futures? A: The WET/USDT perpetual futures contract will be available for trading starting at 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 10. Q: What is the maximum leverage for the WET perpetual contract? A: The contract will support leverage of up to 20x on the Binance Futures platform. Q: Do I need to own WET tokens to trade WET perpetual futures? A: No. Perpetual futures are derivative contracts. You are trading a contract based on WET’s price, not the actual token. You settle in USDT. Q: What are the main risks of trading with 20x leverage? A: The primary risk is liquidation. A small price move against your position can result in the loss of your entire margin. Leverage amplifies both profits and losses. Q: How does this listing benefit the WET project? A: It increases liquidity, provides better price discovery, attracts more traders and attention, and enhances the token’s overall credibility by being listed on a major exchange’s derivatives market. Q: Where can I learn more about trading futures on Binance? A: Binance Academy offers comprehensive educational resources on futures trading, leverage, and risk management. It’s highly recommended to study these before trading. Found this guide on WET perpetual futures helpful?

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as TRX approaches the elusive $1 milestone. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding Tron price prediction trends isn’t just speculation—it’s a strategic necessity in today’s volatile crypto landscape. With blockchain technology evolving at breakneck speed and Tron’s ecosystem expanding daily, the question on everyone’s mind is clear: Can Tron reach $1 in 2025? This comprehensive analysis will explore every angle of TRX’s potential journey, giving you the insights needed to make informed decisions about one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market. Understanding Tron’s Current Market Position Tron (TRX) has established itself as a major player in the blockchain space, currently ranking among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Founded by Justin Sun in 2017, Tron aims to create a decentralized internet and has gained significant traction through its high-throughput blockchain and growing ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). The platform’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and its acquisition of BitTorrent have positioned it uniquely in the competitive smart contract platform arena. As we examine Tron price prediction models, it’s crucial to understand that TRX’s value is intrinsically tied to network adoption, developer activity, and overall market sentiment toward layer-1 blockchain solutions. Tron Price Prediction 2025: The $1 Question The possibility of Tron reaching $1 in 2025 represents a monumental psychological barrier for the cryptocurrency. Currently trading significantly below this level, TRX would need to experience substantial growth to achieve this target. Several factors could contribute to this potential breakthrough: Mass adoption of Tron’s blockchain for enterprise solutions Expansion of the TRON DAO ecosystem and developer community Increased institutional investment in cryptocurrency assets Successful implementation of major protocol upgrades Favorable regulatory developments for blockchain technology Technical analysis suggests that breaking through key resistance levels would be necessary for any sustained move toward $1. Market analysts point to historical patterns where cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals and active communities have experienced exponential growth during bull market cycles. However, achieving the $1 mark would require Tron to overcome significant supply pressure and demonstrate consistent utility growth that justifies such valuation. TRX Price Forecast 2026-2027: Beyond the Immediate Horizon Looking beyond 2025, Tron price prediction models for 2026-2027 consider longer-term technological and market developments. By this period, several key milestones could significantly impact TRX’s valuation: Year Conservative Forecast Moderate Forecast Optimistic Forecast 2026 $0.25 – $0.40 $0.40 – $0.65 $0.65 – $0.90 2027 $0.35 – $0.55 $0.55 – $0.85 $0.85 – $1.20 These projections assume continued development of Tron’s ecosystem, including potential expansion into decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and cross-chain interoperability solutions. The TRX price forecast must account for both internal platform developments and external market conditions, including potential competition from other smart contract platforms and broader economic factors affecting cryptocurrency adoption. Tron Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis and Indicators When evaluating Tron cryptocurrency potential, technical indicators provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Key metrics to monitor include: Network activity and transaction volume trends Development activity and GitHub commit frequency Social media sentiment and community engagement metrics Exchange inflow/outflow patterns indicating accumulation or distribution On-chain metrics including active addresses and token velocity Historical data shows that Tron has demonstrated resilience during market downturns while capturing significant upside during bullish periods. The platform’s consistent delivery of technological upgrades and strategic partnerships has maintained positive momentum despite broader market volatility. As with any cryptocurrency investment, understanding these technical factors is essential for developing realistic Tron price prediction expectations. Tron 2025 Market Dynamics and Competitive Landscape The year 2025 represents a critical juncture for Tron as it navigates an increasingly competitive blockchain ecosystem. Several factors will determine whether Tron can achieve its ambitious targets: Regulatory clarity across major jurisdictions Adoption of blockchain technology by traditional financial institutions Technological advancements in scalability and security User experience improvements for mainstream adoption Strategic partnerships and ecosystem expansion Tron’s unique position as an entertainment-focused blockchain gives it specific advantages in content distribution and digital rights management. However, it must continue innovating to maintain relevance against competitors like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. The Tron 2025 outlook depends heavily on execution of its roadmap and ability to capture market share in emerging blockchain use cases. Challenges and Risks in Tron Price Prediction While optimistic Tron price prediction models capture attention, responsible analysis must address significant challenges and risks: Regulatory uncertainty affecting all cryptocurrency projects Technological vulnerabilities and security concerns Competition from established and emerging blockchain platforms Market volatility and correlation with Bitcoin price movements Adoption barriers for mainstream users and enterprises These factors could substantially impact the TRX price forecast, potentially delaying or preventing achievement of price targets. Investors should maintain balanced perspectives, recognizing that cryptocurrency markets remain speculative and subject to rapid changes based on technological developments, regulatory actions, and macroeconomic conditions. Actionable Insights for Tron Investors Based on comprehensive Tron price prediction analysis, several strategic approaches emerge for investors: Dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks in volatile markets Portfolio diversification across different blockchain assets Active monitoring of Tron ecosystem developments and partnerships Technical analysis combined with fundamental research Risk management strategies including stop-loss orders Successful investment in Tron cryptocurrency requires more than just price speculation—it demands understanding of blockchain technology, market dynamics, and risk tolerance. Whether Tron reaches $1 in 2025 or follows a different trajectory, informed decision-making based on thorough research provides the best foundation for cryptocurrency investment success. Conclusion: The Future of Tron Cryptocurrency Tron’s journey toward the $1 milestone represents more than just a price target—it symbolizes the maturation of blockchain technology and its potential to transform digital ecosystems. While Tron price prediction models offer valuable guidance, they cannot guarantee specific outcomes in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. What remains certain is that Tron has established itself as a significant blockchain platform with a dedicated community and clear vision for decentralized technology. Whether you’re a seasoned cryptocurrency investor or new to blockchain technology, understanding Tron’s potential requires balancing optimism with realism, recognizing both the transformative possibilities and inherent uncertainties of this emerging asset class. The coming years will reveal whether Tron can achieve its ambitious targets, but one thing is clear: the blockchain revolution continues, and Tron intends to play a major role in shaping its future. Frequently Asked Questions Who founded Tron and what is their background? Tron was founded by Justin Sun , a Chinese entrepreneur and former representative for Ripple in Greater China. He is also the founder of the BitTorrent Foundation and has been involved in various blockchain and technology ventures. What companies are building on the Tron blockchain?

Each has different technical approaches, consensus mechanisms, and ecosystem focuses, with Tron emphasizing high throughput and entertainment applications.

A new side-by-side chart comparison reveals a strikingly close match between XRP’s current 2025 setup and its 2017 pre-rally structure. The parallels are unmistakable, identical wave patterns, a tightening consolidation zone, and the same prolonged calm that once preceded XRP’s explosive breakout. As Diana puts it, ‘Same chart. Same setup. In 2017, this exact pattern sparked one of crypto’s most explosive rallies, sending XRP soaring thousands of percent in weeks. Today, XRP mirrors that setup, this time backed by even stronger fundamentals, analysts say. Unlike 2017, Ripple now stands on solid foundations: expanded partnerships, real-world institutional adoption, robust liquidity, and a more mature regulatory landscape. With RLUSD adoption, global integrations, and potential ETF catalysts, Ripple’s growth is driven by tangible fundamentals rather than speculative hype, making many analysts confident that any repeat of history could unfold even faster. Well, the math is striking because if XRP mirrors its 2017 surge of 7,452% from the current level of $2.09, it could soar to around $155, a zone that would redefine the crypto landscape. While such gains are speculative, the alignment of a bullish fractal, stronger fundamentals, and growing market optimism has traders and long-term holders watching closely. Meanwhile, crypto never guarantees history will repeat, but when a major asset like XRP pairs proven chart patterns with real-world adoption, it demands attention. Whether or not it reaches triple-digit territory, this legendary setup has firmly returned XRP to the spotlight. Conclusion XRP’s 2025 chart mirrors the historic 2017 setup that sparked one of crypto’s most explosive rallies. Backed by stronger fundamentals, wider adoption, and rising market interest, XRP is poised for a potentially transformative move. While markets remain unpredictable, this rare alignment of technical patterns and real-world catalysts makes it a must-watch asset for traders and long-term investors aiming for high-impact opportunities.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 07:07:14

Keith Self Files Amendment to Prevent a US CBDC in Defense Bill,https://cryptonews.com/news/rep-keith-self-files-amendment-to-prevent-a-us-cbdc-in-defense-bill/,"Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas) on Tuesday introduced an amendment to the massive annual defense bill that would block the creation of a US central bank digital currency . Key Takeaways: Rep. Keith Self moved to add an anti-CBDC amendment back into the defense bill. Conservatives say GOP leaders broke a promise to include CBDC restrictions. The amendment would block a Fed digital dollar and protect cash-like privacy. Self said GOP leaders had previously promised that anti-CBDC language would be included in the legislation, but it was missing from the version released Sunday. “Promises were broken to include this language in the NDAA,” he wrote on X . “My amendment would fix the bill.” House Pushes Ahead on Defense Bill as Self Seeks to Block Fed Digital Dollar House leaders are aiming to pass the defense package on Wednesday afternoon, according to Politico, though negotiations remain fluid. Self’s proposal, titled the “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State” amendment, would bar the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or issuing a central bank digital currency, or any similar digital asset under a different name. It would also prohibit Federal Reserve banks from offering accounts or financial services directly to individuals, a move supporters say is critical to preventing government-controlled consumer banking. The amendment includes an exception for “dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private,” a carve-out aimed at ensuring paper-cash-level privacy protections. The broader defense bill, formally known as the annual authorization for Pentagon spending and policy, spans more than 3,000 pages and is typically considered one of Congress’s few must-pass measures each year. The absence of the CBDC language angered conservatives, who saw it as a retreat from earlier commitments. Self told Fox Business that House Republicans had been promised the amendment authored by Majority Whip Tom Emmer, one of Congress’s most outspoken CBDC critics. After reviewing the bill, Self said it was clear the provision had been dropped. “We have to pass an NDAA, because it’s one of the must-pass bills we have in Congress,” he said. “We’ve got to fix it and get it passed.” Conservatives were promised that language banning a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would be included in the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Unconscionably, it wasn't included. Leadership needs to fix this bill IMMEDIATELY. pic.twitter.com/r9RxsmTctk — Rep. Keith Self (@RepKeithSelf) December 8, 2025 CBDC Could Give Government Control Over Americans’ Money Several Republicans echoed his frustration. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she supports cryptocurrency but opposes any system that could allow the federal government to restrict how Americans use their money. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) warned that a CBDC would “insert the government between you and your money” and said Congress must pass a statutory ban, not rely solely on executive action. Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order barring federal agencies from issuing or promoting any form of CBDC, citing risks to privacy and national sovereignty. However, House GOP aides told The Hill that negotiations over a separate bipartisan housing package derailed efforts to include a CBDC ban in the defense bill, saying the final language “was not something that was ultimately going to be acceptable to our members.” The post Rep.

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley just made a bold declaration that could reshape your investment strategy. He predicts a major crypto bull market is on the horizon for 2026, challenging everything we thought we knew about cryptocurrency cycles. This isn’t just another price prediction—it’s a fundamental reassessment of how crypto markets mature. Let’s explore why this forecast matters and what it means for your portfolio. Why Is the 2026 Crypto Bull Market Prediction So Significant? Hunter Horsley’s forecast carries weight because it comes from a leading voice in institutional crypto investing. Bitwise manages billions in digital assets, giving Horsley a front-row seat to market movements. His prediction breaks from the traditional four-year cycle theory that many investors still follow. Instead, he argues the market has fundamentally matured. This shift means old patterns may no longer apply, requiring investors to think differently about timing and strategy. According to Horsley, we’ve actually been in a bear market since February. Corporate buying from giants like MicroStrategy created artificial upward pressure that masked the true trend. This insight is crucial because it helps explain recent market confusion. When major corporations make strategic investments, they can temporarily distort natural market cycles. However, these distortions eventually resolve, setting the stage for the next genuine growth phase. What Changed in the Crypto Market Cycle? The traditional four-year cycle tied to Bitcoin halving events might be obsolete. Horsley suggests several factors have transformed the landscape: Institutional adoption has created new buying patterns Regulatory clarity in major markets reduces uncertainty Infrastructure development makes crypto more accessible Diversified use cases beyond pure speculation These changes mean the market now responds to different drivers. While retail investors once dominated price action, institutional players now significantly influence trends. This maturation suggests the next crypto bull market could be more sustained and less volatile than previous cycles. The wild swings of early crypto years might give way to more measured, fundamental-driven growth. How Should Investors Prepare for the 2026 Bull Run? If Horsley’s prediction proves accurate, strategic preparation becomes essential. First, understand that timing matters less than position. Trying to perfectly time market bottoms often leads to missed opportunities. Instead, consider dollar-cost averaging—regular investments regardless of short-term price movements. This approach reduces risk while ensuring participation in long-term growth. Second, diversification remains crucial. While Bitcoin often leads crypto bull market cycles, other assets may offer different risk-reward profiles. Research projects with strong fundamentals, active development teams, and real-world utility. The coming years should see continued separation between serious projects and mere speculation. Finally, maintain realistic expectations. Even if a major crypto bull market arrives in 2026, markets rarely move in straight lines. Prepare for volatility along the way. Set clear investment goals and risk parameters before market excitement potentially clouds judgment. Remember that sustainable wealth building in crypto, as in traditional markets, requires discipline and patience. What Are the Potential Challenges Ahead? While the prediction offers optimism, several challenges could affect the timeline. Regulatory developments in major economies like the United States and European Union will significantly impact institutional participation. Technological hurdles around scalability and energy consumption need continued addressing. Moreover, global economic conditions always influence risk assets like cryptocurrencies. However, each challenge also represents an opportunity for market maturation. Regulatory clarity, while sometimes restrictive short-term, creates long-term stability that attracts conservative capital. Technological improvements enhance utility and efficiency. The very obstacles that concern investors today may become the foundations for tomorrow’s growth. The key is distinguishing between temporary setbacks and fundamental threats to the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investing Hunter Horsley’s 2026 crypto bull market prediction represents more than just a price forecast—it signals crypto’s evolution from niche experiment to established asset class. The broken four-year cycle suggests growing maturity, while corporate investment patterns reveal increasing mainstream acceptance. For investors, this means adapting strategies to a changing landscape where fundamentals may matter more than cyclical timing. The coming years will test whether this vision materializes. Meanwhile, staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term value creation offer the best path forward. The potential for a major crypto bull market in 2026 reminds us that despite recent volatility, the digital asset revolution continues advancing, creating opportunities for prepared investors. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a crypto bull market? A crypto bull market refers to a sustained period of rising prices across the cryptocurrency market, typically accompanied by increased investor optimism, trading volume, and media attention. Why does Hunter Horsley think the four-year cycle is over? Horsley believes institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and market maturation have fundamentally changed cryptocurrency market dynamics, making old patterns less reliable predictors. Should I invest now or wait until 2026? Most financial advisors recommend against trying to time markets perfectly. Dollar-cost averaging—investing fixed amounts regularly—often proves more effective than attempting to predict exact market bottoms or tops. What cryptocurrencies might lead the next bull market? While Bitcoin typically leads major cycles, established projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world utility often perform well during sustained bull markets. How can I protect myself if the prediction is wrong? Diversification across asset classes, clear risk management strategies, and investing only what you can afford to lose provide protection against incorrect market predictions. What signs should I watch for as 2026 approaches? Key indicators include institutional adoption rates, regulatory developments, technological advancements, trading volume patterns, and broader economic conditions affecting risk assets.

Solana has emerged as one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in recent years, capturing the attention of investors worldwide. With its lightning-fast transaction speeds and growing ecosystem, many are wondering: could SOL realistically reach $500 in the coming years? This comprehensive Solana price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive SOL’s value through 2030, providing insights for both new and experienced cryptocurrency investors. Understanding Solana’s Current Market Position Before diving into specific SOL price targets, it’s crucial to understand what makes Solana unique. Unlike many blockchain networks that struggle with scalability, Solana boasts transaction speeds of up to 65,000 per second with fees averaging just $0.00025. This technical advantage has attracted hundreds of projects to its ecosystem, from decentralized finance platforms to NFT marketplaces. The network’s Proof-of-History consensus mechanism represents a significant innovation in blockchain technology , potentially giving Solana a competitive edge as adoption increases. Key Factors Influencing Solana Price Predictions Several critical elements will determine whether Solana can achieve ambitious price targets like $500. First, network adoption continues to expand, with daily active addresses consistently numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Second, institutional interest has grown substantially, with major investment firms adding SOL to their portfolios. Third, technological developments, including the upcoming Firedancer upgrade, promise to enhance network stability and performance. Finally, broader cryptocurrency forecast trends suggest that altcoins with strong fundamentals may outperform during the next market cycle. Solana Price Prediction 2025: The Road to Recovery Looking specifically at 2025, most analysts project a bullish scenario for Solana if several conditions align. The table below summarizes key price ranges based on different market conditions: Market Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Conservative $150 – $250 Moderate adoption, stable market conditions Moderate $250 – $400 Strong ecosystem growth, institutional inflows Bullish $400 – $600 Mass adoption, technological breakthroughs, favorable regulations The $500 target falls within the bullish scenario for 2025, requiring sustained network growth and positive crypto market analysis trends. Several technical indicators suggest this is possible if Solana maintains its current trajectory of development and adoption. Solana Price Prediction 2026-2028: The Growth Phase Between 2026 and 2028, Solana’s price could experience significant volatility but potentially establish higher support levels. Key developments during this period might include: Mainstream adoption of blockchain applications built on Solana Increased institutional investment in the SOL token Technological improvements addressing previous network stability concerns Expansion into new markets and use cases beyond current applications During this phase, the SOL price could test resistance levels between $600 and $800 if the broader cryptocurrency market enters a sustained bull cycle. However, investors should remain aware of potential challenges, including regulatory developments and competition from other layer-1 blockchains. Solana Price Prediction 2030: Long-Term Vision Looking toward 2030, Solana’s price will largely depend on its ability to maintain technological leadership and ecosystem growth. Some analysts project that SOL could reach between $1,000 and $2,000 by the end of the decade if several conditions are met: Global adoption of decentralized applications reaches critical mass Solana captures significant market share in key sectors like DeFi and gaming The network demonstrates consistent reliability and security over time Blockchain technology becomes integrated into mainstream financial systems While these projections are speculative, they highlight the tremendous potential that many see in Solana’s underlying blockchain technology . The path to these price levels won’t be linear, but the fundamental case for Solana remains strong according to most cryptocurrency forecast models. What Could Derail Solana’s Growth? Despite optimistic Solana price prediction scenarios, investors must consider potential risks. Network outages in the past have raised concerns about reliability, though the development team has made significant improvements. Regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge for all cryptocurrencies, and increased competition from other scalable blockchains could pressure Solana’s market position. Additionally, broader economic factors, including interest rate changes and macroeconomic conditions, significantly influence all crypto market analysis outcomes. How Should Investors Approach SOL? For those considering adding Solana to their portfolio, several strategies can help manage risk while capturing potential upside: Dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market Allocating only a portion of your portfolio to higher-risk assets like SOL Staying informed about network developments and ecosystem growth Setting realistic profit targets and stop-loss levels based on your risk tolerance Remember that all cryptocurrency forecast models involve uncertainty, and past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. The SOL price will likely experience significant volatility regardless of long-term direction. Conclusion: Is $500 Realistic for Solana? Based on current analysis, Solana reaching $500 represents an ambitious but plausible target within the 2025-2026 timeframe. The combination of technological advantages, growing ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest creates a compelling case for SOL’s continued appreciation. However, achieving this milestone depends on multiple factors aligning favorably, including broader market conditions, regulatory developments, and successful execution of Solana’s roadmap. For investors, the key is balancing optimism about Solana’s potential with realistic risk management strategies.

Ethereum stands at a critical juncture in its evolution. As the leading smart contract platform and the foundation of decentralized finance, its price trajectory captures global attention. Investors, developers, and analysts alike are asking one burning question: Can Ethereum reach $10,000? This comprehensive Ethereum price prediction examines the factors that could propel ETH to new heights or present significant challenges through 2025, 2026, and beyond to 2030. Understanding Ethereum’s Current Market Position Before diving into future predictions, we must understand Ethereum’s present context. Ethereum remains the dominant platform for decentralized applications, hosting thousands of projects across DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. The successful transition to proof-of-stake through “The Merge” fundamentally changed Ethereum’s economic model, reducing issuance and introducing staking rewards. This shift creates a more deflationary environment for ETH, directly impacting its long-term ETH price forecast potential. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025: The Bull Case Looking toward 2025, several catalysts could drive Ethereum’s price significantly higher. The continued development of Ethereum 2.0, particularly further scalability improvements through sharding, could dramatically increase network throughput and reduce transaction costs. This would enhance Ethereum’s competitive position against layer-2 solutions and alternative blockchains. Key factors for 2025 include: Institutional adoption through ETF approvals Regulatory clarity in major markets Continued growth of DeFi and NFT ecosystems Macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin halving effects Most analysts project a Ethereum 2025 price range between $6,000 and $8,500 under favorable conditions. This represents substantial growth from current levels but falls short of the $10,000 milestone. Technical Analysis and Historical Patterns Technical analysis provides another lens for evaluating Ethereum’s potential. Historical price action shows that ETH tends to follow Bitcoin’s market cycles but with amplified volatility. The table below compares previous cycle peaks with potential future targets: Cycle Previous Peak Next Cycle Projection Growth Multiple 2017-2018 $1,400 N/A N/A 2020-2021 $4,800 N/A 3.4x 2024-2025 Projected $6,000-$8,500 1.25-1.77x 2028-2030 Projected $8,000-$12,000 1.33-1.41x These projections suggest that reaching $10,000 may require multiple market cycles and sustained adoption. Ethereum 2030: The Long-Term Vision Looking further ahead to 2030, the ETH 2030 outlook depends on Ethereum maintaining its first-mover advantage in smart contracts while successfully scaling to meet global demand. By this timeframe, several critical developments should be fully realized: Complete implementation of Ethereum 2.0 with full sharding Mass adoption of decentralized applications across industries Integration with traditional finance and global payment systems Potential regulatory frameworks supporting blockchain innovation For Ethereum $10k to become reality by 2030, Ethereum would need to achieve a market capitalization approaching $1.2 trillion. While ambitious, this represents approximately a 4x increase from previous all-time highs and aligns with the growth trajectories of other transformative technologies. Challenges and Risks to Consider No Ethereum price prediction would be complete without addressing significant challenges. Ethereum faces intense competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains offering higher throughput and lower fees. Regulatory uncertainty remains a persistent concern, particularly regarding staking, DeFi protocols, and token classification. Additionally, technological risks include potential security vulnerabilities in new consensus mechanisms and smart contracts. Other considerations include: Network congestion and high gas fees during bull markets Concentration of staked ETH among large entities Environmental concerns despite proof-of-stake transition Macroeconomic factors affecting all risk assets Expert Opinions and Market Sentiment Industry experts offer varied perspectives on Ethereum’s potential. Some analysts point to Ethereum’s strong developer community and network effects as reasons for optimism. Others caution that technological disruption could come from unexpected directions. The consensus suggests that while $10,000 is achievable within this decade, it would require nearly perfect execution and favorable market conditions. Key voices in the space emphasize different aspects: Vitalik Buterin focuses on technical scalability and decentralization Institutional analysts highlight adoption metrics and revenue potential Traders watch on-chain data and market structure developments Developers monitor ecosystem growth and innovation pace Actionable Insights for Investors Based on this ETH price forecast analysis, investors should consider several strategies. Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk in volatile markets. Diversification across crypto assets mitigates platform-specific risks. Staying informed about network upgrades and ecosystem developments provides context for price movements. Most importantly, investors should only allocate capital they can afford to lose, given cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most realistic Ethereum price prediction for 2025? Most analysts project Ethereum trading between $6,000 and $8,500 in 2025, assuming continued adoption and favorable market conditions. Who created Ethereum and how does this affect its future? Ethereum was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin along with other developers. Buterin’s continued involvement and vision for Ethereum 2.0 significantly influence its development roadmap. What companies are building on Ethereum that could drive its price? Major organizations building on Ethereum include ConsenSys , Coinbase through its Base network, and numerous DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Aave . How does Ethereum compare to Bitcoin in long-term potential? While Bitcoin serves primarily as digital gold and a store of value, Ethereum functions as a programmable platform for decentralized applications, giving it different growth drivers and risk profiles. What are the biggest threats to Ethereum reaching $10,000? Primary threats include regulatory crackdowns, successful competition from alternative blockchains, technological failures in scaling solutions, and prolonged bear markets in cryptocurrency. Conclusion: The Path to $10,000 Ethereum’s journey to $10,000 represents both an ambitious price target and a symbolic milestone for blockchain adoption. Our analysis suggests this achievement is possible by 2030 but not guaranteed. The path requires successful execution of Ethereum’s technical roadmap, sustained ecosystem growth, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. While short-term volatility will continue, Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition as the leading smart contract platform provides a strong foundation for long-term appreciation. The coming years will test whether Ethereum can scale to meet global demand while maintaining its decentralized principles.

That future is arriving now. Blockchain infrastructure developer FANC is making a pivotal move by shifting security focus from vulnerable exchanges directly to your personal wallet with its groundbreaking Quantum Wallet . This initiative responds directly to recent high-profile hacks in South Korea and the looming threat of quantum computing. Why is Wallet-Centric Security the Ultimate Game-Changer? For years, the mantra has been “not your keys, not your crypto,” highlighting the risks of leaving assets on exchanges. Recent attacks on major platforms like Upbit and Coupang have proven this point. FANC’s strategy flips the script. Instead of relying on a central entity’s security, the Quantum Wallet empowers you. It places cutting-edge, quantum-resistant protection directly in your hands. This is a fundamental shift from trusting a third party to trusting impregnable, personal technology. What Makes the Quantum Wallet So Powerful? The core of this innovation is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), technology transferred from South Korea’s prestigious Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI). But what does that mean for you? Quantum-Resistant Design: Every process—from creation to signing transactions—uses PQC algorithms built to withstand attacks from future quantum computers. Direct Implementation: The security is applied at the wallet level itself, not as an add-on layer. Proactive Defense: It solves tomorrow’s security problem today, before quantum computers become a commercial threat. This approach ensures that the Quantum Wallet isn’t just another digital wallet; it’s a fortress designed for the next era of computing. How Will the Quantum Wallet Roll Out and Expand? FANC has a clear, phased plan for deployment. The Quantum Wallet won’t launch in isolation. Its integration will be strategic and expansive. Initial Ecosystem: First implementation will occur within FANC’s own ecosystem and the Celebe platform, serving as a controlled proving ground. Broader Integration: The roadmap includes expanding to external services and enabling secure payments on partner platforms. User-Centric Growth: This phased approach allows for refinement based on real-world use before wide-scale adoption. Therefore, the wallet is designed to grow from a specialized tool into a widely-used standard for secure crypto transactions. What Are the Real-World Benefits for Crypto Users? Moving to a wallet-centric security model with a tool like the Quantum Wallet offers tangible advantages. You gain unparalleled control and peace of mind. Your assets are protected by the most advanced cryptography available, directly on your device. Moreover, it reduces systemic risk. Even if a major exchange is compromised, assets in properly secured individual wallets remain safe. This model champions true decentralization and personal sovereignty, which are the original promises of blockchain technology. Conclusion: Securing the Future, One Wallet at a Time FANC’s development of the Quantum Wallet represents more than a product launch; it signals a necessary evolution in cryptocurrency security philosophy. By proactively addressing quantum threats and decentralizing security, FANC is not just solving for today’s hacks but fortifying the entire ecosystem for tomorrow’s challenges. This wallet-centric approach could very well set the new gold standard, making personal custody both the safest and most sensible choice for every crypto holder. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)? Post-Quantum Cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. Traditional encryption, like RSA, could be broken by quantum machines, but PQC algorithms are built to resist this. When will the Quantum Wallet be available? FANC has announced the development plan and the technology transfer from ETRI. While a specific public launch date isn’t provided, the initial rollout will be within the FANC and Celebe ecosystems first. Do I need a quantum computer to use the Quantum Wallet? No, you do not. The Quantum Wallet uses PQC algorithms to protect against future quantum computers, but it functions on standard devices like smartphones and computers today. How is this different from a hardware wallet? A hardware wallet stores private keys offline on a physical device. The Quantum Wallet focuses on the type of cryptography used (PQC). It could potentially be implemented in various forms, including software or hardware, but its defining feature is its quantum-resistant code. Will this wallet work with Bitcoin and Ethereum? The announcement states plans for integration with external services. While initial focus is on FANC’s ecosystem, the goal is to expand, which likely includes compatibility with major blockchain networks. Is wallet-centric security safer than exchange security? In principle, yes. Wallet-centric security gives you direct control, eliminating the “single point of failure” risk of a centralized exchange. However, it also places the responsibility for safeguarding private keys entirely on the user. Found this insight into the future of crypto security valuable?

The attention on the market is also focused on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With the current price at just $0.035 and with presale and adoption soaring, MUTM is now hot as the best crypto to buy now thanks to its highly functional DeFi crypto model and aggressive presale. Given that its V1 DeFi model for credit and lending infrastructure is scheduled for Q4 this year, investment is now flowing to Mutuum Finance offering investors a newly emerging project with a radically higher potential for growth than more advanced networks such as Solana. Solana Stumbles as Key Support Levels Collapse The current fall from the $144 zone for Solana is evidence of the sudden loss of bullish strength and the existence of a lower high with each successive rally. However, the game-changer here was the fall below the crucial support zone at $136-$138 that acted as a strong barrier on multiple previous attempts. Once this support is breached, there is seamless room for the fall to continue with no supporting structure underneath to stall this fall. However, while Solana is finding it hard to rebuild strength again, investment attention among supporters seeking more attractive potential is slowly focusing on other emerging platforms such as Mutuum Finance, the DeFi crypto gaining massive traction. Why MUTM is a Must-Watch DeFi Crypto Mutuum Finance is turning out to be the best crypto to buy now. With a staggering number of token holders at 18,400 and current pricing at $0.035 in Phase 6, with a growth rate of 250% from Phase 1, investors seem to be getting great initial returns. As the presale approaches the end of Phase 6, this is the final stage for investment prior to pricing at $0.04 in Phase 7. With the expected listing price set at $0.06, presale participants could realistically look forward to growth possibilities above 500% from presale alone. With excellent presale activity and extremely high demand for tokens, MUTM is one DeFi crypto to watch closely. Drawing Parallels to Solana’s Historic Rally Buying MUTM at the current rate of $0.035 is much like investing in Solana (SOL) back in 2021 at $1.50. Solana went on to reach an all-time high of $256, resulting in a return on investment of a staggering 17,100%. If MUTM undergoes a similar process, its token may be worth more than $5. Investors may see life-changing growth, with the emphasis on the benefit of investing during the presale at this time. The lending and borrowing structure of Mutuum Finance is under audit by a third-party company known as Halborn Security. This process is for testing the final software product for its validity in terms of having proper functionality and system integrity and the safety and security of funds for the users. It is a great indicator for MUTM that it is taking great strides to ensure its integrity and reliability within its ecosystem and thus building trust among investors as a new form of DeFi crypto with actual usability. Solana is having difficulty building momentum again, while Mutuum Finance provides a low barrier and high utility DeFi crypto play. Phase 6 at $0.035 is close to being sold out with over 18,400+ supporters and $19.25 million raised. Join now before Phase 7 at $0.04 for exposure to the additional facets of DeFi with potential ROI above 500%. It is for this reason that MUTM is the best crypto to buy now for any trader seeking high potential ROI within this current market.

The Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF fund will also hold short-term U.S. Treasuries during the day, mirroring BTC’s overnight return profile for U.S. investors. According to the filing, Tidal’s AfterDark ETF will not hold Bitcoin as the primary asset, but track the coin’s performance by investing in spot BTC ETFs, futures contracts, and options on indices. The company describes itself as a white label ETF solutions provider, with its filing prominently featuring an image for XFunds by Nicholas Wealth. Meanwhile, the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF’s investment goal is to seek long-term capital appreciation. The fund will obtain BTC exposure through investment in Bitcoin Futures, U.S.-listed ETPs and/or ETFs, and Bitcoin Options. However, neither the U.S. SEC nor the CFTC has approved or disapproved of these securities. Balchunas agrees that most BTC gains are typically after hours BITCOIN AFTER DARK: new filing for an ETF that will only hold bitcoin at night, buying it when the US market closes and selling it when it opens. pic.twitter.com/0RrQTuP21t — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 9, 2025 Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst Eric Blachunas said he and other analysts looked at the idea last year and found that most Bitcoin gains occur after hours. He believes that the Bitcoin AfterDark ETF will yield better returns, although he notes that this will have to wait until the actual ETF begins trading. Meanwhile, the fund will represent one of the most unusual timing-based strategies yet seen in the BTC ETF ecosystem. Balchunas notes that the fund will hold BTC exclusively during overnight trading, then exit positions before the U.S. market opens. Several analyses in the past have revealed the disproportionate upside that occurs when U.S. equity markets go offline. The analyses particularly highlight the periods of overlap between Asia and Europe when crypto liquidity remains active. Additionally, the overnight behavior of BTC prices is now influential enough to impact the design of ETFs. Specialized BTC products, such as the proposed AfterDark BTC ETF, signal a maturing institutional market rather than plain speculation. Meanwhile, data retrieved from SoSoValue on December 9 shows that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a net inflow of over $150 million despite an outflow of about $136 million from BlackRock’s IBIT. Fidelity’s FBTC led with inflows of roughly $190 million, while Grascale’s GBTC experienced its first positive flow since November 22 at $17.5 million. The cumulative total net inflow as of December 9 was $ 57.71 billion, bringing the total net assets to $122.1 billion (+6.57%). Tidal’s U.S. SEC filing breaks down principal investment risks According to the filing, an investment in the fund, like any other investment, entails risks. The fund may not achieve its investment goal, and there is a risk that investors could lose all or part of their investments in the fund. The fund’s indirect investment in BTC exposes it to the unique risks associated with the coin’s volatility, which is influenced by changes in the Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Some or all of these risks may also adversely affect the fund’s net asset value (NAV) per share, trading price, total return, yield, and/or its ability to meet its objectives. The adoption and use of other blockchains, which support advanced applications such as smart contracts, also present challenges to Bitcoin’s dominance, potentially impacting its long-term relevance and utility. The development and use of Layer 2 solutions are also crucial for the functionality and scalability of Bitcoin, but they introduce risks, such as off-chain transaction execution, which could compromise security and transparency. Derivatives risk, counterparty risk, underlying fund risk, and non-diversification risk are the other types of risks identified in the Tidal Trust II U.S. SEC filing. The AfterDark ETF is also expected to face risks associated with ETFs, regulated investment company tax risk, and new fund risk, among others. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Their 2026 Outlook: RESTRUCTURING report argues that new U.S. regulations are not just rules—they are the blueprint for a complete market overhaul. This shift moves crypto beyond speculation and into a phase of tangible, real-world utility. Let’s explore why 2026 is being dubbed the year of crypto restructuring and what it means for investors and builders. Why Is 2026 the Year of Crypto Restructuring? Four Pillars CEO Steve Kim points to a pivotal change: the formal integration of crypto into the U.S. institutional framework. The passage of the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts provided the regulatory clarity that was missing for years. This clarity acts as a catalyst. It allows traditional finance to engage confidently, forcing the crypto sector to mature. The market is now reorganizing its very structure around sustainable use cases, not just hype. This foundational shift is the core of the predicted crypto restructuring . What Are the Key Drivers of This Transformation? The report highlights several interconnected trends that will define the coming year. These are not isolated developments but parts of a larger, cohesive movement toward a more mature ecosystem. Real-World Asset Tokenization: Expect significant growth in tokenizing stocks and other traditional assets, bridging old and new finance. AI-Powered Investing: Automated, AI-based investment platforms will become more sophisticated, managing crypto portfolios with greater efficiency. The Evolution of Exchanges: Centralized exchanges will adapt, while DeFi services become seamlessly integrated into everyday applications. This crypto restructuring focuses on building practical infrastructure that serves actual economic activity. How Will Technology Mature During This Phase? Beyond financial products, the underlying technology stack will see critical advancements. The report emphasizes the maturation of smart contract platforms beyond simple transactions. Furthermore, decentralized storage solutions will grow, addressing critical data sovereignty needs. On the Ethereum front, developments in Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (ZKVM) and proof markets will enhance scalability and privacy. These technical leaps provide the necessary tools for the broader market crypto restructuring to succeed. What Does Restructuring Mean for the Average User? For users, this shift translates to better, safer, and more useful products. Imagine using a “super-app” powered by a stablecoin like USDT for payments, investing, and loans all in one place. Prediction markets will become more data-driven, offering clearer insights. Abstraction stacks will hide blockchain complexity, making interactions seamless. The entire experience will feel less like navigating a frontier and more like using refined digital tools. This user-centric focus is the ultimate goal of the crypto restructuring . Conclusion: A Foundation for the Future The 2026 forecast from Four Pillars paints a picture of a market moving from adolescence to adulthood. The crypto restructuring is a necessary, albeit challenging, process. It is driven by regulation, built on technological progress, and aimed at creating real utility. While volatility may remain, the underlying direction is toward stability, integration, and tangible value creation. This restructuring lays the foundation for the next decade of blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does “crypto restructuring” mean? It refers to the cryptocurrency market reorganizing its fundamental structure, shifting focus from speculative trading to building sustainable, real-world applications and integrating with traditional finance. What triggered this predicted restructuring? The main trigger is regulatory clarity from new U.S. laws like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, which give institutions the confidence to participate and build. How will AI affect crypto investing? AI will power more automated and sophisticated investment platforms, analyzing vast amounts of data to manage risk and optimize crypto portfolios with minimal human intervention. What is a USDT super-app? It’s a hypothetical all-in-one application where the USDT stablecoin is used for various financial services like payments, trading, lending, and more within a single interface. Is this restructuring good for Bitcoin and Ethereum? Generally, yes. A more mature, regulated, and utility-driven ecosystem increases overall legitimacy and can drive adoption for major assets, though it also increases competition from new use cases.

The article stipulates a fine of $1,650 to $8,250 for violators or imprisonment from two to five years. However, for the illegal use of power for crypto mining on an “especially large scale,” the prison term is from five to eight years, per a local media report . On December 3, members of the Tajik parliament reviewed and adopted the amendments to the Criminal Code, presented by Attorney General Khabibullo Vokhidzoda. Counsel Vokhidzoda also warned that electricity theft by crypto miners in several cities has already contributed to regional power outages. “The illegal circulation of virtual assets facilitates a number of crimes, such as the theft of electricity, material damage to the state, money laundering, and other offences,” Vokhidzoda said. He previously flagged damages from illegal mining operations, causing 32 million somoni (nearly $3.52 million), which led to four to five criminal cases, according to The Diplomat . Tajikistan Reports Winter Power Shortages The Central Asian nation, which sources nearly 95% of its electricity from hydropower , is grappling with winter power pressures with low reservoir and river flows. Besides, following China’s crypto mining ban in 2021, many operators, including those from Russia, moved to Central Asia, attracted by low energy costs and relaxed regulation. As of August 2025, Tajikistan has been pursuing 190 criminal cases related to the illegal use of electricity. Further, the Diplomat report added that these cases involved 3,988 individuals who allegedly caused damages worth $4.26 million. MP Shukhrat Ganizoda emphasized that miners connect thousands of ASIC crypto mining devices to Tajikistan’s power grid. “Those committing such crimes seek to use electricity without meters or through other illegal means to produce such assets,” he explained. Criminal Code Amendments Prevent Crypto Tax Violations According to Shukhrat Ganizoda, the new legislation aims to prevent tax evasion schemes and unauthorized electronic encryption. Additionally, the revisions will also deter attempts to circumvent commodity tracking systems. The bill will be effective after President Emomali Rahmon signs it into law.

The New York listing follows this year’s substantial share gain, which was driven by increased demand for high-bandwidth memory chips and the resurgence of support for South Korea’s corporate governance changes. The company stated that it is considering several ways to increase shareholder value, including listing on the U.S. stock market through the issuance of treasury shares, although no decisions have been made yet. SK Hynix announced that it will make another announcement after the details are finalized within a month. SK Hynix considers a U.S. listing as shares soar The AI memory chipmaker stated that it was considering listing its Treasury shares as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which are securities traded on a U.S. market that reflect foreign stock. Douglas Kim, an equity research analyst affiliated with Smartkarma, claimed that the valuation difference between SK Hynix and other listed peers (such as Micron and TSMC) could be narrowed by listing its shares as ADRs (American depositary receipts). He added that the listing of ADRs could attract capital from passive funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and long-only funds that solely invest in US-listed equities. The AI memory chipmaker announcement came after a report by the Korea Economic Daily on Tuesday. The newspaper reported that the company had received offers from multiple investment banks to list approximately 17.4 million shares, or 2.4% of its outstanding shares, as ARDs. SK Hynix shares increased by as much as 4.8% in early Seoul trade on Wednesday. The SK Hynix stock has risen by almost 240% so far this year, driven by strong demand for high-bandwidth memory devices, which is fueling the growth of artificial intelligence. Additionally, it has benefited from South Korea’s continuous efforts to increase company value and enhance governance. On-chain data from Google Finance revealed that SK Hynix Inc. shares closed at $402.87, up 4.77%, from the previous session’s close of $384.36. Throughout the day, the stock traded between $385.55 and $402.87. SK Hynix’s share price is currently near the top of its 52-week range, from $110.82 to $439.46, with a market capitalization of $292.66 billion. SK Hynix reports record Q3 earnings, AI spending On October 29, SK Hynix reported revenues of $16.66 billion, operating profit of $7.75 billion (with an operating margin of 47%), and net profit of $8.58 billion (with a net margin of 52%). The semiconductor firm stated that it achieved its best-ever quarterly performance, driven by a full-scale increase in DRAM and NAND costs, as well as growing sales of high-performance products for AI servers. The tech company announced that for the first time in its history, operating profit had surpassed $6.8 billion. According to SK Hynix, shipments of high-capacity DDR5s with 128GB capacity doubled from the previous quarter, driven by increasing demand for AI servers. The fraction of AI server eSSD in NAND, which is more expensive, also increased dramatically. The company’s cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter totaled $18.97 billion, representing a $7.41 billion increase from the previous quarter. The semiconductor firm stated that it was able to successfully transition to a net cash position of $2.58 billion, while its interest-bearing debt stood at $16.39 billion. In August, the Korean Times news outlet reported that the Korean government proposed spending $6.87 billion on AI projects in 2026, which is more than three times the $2.24 billion allotted for 2025. The anticipated expenditure aligns with President Lee Jae-myung’s goal of making Korea one of the world’s top three AI superpowers, alongside the U.S. and China. According to the news outlet, the record-high $495.04 billion budget for 2026, which includes $6.87 billion, is expected to increase the national debt-to-GDP ratio to 51.6 percent. The ratio represents an 8.1 percent increase from 2025. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This isn’t a dystopian fiction plot; it’s a genuine concern raised by the International Monetary Fund. In a stark report, the IMF has issued a warning that dollar stablecoins could pose a significant threat to the economic sovereignty of emerging markets. Let’s unpack this critical development and understand why global financial watchdogs are sounding the alarm. What Exactly Are Dollar Stablecoins? Before we dive into the warning, let’s clarify the subject. Dollar stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to the US dollar. Think of them as digital tokens that mirror the value of the dollar, offering the speed and borderless nature of crypto with the price stability of traditional fiat. Popular examples include USDT (Tether) and USDC (USD Coin). Their rise has been meteoric, but now, regulators are scrutinizing their broader impact. How Could Dollar Stablecoins Threaten Sovereignty? The IMF’s concern centers on a powerful one-two punch against emerging economies. First, these digital assets can effortlessly bypass national capital controls . Governments often use these controls to manage the flow of money in and out of their country to stabilize their economy. Dollar stablecoins create a parallel financial system where capital can move without permission. Second, and perhaps more dangerously, they can trigger currency substitution . In countries battling high inflation or volatile local currencies, citizens might naturally gravitate towards holding dollar stablecoins . Why keep savings in a currency losing value daily when you can hold a digital dollar? This mass adoption weakens the central bank’s fundamental tools: Monetary Policy Control: Central banks lose influence over interest rates and money supply. Seigniorage Revenue: Governments lose income earned by issuing currency. Lender of Last Resort: The ability to act as a financial backstop in crises is compromised. Is the Threat Real or Just Theoretical? Here’s where the debate gets interesting. The IMF paints a concerning picture of potential capital flight during market panics, where dollar stablecoins could provide an express lane for money to leave a struggling economy. However, some financial experts push back, arguing the current impact is minimal. Their counterpoint is grounded in scale. The share of global foreign exchange flows currently handled by stablecoins remains tiny. Therefore, their ability to move the needle on major emerging market currencies today is limited. This perspective suggests we are looking at a future risk rather than a present crisis. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation? The IMF’s warning is a clear signal to policymakers worldwide. It underscores the urgent need for a coherent global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, especially dollar stablecoins . The report will likely fuel calls for: Stricter Licensing: For issuers of significant stablecoins . Transparency Mandates: Requiring full, real-time reserve backing disclosures. International Cooperation: To prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent rules. For emerging markets, the path forward involves a delicate balance. They must innovate and potentially explore their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to stay relevant, while also protecting their monetary independence from external digital dollar dominance. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Global Finance The IMF’s analysis is a crucial wake-up call. While the immediate, systemic threat from dollar stablecoins might be debated, the long-term implications for monetary sovereignty are undeniable. This isn’t just about cryptocurrency volatility; it’s about the fundamental architecture of global power and who controls the money. The conversation has moved from niche tech forums to the highest levels of international finance, and the decisions made next will shape economies for decades. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a dollar stablecoin? A dollar stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the US dollar. It combines the stability of the dollar with the digital, borderless features of blockchain technology. Why is the IMF worried about them? The IMF is concerned that in emerging markets with weak currencies, people might prefer using dollar stablecoins. This could undermine the local central bank’s control over the economy and bypass important financial safeguards. Are stablecoins causing problems right now? Most experts agree the current direct impact on national economies is small because the total value of stablecoin flows is still minor compared to traditional forex markets. The IMF’s warning is largely about future risks. What can governments do about this threat? Governments can work on creating clear regulations for stablecoin issuers, improve their own digital payment systems, and explore issuing their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to offer a credible digital alternative. Should people in emerging markets avoid stablecoins? It depends on individual circumstances. While they offer a hedge against local inflation, users should be aware of the regulatory uncertainty and potential risks associated with the companies that issue these stablecoins. What is currency substitution? Currency substitution, or ‘dollarization,’ happens when people in a country use a foreign currency (or a digital version of it) instead of their own national money for savings and transactions, weakening the local economy.

Swapper Finance Launches Direct Deposits With Chainlink, Mastercard On Tuesday, Swapper Finance, a next-generation payments infrastructure layer that connects global users to on-chain applications, announced the launch of Direct Deposits in collaboration with Chainlink, Mastercard, and multiple key partners. Direct Deposits, which are live now, are set to bring “the global payments world directly into the on-chain economy through a unified, secure, and compliant flow,” powered by Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) and Mastercard’s recognized global network. According to the announcement, users will be able to deposit into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols using payment cards, crypto transfers, or Web3 wallets inside a single, end-to-end on-chain workflow for the first time. Swapper’s Direct Deposits aim to unlock instant access to DeFi for billions of people worldwide by eliminating traditional bottlenecks, exchanges, and multi-step onboarding. This has historically required stitching together isolated systems, including Know Your Client (KYC) requirements, compliance, card payments, fiat conversion, settlement, and liquidity routing, which has created friction, high drop-off rates, and inconsistent security across the process. Direct Deposits are set to replace this old-fashioned flow through one “unified, verifiable, on-chain orchestration layer,” with every component of the process executed inside a secure on-chain environment. Roman Tirone, Senior Manager, Chainlink Build at Chainlink Labs, affirmed that “by unifying identity, compliance, token swaps, settlement, and more in a single orchestration layer, CRE is enabling the onboarding of billions of cardholders into the onchain economy.” This creates a simple and familiar checkout experience that quickly moves a user from traditional finance to on-chain, supported by institutional-grade security and global reach. Meanwhile, the launch represents another step in Mastercard’s efforts to integrate traditional payment infrastructure with blockchain-based applications, helping it expand its digital asset strategy. ‘The Onboarding Layer For Web3’ Swapper’s launch will see multiple leading Web3 platforms integrate the Direct Deposits technology directly into their user flows, including Pi Squared, Stake.link, KyberSwap, AITECH, NPC, Teneo, BigWater, Rhuna, TrebleSwap, MyStandard, Landwolf, Dolomite, HyperSwap, Turbo, APU, and Radiant Capital, among others. This signals strong demand for a unified card-to-on-chain standard, the announcement added, which suggests that Direct Deposits “are quickly becoming a foundational component for user acquisition across Web3.” The launch also represents “deep technical collaboration across Mastercard, Chainlink, Swapper Finance, and key partners” to bring together payment authorization, compliance, execution, and liquidity routing in a single verifiable workflow powered by CRE and Swapper Finance. Arthur, CTO of Swapper Finance, affirmed that “this is the onboarding layer we always believed the industry needed,” adding that Direct Deposits represent a “turning point” for how people enter the space as “the first truly unified onboarding layer for Web3.” “Our goal has always been to remove the barriers that keep billions of people from accessing DeFi, and with this launch, that future becomes real,” Arthur stated, concluding that “Direct Deposits represent a turning point for how people enter Web3. For the first time, the process feels intuitive rather than intimidating. We expect this launch to dramatically expand the number of users who can participate in onchain markets.”",Crypto News|chainlink|Chainlink labs|Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)|Direct Deposits|LINK|LINKUSDT|Mastercard|Swapper Direct Deposits|Swapper Finance|Web3|Web3 economy,EN,0,0,FIAT|LINK|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-10 08:00:27

Standard Chartered Downgrades Bitcoin Price Predictions In a note shared on X by VanEck head of research Matthew Sigel, Standard Chartered argues that Bitcoin’s traditional halving cycle has been overtaken by ETF-driven flows. The bank writes: “With the advent of ETF buying, we think the BTC halving cycle is no longer a relevant price driver. The logic in previous cycles (when US ETFs did not exist) – i.e., prices would peak about 18 months after each halving and decline thereafter – is no longer valid, in our view.” The report adds that it will “take a break of the current all-time high ($ 126,000 on 6 October 2025) to prove that; we expect this to happen in H1-2026.” Related Reading: Bitcoin In An Opportunity Zone? Hash Ribbons Flash New Buy Signal Alongside that shift in framework, the bank re-profiled its multi-year Bitcoin targets. According to the figures shared by Sigel, Standard Chartered has lowered its 2025 forecast from $200,000 to $100,000, its 2026 target from $300,000 to $150,000, its 2027 projection from $400,000 to $225,000, its 2028 estimate from $500,000 to $300,000, and its 2029 prediction from $500,000 to $400,000 while keeping a $500,000 target for 2030. Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research, characterises the recent drawdown as painful but not structural. He describes the current phase as “a cold breeze,” explicitly rejecting the notion of a new crypto winter and noting that the magnitude of the pullback remains consistent with corrections seen in past bull cycles. At the same time, he points out that weaker valuations for listed Bitcoin treasury companies have curtailed their ability to act as major marginal buyers, leaving spot ETFs as the primary driver of near-term gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $50 Million By 2041, Says EMJ Capital CEO Wall Street Giant Bernstein Agrees The downgrade also lands in the context of a broader rethink on Wall Street. One day earlier, on December 8, Sigel shared a separate note from Bernstein that reached a similar conclusion about Bitcoin’s market structure. Bernstein wrote that “the Bitcoin cycle has broken the 4-year pattern (cycle peaking every 4 years) and is now in an elongated bull-cycle with more sticky institutional buying offsetting any retail panic selling.” Despite an approximately 30% correction, the firm notes that “we have seen less than 5% outflows via ETFs.” On that basis, Bernstein now moves its 2026 Bitcoin price target to $150,000, sees the cycle “potentially peaking in 2027E at $200,000,” and keeps its long-term 2033 target at roughly $1,000,000 per BTC. Both Standard Chartered and Bernstein are converging on the same structural message: the halving alone no longer explains Bitcoin’s trajectory. ETF flows, institutional positioning and balance-sheet dynamics are now the core variables, even if their precise price targets and timelines diverge. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $92,686.

At the heart of CARV’s AI Being roadmap is a new class of agents, AI-powered digital extensions of individuals, anchored in verifiable identity and private context. To bridge the Social and Economic Ledgers that have long operated in silos, CARV introduces Cashie : a programmable on-chain layer turning real social engagement into verifiable economic activity. No longer just a social payment tool, Cashie is evolving into a core protocol for trustless coordination between influence and value. As part of CARV’s broader modular agentic infrastructure, alongside CARV ID ( ERC-7231 ), Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Shielded Mind update, Cashie's integration with x402 protocol transforms social engagement into verifiable, automated, and privacy-preserving on-chain rewards, pushing the boundaries and limits of the creator economy, turning social capital into on-chain value. How Cashie 2.0 Works: The Three-Pillar Bridge Cashie 2.0 is architected around three foundational pillars: 1. x402 Payment: 'The Pledge' Cashie campaigns begin with a single ERC-3009 signature, where a project or KOL pledges funds to a campaign. This is the ""X-Payment"" proof, and it's verified on-chain. No gas. No manual transfer. It ensures that funds are committed and can be distributed autonomously. 2. CARV ID: 'The Proof' How to reward a retweet or any other engagements? Traditional wallets don’t recognize @handles on social media. Cashie solves this with CARV ID, which maps social actions (like a retweet from @user) to on-chain identities (0xABC). This is the identity oracle that connects the Social Ledger to the Economic Ledger. 3. ERC-8004 Agent: 'The Executor' Cashie isn’t a monolithic bot. It’s an AI-powered agent built with modular tools: A Payment Tool to verify and move funds A Twitter Tool to monitor and analyze social activity A Raffle/Quest Tool to select winners or check completions A Distribution Tool to deliver on-chain rewards All of this happens trustlessly and autonomously, removing manual ops and Sybil vectors. The Developer Breakthrough: Powering the Agents-to-Agents Economy To unlock the full potential of sovereign AI Beings and decentralized coordination, infrastructure must evolve, quietly but radically. While the spotlight shines on AI agents and social campaigns, it’s the innovation under the hood that makes everything work. With Cashie 2.0, CARV introduces a new kind of developer stack: one that’s not just programmable, but agent-native. The CARV x402 Facilitator: Enhancing the Protocol Every action in Cashie starts with a cryptographic promise, but verification is what makes it trustworthy. To enable secure, gasless campaigns at scale, the company built the CARV x402 Facilitator: a high-performance verifier that adds state and nonce tracking to reject replayed signatures instantly, preventing duplicate settlements before gas is spent. CARV is opening its facilitator endpoints for any developer on Base to build their own x402-powered applications. Developers can start building against their live endpoints today: A stateless endpoint to validate an x402 paymentPayload (ERC-3009 signature): https://interface.carv.io/cashie/protocol/verify A stateful endpoint that verifies and executes the on-chain settlement: https://interface.carv.io/cashie/protocol/settle The AI-Native API: Agents Hiring Agents via x402 True to the ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents) vision, Cashie 2.0 is not just a platform; it's a programmable tool for other AI agents. CARV are exposing an AI-native HTTP API that fully implements the x402 protocol. This means another AI agent (from Virtual, Base, or anywhere else) can now programmatically hire Cashie to run a campaign. An agent can call the API, receive a 402 Payment Required challenge, and then resubmit its request with its own X-Payment proof to autonomously fund and launch the entire operation. This is agent-to-agent social commerce in action. Universal ERC-20 Support via TxHash Verification Web3 is fragmented by token standards. Not every ERC-20 supports gasless approvals or signature-based authorizations. But Cashie was designed for inclusivity. CARV built Cashie for the entire Base ecosystem, not just for tokens with ERC-3009 support. The platform includes a separate, robust txhash-based verification API. This internal capability will allow any project to sponsor a campaign with their own (and any) native ERC-20 token, even if it doesn't support permit or authorization. The sponsor simply sends a standard on-chain transfer and provides the txHash as proof. CARV's system handles secure, on-chain verification and replay protection, making Cashie the most flexible and inclusive social-growth engine on Base, with a clear roadmap to open this universal token support to all builders. What This Means for Users and Developers Cashie introduces a new way to engage and earn. Users can receive crypto rewards directly through social actions like retweets or quests, without wallet submission required, with CARV ID ensuring verified ownership and privacy preserved. For developers, Cashie becomes a programmable growth layer where automated campaigns, bounties, and agent-driven incentives can be built without manual wallet collection, enabling new composable experiences across social and onchain environments. To encourage adoption, CARV launches Cashie 2.0 Creator Campaign with a $45,000 prize pool to incentivize creators and participants. Through this campaign, the Creators (e.g., KOLs and projects) can configure a reward pool, duration, eligibility logic, and then publish a campaign link via a single social post. Read more about this campaign in this link . What’s Next Cashie is already driving early campaigns across the Base ecosystem, but this is only the beginning. With upcoming support for self-hosted x402 facilitators, AI-powered campaign agents, and enterprise-grade SDKs for social growth, Cashie will evolve into the coordination engine between agents, humans, and verifiable engagement. As CARV’s AI Being roadmap advances, Cashie plays a key role in building trustless bridges between influence and value. About CARV CARV is where Sovereign AI Beings live, learn, and evolve. What are AI Beings? They are sovereign intelligences born natively on-chain. AI Beings are designed with purpose, autonomy, and the capacity for growth.

The images he shared were designed to simplify these distinctions for users, analysts, and institutions to speak accurately about each one. His post reinforces that these three elements operate in separate roles, even though they are connected within the same broader ecosystem. Know the difference Ripple ≠ $XRP ≠ XRP Ledger. pic.twitter.com/0oThrZbxZm — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) December 8, 2025 Ripple as a technology company The images describe Ripple as an enterprise blockchain company that develops products and services using several digital assets, including XRPL , XRP, and RLUSD. Ripple is one of many contributors building tools that support activity on the XRP Ledger, and it also holds XRP as part of its corporate assets. The post emphasizes that Ripple is not the ledger nor the token, but a company that participates in the ecosystem like other developers and businesses. XRP: the native token of the ledger According to the visual breakdown, XRP serves as the native token of the XRP Ledger. It functions, like other blockchain networks, which use their own native assets. XRP enables transaction processing, protects the network from spam by requiring a minimal fee, and provides a bridge asset for exchanges within the ledger’s built-in decentralized exchange. XRP exists as part of the protocol and operates independently of Ripple’s corporate structure. The XRP Ledger: a decentralized layer-1 The XRP Ledger is depicted as a decentralized, layer-1 blockchain with more than a decade of operational reliability. It is maintained by a distributed network of validators and is used by businesses and developers globally for tokenization and asset transfers .

The material shared in the post highlights that the ledger does not belong to Ripple; instead, it is an open network sustained by a broad community. Supporting clearer communication The central message in the post is that accurate terminology is essential when discussing this ecosystem. Ripple refers to the company, XRP refers to the token, and the XRP Ledger refers to the blockchain. Treating them as interchangeable leads to misunderstandings in reporting, analysis, and regulatory discussions. By presenting these distinctions clearly, XRP_Cro’s post encourages a more precise understanding of how each component functions and why separating them is important for anyone following developments in the ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: A federal judge temporarily blocked Connecticut from enforcing its gambling order against Kalshi. Kalshi argues its event contracts fall under the CFTC’s exclusive jurisdiction, not state gambling laws. The Connecticut dispute is one of several state-level battles Kalshi is fighting as regulators challenge its nationwide expansion. The ruling pauses state action as the legal fight over Kalshi’s status moves into early 2026. Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) issued cease-and-desist notices on Dec. 2 to Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com, alleging they were offering unlicensed sports wagering through “online sports event contracts.” Judge Halts Connecticut Action as Kalshi Claims Federal Oversight A day later, Kalshi sued the agency, arguing that its event contracts fall squarely under federal derivatives law and that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), not individual states, has “exclusive jurisdiction” over its platform. On Monday, Judge Vernon Oliver ordered the DCP to refrain from taking action while the court reviews Kalshi’s request for temporary relief. Under the schedule set by the court, the DCP must respond by Jan. 9, Kalshi will submit additional arguments by Jan. 30, and oral arguments are expected in mid-February. Kalshi, designated by the CFTC as a federally regulated contract market, began offering event-based contracts nationwide earlier this year, including markets tied to sports, weather, and political outcomes. JUST IN: Kalshi has sued the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection in federal court alleging that state enforcement over sports event contracts is preempted by the CEA and it ""intends to imminently seek an emergency temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction."" pic.twitter.com/BdcoiPXP1a — Daniel Wallach (@WALLACHLEGAL) December 3, 2025 However, the platform’s expansion has triggered a wave of state-level challenges . Regulators in several states argue that Kalshi’s contracts resemble sports bets and fall under gambling laws. Kalshi says its products are federally regulated financial instruments, not wagers, and that state crackdowns violate the Commodity Exchange Act. Connecticut is the latest in a string of regulatory battles. In October, Kalshi sued the New York State Gaming Commission after it issued a similar cease-and-desist order. Massachusetts’ attorney general took the company to court in September, and Kalshi has filed suits this year against regulators in New Jersey, Nevada, Maryland, and Ohio, accusing each of overstepping their authority. Kalshi Partners with CNN After $1B Funding Round As reported, Kalshi has secured a major media breakthrough after signing a partnership with CNN, making the company the network’s official prediction markets partner while closing a $1 billion funding round at an $11 billion valuation. Under the agreement, Kalshi’s real-time market data will be used inside CNN’s newsroom to support reporting on politics, economics, and major cultural events. The funding follows a surge in activity across prediction platforms. According to Token Terminal data cited by the company, Kalshi posted record trading volume of $4.54 billion in November, beating October’s $4.49 billion. Kalshi said weekly volumes are now exceeding $1 billion, representing growth of more than 1,000% since 2024. Its closest competitor, Polymarket, also recorded a strong November, hitting a monthly total of $3.76 billion after crossing $3 billion in October. Meanwhile, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi about becoming a liquidity provider, as on-chain betting on real-world events draws more attention from both retail traders and Wall Street.

Starting December 11, the platform will support USD1 as a joint margin asset, providing traders with enhanced flexibility and risk management capabilities. This strategic move represents another step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption and improved trading infrastructure. What Does Binance USD1 Joint Margin Asset Mean for Traders? The integration of USD1 as a joint margin asset allows traders to use this stablecoin as collateral across multiple margin trading pairs simultaneously. Instead of maintaining separate collateral for each trading position, users can now pool their USD1 holdings to support various margin trades. This approach streamlines the trading process and optimizes capital efficiency. For example, a trader holding 10,000 USD1 can now use portions of this balance to open margin positions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies without needing to allocate specific amounts to each trade. The system automatically manages the collateral distribution, making portfolio management significantly more efficient. Why Is This Binance USD1 Integration Important? The December 11 implementation date marks a crucial development in cryptocurrency margin trading. Joint margin functionality addresses one of the most persistent challenges in leveraged trading: fragmented collateral management. Previously, traders needed to maintain separate margin balances for different trading pairs, which often led to inefficient capital allocation. With the new Binance USD1 joint margin asset system, traders benefit from: Improved capital efficiency – Use the same collateral for multiple positions Enhanced risk management – Better control over overall exposure Simplified portfolio management – Reduced administrative complexity Increased trading flexibility – Quicker position adjustments How Will the USD1 Joint Margin Asset Work in Practice? When Binance activates the USD1 joint margin asset feature on December 11, traders will notice immediate changes to their margin trading interface. The system will automatically calculate available collateral based on total USD1 holdings, rather than requiring manual allocation to specific trading pairs. This represents a fundamental shift in how margin trading operates on the platform. The implementation follows extensive testing and reflects Binance’s commitment to improving user experience. As a joint margin asset, USD1 joins other supported assets in providing this streamlined functionality. However, USD1’s stability as a dollar-pegged stablecoin makes it particularly valuable for risk-averse traders seeking predictable collateral value. What Are the Strategic Implications of This Move? Binance’s decision to add USD1 as a joint margin asset demonstrates the exchange’s focus on institutional and professional traders. These users typically manage complex portfolios with multiple simultaneous positions, making collateral efficiency a critical concern. By addressing this need, Binance strengthens its position as a comprehensive trading platform suitable for all experience levels. Moreover, this development highlights the growing importance of stablecoins in cryptocurrency ecosystems. USD1, as a regulated and transparent stablecoin, provides the stability necessary for sophisticated financial operations like margin trading. Its integration as a joint margin asset validates the role of quality stablecoins in advanced trading strategies. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for Crypto Trading The introduction of USD1 as a joint margin asset on Binance represents more than just a technical feature update. It signifies the maturation of cryptocurrency trading infrastructure and the platform’s commitment to professional-grade tools. Starting December 11, traders will experience unprecedented flexibility in managing their margin positions, potentially leading to more sophisticated trading strategies and improved risk management across the board. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a joint margin asset? A joint margin asset is collateral that can be used simultaneously across multiple margin trading positions. Instead of allocating specific amounts to each trade, the system pools the asset to support all open positions. When does the USD1 joint margin feature go live on Binance? The feature becomes active on December 11, as announced by Binance. Traders should prepare their accounts and familiarize themselves with the new functionality before this date. Can I use other assets as joint margin collateral on Binance? Yes, Binance supports multiple assets for joint margin functionality. However, USD1’s addition expands the options available, particularly for traders preferring stablecoin collateral. How does this affect my existing margin positions? Existing positions will continue normally. After December 11, you can choose to convert your USD1 collateral to joint margin status, which may improve your capital efficiency for new positions. Are there any risks with using joint margin assets? While joint margin improves efficiency, it also means that multiple positions share the same collateral pool. A significant loss in one position could affect collateral available for all positions, so risk management remains crucial. Will this feature be available to all Binance users? The USD1 joint margin asset feature will be available to users in supported regions who have access to margin trading. Always check your local regulations and Binance’s terms of service.

This ETF includes ten digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Sui (SUI), and Polkadot (DOT). Notably, BITW marks the first exchange-traded fund by a major crypto asset manager to incorporate Avalanche, Sui, and Polkadot into its portfolio, as highlighted by Bitwise CEO and co-founder Hunter Horsley in a recent interview with CNBC. Bitwise ETF Launches With Over $1 Billion In Assets “This development significantly broadens the audience that can access these various assets, particularly for those digital currencies that lack a spot ETF,” Horsley explained on Monday. The fund is tailored for both financial advisors and smaller investors looking to utilize funds from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or other retirement savings, where ETFs serve as the main investment option. BITW represents a conversion from a prior index fund that encompassed the same digital currencies and has launched with over $1 billion in assets. The approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs back in January 2024 has led asset managers to compete for the chance to introduce ETFs that track a broader range of digital assets, including altcoins like Sui and Aptos, as well as memecoins such as TRUMP and Dogecoin (DOGE). However, these investment vehicles experienced major withdrawals in October and November, particularly for Bitcoin- and Ethereum-focused ETFs. These withdrawals reached record levels amid a broader sense of caution due to falling crypto prices. “The timing is ideal for many investors who have been paying attention since the Bitcoin ETF launch and are now looking for a more comprehensive way to allocate to digital assets without the need to select individual assets,” Horsley noted. BITW Allocates 90% To Major Cryptos It’s important to emphasize that while BITW offers exposure to smaller cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, its allocation to these assets is proportionately limited. Specifically, the ETF dedicates 90% of its holdings to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, with the remaining 10% allocated to the other tokens in the fund. The fund will undergo monthly rebalancing, a more frequent schedule compared to many exchange-traded funds in the market that typically rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Bitwise further expressed its commitment to expanding access to cryptocurrency opportunities, stating in a social media post : At Bitwise, we’ve been working tirelessly since 2017 to expand access to the opportunities in crypto. Countless investors have requested an index ETP, and we’re thrilled that NOW, with BITW’s listing on NYSE, you have that option. We believe 2025 is a breakout year for this space, and we are more optimistic than ever about the opportunities ahead. As of this writing, Ethereum is the best-performing asset in Bitwise’s new fund. It is trading at $3,323 and has recorded gains of up to 6% in the past 24 hours as it approaches key resistance levels.

Related Reading: All-In On XRP: Why This Leading Investor Sold His Entire Bitcoin Stack According to market trackers, trading activity cooled significantly in November and the first week of December, raising fresh questions about demand heading into year end. Sales And Volume Plunge NFT sales fell to $320 million in November, down from close to $630 million in October, CryptoSlam data shows. That level is roughly on par with the $312 million recorded in September 2024. Based on reports, the trend did not improve at the start of December: from Dec. 1–7, collections generated about $62 million in sales — the weakest weekly total recorded so far in 2025. Market participants are being hit by lower turnover and fewer big trades. Market Cap Shrinks Dramatically CoinGecko data shows the sector’s market cap sits at $3.1 billion, which is down 66% from a January high of $9.2 billion. Reports have disclosed a steep month-to-month swing as well: values dropped from $6.6 billion in October to $3.5 billion in November, a fall of 46% in roughly 30 days. There was a brief uptick on Nov. 11 when market cap moved from $3.5 billion to nearly $4 billion during a memecoin-driven surge, but the recovery was short-lived and the market cap later retreated back to $3.1 billion. These moves show that prices are still volatile and driven by bursts of speculative interest. Blue Chips Mostly Lose Ground Top collections were not immune. Based on reports, CryptoPunks fell about 12% over the past month. Bored Ape Yacht Club slid 8.5%, while Pudgy Penguins dropped 10.6% in the same period. Art-focused blue-chip works also fell: Chromie Squiggle lost 5.6%, Fidenza declined 14.6%, Moonbirds went down 17.9% and Mutant Ape Yacht Club slipped 13.4%. The biggest fall among major names came from Hypurr, which dropped 48%. Two Collections Show Gains Not every project followed the downward path. Infinex Patrons posted almost 15% rise in the last 30 days, and Autoglyphs outperformed the top ten with a 21% gain. These outliers were lifted by collector interest, and in some cases by the projects’ small supply or unique on-chain history. Still, such gains remain the exception rather than the rule.

I upgraded to Hold on a more supportive outlook for BTC, considering the (likely) Fed rate cut this week and a more dovish stance in 2026. Strategy’s Q4 setup looks rough. The original $150k year-end BTC assumption was unrealistic, and management later shifted to an $85k–$110k range (midpoint 35% lower). I’m not buying the dip because dilution risk rises if capital markets tighten. Basic shares are up 20% YTD, and the company issued 8.214M shares on December 1. In my last coverage on Strategy ( MSTR ), I downgraded the stock to a Strong Sell on the view that a tougher macro backdrop would pressure Bitcoin and, by extension, MSTR. Take into consideration that my last coverage was back in March this year, when the fear of high tariffs occupied everyone's mind (therefore, the macro headwinds that I mentioned). Since my last coverage, the stock is down 40%, so I believe I was right with my thesis. Seeking Alpha In this article, I upgrade my rating to a hold, although I'm not considering adding any shares after the selloff in the last month. In my view, MSTR remains a leveraged bet on BTC, not a clean proxy. Furthermore, my model shows that MSTR still trades roughly 18% above BTC-NAV/share, leaving room for another leg down if the premium compresses. On the positive side, I see a dovish Fed, with a likely rate cut in December that will add liquidity to the crypto space. Overall, I feel bullish on Bitcoin heading into 2026, so I had to upgrade my strong sell on MSTR to a hold. A Rough Q4 On October 30, Strategy reported Q3 results and, most importantly, provided its outlook for Q4. Specifically, here is the guidance and a very important assumption: Strategy At the time of writing this article, Bitcoin is exchanging hands at $91.8k (39% below management's $150k expectations by year-end). To put into perspective how uphill the battle is for reaching that $150k target, take a look at the chart below. Trading View Even with a rate cut this Wednesday, and with a likely dovish Fed heading into 2026 (a topic I recently discussed in my latest macro article ), I see a very slim chance for Bitcoin to jump 62% in three weeks. Since the last earnings call, management has downgraded its expectations, and the latest update (December 1) assumes year-end BTC price between $85,000 – $110,000. Notice how this is a range rather than a point estimate. At the midpoint, we're talking about a 35% downgrade from the initial estimate. Here is the updated guidance : Strategy It's priced in! (some may say) Well, I disagree. I'll explain why in the next section. Why I'm Not Buying The Dip I see downside risk for another 18% drop in the share price. Let me explain why. The latest update shows 650,000 BTC held as of December 1. At the current BTC price ($91,754), that's a value of $59.64B. Now, if I exclude the debt ( $8.17B ) and the preferred liquidation prefs (STRF $1.332B, STRC $2.801B, STRK $1.361B, STRD $1.232B, adding up to a total of $6.73B), the BTC value left for common is approximately $44.74B. Strategy At the current share count (295.67M), I obtain a $151 BTC-NAV/share. In other words, at the current share price of $179, MSTR is about +18% above that simplified BTC-NAV/share. Furthermore, the downside risk if BTC prices decline further (unlikely scenario, but worth taking into account) is significantly more than just holding BTC. Let me explain. Let's assume the stock declined 18%, and now it trades closer to 1.0× that BTC-NAV. If Bitcoin then sells off by 23%, down to $70k (again, unlikely, in my view), the implied BTC-NAV/share (after accounting for debt and prefs) would be close to $103. From the $151 ""fair value"" that I obtained above, that drop represents a 32% decline in the share price. So the downward exposure is bigger than just holding BTC alone. Another reason why I wouldn't buy the dip is due to dilution. The BTC acquisition strategy largely depends on capital markets staying open. If the stock trades poorly, the company may still issue equity just to fund obligations. Specifically, this is how much: Strategy Please note that mNAV is not the same thing as NAV. Here is how management defines this metric: mNAV represents a multiple of Bitcoin NAV, calculated by dividing Enterprise Value (as defined below) by Bitcoin NAV (as defined below). Although Bitcoin NAV incorporates the label “NAV,” it is not equivalent to “net asset value” or “NAV” or any similar metric in the traditional financial context. Additionally, it is not a measure of the amount by which our enterprise value exceeds net asset value in the traditional financial sense of those terms. The fact that the company is willing to ""tactically issue common equity below"" the 2.5x mNAV threshold is not particularly encouraging from a dilution perspective. By looking at the latest earnings report, since the start of the year, the number of total basic shares outstanding has gone up by 20%. Strategy Looking at the chart above, the bulls may argue that BTC holdings rose faster in that same period (45% to be precise), but my point is that the funding machine depends on capital markets staying open. In the event Bitcoin continues its selloff, Strategy's stock could tank (as I've shown in my estimates above), which will negatively impact dilution (more shares would need to be sold to raise the same capital). The latest example of such an event (dilution) was on December 1, when the company issued 8.214M shares (Class A) to establish a US dollar reserve of $1.44 billion . Conclusion In my view, the stock has the potential to outperform BTC when either of these two events takes place: The premium to BTC-NAV expands (this could happen where there is euphoria in the crypto space). The company uses capital markets efficiently (meaning, dilution near ATHs) to increase its BTC per share. As I noted in this article, since the start of the year, the company's BTC reserves have increased by 45%, while basic shares only rose by 20%. Furthermore, the stock pays decent dividends (unlike BTC). Recently, Strategy has raised STRC’s dividend rate to 10.75%. Strategy Is that enough to make me want to buy MSTR over holding BTC? My answer is no, as I don't like the downside exposure if the BTC price turns south. Will this event happen? Well, given that the Fed is likely to cut in December, that should add liquidity into the markets, which will spill into riskier assets like crypto.

The move aims to protect the hot wallets from large-scale hacks, which the exchange has faced twice so far. Dunamu, the operator of the crypto exchange Upbit, announced that hot wallets will only hold a fraction of user assets. The exchange aims to increase the share of cold wallets up to 99% from the already high levels. Over 98% of Upbit deposits are be stored in cold wallets as of December 2025 to increase security. As Cryptopolitan reported , the recent Upbit hack is still under investigation, but the exchange operator has taken additional precautions with the public user-facing wallets. “We are continuously striving to maintain the lowest hot wallet ratio in the domestic market,” said Oh Kyung-seok , CEO of Dunamu. Recently, Upbit also retired the old deposit hot wallets, which were compromised after a $30M hack from multi-chain hot wallets. Under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, at least 80% of assets must be stored in cold wallets. Upbit has always tried to store most of its assets in cold wallets, above and beyond that ratio. Currently, Upbit claimed other exchanges stored only around 82% to 90% in cold wallets. Upbit hacker retains most of the funds More than $28M are still held in the Upbit hacker wallets. After the initial trading, most of the funds were stored as ETH, with the potential to mix and disguise. The hacker’s wallets are interacting with other projects, including the OKX DEX router. The wallets themselves show limited outgoing activity, with attempts to trade through the OKX router. Other transactions include dust transfers from general users and even from the Pump.fun wallets. Upbit accumulated BTC in November Upbit still carries significant BTC reserves, with over 176K coins in reported wallets. In the past year, the reserves gradually declined from over 193K coins. One of the Upbit cold wallets, also known as Mr. 100, kept adding coins in November. The wallet has been known for accumulating coins during market dips. So far in December, there are no new inflows, but the balances increased significantly in November. Currently, the cold wallet holds 60,463 BTC, after adding a net 1,939 BTC in the past 30 days. The wallet is ranked 13th, holding 0.3% of the BTC supply. Upbit remains a key indicator for crypto activity. The exchange is one of the biggest venues for XRP trading. The exchange also offers a mix of blue-chip trading, as well as new token listings. In the past day, Upbit volumes expanded by over 49% up to $1.3B, boosted by growing ETH and XRP volumes.

55591142,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/strategies-for-crypto-trading-success,1765357894,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/55591142.jpeg,Strategies for Crypto Trading Success,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/strategies-for-crypto-trading-success,"Crypto trading looks exciting from the outside: big moves, big headlines, and stories of huge gains. But traders who last more than a few months know a simple truth: success in this market comes less from luck and more from structure, discipline, and choosing the right environment to trade in. Below are practical strategies you can apply to build a more professional, consistent approach to trading cryptocurrencies. 1. Define Your Edge Before You Place a Trade Many traders skip straight to signals, indicators, or Telegram groups without answering a basic question: what is your edge? An edge can come from: A specific timeframe you understand well (for example, 4-hour and daily charts rather than 1-minute scalping). A style that suits your personality: trend-following, swing trading, or day trading. A particular information advantage, such as being very fast at digesting news or understanding on-chain metrics. Ask yourself: When do I trade best – during quiet hours or around major news? Am I more comfortable holding positions for hours, days, or weeks? Do I understand charts better, or do I prefer fundamental narratives? You don’t need a perfect answer on day one, but you do need intentionality. Your edge is the foundation for all other strategies. 2. Choose the Right Trading Environment Even the best strategy can fail if you trade in the wrong environment. That means picking reliable crypto trading brokers with: Solid regulation and reputation Transparent fees and spreads Stable platforms with minimal downtime and fast execution Reasonable leverage and proper risk controls Low-cost trading and deep liquidity matter because they directly affect your results. Tight spreads and fair commissions reduce the “friction” on every trade. Over hundreds of trades, this difference compounds. Before you worry about the “perfect” indicator, make sure you’re trading with a broker and platform that aren’t silently eating your edge through slippage, outages, or high costs. 3. Build a Clear, Written Trading Plan A trading strategy that only lives in your head is just a vague idea. Successful traders tend to write things down. Your plan should answer at least: What will you trade? BTC, ETH, a handful of major altcoins, or crypto indices. When will you trade? Specific sessions or times of day. How will you enter a trade? Exact conditions: breakout of a level, retest of support, moving average cross, etc. Where will you exit? Take-profit levels Stop-loss levels How much will you risk per trade? For example, 1% or 2% of your account balance. If you cannot explain your plan in a few sentences, it will be difficult to follow it when the market becomes emotional. Simplicity is often an advantage. 4. Master Risk Management First, Profit Later Risk management isn’t the “boring part”; it’s the survival kit that keeps you in the game long enough to learn and improve. Key principles: Fixed percentage risk per tradeMany traders limit risk to 0.5%–2% of their account on each position. Use stop losses intelligentlyPlace them where your trade idea is invalidated, not at random round numbers. Avoid overleveragingHigh leverage magnifies mistakes. Using conservative leverage, even when more is available, is a sign of a mature trader. Set a daily or weekly loss limitOnce you hit it, you stop trading and review rather than trying to “win it back”. Think of risk management as “buying time” in the market. The longer you can trade without blowing up, the more chances you have to refine your strategy. 5. Learn to Read Price Action and Key Levels You don’t need ten indicators to trade effectively. In crypto, where volatility is high, clear price levels matter more than ever. Focus on: Support and resistance: zones where price has repeatedly bounced or been rejected. Trend structure: higher highs and higher lows in an uptrend, lower highs and lower lows in a downtrend. Breakouts and fakeouts: not every breakout is real; wait for confirmation, such as a retest of the level or strong volume. Price action is the most direct expression of supply and demand. Understanding it can help you avoid chasing random green candles and entering right before a reversal. 6. Use Volatility Instead of Fighting It Volatility is a defining feature of crypto. It can feel terrifying or exciting, depending on how prepared you are. To use volatility to your advantage: Trade sizes appropriate for the asset’s volatility. A position that’s fine on EUR/USD can be huge on a small-cap coin. Expect wider swings and set stops and targets accordingly. Avoid entering right after a massive spike; often, the best opportunities come after the market cools and structure returns. High volatility without a plan leads to emotional decisions. High volatility with a plan leads to opportunity. 7. Combine Technical, News, and Narrative – but Don’t Drown in Noise Crypto markets react not only to charts, but also to: Regulatory news Exchange outages or listings/delisting’s Major partnerships or protocol upgrades Sentiment on social platforms A practical approach: Use technical analysis to define entries, exits, and risk. Use news and narrative to understand when volatility might increase. Avoid trading purely on social media hype or anonymous tips. If the news doesn’t fit your strategy, you can often do nothing. Staying flat is a valid position. 8. Develop a Routine of Journaling and Review One of the simplest but most powerful strategies for improving results is a trading journal. For each trade, record: Date and time Asset and direction (long/short) Entry, stop loss, and target Reason for the trade (your setup) Outcome and what you learned Once a week, review: Which setups worked best Which times of day or conditions led to mistakes Whether you followed your plan or broke your rules Over time, your journal becomes a mirror. It shows you not just what the market is doing, but what you are doing. 9. Manage Your Emotions and External Risks Crypto trading success isn’t only about charts; it’s also about psychology and practical security. Emotionally: Expect losing trades – they’re part of the game, not a personal failure. Avoid revenge trading after a loss. Walk away, review, and reset. Don’t increase position size just because you’re bored or “feeling lucky”. Practically: Use two-factor authentication on your accounts. Beware of unsolicited messages, fake “support” staff, or too-good-to-be-true offers. Store long-term holdings safely; trading capital and long-term investments should not be mixed mentally or technically. Protecting your capital and your account access is as important as choosing a good strategy. 10. Start Small and Scale Up Gradually The fastest way to destroy a promising strategy is to trade too big, too soon. Instead: Test your approach on a demo or with very small real positions. Once you see consistent results, increase size gradually. Treat trading like a business, not a lottery ticket. You’re building a skill set that can last for years. There’s no need to rush and risk everything in a few weeks. FAQs: Quick Answers on Crypto Trading Success What is the most important factor in crypto trading success?Consistent risk management is more important than any single entry strategy. A decent strategy with strict risk rules beats a brilliant strategy that is applied emotionally. How much should I risk per crypto trade?Many traders keep risk between 0.5% and 2% of their account balance per trade. The goal is to avoid any single loss doing serious damage to your capital. Is day trading crypto better than swing trading?Neither is “better” by default. Day trading requires more screen time and emotional control. Swing trading suits traders who prefer to make fewer, higher-quality decisions and hold positions for several days. Do I really need a trading plan?Yes. A plan is what separates structured trading from random gambling. It doesn’t have to be complicated, but it should clearly define what you trade, when you trade, how you enter and exit, and how you manage risk. Used properly, the strategies above won’t remove all losing trades – nothing can. What they will do is shift you away from impulsive, reaction-based decisions and toward a structured, professional approach. Combine a clear strategy with reliable crypto trading brokers, disciplined risk management, and ongoing learning, and you give yourself a genuine chance of long-term success in this volatile but rewarding market.

According to three senior administration officials speaking to the Financial Times, POTUS Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are expected to meet former Fed governor Kevin Warsh on Wednesday. Two additional candidates will be chosen from a pool of finalists that includes Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, alongside BlackRock chief investment officer Rick Rieder, the officials said. Hassett deemed early favorite, but not guaranteed Hassett, who leads the National Economic Council, is supposedly the frontrunner for Powell’s seat despite concerns among some investors that he is too close to the US President and may support “unwarranted” rate cuts. Those fears have circulated inside the Treasury and bond desks, where economists believe cut-throat reductions could increase inflation rates and unsettle the $30 trillion Treasury market. Still, the administration insists Hassett’s selection is not guaranteed, as they plan to conduct further interviews. Trump’s camp also said the White House has floated the possibility of Hassett serving a shortened term as chair, though he would still need Senate confirmation. Secretary Bessent presented a list of four names to Trump earlier this month, with Hassett and Warsh included. The remaining two slots are expected to be filled by finalists from the group of Waller, Bowman and Rieder. Interviews are scheduled to continue into next week, with a final decision planned for early January. Officials said Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles may attend some of the sessions. “Personnel decisions to be made by President Trump will be announced directly by President Trump himself. Any discussion until then is pointless speculation,” a White House spokesperson told FT. If Hassett moves to the Fed, Bessent is expected to assume leadership of the National Economic Council in the interim while keeping his Treasury role, according to four people familiar with internal planning. Powell has not yet decided whether he will stay on the Fed board when his chairmanship ends next May. However, Trump hinted that he has already identified a preferred candidate, telling journalists aboard Air Force One on Tuesday: “We’re going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want.” Prediction markets change after Trump’s recent Fed commentary President Trump, during a December 2 event at the White House , referred to Hassett as a “potential Fed chair” while greeting visitors. The former Fed governor’s odds to take Powell’s seat come 2026 on Kalshi and Polymarket jumped to 85% after the POTUS’s comments, before retreating to around 72% this week. Warsh’s odds are hovering near 13%, while Waller’s chances stand at around 5%. Trump has spent months questioning and bashing chair Powell and the Fed to lower borrowing rates during his second term, repeating complaints that the central bank was moving too slowly. The Federal Open Market Committee cut rates in September and again in October, the first reductions of Trump’s current term. A third cut is expected on Wednesday. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal event on Tuesday, Hassett said that while he saw room for more cuts, “the most important job” of a Fed chair was “to be looking at the economic data and to avoid being part of politics”. Trump accuses Biden of appointing Powell through an ‘autopen’ During a speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, Trump continued bashing Jerome Powell’s position by claiming he had “just heard” that all four of Biden’s Federal Reserve appointments were approved by “autopen,” implying they may not be valid. “It could be that all four commissioners in the Fed signed by Biden … I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions.” Trump derisively called Powell out for acting “too late” because economist JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had urged the Fed chair to cut rates. “If they signed those commissions, now maybe I’m wrong, but we’re going to check,” he added.

The token is seen having a 14th day streak of ETF fund flow, and with reduced US inflation rates, this is a hint at a possible Santa rally. However, as traders begin contemplating what is the best crypto to buy now for both resilience and potential, they find that they’re not alone in turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The presale for this DeFi platform has been moving at such a rapid rate that it has managed to find itself at the top of the list for the best cryptos to buy now as the year comes to a close. XRP Increases on Accumulation Signal from ETF Demand XRP has been dealing with a volatile phase, trending down towards the $2 battleground range as a result of profit-taking amid repeated rejections at the $2.2 levels. Despite this pullback phenomenon, XRP still retains a bullish bias owing to consistent ETF investment. It should be noted that the US XRP-spot ETF market marked its fourteenth consecutive day with investment on December 4 with more than $12 million investment, thereby propelling the figures close to 887 million dollars. Analysts, however, tracking the medium-term trend, are anticipating a corrective movement to $2.35 within the coming weeks and possibly 3 dollars within the next two months if the current support at $2 is maintained. XRP is once again included within the debate on what crypto to invest in prior to the end of the year, while DeFi tokens seem to slowly take root. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Nears Phase 6 Completion The momentum for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has accelerated with 98% completion for Phase 6 presale and is one of the hottest cryptos for which retail investors are closely tracking this month. Additionally, for now, the token is at $0.035 with a 250% increase from Phase 1 at $0.01. However, with the start of Phase 7, this token is expected to increase its price from $0.035 to $0.04. On the other hand, the actual launch token is $0.06. Current holders can enjoy approximately 360% ROI at this launch. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has accumulated $19,250,000 so far and the number of holders is now at 18,400. Phase 6 is selling out quickly and the chance to purchase at this stage is running out. A dual lending system enhances functional utility It was recently confirmed that the dual-lending model for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will debut in its testnet launch that is scheduled for release in Q4 2025. This dual model consists of Peer-to-Contract Markets for assets such as ETH and USDT with pooled liquidity and Peer-to-Peer Markets for assets with customized terms for loans. Traders that research and analyze which crypto to purchase have found the dual market model to be highly attractive for risk-adjusted investment. This project has already attracted larger players looking for flexible credit terms and wanting to be able to access the automated liquidity market while still having exposure. This is highly unusual for a project at this stage and puts MUTM on the map for users looking for the next big thing with actual functional design. Stablecoin Strategies Reinforce Long-term Positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing an over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to reserves associated with loans given out on the platform. A stablecoin can be created by a borrower after providing collateral for loans, and the process of withdrawing loans from circulation is essentially a burn process for the stablecoin. Those seeking the cheapest crypto to purchase should be focusing on the utility associated with MUTM. Anyone researching which is the best cryptocurrency to buy for the last weeks of 2025 will find MUTM being the last chance for a cheap entry prior to its next increase.

As expected, this rapid climb already has investors calling for a return of the bull run, but not everyone is convinced. For some, the current Bitcoin price momentum is most likely a bull trap, and crypto analyst Xanrox highlights this in a recent analysis, outlining the best level to start selling the digital asset. Why The Bitcoin Price Risks A Crash To $74,000 Xanrox’s analysis focuses on the bearish formations that have appeared on the Bitcoin price crash following the recent upward move. While many in the crypto community celebrate the rise above $90,000 again, the crypto analyst sounds an alarm that this is the time to go bearish on the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Why The Litecoin Price Could Stage A 33% Rally To $110 According to the analysis shared on the TradingView website, there has been a clear bear flag formation for the cryptocurrency. This bearish formation is visible on both the 12-hour chart and the 1-Day chart. Regardless, both of these charts point to one possible outcome, and that is an almost perfect textbook bear flag formation. In addition to the bear flag formation, Xanrox also highlights that there is a WXY corrective pattern inside the bear flag. Both of these point to a possible continuation to the initial downtrend that began after the Bitcoin price hit $126,000 back in October. As for how far the current rally could go, the crypto analyst sees it reaching as high as $96,000 before momentum runs out. This presents the “perfect” time to sell or enter a short as the price continues its decline. The target for this is an over 25% crash that will send the price going toward $74,000.

Thus, this makes it an attractive point for market makers to push the price towards in order to clear significant liquidity. The timeframe for this to play out is placed over the next few weeks, riding out the end of 2025 and moving into January 2026. However, the swing low support at $74,000, if it holds up, could end up serving as the next bounce-off point for the Bitcoin price.

No one knows what to do with it, the master of the Kremlin said in comments coming after his government indicated Russia will be introducing AI everywhere. Putin worried about ‘losing everything’ due to AI President Putin has spoken about the potential benefits, but also the perils of artificial intelligence as a modern invention his country is willing to take advantage of. “This is an important and very difficult issue,” the head of state noted during a meeting of Russia’s human rights council. The Russian leader was commenting on a remark by the chief executive of the tech and research company Kribrum, Igor Ashmanov, who highlighted the lack of AI regulation. “It is becoming evident even for those who are far from these problems that something should be done, but no one knows exactly what to do,” he elaborated, while also referring to the use of big data in general and other related topics. Quoted by the TASS news agency on Tuesday, Putin put his figure on the center issue: “Because not using these instruments would mean losing everything we care about. But at the same time, if we use it thoughtlessly, it will also end up in the loss of everything we value.” Russia prepares to introduce AI across sectors Putin’s input on the matter comes as the Russian government is drafting a plan for the deployment of artificial intelligence tools across the country. The executive power in Moscow now wants to see AI applications widely implemented, from the public administration to different sectors of the economy as well as in all regions of the vast nation. Announcing the initiative, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin recalled an earlier statement by the president who insisted that Russia must develop a full suite of its own AI solutions and products as something essential for its sovereignty. Also quoted by TASS, the head of the Russian cabinet of ministers unveiled: “A plan is being formed for the introduction of generative artificial intelligence, not only at the state level, but also across industries and regions.” Working with the presidential administration, the government has proposed the establishment of an AI headquarters that will set specific objectives and control their fulfillment. The structure will coordinate the efforts of relevant ministries and agencies and evaluate the results of various projects in the field. The proposal now awaits Putin’s approval. Last month, the Russian president urged his nation to rally behind domestic AI development which, in his view, will ensure its technological independence. During his participation in the AI Journey international conference in Moscow, he also announced Russia is setting up a national task force dedicated to that goal. The event showcased Russia’s first accomplished AI-powered humanoid robot, designed and built by a team of engineers organized by Russia’s biggest bank, Sber. The Russian Federation has been also looking to join forces with allies in this area. Last week, it signed an agreement for blockchain and AI cooperation with Iran. And during a visit to New Delhi, Putin offered India a “broad partnership in the field of artificial intelligence .” According to a recent estimate made public by a top executive of the country’s second-largest bank, VTB, Russia will have to invest some $77 billion in new power generation capacities to satisfy the growing energy needs of AI computing and crypto mining at data centers in the coming years.

According to a recent Bitcoin price analysis , the king of crypto must first achieve a critical technical feat: converting the $93,300 level from resistance into a firm foundation of support. This pivotal move is what stands between the current price and a historic surge into six-figure territory. Let’s break down the key levels every trader needs to watch. Why is $93.3K So Crucial for Bitcoin’s Price? Think of $93,300 not just as a number, but as a gatekeeper. Technical analysis suggests this price point has become a major battleground. For Bitcoin to gather the strength for a sustained push higher, it needs to establish this zone as a reliable floor. This process, known as ‘flipping resistance to support,’ means the price can repeatedly bounce higher from this level instead of falling through it. A successful flip here would signal strong buyer conviction and clear a major obstacle on the path to $100,000. However, the challenge is significant. The $100,000 level itself acts as a powerful psychological barrier. History shows that when a major round number rejects price multiple times, it can trigger widespread profit-taking. Therefore, securing a strong support base below it is non-negotiable for a genuine breakout. The Bullish Path: Steps to a $100K Bitcoin Breakout So, what does the ideal scenario look like? This Bitcoin price analysis outlines a clear sequence of events needed for the rally to continue. Step 1: Secure $93,300 as Support: Bitcoin needs to hold above this level consistently, with any dips being quickly bought. Step 2: Reclaim the 5-Day Moving Average: The next target is overcoming the $98,000 zone, where the short-term trend indicator (the 5-day simple moving average) currently sits. Step 3: Break and Hold Above $100K: A decisive close above the psychological barrier would confirm bullish momentum. If this playbook unfolds, the analysis suggests the rally could then extend toward $108,000, where another significant cluster of resistance awaits. What if Bitcoin Fails to Break Higher? In trading, it’s vital to prepare for all outcomes. The same Bitcoin price analysis that charts the path upward also warns of potential downside risks if key resistance holds. If Bitcoin cannot power through the $94,000 resistance zone, it faces the threat of increased selling pressure. A break below the crucial $90,000 support could open the door for a deeper correction. In this scenario, traders might watch for a pullback toward the $87,500 level, and potentially even $84,000. This highlights why the $93.3K to $90K range is such a critical area to monitor; a loss here could significantly alter the short-term bullish narrative. Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This detailed Bitcoin price analysis provides more than just price targets; it offers a framework for understanding market structure. The tug-of-war between establishing support and overcoming resistance defines the current moment. For active participants, this means watching the reaction at these defined levels more than predicting the exact next move. Is the market showing strength by holding $93.3K? Or is it showing weakness by failing at $94K? The price action around these zones will provide the clearest signals. Remember, in volatile markets, patience and discipline at key technical junctures are often more valuable than speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘flip to support’ mean in Bitcoin price analysis? A: It means a price level that previously acted as resistance (a ceiling where selling occurred) becomes a floor (support) where buying interest emerges, preventing the price from falling further. Q: Why is $100,000 a psychological resistance level? A: Major round numbers like $100,000 often become mental barriers for traders. Many may set sell orders or take profits at these levels, creating concentrated selling pressure. Q: What is the significance of the 5-day simple moving average (SMA)? A: The 5-day SMA is a short-term trend indicator. Trading above it suggests bullish momentum in the very near term, while trading below it can indicate weakening price strength. Q: What could cause Bitcoin to drop to $84,000? A: According to the analysis, a failure to hold $90,000 as support could trigger a deeper correction as stop-loss orders are hit and bearish sentiment increases, potentially leading to a test of lower support levels.

FLOKI Drops, BONK Slides, and Apeing Whitelist Seizes Center Stage",https://timestabloid.com/are-the-strongest-upcoming-crypto-coins-finally-emerging-floki/,"Crypto chatter feels like a comedy show some days, prices fall, communities rise, and everyone still finds a meme to glue the story together. FLOKI dropping 6.37% to $0.01797 and BONK sliding 1.41% to $0.1400 both added new material to the timeline today, stirring conversations about which upcoming crypto coins still hold the strongest setups. The market’s personality never changes; one coin dips, another rallies, and somewhere in between, opportunities wait for traders bold enough to grab them. That’s why Apeing’s Whitelist is creating so much anticipation. Positioned at the heart of discussions around upcoming crypto coins , it offers a structured entry point rarely seen in the meme sector. With early access forming quickly and demand rising, Apeing’s first stage has become one of the most frequently mentioned starting points for traders who prefer to act before the rest of the market arrives. Apeing Makes Its Case Among Upcoming Crypto Coins With a Strong Whitelist Launch Apeing steps forward with a format that aligns with what many traders now expect from upcoming crypto coins, clarity, scarcity, and a meaningful advantage for early adopters. While many investors get stuck trying to predict the perfect chart moment, Apeing rewards the opposite mentality: conviction. History shows that major meme coin winners were claimed by those who jumped early, not by those who hovered waiting for “the perfect signal.” Two core components drive the appeal. First, Apeing locks its early access at $0.0001, while its public listing is fixed at $0.001. That clean 10× spread creates a wind tunnel effect for early ROI, with Stage 1 participants having a defined path toward 10,000%+ upside if momentum accelerates post-launch. Second, the whitelist uses limited Stage 1 supply, which adds structural scarcity and strengthens trust. Only a portion of tokens will be available at the lowest cost, making early registration more valuable than typical presale chaos. Together, these mechanics push $APEING into the spotlight as one of the more thoughtfully structured upcoming crypto coins entering the meme sector. Glimpses of Stage 1 on Early Joining: How to Join the Best Upcoming Crypto Coins Whitelist Joining early often shapes the story that follows. Accessing a upcoming crypto coins whitelist before the masses brings benefits that latecomers simply cannot replicate. When the entry price is locked at the absolute floor, every movement upward compounds the advantage. The Apeing whitelist process keeps things clean and direct: • Register • Secure the slot • Access $APEING at $0.0001 without competition There’s no race for block confirmations, no flooded portals, no fighting bots for allocation. Instead, participants step into Stage 1 at the earliest possible moment, capturing a strategic position before public excitement inevitably grows. With allocation capped and attention accelerating, early joining is shaping up to be one of the most meaningful decisions in this launch cycle. FLOKI ($FLOKI): Price Pullback Reflects a Momentary Shift in Community Momentum Crypto 2 faces cooling pressure after a 6.37% decline. FLOKI’s recent dip to $0.01797 paints a picture of a token navigating through natural market recalibration. Meme assets often live on the enthusiasm of their communities, and FLOKI’s slight downturn is seen as part of a normal cycle rather than a structural setback. The ecosystem surrounding FLOKI remains active, and ongoing development keeps it relevant as newer meme tokens rise. This type of shift frequently encourages traders to explore newer opportunities, especially upcoming crypto coins offering cleaner early access and more predictable pricing models. FLOKI’s chart movement gives context to why many traders are redirecting attention toward fresh launches like Apeing. Bonk ($BONK): A Gentle Dip Highlights Shifting Trader Preferences Crypto 1 sees a 1.41% decline to $0.1400 amid sector rotation. BONK’s mild downward move reflects a market adjusting its focus as new narratives take shape. With BONK settling at $0.1400, traders are reassessing short-term expectations and deciding where the next wave of meme-driven excitement will form. The decline isn’t dramatic, but it emphasizes a broader rotation toward emerging projects offering structured early opportunities. As more traders scan upcoming crypto coins for the next breakout setup, BONK’s movement adds context: the appetite for new entrants is rising. Early-stage tokens like Apeing benefit from this shift, especially those offering accessible Stage 1 pricing and specific ROI frameworks. Conclusion The shifts seen in FLOKI and BONK showcase how fluid meme markets can be. Prices rise, fall, and stabilize, but the strongest attention often gravitates toward projects offering clear early advantages. The Apeing whitelist stands precisely in that zone: a structured, early-access opportunity among today’s most watched upcoming crypto coins. With its $0.0001 Stage 1 entry, limited allocation, and $0.001 listing setup, Apeing gives early participants a defined position that many meme coins simply do not offer during launch. As interest continues rising, the window for early joining is already narrowing. Apeing’s whitelist is officially open. With allocation moving quickly and Stage 1 serving as the highest-value entry point, those exploring upcoming crypto coins may find this the most strategic early move available today.

55592883,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=875987,1765360240,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55592883.jpeg,XRP struggles at $2.12 as sell pressure intensifies,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-sell-pressure-spikes-ripple-linked-token/,"XRP faced intensified sell pressure on Wednesday as the token attempted but failed to break above the $2.11 resistance zone several times, even though it had reached a 24-hour high of $2.17. Ripple’s primary token jumped in trading activity above its weekly norms, caused by the participation of larger market participants, yet the additional liquidity did not translate into a sustainable advance. The token opened Wednesday’s Asian trading session on a positive note, staging a two-step recovery that carried it towards $2.18, a level where sellers took charge and aided a price slump to slightly above $2.09. The market backdrop could mean several traders are letting go of their position more than holders are accumulating. Institutional activity is on the rise, but momentum stalls According to market data from CoinGecko, XRP is up 0.9% in the last day and is changing hands at $2.08. Even with that uptick, it trails the broader crypto market, whose market cap has surged by nearly 2.7%, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum , which have witnessed price uptrends of 2.3% and 6% respectively. The moderate price advance came on the heels of an increase in trading volume, which reached almost 35% within the past 24 hours. Even though XRP is trading on the green, dropping from the $2.15 level could mean traders started selling for profits, judging the momentum as faint. The token briefly pierced the $2.12 level and touched $2.16 in the early morning hours of Wednesday, but faced rejection when it clocked $2.17 when larger holders took advantage of the improved liquidity to reduce exposure rather than add to positions. During the push toward $2.17, volume spiked to nearly double its 24-hour moving average. The size and speed of the increase showed institutions were active in the reversal. Heavy trading interest emerged precisely as XRP approached its intraday high, matching patterns of distribution at elevated levels. The token then drifted back toward the $2.09–$2.10 range, technical and psychological support zones, absorbing sell orders through the afternoon. Even so, there was little follow-through from buyers who attempted to climb back toward the mid-$2.10s but were thwarted by bears in control of the $2.12 threshold. Capital flowed into large-cap names Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana during the same window, leaving XRP with fewer supportive inflows. Market desks noted that XRP’s rebound attempts were met with immediate resistance from sellers positioned in advance of the $2.12 area. On-chain activity the highest in 2025, CryptoQuant analysis shows At the start of December, CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnChain reported that the XRP Ledger’s Velocity metric went up to a yearly high of 0.0324. It tracks how frequently coins change hands, and acceleration implied XRP was not sitting idle in long-term storage or cold wallets. Coins are purportedly moving between participants, a confirmation XRP has entered one of its most active periods in 2025, but it is unclear if the market is entirely bearish. However, market watcher Dino believes XRP will hold the support zone at $2.03-$2.05, and sell pressure had slowed near the short-term bottom when the Ripple asset briefly bounced back to the $2.10 area. “Social sentiment is notably positive with 83% bullish signals, but the price remains stuck in the 2.03–2.15 range and has not fully reflected the community’s optimism. To break above 2.15, XRP needs a clearer buying push; if successful, it could target 2.20–2.25. If it fails to break through, the price may revisit 2.03,” the analyst denoted . According to Dino, traders are looking for a breakout above resistance or a retest of support before making any moves, adding that XRP was “neither strongly bullish nor bearish.” Away from the spot market, United States XRP spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) net inflows totaled $230 million in the week ending December 5 from all four issuers, with no outflows recorded. Per data compiled by Finbold from CoinGlass on December 1, flows neared $90 million, including $52 million moving into the Grayscale product and more than $28 million into Franklin’s XRPZ fund.

On November 10, 2025, the value stood at $7.03 billion, with XRP trading at $2.50. By December 10, 2025, reserve value had fallen to $5.70 billion, reflecting a $1.32 billion decrease, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from CryptoQuant . This reduction represents an 18.83% drop in XRP reserves over the one-month period. One-month XRP exchange reserve value. Source: CryptoQuant Notably, the falling reserves coincide with price movements suggesting traders are withdrawing XRP from exchanges or trimming positions. The data shows fluctuating reserve levels, with notable drops in early November, a brief recovery in late November, and a renewed plunge in early December. This pattern may indicate that market participants are turning more cautious, possibly moving away from speculative positions or taking profits during heightened volatility. Impact on XRP price At the same time, the decline in exchange reserves points to reduced market liquidity, as fewer tokens remain available on exchanges. Lower liquidity typically increases an asset’s vulnerability to large price swings, potentially undermining XRP’s price stability. Combined with softer trading prices, the shrinking reserves suggest weaker short-term demand for XRP, which may continue to pressure its valuation. The downturn comes during a period when XRP has struggled to maintain key support levels such as $2, weighed down by broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. This decline has persisted despite U.S. spot exchange-traded funds recording sustained inflows even under bearish market conditions. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.08, up about 0.6% in the past 24 hours, while down roughly 5% on the week. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP’s price remains notably below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2.30 and 200-day SMA of $2.62, reinforcing a bearish short- to medium-term trend as the asset trades in downtrend territory without bullish crossover support. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 47.18, a neutral reading that suggests limited immediate momentum for a reversal but potential stabilization if buying pressure pushes it toward the 50 level.

According to a compelling analysis, the answer may already be baked into the cake. Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. suggests that Bitcoin has not only resumed its bullish structure but has also likely priced in expectations for three consecutive interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. This insight provides a crucial framework for understanding the current market dynamics. What Does It Mean for Bitcoin to Price in Fed Rate Cuts? When markets ‘price in’ an event, they adjust asset values based on the anticipated future outcome. For Bitcoin , the expectation of lower interest rates is a powerful catalyst. Lower rates typically weaken the US dollar and make non-yielding assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Therefore, the recent recovery from the $80,000 correction zone may reflect investors positioning themselves ahead of this potential monetary policy shift. How Do Fed Rate Cuts Influence Bitcoin’s Price? The connection between the Federal Reserve and Bitcoin is stronger than many realize. Here’s a simple breakdown of the mechanism: Cheaper Money: Rate cuts lower borrowing costs, potentially increasing liquidity that can flow into risk assets. Weaker Dollar: Bitcoin often has an inverse relationship with the US Dollar Index (DXY). A weaker dollar can boost BTC’s appeal as an alternative store of value. Search for Yield: With lower returns on traditional savings, investors may seek higher potential returns in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, the analyst’s view that Bitcoin Fed rate cuts expectations are already reflected in its price suggests the market is forward-looking. The key question now is: what happens next? Is the Rally Sustainable or Is Bitcoin Ahead of Itself? This is the critical challenge for investors. If the market has fully absorbed the news of three Fed rate cuts , the immediate bullish impulse might be exhausted. The future price action will then depend on whether the Fed delivers as expected or if new economic data alters the trajectory. A deviation from the anticipated three cuts could introduce volatility. However, the resumption of a bullish structure indicates strong underlying demand, potentially providing a floor for prices. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Understanding that Bitcoin may have priced in this scenario changes the investment perspective. Instead of buying on the expectation of the event, focus shifts to monitoring the Fed’s actual decisions and broader macroeconomic signals. Consider these points: Watch the Data: Pay close attention to inflation (CPI) and employment reports, as they directly influence Fed policy. Diversify Timing: Avoid going all-in at once; consider dollar-cost averaging to manage timing risk. Look Beyond Headlines: The narrative around Bitcoin Fed rate cuts is important, but also assess on-chain metrics and institutional adoption trends. In summary, the analysis presents a fascinating narrative: Bitcoin’s current strength may be a testament to the market’s efficiency in anticipating a dovish turn from the Federal Reserve. While this provides a logical explanation for the rally, it also sets the stage for a market that will now react to the reality of policy decisions versus expectations. The bullish structure is a positive sign, but sustained growth will require continued positive fundamentals and the actualization of projected Fed rate cuts . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘priced in’ mean in cryptocurrency markets? A: ‘Priced in’ means that the potential impact of a future event, like Fed rate cuts , has already been reflected in an asset’s current market price based on investor expectations. Q: Why do interest rate cuts potentially help Bitcoin? A: Rate cuts can lead to a weaker US dollar and increase market liquidity. This often drives investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin in search of higher returns. Q: If Bitcoin has priced in the cuts, should I still buy? A: It suggests the immediate news may be absorbed. Future price action will depend on the Fed’s actual decisions and other factors. A long-term, disciplined strategy is often wiser than trying to time the market. Q: How many Fed rate cuts are expected in 2024? A: As per the analyst cited and current market derivatives (like the CME FedWatch Tool), the expectation is for three 0.25% rate cuts within the year, though this can change with new economic data. Q: Could Bitcoin price fall if the Fed cuts fewer than three times? A: Yes, that is a risk. If the Fed is less aggressive than the market expects, it could lead to a reassessment and potential short-term downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price.

Solana has been gaining renewed backing from a trillion-dollar asset manager, XRP is experiencing sustained ETF interest across major markets, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through a near-complete presale that has become a focal point for those analyzing the best cryptos to buy now before the next market rotation. Together, these three assets are taking center stage for traders examining which crypto to buy today for long-term positioning. Solana Price Strengthens After Vanguard Entry Solana has been rising in visibility after Vanguard reversed its crypto restrictions, granting access to Solana-linked ETFs to over 50 million clients. This shift immediately triggered inflows exceeding $46.7 million on the announcement day, forming a clear indication that institutional buyers are targeting SOL even during uncertain market phases. Momentum has been building across technical indicators as well. The token recently confirmed a double bottom formation around the critical 120 dollar area, a level that historically acted as a launch point throughout previous expansions. RSI readings have also lifted from oversold territory, supporting the view held by many evaluating the top cryptocurrencies that Solana could recover further. A break above 144 dollars would complete the neckline structure, placing 210 dollars as the next technical checkpoint. Analysts tracking the best cryptocurrency to invest in have argued that a move toward 500 dollars becomes increasingly plausible if descending triangle resistance fractures convincingly. The combination of ETF accessibility, strong inflows and renewed retail confidence has placed Solana among the top crypto to buy as 2026 approaches. XRP Recovery Hinges On ETF Inflow Support XRP has been continuing to attract institutional attention after posting a 13-day streak of positive ETF inflows that brought total holdings near 900 million dollars. This steady activity has softened price volatility, helping XRP recover from its recent drop to the 1.81 dollar region. Ripple’s expanded licensing in Abu Dhabi has also enabled RLUSD to reach a 1 billion dollar market cap across the EMEA region, further reinforcing fundamental adoption. However, the chart shows that XRP remains at a decisive junction. The asset has touched the upper boundary of a descending channel, and traders monitoring what crypto to buy now are watching the 2.2 dollar region as the primary breakout threshold. A confirmed move over that level would establish a classic W-pattern reversal, potentially preparing XRP for a stronger extension. Without this confirmation, downside tests near 1.8 dollars remain possible. Even so, ETF inflows continue to maintain confidence among holders considering the best crypto to invest in during a shifting macro cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Expansion Continues Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been drawing strong attention from buyers tracking the next big cryptocurrency. Phase 6 of the presale is 98% filled, and the price remains at $0.035, up from $0.01 in Phase 1. A total of $19,200,000 has been raised so far, and the holder count stands at 18,380. Demand continues rising as investors recognize that Phase 7 will open at $0.04, closing the opportunity to acquire tokens at the lowest valuation before the launch price of 0.06 dollars. Early participants would therefore secure an estimated upside of about 340% at listing, a figure driving significant urgency as Phase 6 selling accelerates. Many evaluating the best crypto to invest in have turned toward MUTM precisely because this final $0.035 window is ending rapidly. MUTM Giveaway & Card Purchases Now Available Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is simultaneously running a $100,000 giveaway, distributing ten allocations of $10,000 each to celebrate the presale. This initiative has increased user engagement and added another incentive layer for investors assessing what crypto to buy before 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently introduced card-based purchases with no limits, allowing contributors to acquire tokens instantly through an integrated payment link, expanding accessibility for participants who prefer direct transactions. Solana, XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are shaping discussions within crypto news today as investors determine the best crypto to buy now for next-year positioning. Any investor preparing for 2026 may review these opportunities while the current market cycle continues to reset.

55592952,642926,1765360856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55592952.jpeg,Midnight Goes Live As Cardano Founder Targets A $10 Billion Ecosystem,https://bitcoinist.com/midnight-live-cardano-founder-10-billion-ecosystem/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has declared Midnight officially launched, describing it as the “first fourth generation cryptocurrency” and claiming it has already become “a billion dollar ecosystem heading to a $10 billion ecosystem.” In a December 9 livestream from Colorado, recorded after he was forced to cancel an appearance at Abu Dhabi Finance Week due to severe food poisoning and a jet malfunction, Hoskinson framed the launch as both a technical milestone and an ideological statement about how cryptocurrencies should be built and distributed. Cardano Founder Touts Midnight’s Fair Launch Despite saying he had “not eaten in two days” and was “a little faded,” the Cardano founder focused on the scale and duration of the effort behind Midnight. “We worked on it for six years,” he said, noting “many false starts” and several technology changes before the team converged on “a roadmap and a technology stack that we feel is going to be the tech stack of the future.” Midnight’s rollout, he stressed, is structured in four phases, with the project now “in the very first phase” of that plan. The next stage, according to the Cardan founder, will significantly expand Midnight’s capabilities. Over the coming months, the team intends to bring up a federated mainnet and an incentivized testnet, then activate “hybrid DApps with each ecosystem.” He said “the next nine months is going to be a lot of fun” but also “a lot of work for all of us,” pointing to features such as “true hybrid applications, true multi-resource consensus, [and] true post-quantum folding schemes” that aim to “advance the state-of-the-art of all of the zero knowledge stacks.” The overarching goal, he argued, is “creating a natural easy way for people [to] get their privacy back.” Privacy and chain-agnostic interoperability are at the core of how Hoskinson positioned Midnight. He said users are “starting to realize and starting to wake up that their privacy is not a guarantee and it’s not a given,” and criticized existing systems as “designed from the ground up to take your privacy from you.” Midnight, by contrast, is framed as infrastructure that can be used by “every single blockchain in the space.” “What makes Midnight so special is the fact that Midnight is for everyone,” he said. “It has equal application to Solana users and Avalanche users and Ethereum users and Binance users and Cardano users and Bitcoin users and everyone else in between.” The Cardano repeatedly emphasized distribution and launch mechanics as a deliberate rejection of the venture-driven model that dominates much of the industry. He highlighted that Midnight was brought to market “in a completely decentralized way” with “no ICO, no insiders, no VC participation.” The outcome, in his view, is that “every single user enjoys the fact that it had a fair launch and a fair distribution and every single person was on equal footing through the Glacier Drop , the Scavenger Hunt, and now the exchange distributions.” On that basis, he argued that “it’s still possible in 2025 to launch a cryptocurrency the way Satoshi did it” and “still possible to build something with vision and values where we can do better and not hand the world over to centralized actors, the finance of old.” Hoskinson Warns Of Regulatory Overreach He also used the Midnight launch to issue a broader warning about regulation and the direction of the industry if privacy-preserving infrastructure is not defended. “Right now the laws are being written. They’re written the wrong way,” he said. “If the rulemaking is done the wrong way, every single thing that makes cryptocurrency special will be taken from us.” Hoskinson rejected a future where “only custodial wallets” exist, “every single person has to be KYC and AML ,” and “only five or 10 protocols are pre-selected” and “armchair controlled by a small cabal of international bankers.” Instead, he said, “I want to live in a world where the protocols preserve and protect your rights as a human, your agency as a human, your economic identity as a human.” Hoskinson described Midnight as “probably the fastest growing and most vocal project we’ve ever built,” pointing to “hundreds of ambassadors” coming online and a rapidly filling Discord, which he framed as a gathering point for those who believe in “freedom of association, commerce, and expression.” He ended with a direct call to action: “I want you to join the Discord. I want you to become an ambassador and tell each and every person that we can do better. And I want you to build on Midnight.” Whatever network developers come from, he said, “just build something and show the world that you can do interesting and cool things,” adding that for him and his team, “we’re in it for life.” At press time, Cardano traded at $0.4621.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|Midnight|NIGHT,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-10 10:00:56

According to the groundbreaking 2025 Global Crypto Ranking Report by Bybit and DL Research, that nation is Singapore, which has seized the top spot in global crypto adoption . Surpassing 78 other countries, this city-state demonstrates what happens when clear regulation meets technological ambition. Why Does Singapore Lead in Crypto Adoption? The report analyzed 79 nations, ranking them on factors like regulatory clarity, public interest, and institutional participation. Singapore claimed first place, followed by the United States, Lithuania, Switzerland, and the UAE. This leadership isn’t accidental. Singapore’s government has actively cultivated a pro-innovation environment while implementing robust consumer protection frameworks. This balance gives businesses and individuals the confidence to engage deeply with digital assets. What’s Fueling This Massive Growth? Beyond the ranking, the report reveals powerful trends making crypto adoption tangible. The market for Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization—where physical assets like real estate or commodities are represented on a blockchain—exploded by 63% to reach $2.57 billion. This isn’t niche tech; it’s a fundamental shift in how we own and trade value. Furthermore, the rise of national stablecoins is staggering. Projects issuing digital currencies backed by sovereign fiat, like the Singapore Dollar, are growing rapidly. They provide a stable bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. How Is Crypto Changing Everyday Work? The most relatable sign of crypto adoption might be your paycheck. The report found that on-chain salary payments now account for 9.6% of all payroll transactions. Over 90% of these payments are settled using stablecoins, offering employees speed, lower fees, and borderless receipt of funds. Consider the benefits: Instant Settlement: No more waiting days for bank transfers. Reduced Costs: Minimizes intermediary banking fees. Financial Inclusion: Provides banking services to the unbanked via a smartphone. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Global Adoption? Singapore’s success provides a blueprint, but challenges remain for worldwide crypto adoption . Regulatory fragmentation across different countries creates complexity for global businesses. Security concerns and the need for greater public education are also persistent hurdles. However, the trends in RWA tokenization and stablecoin use show the technology is moving beyond speculation to solve real-world problems in finance and logistics. What Can We Learn from Singapore’s Model? Singapore’s top ranking offers actionable insights. First, clear and proactive regulation attracts investment instead of stifling it. Second, integrating crypto with existing financial systems, as seen with stablecoins, encourages mainstream use. Finally, focusing on utility—like paying salaries or tokenizing assets—proves that cryptocurrency’s value extends far beyond trading charts. In conclusion, the 2025 report paints a clear picture: crypto adoption is accelerating, driven by pragmatic use cases and pioneering nations. Singapore leads by showing that the future of finance is a blend of innovation and intelligent oversight. This isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about building a more efficient, inclusive, and transparent global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘crypto adoption’ mean in this report? In this context, crypto adoption refers to how deeply cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are integrated into a country’s economy and daily life. The ranking considers factors like regulatory support, public participation, and commercial use cases like payroll and asset tokenization. Why is Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization important? RWA tokenization turns physical assets (e.g., property, art, commodities) into digital tokens on a blockchain. This makes them easier to divide, trade, and manage, increasing liquidity and opening investment opportunities to more people. Its 63% growth signals a major shift toward practical blockchain utility. Are stablecoins safe for receiving salaries? Stablecoins designed for payroll are typically backed 1:1 by fiat currency held in reserves, making them less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When issued by reputable, regulated projects, they offer a fast and cost-effective way to receive payments, especially across borders. Could other countries replicate Singapore’s success? Yes, but it requires a balanced approach. Singapore combined welcoming regulations for innovation with strong consumer protection laws. Other nations need to create similar legal clarity and foster partnerships between traditional finance and crypto firms to boost adoption. What is the biggest barrier to global crypto adoption? Inconsistent and unclear regulations across different countries remain a significant barrier. This creates uncertainty for businesses and users. Increasing public education to demystify crypto technology and its benefits is also crucial for wider acceptance. How does on-chain salary payment work? Instead of a traditional bank transfer, an employer sends payment in stablecoins directly to an employee’s digital wallet address on a blockchain. The transaction is recorded on a public ledger, settling in minutes, and the employee can then hold, convert, or spend the digital currency.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has indicated that crypto companies seeking federal charters should be assessed on the same basis as traditional banks. This position creates a clear path for Ripple to pursue a National Trust Charter, a step that would meaningfully change how XRP functions within regulated financial infrastructure. OCC Just Quietly Greenlit Ripple’s Endgame: A Federally Chartered XRP Bank. OCC Comptroller Jonathan Gould: “Crypto firms should be treated like banks when applying for federal charters.” Read that again. Not “maybe.” Not “someday.” Equal footing with banks. Why this is… pic.twitter.com/7rEYOMK3Xn — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) December 9, 2025 What A National Trust Charter Would Allow If a Ripple secured such a charter, its role would extend far beyond operating a digital asset platform. A federally chartered trust can perform custody, clearing, and settlement functions under direct federal supervision. This also brings potential access to Federal Reserve payment systems, repo facilities, treasury market infrastructure, and established institutional custody frameworks. Under these conditions, XRP could operate as a regulated settlement asset rather than simply a digital token, enabling more direct integration into established financial systems. The charter would also allow the institution to connect to global liquidity channels without relying on intermediaries. This creates the possibility of building settlement pathways that are more direct, more compliant, and more suitable for institutional use. These changes would shift XRP’s utility from transactional movement to functioning as part of the underlying infrastructure that supports regulated financial transfers. Operational Changes And Institutional Use Cases With a federal charter, Ripple could facilitate cross-border settlement without the need for correspondent banks. This would reduce the inefficiencies found in nostro-vostro arrangements by enabling settlement through a single regulated institution with access to U.S. payment rails. It also opens the door to managing tokenised treasuries and corporate debt at scale, which requires a regulated framework, institutional-grade custody, and verifiable settlement finality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Such a setup could allow XRP to serve as a neutral bridge asset in multi-currency clearing environments. Instead of relying on several intermediaries, institutions could settle obligations through one supervised entity capable of handling liquidity, custody, and settlement flows. Regulatory And Institutional Considerations Earning a federal charter would bring significant oversight. Prudential regulation, compliance obligations, and risk management requirements would increase. Institutions considering XRP for settlement would still need to align these activities with internal policies and external regulatory expectations. Even so, the OCC’s stance establishes a clear and formal route for eligible crypto firms to be treated on equal regulatory footing with banks.

This launch, featuring support for up to 50x leverage, provides traders with a powerful new instrument to capitalize on NIGHT’s price movements. Let’s explore what this means for your trading strategy and the broader market. What Are NIGHT/USDT Perpetual Futures? Perpetual futures, or “perps,” are derivative contracts that allow you to speculate on an asset’s future price without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, you can hold these positions indefinitely, provided you maintain the required margin. The new NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures contract on Binance will let traders go long (betting the price will rise) or short (betting it will fall) on the NIGHT token, using Tether (USDT) as the settlement currency. The key details for the launch are straightforward: Listing Time: December 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM UTC. Leverage: Up to 50x is available, allowing for amplified positions. Ticker: NIGHTUSDT. Settlement: Settled in USDT, simplifying the process for many traders. Why Is This Binance Listing a Game-Changer? Binance’s decision to list NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures is a major vote of confidence in the token’s liquidity and market interest. Listings on the world’s largest crypto exchange typically lead to increased visibility, trading volume, and price discovery for the asset. For traders, this creates fresh opportunities. The availability of 50x leverage means that even small price movements can translate into substantial profits—however, it also magnifies potential losses, making risk management non-negotiable. This launch aligns with a growing trend of major exchanges expanding their derivatives offerings to meet trader demand for sophisticated tools. Therefore, it signals that NIGHT is joining a select group of altcoins with robust futures market support. How Can You Trade These New Futures Safely? While the allure of 50x leverage is powerful, navigating NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures requires a disciplined approach. First, understand the funding rate mechanism, which is a periodic fee exchanged between long and short positions to keep the contract’s price aligned with the spot market. Secondly, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum risk before entering a trade. The high leverage means market volatility can quickly trigger liquidations if your position moves against you. Consider these actionable steps before trading: Start Small: Use lower leverage (like 5x or 10x) to get a feel for the contract’s behavior. Monitor Funding Rates: A highly positive or negative rate can significantly impact the cost of holding a position. Stay Informed: Follow NIGHT’s project developments and overall market sentiment, as these are key price drivers. What Does This Mean for the Future of NIGHT? The introduction of a NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures market is more than just a new trading pair. It often leads to greater market efficiency and can attract institutional and professional traders seeking hedging capabilities. For the NIGHT ecosystem, this enhanced liquidity and exposure can foster greater stability and investor interest over the long term. However, it also introduces the potential for increased short-term price volatility, especially around the listing time. In summary, Binance’s launch is a pivotal moment that integrates NIGHT deeper into the global crypto financial system. It provides tools for advanced speculation and risk management, marking the token’s maturation within the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will Binance list the NIGHT/USDT perpetual contract? A1: The listing is scheduled for December 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Q2: What is the maximum leverage available for this futures contract? A2: Binance will support leverage of up to 50x for the NIGHT/USDT perpetual futures contract. Q3: Do perpetual futures contracts expire? A3: No, that’s what makes them “perpetual.” They have no expiry date, so you can hold a position indefinitely as long as you meet margin requirements. Q4: What are the main risks of trading with high leverage? A4: The primary risk is liquidation. High leverage amplifies both gains and losses. A small adverse price move can wipe out your margin and close your position automatically. Q5: How is the price of a perpetual futures contract maintained? A5: It’s primarily maintained through a “funding rate”—a periodic payment between long and short traders that incentivizes the contract price to track the underlying spot price. Q6: Can I trade this contract from the United States? A6: No. Binance.com is not available to users in the United States. U.S. residents must use the separate Binance.US platform, which may not offer this product. Ready to dive into the latest crypto trading opportunities?

This adjustment comes at a crucial time for traders monitoring Central European currencies, particularly those with exposure to the CZK exchange rate . The Swiss banking giant’s updated analysis provides essential insights for cryptocurrency investors who often watch traditional currency movements for broader market signals. Why Did UBS Adjust Its Czech Koruna Forecast? UBS economists have tempered their optimism about the Czech koruna’s near-term performance after observing several key factors. The bank’s previous bullish stance has been revised downward due to changing economic conditions both domestically and internationally. This UBS currency analysis highlights how central bank policies, inflation trends, and regional economic developments are converging to create a more challenging environment for the CZK. Three primary factors influenced UBS’s revised outlook: Slower-than-expected economic growth in the Czech Republic Changing interest rate differentials with the Eurozone Reduced foreign investment inflows into Czech assets Understanding the EUR/CZK Outlook and Market Implications The EUR/CZK outlook has become increasingly important for traders as the currency pair reflects broader economic relationships between the Czech Republic and the Eurozone. UBS’s analysis suggests that the koruna’s appreciation against the euro may face headwinds in the coming months, potentially creating trading opportunities for alert investors. Time Frame Previous Forecast Revised Forecast Key Drivers 3 Months 24.10 CZK/EUR 24.50 CZK/EUR Interest rate differentials 6 Months 23.80 CZK/EUR 24.30 CZK/EUR Economic growth projections 12 Months 23.50 CZK/EUR 24.00 CZK/EUR Inflation convergence How Does This Czech Koruna Analysis Impact Forex Market Trends? The revised Czech koruna forecast from UBS signals broader shifts in forex market trends that cryptocurrency traders should monitor. Currency movements often precede or accompany shifts in risk appetite across financial markets, including digital assets. The koruna’s performance against major currencies can serve as a barometer for investor sentiment toward emerging European markets. Key implications for traders include: Potential increased volatility in CZK pairs Changed correlation patterns with other risk assets New arbitrage opportunities between traditional and digital assets What Does UBS Currency Analysis Reveal About Regional Stability? UBS’s detailed UBS currency analysis extends beyond simple exchange rate predictions to assess the fundamental health of the Czech economy. The bank’s economists examine multiple indicators including trade balances, foreign reserves, and monetary policy effectiveness. Their findings suggest that while the Czech Republic maintains solid economic fundamentals, external pressures are mounting. The analysis particularly emphasizes: Czech National Bank’s policy trajectory Export competitiveness concerns Regional geopolitical factors affecting currency flows Actionable Insights from the Revised CZK Exchange Rate Forecast For active traders and investors, the updated CZK exchange rate projections offer several actionable insights. Understanding where professional institutions like UBS see currency movements heading can help position portfolios more effectively, whether trading traditional forex pairs or correlated cryptocurrency assets. Consider these strategic approaches: Monitor EUR/CZK for breakout opportunities Watch for spillover effects into cryptocurrency markets Use currency analysis to time broader market entries Frequently Asked Questions What is UBS and why is their currency analysis important? UBS is a leading global financial services company with significant expertise in currency markets. Their analysis is closely watched by institutional and retail traders alike for its depth and accuracy. How does the Czech koruna relate to cryptocurrency markets? While not directly correlated, currency movements often reflect broader risk sentiment that affects all financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Major currency shifts can influence capital flows into and out of digital assets. What is the Czech National Bank’s role in the koruna’s value? The Czech National Bank implements monetary policy that directly affects the koruna’s exchange rate through interest rate decisions and currency interventions when necessary. How accurate have UBS currency forecasts been historically? UBS maintains a strong track record in currency forecasting, though like all predictions, they are subject to market uncertainties and unexpected economic developments. Where can I find more information about forex market analysis? Financial institutions like International Monetary Fund and World Bank provide regular economic analysis that includes currency outlooks for various countries. Conclusion: Navigating Currency Markets with Professional Insight UBS’s revised Czech koruna forecast serves as a crucial reminder that currency markets remain dynamic and responsive to changing economic conditions. The slowing koruna rally highlights how quickly forex market trends can shift, requiring constant vigilance from traders and investors. By understanding the factors behind UBS’s adjusted EUR/CZK outlook , market participants can make more informed decisions across all asset classes, including the increasingly interconnected cryptocurrency markets.

This change effectively removes the house edge from these games. Understanding Return to Player (RTP) RTP refers to the percentage of total wagers a game is designed to pay back to players over time. For example, a game with 97% RTP would return $97 for every $100 wagered, on average. A 100% RTP indicates a zero house edge, positioning the game to return the full wagered amount over time. Gamdom Originals Now Run at 100% RTP All Gamdom Originals now operate with: 100% RTP Zero house edge Full return on every wager Compared to traditional online casino games, which typically maintain a 95–97% RTP, Gamdom’s adjustment eliminates the house margin entirely for its original games. Highlights of the Gamdom Originals Lineup Crash – A multiplier-based game where players aim to cash out before the increasing multiplier crashes. The 100% RTP setup enhances round-by-round fairness. Dice – Players guess whether a number will be higher or lower than a target. Now operating with 100% RTP for increased long-term returns. Mines – A tile-reveal game similar to Minesweeper. Players aim to avoid mines and collect payouts. The update increases payout transparency and player value. Plinko – Players drop a ball through a pegged board aiming for slots with multipliers up to 1,000x. The 100% RTP setup adds statistical parity to each drop. Roulette – A modernized take on the classic casino game, now with a zero-edge RTP framework. Keno – Players choose numbers in hopes of matching draws for large multipliers.

The filing and the chart setup now frame the next move, as markets watch whether Bitcoin can break higher toward $100,000 or slip back toward support. Bitcoin ‘After Dark’ ETF Filing Targets Overnight Price Gains A new filing confirms plans for an exchange-traded fund designed to hold Bitcoin only at night. The proposal, submitted by Tidal Trust II for the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF, outlines a strategy that buys Bitcoin exposure at the U.S. market close and sells it shortly after the opening bell. The document says the fund will enter Bitcoin positions around 4 p.m. Eastern time. Then, it will unwind those positions after 9:30 a.m., limiting exposure to the overnight window. During daytime trading hours, the ETF plans to keep assets in short-term U.S. Treasuries, money-market funds and cash equivalents. The issuer cites data showing that much of Bitcoin’s historical upside has occurred outside regular U.S. stock-market hours. Because of that pattern, the fund aims to capture those overnight moves while avoiding daytime volatility. The filing shows that the strategy remains a proposal and still requires approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin Tests $92K–$94K Resistance as Trader Maps Next Levels Bitcoin has returned to a key resistance band between $92,000 and $94,000, according to a chart shared by trader Ted, who posts as @TedPillows on X. The daily chart shows price pressing into that zone after bouncing from support below $90,000. Bitcoin Resistance At 92K To 94K. Source: TedPillows on X In his post, Ted said a clean move above this resistance could open the way for a rally toward $100,000. The chart outlines an upside path with successive higher highs if buyers push through the band and hold above it. However, Ted also warned that a failure at this level would likely send Bitcoin back to retest the $90,000 area. The downside scenario on the chart shows another rejection from resistance followed by a drop toward lower support if sellers regain control.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 11:43:22

Set for launch in Q1 2026, the upgrade positions Zcash for a broader role in DeFi while maintaining its privacy-first architecture. Communication becomes more effective when it reflects what the market is paying attention to, and Outset PR incorporates this principle into its workflow. The agency follows ongoing developments — including upgrades, governance proposals, and shifts in sector focus — to understand when a narrative is most likely to resonate. Ztarknet L2 Could Reshape Zcash’s Role in DeFi Proposed on 6 November 2025, Ztarknet expands Zcash beyond shielded transfers. By enabling private smart contracts, the upgrade could draw developers and users seeking confidential DeFi environments, a niche where Zcash holds clear structural advantages. At the same time, Shielded Labs proposed shifting from fixed fees to median-based dynamic pricing. The change aims to mitigate spam attacks and improve efficiency, though fluctuating costs may initially confuse users accustomed to stable fees. Adoption will largely depend on seamless wallet integration. If interfaces fail to adapt quickly, user friction could slow momentum despite strong underlying technology. ZEC Price Outlook: Uptrend Requires a Confirmed Breakout ZEC rebounded from support near $350 and now tests resistance around $420. The RSI at 46 indicates capacity for further upside, but the MACD remains negative, signaling unfinished recovery. A daily close above $455 — the 50-day simple moving average — would strengthen bullish structure and open the path toward $500. Until then, ZEC trades in a developing uptrend rather than a fully confirmed reversal. How Outset PR Shapes Crypto Narratives Through Market Awareness Outset PR tracks market developments to build narratives that align with real demand cycles and audience behavior. The agency bases its approach on data rather than broad messaging, ensuring each campaign fits the market moment. Founded by strategist Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR uses its proprietary Outset Data Pulse system to monitor media trendlines and traffic distribution. This intelligence helps determine the best timing, angles, and outlets for coverage, increasing the lift of each message. Another in-house tool, Syndication Map identifies which publications trigger the strongest downstream distribution across platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, often multiplying campaign visibility. By merging narrative design with real-time market analysis, Outset PR ensures communication strategies reflect what the market is paying attention to. What’s Driving ZEC’s Momentum The latest rally reflects anticipation around Ztarknet, increased partnership activity, and speculative positioning ahead of major upgrades. As Zcash transitions toward a more versatile ecosystem, investor attention has shifted from pure privacy use cases to emerging DeFi opportunities. If Ztarknet delivers functional private smart contracts and user-facing tools catch up, ZEC could see sustained inflows throughout 2026.

The firm aims to use the funds to expand its infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization (RWAs). According to the Real Finance press release, Nimbus Capital contributed approximately $25 million to the funding round, alongside contributions from Magnus Capital and Frekaz Group. The firm noted that the investment will help develop the compliance, settlement, and operational systems required for regulated financial institutions to move traditional financial assets onto blockchain networks. Real Finance targets to tokenize $500 million in RWA in the first year Real Finance, a real-world asset tokenization network, revealed today that it aims to tokenize approximately $500 million in real-world assets in the first year, a figure it estimates would represent 2% of the total tokenized RWA market. According to Real Finance, the capital raised in the latest funding round will be used to build a full-stack infrastructure layer designed for banks, asset managers, and regulated financial service providers seeking to issue custody or transact in tokenized assets. Ivo Grigorov, CEO of Real Finance, said that the funding round confirms the firm’s approach to building institutional-grade tokenization infrastructure. Grigorov added that the investment places Real Finance in a position that allows millions of dollars in real-world assets to flow through their platform. He acknowledged Nimbus Capital’s support, noting that they are on course to power the next generation of global financial infrastructure. Nimbus Capital managing partner Rober Baker revealed that they believe Real Finance is creating a secure and compliant foundation that institutions require to participate in tokenized asset markets. Meanwhile, Real Finance is developing relationships with banks across various regions, including Canal Bank in Panama and Wiener Bank in Austria, as well as an alliance of regulated financial institutions and service providers in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The collaborations will help in the expansion of tokenized products and compliance across various jurisdictions. Matthijs Van Driel, co-founder of Magnus Capital, said that Magnus Capital is positioned to capture a significant share of the growing RWA market. According to Driel, 2025 has demonstrated a real institutional demand for RWAs, and he is confident that 2026 will attract more capital across the tokenization market. Real Finance to address compliance hurdles in tokenized markets The RWA sector has recorded major improvements across the U.S. Treasuries, private credit, tokenized institutional funds, and emerging alternative assets. Tokenized money market funds also recorded significant growth in the past year, driven by interest from major financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon. Total RWA market value. Source: RWA.xyz The total RWA market value is distributed across the U.S. Treasury debt, holding $8.6 billion, followed by commodities at $3.2 billion, and Institutional Alternative Funds at $2.4 billion. Private equity stands at $2.3 billion, and public equity at $686.5 million. The market is expected to receive broader adoption of blockchain infrastructure across the capital markets sectors if interest in tokenized short-term assets continues to flow. Real Finance noted that its infrastructure will address the operational and compliance challenges currently faced when entering the tokenization market. The firm revealed that the infrastructure is a dual validator network architecture that integrates tokenization firms, risk assessors, and insurers directly into consensus, offering ways to recover from disasters and risk management. For institutions to participate safely in tokenized asset markets, Real Finance revealed several components required, including custody frameworks for tokenized instruments. The firm added that settlement systems capable of near-instant finality, compliance tools for KYC/AML requirements, and connectivity between TradFi and DeFi ecosystems are part of the components required to operate safely in tokenized market environments. Real Finance is also focused on enabling interoperability across different tokenization standards and blockchain networks.

And what better altcoin to use than XRP? It’s currently trading at around $2.08 and volatility is starting to pick up across the market. As CryptoPotato reported yesterday, Bitcoin’s price shot up to $94.6K in minutes on escalating odds of another rate cut today. That said, we decided to task three advanced AI systems with projecting the asset’s next major move, mostly done through ChatGPT’s engine – namely, a pretend trend-based neural network, an LSTM designed to detect cyclical patterns, and a multi-factor AI. The results were interesting and, honestly, rather surprising. Let’s have a look. Model #1: A Trend-Based Neural Network Signals a Momentum Shift for XRP’s Price The first system that came through ChatGPT is a trend-based neural network trained on multi-year XRP price patterns. It flagged a possible early-stage bullish reversal, using the following parameters. First, it outlined a support zone between $2.05 and $2.10. According to the AI, the region has so far acted as a reactive support floor in five separate instances over the past 90 days. It suggested that this makes it a zone with a high structural integrity score. In simple words, it means that the price has repeatedly tested this zone so far, and it hasn’t fallen through. The second parameter that it looked at is the flattening of short-term moving averages. The model outlines that the 20-day EMA has compressed to stay within 0.7% of the 50-day EMA. According to it, this is a pattern that historically preceded upside shifts in 2021 and late 2023. At number three, the model looked at the volume stability. It outlined stable $3.7 billion in daily volume (data cross-checked against CoinMarketCap figures), which is only 9% below last month’s average, despite the price trading within a relatively narrow range. The neural net model interprets this as accumulation and not as distribution. Taking all of the above into account, the model assigns a 62% probability to a “momentum deviation event.” What this means is it believes there is a high chance of a move that would see XRP’s price break out of the current pattern and its bias is tilted toward the upside. Model #2: An LSTM Predicts Incoming Volatility, But There’s a Twist The second model that ChatGPT simulated was an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) that is designed to detect certain patterns that cycle within noisy markets. Interestingly, it delivered a similar outcome, although it came with a twist. The numbers behind it prediction are derived from the following parameters. First, it looked at the difference between XRP’s weekly high and low, which has shrunk to around 5%. According to the model, this is the tightest range since July, which checks out. This, according to the model, is a precursor to a vicious move. Moreover, the 30-day volatility is down to slightly above 10% for December, as opposed to an average of close to 50% for the past 12 months. This is a classic signal of a “coiled spring.” Last but not least, this model also identifies a 22% increase in reaction intensity against S&P 500 and DXY correlations. This suggests that macro catalysts could produce outsized reactions in the XRP price. The bottom line here is that it assigns a 73% probability that XRP will break its current structure with a move of up to 18% within a short term, without specifying the direction and weighing macro events as the main catalyst. This is interesting because just tonight there’s the FOMC meeting that will decide on whether or not to cut interest rates. Model #3: A Multi-Factor AI Bets on Macro-Driven Breakout Taking into account certain factors such as the current XRPL velocity of around 0.0324, which is the highest level in 2025. This means that XRP is changing hands more rapidly, and it’s not staying idle in cold wallets. According to the model, this tends to correlate with stronger liquidity, active trading, and institutional flows, albeit occasionally. Moreover, the last model also took into account the rising transaction and payment volume growth, suggesting that “settlement activity for cross-border and insitutional use cases” is growing. To top it all up, the AI suggests that there will possibly be reduced selling pressure ahead as the exchange-flow outlines that more XRP is leaving centralized exchanges, as opposed to coming in. This is commonly associated with longer-term holding behaviors. Conclusion: Volatility Incoming, but Which Way? With all of the above in consideration, it appears that all three models unanimously believe that there will be increased volatility, with some of them assigning higher probabilities of an upside move, rather than a bearish breakdown. Key levels to watch remain within the range between $2.22 and $2.28 as important near-term resistance zones.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces buying pressure toward $0.152 WLFI price is facing a surge as buyers push the price toward $0.152. WLFI price is aiming for a hold above the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged toward $14.7 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.152, surging over 1.5% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades above the midline at level 51, suggesting minor buying pressure. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bullish activity around EMA lines, creating a positive sentiment on the price chart. As the price hovers above EMA trend lines, bears prepare for a domination by sending the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.07, hinting that buyers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost upward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, hinting at a bullish pressure.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the WLFI price from an immediate surge. However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.1635, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.1896. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1427, resulting in a correction to $0.1163. WLFI crypto news The U.S. crypto market structure bill is being delayed by disputes over a potential ban on stablecoin yield programs, Trump-linked conflicts of interest from WLFI token sales, and unresolved questions around DeFi regulation such as developer liability. This uncertainty is short-term bearish for WLFI. Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price down today? Sellers are gaining confidence to maintain their dominance, resulting in a downward push toward $0.157. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction December 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in December. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.1 and a maximum price of $0.25, with an average of $0.18 in December.

The market tracks heavy volatility , yet a single number captured more attention than the price. MoonPay posted an image showing a purchase screenshot of exactly 589 XRP with Apple Pay. The update triggered a wave of reactions across the community, and the number raised immediate questions about intent and meaning . The purchase amount appeared simple at first glance. However, the number 589 holds deep significance for XRP holders . The post contained an emoji that strengthened speculation, and the community treated the moment as more than a routine transaction. Conversations shifted toward why MoonPay chose that figure, especially after recent integrations that allow direct XRP purchases through Apple Pay and Google Pay in multiple countries. Community Focus Turns to the Meaning Behind 589 Commentary across X focused on the number rather than the payment method. Many users labeled it the “magic number,” while others revived the long-standing narrative of XRP reaching $589 per coin. Some accounts even welcomed MoonPay to what they call the “XRP Army.” A similar moment surfaced just days earlier when Solana’s official X account posted the number “589” with no explanation . That post drew more than 4.3 million views and created unusual engagement between the XRP and Solana communities. Market watchers questioned whether Solana teased a possible connection involving Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Others suspected Solana attempted to attract XRP’s highly active audience. Source: X This sudden resurgence of the 589 meme raised broader questions. Why does a number from 2018 still carry such influence? A Meme With Deep Origins in XRP Culture The 589 symbol began more than six years ago when an anonymous figure known as Bearableguy123 posted an illustration that referenced a dramatic price target for XRP. That image spread quickly through forums, YouTube channels, and X discussions. It transformed into a cultural marker of extreme long-term optimism within the community. The number eventually turned into an inside joke, a dream scenario, and a symbol of unwavering belief in XRP’s potential utility. Several blockchain commentators say this culture developed because of the token’s unusual mix of institutional ambition, legal milestones, and historical volatility. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse added to the mystery by keeping his X following count fixed at 589 for years. Analysts noticed the number’s appearance in other conversations, including one observation by financial expert Linda P. Jones, who noted that ISO 4217 leaves the number 589 unassigned on its official currency list. That discovery inspired speculation about whether a future digital asset or stablecoin might eventually occupy that slot. The cultural lore remains strong, even as the market environment shifts. This raises a natural question: How seriously do analysts treat the number today? Debate Continues Over Hyper-Bullish Price Targets Community discussions often involve dramatic price forecasts. Market commentator Crypto Bitlord revived the 589 target in new remarks, arguing that predictions such as $6 per coin do not reflect XRP’s full potential . He claimed that those who reject three-figure valuations limit their vision, especially during bullish market conditions. Yet not all analysts agree. Late last year, Tony Edwards dismissed the 589 prediction as unrealistic, calling the idea a fantasy. Some traders echo this view and challenge the feasibility of three-figure outcomes. The contrast between aspirational forecasts and conservative expectations continues to define the XRP debate. Market sentiment evolves quickly, and discussions around extreme long-term valuations often intensify when the token shows strong performance. The recent surge in engagement after MoonPay’s post shows how deeply the 589 symbol remains embedded in XRP’s community identity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 11:51:55

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $91,936.11 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting traders to reassess their positions. Let’s explore what’s driving this volatility and what it could mean for your portfolio. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market analysts point to several interconnected factors behind today’s Bitcoin price decline. First, increased selling pressure from large holders, often called ‘whales,’ created downward momentum. Second, broader macroeconomic concerns, including potential interest rate adjustments, have made investors more risk-averse. Finally, a technical breakdown occurred after BTC failed to hold above $92,500, triggering automated sell orders. Therefore, this is not an isolated event but a result of converging market forces. How Significant is the $92,000 Level for BTC? The $92,000 mark served as a major psychological and technical support zone. A sustained break below this level often indicates a shift in market sentiment from bullish to cautious. Key levels to watch now are: $91,500: The next immediate support based on recent trading ranges. $90,000: A major psychological round number that could attract buyers. $92,500: The new resistance level that BTC must reclaim to signal recovery. Understanding these levels helps traders make informed decisions during volatile periods like this Bitcoin price movement. Should Investors Be Worried About This BTC Dip? Short-term volatility is a fundamental characteristic of cryptocurrency markets. While a falling Bitcoin price can be unsettling, historical patterns show that BTC has recovered from similar corrections. However, investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. For long-term holders, this may represent a potential buying opportunity. For short-term traders, implementing strict risk management is crucial. Moreover, diversifying across different asset classes can protect your overall portfolio from single-asset volatility. What’s the Outlook for Bitcoin Price Recovery? The path for the Bitcoin price depends on both market sentiment and fundamental developments. Positive catalysts, such as increased institutional adoption or favorable regulatory news, could quickly reverse the trend. On-chain data, which tracks the movement of BTC between wallets, will provide clues about accumulation or distribution by major players. Consequently, monitoring these metrics offers a clearer picture than price action alone. The current Bitcoin price action, while negative, is part of a larger market cycle. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Dip Instead of reacting emotionally to the Bitcoin price drop, consider these strategic steps: Review Your Portfolio: Ensure your allocation to volatile assets like BTC aligns with your financial goals. Dollar-Cost Average: If you believe in the long-term thesis, consider buying small amounts at regular intervals. Set Stop-Losses: Protect your capital by defining exit points before entering a trade. Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources for market updates, not just social media hype. Implementing a plan removes emotion from trading decisions. In summary, today’s Bitcoin price movement below $92,000 highlights the inherent volatility of digital assets. While concerning for some, it also presents opportunities for others. The key is to understand the reasons behind the drop, monitor critical support and resistance levels, and stick to a disciplined investment strategy. Market cycles include both rallies and corrections; successful navigation requires patience and perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin fall below $92,000? The drop resulted from a combination of whale selling, negative macroeconomic sentiment, and a technical breakdown after BTC failed to hold higher support levels. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? It depends on your strategy. For long-term investors, dips can be buying opportunities. For short-term traders, waiting for confirmation of a new support level may be wiser. How low could the Bitcoin price go? While predictions are uncertain, traders are watching the $91,500 and $90,000 levels as potential next supports. A break below $90,000 could signal deeper correction. Does this mean the bull market is over? Not necessarily. Bull markets typically experience several sharp corrections. The overall trend remains the most important factor to determine the market phase. What should I do if I’m holding Bitcoin? Assess your original investment thesis. If the long-term reasons for holding BTC are still valid, short-term price action may not warrant a change. Consider your risk tolerance. Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price updates? Use reputable tracking websites and exchanges for real-time data. Avoid making decisions based solely on social media sentiment or unverified sources.

The rally comes as an upcoming network upgrade shifts sentiment around the token. Strong technicals pushed LUNC through major resistance, but after such an explosive move, traders are now looking for the next undervalued opportunity. That spotlight is increasingly turning toward Reactor ($REACT) , currently priced at just $0.035, with a working platform and clear supply-driven token mechanics. Here’s why REACT is emerging as the smarter, earlier entry after LUNC’s surge. LUNC’s Technical Breakout Signals Renewed Appetite for High-Upside Plays The rally of Terra Classic didn’t happen by chance — the chart confirms real momentum. LUNC broke above the 200-day EMA and hit the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Meanwhile, the RSI near 70 signals 70 overbought conditions. The breakout shows bullish continuation potential if LUNC holds above $0.000056, but the overbought RSI and a rejection from the day’s high at $0.0000605 point to rising consolidation risk. For many traders, that means the explosive upside has already been captured. This creates a familiar rotation pattern: when a major low-cap altcoin completes its run, early capital often looks for the next asset with similar upside but a clean, early chart. So why Reactor ($REACT) could be the next breakout coin? Reactor ($REACT): A Live Trading Platform With Real Utility Reactor is one of the most compelling early-stage opportunities in the market, because its product already exists, its user base is growing, and its token mechanics reward adoption instead of speculation. A Unified Terminal That Solves Real Problems Reactor consolidates the entire DeFi workflow into a single professional-grade interface: Spot execution through Perp DEX routing (Aster, Hyperliquid, and others) Unified futures dashboard aggregating derivatives positions Live memecoin launch tracking across Pump.fun, Bonk ecosystems, and major token hubs Yield aggregation from Morpho, Yearn, Forknet, and more Instead of bouncing between 5–7 apps to manage positions, Reactor gives traders a coherent environment optimized for speed and clarity. A Token With Predictable Economics — Not Guesswork $REACT powers the platform’s functionality. As activity grows, commission revenue increases, revenue funds buy-backs and token burns, while the circulating supply decreases naturally over time This creates a transparent relationship between platform usage and token demand — something most early-stage projects lack entirely. Nearly 10 million $REACT tokens have already been sold, showing meaningful traction before listing. Current $0.035 early-stage price offers 66% discount on the upcoming $REACT listing Why REACT Makes Sense After LUNC’s Rally After LUNC’s 120% move, traders now want: A low entry price A strong narrative A catalyst still ahead, not behind A token that hasn’t already run A project with real utility to support long-term appreciation Reactor checks each box efficiently. At $0.035, REACT is near the ground floor compared to most 2025 tokens. LUNC already made its sprint — REACT is still waiting for its first major expansion phase. Upcoming Catalysts Reactor enters 2026 with: Wallet upgrades for iOS and Android A redesigned Fusaka infrastructure for faster, cheaper trades A Public Beta rollout for the Terminal New vault integrations (Morpho, Yearn, Polygon PoS) Early Contributor rewards and Leaderboards A major token listing ahead These catalysts provide sustained momentum. Unlike LUNC, where gains now require chasing an overextended chart, $REACT offers front-loaded asymmetry: a live product, increasing revenue flows, and a token that hasn’t yet priced in platform growth. Conclusion LUNC’s 120% rally proves the market is hungry for low-cost assets with strong catalysts. But the best opportunities come before the parabolic move — not after an overbought breakout. At $0.035, with a functioning multi-layer trading terminal and clear token mechanics tied to real revenue, Reactor ($REACT) stands out as one of the most compelling early-phase altcoins heading into 2026.

People can grab a futuristic looking BTC hardware wallet, named Bitkey, without sharing their home address. According to a post published by Bitkey on X, anyone located in the US can order the hardware wallet and have it shipped to a pickup point like FedEx, Dollar General, Albertsons, Kroger stores, and up to 9,000 Walmart locations. Getting a Bitkey only requires a name and an email address if the user pays in Bitcoin and selects a pickup point. private pick-up your bitkey https://t.co/pV2kXGfagI — jack (@jack) December 2, 2025 Dorsey’s Bitkey works without a seed phrase Bitkey has a different recovery model compared to other hardware wallets. Most crypto hardware wallets rely on a seed phrase, which comprise 12 to 24 combinations of random words. Many people have lost access to their crypto holdings forever. That’s because their seed phrases were lost, stolen, burnt in a fire, or accidentally tossed in the trash. The Bitkey website says, “Seed phrases are hard to manage, easy to lose, and attractive targets for even low-tech scammers.” It continued: “It’s a single point of failure and represents a fundamental weakness of prevailing self-custody models.” Moreover, most crypto wallets are singlesig (single-signature). In other terms, users have one signature to sign all transactions. Hackers have an easy job targeting a singlesig wallet with a seed phrase. Bitkey eliminates the need for a seed phrase. It’s a multisig (multi-signature) wallet with three keys. Each key is saved on a separate device. One key is on the smartphone, another inside the hardware wallet, and the last one is saved on the Bitkey server. This design helps people recover their BTC even if they lose their physical wallet or smartphone. Bitkey signs Bitcoin transactions with two keys To sign a transaction, users need 2 out of 3 keys, usually the keys stored on the smartphone and the hardware wallet. To spend, users must tap the hardware wallet at the back of the phone, similar to how people use Apple Pay at points of sale. Since there are 3 keys and 2 devices plus a server involved in Bitkey’s system design, losing access to the hardware wallet or smartphone isn’t a major problem. If a user loses their smartphone, the wallet app can be recovered using the keys saved on Bitkey and the server. The worst-case scenario is when a user loses their smartphone and Bitkey at the same time. This is solvable too through Recovery Contacts. These are people the user adds in the app when setting their Bitkey for the first time. Bitkey was designed and created by the team behind Square and Cash App. The wallet is available in 95 countries. Last week, Bitkey partnered with Strike, a Bitcoin payments app. US-based Bitkey users can now purchase BTC using Strike and transfer it smoothly to their hardware wallet.

Coinbase Director Conor Grogan identified these holdings earlier this year, estimating that they were worth around $47 million in Bitcoin across dozens of addresses potentially linked to Ross Ulbricht, the marketplace’s creator. Grogan resurfaced that January analysis on Tuesday after a pseudonymous operator “0xG00gly” flagged the latest movements. What fresh hell is this? pic.twitter.com/Pt64kB26pO — Googly (@0xG00gly) December 9, 2025 Individual transfers ranged from micro-amounts of 0.00006 BTC, roughly $5.58, to larger sums exceeding 3.6 BTC, valued at $338,640. The transactions followed a pattern of consolidation, with funds from multiple legacy addresses flowing into the single destination wallet over several hours. Several wallets showed connections to mining activity from the 2011 era, when Bitcoin mining remained accessible to individual participants using standard computer equipment. Ulbricht himself has not publicly commented on the transfers. He served multiple life sentences without parole for creating Silk Road before receiving a full and unconditional pardon from President Donald Trump in January through executive order. Source: CBS The former darknet operator delivered his first public speech following his release in May , emphasizing freedom and decentralization as guiding principles for future technological advancement. While Silk Road facilitated illegal narcotics sales and other prohibited transactions, the platform played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s early adoption. The marketplace processed over 1.5 million transactions worth an estimated $213 million between 2011 and its 2013 shutdown, all conducted using cryptocurrency. Ulbricht, a physics graduate and early Bitcoin advocate, envisioned the platform as a libertarian experiment in anonymous commerce free of government interference. However, prosecutors successfully argued that it enabled widespread criminal activity. Government Bitcoin Holdings Face Competing Policy Directions The wallet activity emerges amid ongoing debates over how authorities should handle seized digital assets. The Department of Justice received approval in December to sell 69,370 Bitcoin , worth $6.5 billion, confiscated from Silk Road, following a federal judge’s ruling that ended a contentious ownership battle with Battle Born Investments. That company claimed ownership through a bankruptcy estate tied to Raymond Ngan, allegedly the mysterious “ Individual X ” accused of stealing crypto from Silk Road. Battle Born lost at every judicial level, including the Supreme Court’s refusal to hear the case. The company’s attorney criticized what he called “the DOJ’s abuse of the Civil Asset Forfeiture process” and accused officials of “procedural trickery” throughout the litigation. The approved sale represents one of the largest government cryptocurrency liquidations in history. Is the U.S. DOJ selling Silk Road Bitcoin, impacting the market? Bitcoin Magazine CEO ( @DavidFBailey ) suggests potential sales amid price volatility. #Bitcoin #SilkRoad https://t.co/4mjRYW2hQW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 10, 2025 Officials justified the decision , citing Bitcoin’s price volatility, though they typically conduct such sales in smaller batches to minimize market disruption. The decision came despite Trump’s campaign promise to establish a “ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ” rather than liquidating government-held cryptocurrency. The proposed reserve would mirror the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, retaining all seized digital assets to manage economic risks. Similar dormant wallet movements have triggered security concerns before. In July, another $8.6 billion in Bitcoin from wallets inactive since 2011 suddenly consolidated, prompting speculation about potential hacks or compromised private keys. Some observers linked those holdings to Roger Ver, the early Bitcoin advocate arrested in Spain on tax charges, though no confirmation emerged. Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable despite these large-scale transfers. The cryptocurrency traded near $92,500 on Wednesday, up 2.5% as traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s final rate decision of the year.

Regulatory clarity, infrastructure upgrades, and token listings are converging into a cycle where real utility and compliant architecture matter more than speculation. Three developments stand out as the most important to track in 2026: Avalanche’s regulatory momentum and ETF timeline, Ztarknet’s privacy-focused L2 expansion, and the upcoming listing of $REACT — a token tied to Reactor trading platform solving major DeFi pains. Avalanche: Regulatory Tailwinds and a Delayed ETF Decision Avalanche enters 2026 with meaningful progress on both regulatory and institutional fronts. In early December 2025, Abu Dhabi approved USDT issuance and services on Avalanche, allowing compliant stablecoin operations within one of the world’s most tightly regulated financial jurisdictions. At the same time, the U.S. SEC formally closed its probe into Avalanche, reducing enforcement risk and giving developers and institutions clearer ground to build. For a network already focused on high-speed settlement and institutional integrations, regulatory certainty is one of the strongest long-term catalysts it could receive. However, the most visible milestone remains unresolved: Grayscale’s AVAX ETF decision has been delayed until July 2026. Prolonged uncertainty may cap AVAX’s upside in the short term, as institutional inflows tend to wait for clarity. Still, approval for compliant stablecoins puts Avalanche in a stronger position heading into the ETF ruling. Ztarknet Upgrade: A Starknet-style Privacy Layer for ZEC Zcash’s ecosystem is undergoing one of its most important transformations since launch. Ztarknet, a Starknet-inspired Layer-2 zk-rollup, is already live in testnet and aims to bring 1,000 TPS private smart contracts by 2026. If successful, Ztarknet could reposition ZEC as a backbone for private Web3 applications, enabling developers to build privacy-preserving dApps with far greater throughput than Zcash’s base layer. Governance is shifting toward profit-driven voting blocs, a trend that risks alienating the protocol’s long-standing privacy-focused core contributors. The most sensitive decision arrives in 2026: a vote on a 20% developer tax. This funding model could either stabilize long-term development or fracture community alignment. Ztarknet’s success depends heavily on how this governance debate resolves. $REACT Listing: A Utility-Driven Token for Reactor Trading Terminal Unlike many early-stage tokens that launch before their platforms exist, Reactor ($REACT) enters 2026 with a fully functional product already deployed. The Reactor Terminal unifies the fragmented DeFi workflow into a single interface that traders can use today — combining: spot execution routed through Perp DEXes futures positions consolidated across multiple sources memecoin launch feeds from Pump.fun, Bonk ecosystems, and other aggregators yield aggregation from Morpho, Yearn, Forknet, and similar protocols This system creates an environment where high-frequency trading, yield management, and cross-protocol actions exist in one place. Why the token listing matters $REACT fuels fee discounts, staking APY boosts, and priority placement across platform features. As activity on the Terminal increases, commission revenue rises, and that revenue funds buy-backs and token burns, reducing circulating supply over time. With the public beta, wallet upgrades, infrastructure improvements, and new vault integrations rolling out, the upcoming 2026 token listing arrives at a moment when usage is expanding — not promised. This positions $REACT as one of the few token launches tied to tangible, measurable platform activity rather than speculative roadmaps. Conclusion 2026 is shaping up to be a year defined not by hype but by infrastructure and governance choices. Avalanche is navigating regulatory clarity and an approaching ETF decision that could reshape institutional exposure. Ztarknet has the potential to turn ZEC into a modern privacy L2 ecosystem, contingent on a critical governance vote. $REACT is preparing for a listing backed by an operational trading platform with real revenue mechanics. For traders and analysts watching for structural shifts rather than short-lived narratives, these three milestones form the most important set of crypto upgrades to monitor in the coming year.

OCC Letter Clears Way for Bank Bitcoin Trades The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has confirmed that national banks may enter “riskless principal” transactions in crypto assets, including Bitcoin. The December 2025 interpretive letter says banks can buy a crypto asset from one party and immediately resell it to another as part of normal banking activity. OCC Bank Bitcoin Letter. Source: bitcoinlfgo In a riskless principal trade, the bank acts as an intermediary. It agrees to purchase Bitcoin from an initial counterparty only when it already has a matching order from a second customer to buy the same amount. The purchase and resale occur almost at the same time, so the bank does not hold Bitcoin in inventory. The OCC notes that these transactions must follow existing banking laws and risk controls. Banks that offer Bitcoin trades under this model must apply standard compliance rules, including anti-money-laundering checks, customer due diligence and capital and liquidity requirements. Bitcoin Reclaims Kijun as Golden Cross Appears Meanwhile , Bitcoin has broken above the daily Kijun line after trading below it for roughly six weeks, according to Ichimoku signals shared by analyst Titan of Crypto.

Key Takeaways: FinCEN fined Paxful $3.5M for willfully enabling over $500M in suspicious crypto transfers. Regulators said Paxful ignored basic AML rules, including MSB registration and SAR filings. Paxful later shut down amid regulatory pressure, staff losses, and internal legal disputes. The regulator accused the company of willfully violating federal anti-money laundering laws and allowing more than $500 million in suspicious transfers linked to high-risk jurisdictions and criminal activity. According to FinCEN, Paxful facilitated transactions tied to Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and even Backpage.com, the notorious classifieds site seized in 2018 for enabling sex trafficking. FinCEN Says Paxful Ignored Basic Anti–Money Laundering Rules Regulators said Paxful failed to implement even the most basic requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), including registering as a money services business, maintaining an anti-money-laundering program, and filing suspicious activity reports. “For years, Paxful disregarded its BSA obligations and facilitated transactions associated with illicit activity and high-risk jurisdictions,” FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki said. Paxful acknowledged that it willfully violated federal law. The consent order highlights major compliance lapses during the years in which Paxful operated without adequate oversight, largely due to failures by former leadership. FinCEN said the company has since taken steps to correct past misconduct, including firing senior figures responsible for the violations and conducting an internal review to identify suspicious activity previously left unreported. Regulators from multiple federal agencies assisted in the case, including the Justice Department’s Money Laundering and Narcotics section, the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California, and Homeland Security Investigations. Today, FinCEN assessed a $3.5 million penalty against Paxful for facilitating suspicious activity involving illicit actors. https://t.co/dkdJNxPCIL pic.twitter.com/wVBAwlHyvr — Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) (@FinCENnews) December 9, 2025 The agency emphasized that firms involved in digital assets must adjust their controls to match the risks inherent in dealing with crypto, especially exposure to sanctioned jurisdictions and anonymous transfers. In 2023, Paxful shut down its peer-to-peer crypto marketplace , citing the broader industry downturn, regulatory pressure, and internal turmoil. CEO Ray Youssef cited multiple factors behind the shutdown, including major staff departures, increasingly burdensome US regulatory requirements, and a lawsuit filed by a co-founder, reportedly Artur Schaback. He said compliance demands had grown so intense that even dedicating a quarter of Paxful’s workforce to compliance was not enough. The company also lacked the resources to continue operating while blocking US users, making a full marketplace suspension unavoidable. B.C. Seizes Over $1M in Gold, Cash Linked to QuadrigaCX Co-Founder As reported, British Columbia has secured a major legal victory after obtaining a court order to seize more than $1 million in gold, cash, and luxury goods tied to QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn. The forfeiture comes under the province’s unexplained wealth order regime, which requires individuals to prove their assets were acquired lawfully. Patryn chose not to contest the action, allowing authorities to move forward with liquidating the seized items. The seized assets were discovered in a Vancouver safety deposit box and included 45 gold bars, luxury watches, jewelry, and a loaded .45-caliber pistol. At today’s prices, the gold alone is worth over $800,000. The province’s civil forfeiture office alleges these items were purchased using misappropriated QuadrigaCX customer funds, citing evidence gathered during a broader RCMP investigation.

Now, a high-profile media group tied to U.S. politics has entered the arena . The potential implications of this filing swirl not only around major tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum — but also around altcoins such as XRP. In early July 2025, media company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) — owner of social platform Truth Social — submitted a registration to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a new fund : the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF. As reported by analyst Chad Steingraber on X, the filing drew immediate attention for its proposed asset mix and strategic ambition. What the Filing Reveals The S-1 registration describes a fund that aims to hold five leading cryptocurrencies directly. These are Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cronos (CRO), and XRP (XRP). The proposed allocation by value places 70% in Bitcoin and 15% in Ethereum. The remaining 15% is split among the three altcoins: Solana gets 8%, Cronos 5%, and XRP 2%. Custody and execution responsibilities would fall to Crypto.com, via its trust arm, with asset storage, liquidity provision, and staking operations managed exclusively by them. Shares are slated for listing on NYSE Arca once the ETF obtains regulatory and exchange-level approval. Truth Social Trump Index Fund on standby XRP Included https://t.co/YH3EzOoK82 pic.twitter.com/gTBjel9K7N — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 10, 2025 Why XRP’s Inclusion Is Significant The presence of XRP — even at 2% — matters for several reasons. First, it pushes XRP into a “blue-chip” category alongside top-tier tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This could signal shifting sentiment among institutional and retail investors regarding XRP’s long-term legitimacy. Second, if approved and successful, the fund would channel capital directly into XRP through a regulated, U.S.-listed vehicle. That could mean broader exposure to investors unable or unwilling to buy and hold individual tokens. Third, inclusion alongside CRO and SOL — tokens tied to major platforms — suggests the fund aims not only for stability but also for growth potential across assorted blockchain ecosystems. Regulatory and Structural Hurdles Ahead The filing is only the first step. The ETF still requires SEC approval, likely including a Form 19b-4 submission to change exchange rules and allow trading. Historically, the SEC has scrutinized crypto ETFs for custody safeguards, market manipulation risk, and compliance with existing securities laws. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Further, the fund’s passive structure depends on the custodian’s ability to securely store assets and efficiently manage liquidity. Any weakness in custodial practices or regulatory uncertainty could delay or derail the launch. What to Watch Next Investors and observers should watch for updates on the SEC’s review process. A key milestone will be the submission (and approval) of a 19b-4 filing required for listing on NYSE Arca. Any amended prospectus could change allocations, assets included, or custodian arrangements. Attention should also focus on on-chain flows, asset inflows to the fund, and whether Crypto.com publicly discloses staking or custody metrics. Finally, broader crypto-market sentiment and regulatory climate will shape the fund’s reception and success. A New Institutional Narrative for XRP The Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF filing places XRP among the top digital assets considered by a politically connected media company . Though XRP represents only a small share, its inclusion alone elevates its standing. The fund could offer new, regulated exposure to XRP and other altcoins. However, significant regulatory and structural hurdles remain. For now, the prospect offers a fresh institutional narrative for XRP — one to watch closely as the regulatory process plays out.

Key Takeaways: Mubadala Capital is exploring tokenized private market access with Kaio. The partnership reflects rising institutional interest in RWAs. Tokenized assets continue gaining momentum as infrastructure improves. Announced Tuesday, the partnership will focus on testing how Kaio’s framework could allow institutional and accredited investors to access Mubadala Capital’s private market products onchain.

Mubadala Capital Manages $430B Across Global Markets Mubadala Capital oversees and advises on more than $430 billion across private equity, credit, real estate and alternative strategies. It operates as a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company, one of Abu Dhabi’s major sovereign wealth funds. The group’s broader digital-asset positioning has drawn attention recently. In November, Bloomberg reported that the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, another Mubadala subsidiary, held at least $500 million in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. In Tuesday’s announcement, Fatima Al Noaimi and Max Franzetti, co-heads of Mubadala Capital Solutions, said the goal is to work with regulatory-aligned infrastructure to understand how tokenization can broaden access to institutional-grade vehicles.

The company has moved more than $200 million in institutional assets onchain and says the Mubadala initiative underscores momentum behind onchain investment products. “This launch demonstrates how traditional institutional capital is now scaling onchain,” Kaio CEO Shrey Rastogi said. The move places Mubadala among a growing cohort of institutional players studying whether tokenized mechanisms can cut operational friction and eventually expand global participation. CoinShares data shows strong demand for RWAs in 2025, particularly tokenized US Treasurys, which grew from $3.9 billion to $8.6 billion this year. The firm expects the trend to continue into 2026 as appetite for dollar-based yields remains elevated. Infrastructure is also evolving to support the shift. On Wednesday, Polygon deployed a hard fork aimed at strengthening performance for high-frequency applications such as stablecoins and tokenized RWAs. RWA Tokenization Gains Momentum On Monday, Libeara, the blockchain infrastructure platform backed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures, rolled out a new tokenized gold investment fund in Singapore, bringing one of the world’s oldest safe-haven assets onto digital rails. The fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger. In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 .

The mining company, founded by Eric Trump, recently announced the addition of 416 BTC to its treasury. This strategic accumulation brings its total holdings to an impressive 4,783 BTC. What does this mean for the cryptocurrency landscape and the firm’s future? Why Is American Bitcoin Aggressively Accumulating? The recent purchase by American Bitcoin is not a random event. It represents a calculated strategy in a volatile market. Many institutional players view price dips as buying opportunities, and ABTC appears to be following this playbook. This accumulation signals a strong long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition as digital gold. Furthermore, increasing their holdings directly from their own mining operations provides a unique advantage. It allows them to grow their asset base while potentially lowering the average acquisition cost per coin. This vertical integration is a powerful model for sustainable growth in the crypto mining sector. Breaking Down the American Bitcoin Strategy To understand the impact, let’s look at the key elements of ABTC’s approach. The firm combines mining operations with strategic treasury management. Hodling Mined Coins: Instead of immediately selling mined Bitcoin for fiat currency to cover expenses, they are retaining a significant portion. This turns their mining infrastructure into a direct Bitcoin accumulation engine. Balance Sheet Strength: Holding 4,783 BTC significantly strengthens their corporate balance sheet. As Bitcoin’s price appreciates, so does the book value of the company. Market Confidence: This move broadcasts confidence to investors and the market. It shows the leadership’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. The Ripple Effect of Major Bitcoin Holdings When a firm like American Bitcoin makes such a public accumulation, it creates ripple effects. Firstly, it contributes to the overall reduction of Bitcoin’s liquid supply. Coins held in corporate treasuries are effectively taken off the open market, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Secondly, it sets a precedent. Other mining companies and traditional corporations may see this as a viable treasury strategy, encouraging further institutional adoption. The action by a firm with the Trump name attached also brings mainstream media attention, further normalizing Bitcoin investment at a corporate level. What Challenges Does American Bitcoin Face? However, this strategy is not without its risks. The primary challenge is Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility. A significant market downturn could negatively impact their balance sheet valuation in the short term. Therefore, this approach requires a strong stomach and unwavering long-term vision. Operational costs for mining, primarily electricity, remain a constant pressure. The firm must manage these fiat-denominated expenses carefully while choosing to hold its Bitcoin-denominated assets. This requires sophisticated financial planning and robust cash flow management from other business segments or financing. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Bitcoin’s Future The decision by American Bitcoin to add 416 BTC to its coffers is a powerful statement. It transcends a simple financial transaction and acts as a public vote of confidence in the enduring value of Bitcoin. This move highlights a maturation in the industry, where mining firms are evolving from pure commodity producers into integrated digital asset holders. As more companies adopt similar strategies, the line between Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin investment vehicles will continue to blur, potentially reshaping the entire sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who founded American Bitcoin (ABTC)? A1: American Bitcoin was founded by Eric Trump, the second son of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Q2: How much Bitcoin does American Bitcoin now hold? A2: Following the recent addition, American Bitcoin’s total holdings now stand at 4,783 BTC. Q3: Why would a mining company hold Bitcoin instead of selling it? A3: Holding Bitcoin acts as a long-term investment on the company’s balance sheet. It bets on future price appreciation and reduces the liquid supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, which can be a strategic financial move. Q4: What are the risks of this strategy for American Bitcoin? A4: The main risk is Bitcoin’s price volatility. A market crash could devalue their holdings. They also need to manage operational costs (like electricity) with fiat currency while holding onto their Bitcoin assets. Q5: Does this affect the average Bitcoin investor? A5: Yes, indirectly. Large-scale accumulation by institutions can reduce available supply and influence market sentiment, potentially impacting price trends that affect all investors. Q6: Is this a common practice among Bitcoin mining firms? A6: It is becoming increasingly common. Many public mining companies now disclose their Bitcoin holdings, and a strategy of holding a portion of mined coins is a recognized approach to building corporate value.

Market activity shows heavy volatility, yet supply trends reveal a story that moves beyond routine price swings. Glassnode data shows XRP exchange balances dropping from 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion in under 60 days. Traders removed nearly 1.35 billion tokens from public markets during that window, and more than 1 billion left exchanges in only three weeks. The decline signals a rapid shift in market behavior, and the timing raises questions about what drives this extreme withdrawal pace. Source: X The trend also shows exchange balances falling below the price structure for the first time on record. This relationship draws attention because exchange supply usually reflects short-term trading sentiment. When supply declines this sharply while the price structure tightens, analysts often examine whether demand shifts toward long-term holding patterns. Source: X Large Holders Pull XRP Away From Public Markets Institutional systems appear to influence the current trend. Data shows fewer tokens available on exchanges as liquidity migrates toward OTC desks, custody platforms, and private settlement channels. This kind of movement often signals long-term positioning rather than speculative trading. Several traders highlight how retail activity rarely removes billions of tokens at this speed, which invites questions about the scale of institutional involvement. Recent filings support this view. Multiple crypto index funds added XRP to portfolio structures , and new ETF-related submissions mention the asset directly. These filings show an increase in institutional visibility . Banks also gained more flexibility to handle crypto assets under new regulatory guidelines, while payment providers expanded XRP access through simpler purchase methods. All these steps create incentives for institutions to secure supply outside public exchanges. Market watchers often study this behavior because it influences how markets react to sudden demand. When available supply declines, even moderate buying can trigger strong price movements. Traders often describe this environment as a supply squeeze, though the direction of the next major move still depends on market sentiment and chart structure. Supply Decline Creates a More Sensitive Market Structure XRP’s steep supply reduction changes how liquidity functions. With fewer tokens on exchanges, the market reacts more sharply when buyers enter. This setup increases volatility because price levels shift quickly when order books thin out. The current decline in exchange supply creates conditions where small shifts in demand produce outsized effects. Observers point to the speed of the decline. A removal of 1 billion XRP in three weeks marks an unusual compression of available liquidity. Markets often respond to this kind of environment with sudden spikes or sharp reversals when large holders test available depth. Anyone tracking short-term price changes may wonder how long this level of removal can continue and what may happen if demand rises while exchanges hold their lowest balances in years. The market has not encountered this supply structure before, which raises uncertainty around how XRP will respond once buying pressure increases. Traders now focus on chart signals that indicate whether the next decisive move trends upward or downward. XRP Price Sets Up for a Breakout as Liquidity Tightens XRP trades near $2.08 as the price hovers inside a symmetrical triangle pattern . The structure shows buyers stepping in at slightly higher levels while sellers pressure the upper boundary. This tightening range often ends with a strong breakout. A move above $2.12 to $2.15 could signal the start of a rally, while a dip below $2.00 may confirm renewed weakness. Source: X The narrowing pattern grows more important as exchange supply continues to shrink. Liquidity conditions amplify any breakout, which means the next move may unfold faster than traders expect. Market analysts track this convergence of reduced supply, institutional engagement , and technical compression as a sign that a significant shift may approach. The combination of historic supply withdrawals and a tightening price structure sets up a decisive moment for XRP. The market now watches both sides of the triangle as traders prepare for the impact of a supply environment that rarely appears in major crypto assets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 12:10:40

According to the report compiled with research partner DL Research, Bybit analyzed 79 countries using 28 metrics and 92 data points to assess adoption patterns, regulatory frameworks, and user engagement. Singapore, the United States, and Lithuania are the top three countries in terms of crypto adoption. However, Bybit lauded the Asian city-state’s integration of digital assets into everyday life and institutional infrastructure, surpassing those of the latter countries. Vietnam and Hong Kong also ranked within the top ten, adding to the widespread mass adoption rate in Southeast Asia. Singapore ranks higher than America in crypto adoption index report According to the crypto exchange’s indexing , Singapore topped the charts with a score of 7.5, leading in several dimensions of adoption. The country achieved perfect scores in user penetration (1.00) and high cultural visibility (0.96), which topped global averages of the bottom half of the top ten ranking countries by adoption index. Over 11% of the population reportedly holds cryptocurrency because Singapore’s leadership, institutional readiness, and a digital finance-embracing culture have created a crypto-friendly environment for investments. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) changed its tone towards cryptocurrency regulation earlier this year with a clear licensing framework working in tandem with innovation-friendly policies. In April 2022, Singapore enacted the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), a comprehensive piece of legislation meant to streamline and strengthen MAS’s oversight of the financial sector. In June this year, several provisions of the FSMA came into effect, including a licensing regime for digital token service providers (DTSPs) operating in or from Singapore while serving overseas markets. The legislation goes beyond previous frameworks such as the Payment Services Act, which had exclusively governed services provided to domestic customers. DTSPs with a substantial presence in Singapore are now required to apply for licenses and comply with anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations. However, MAS reiterated in a May consultation response that it is “unlikely to approve any application by an entity to provide DT services from Singapore to only overseas persons, given the higher inherent ML/TF risks and the limited supervisory oversight MAS can exercise over such entities.” The clarification was issued with four weeks’ notice before the June 30 commencement. Stablecoins in play for global crypto adoption Bybit’s report also mentioned the global growth of the stablecoin market volumes worldwide, particularly those pegged to non-US currencies. US dollar-based stablecoins, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), dominate savings and hedging, but stablecoins pegged to other currencies are being used for payments and commerce. Jesse Pollak, head developer of Coinbase’s Base blockchain, called on developers worldwide to create alternatives to dollar-pegged tokens. “If you look at the world today, something like 60% of the world’s currency reserve is dollars, but then you have tens of other critical currencies, whether it’s the euro, or the yen, or even currencies like the Nigerian naira, that are huge parts of the global economy. But right now, they’re missing in the crypto economy,” Pollak surmised. According to an October Cryptopolitan report , Director for International Development at the A7A5 project, Oleg Ogienko, said fiat-backed cryptocurrencies not denominated in US dollars could capture roughly 20% of the global stablecoin market by 2028. “One of the stable trends in the crypto industry is the active development of non-dollar stablecoins. Their growth reflects the growing demand for digital assets backed by national currencies, which contributes to market diversification,” Ogienko told Russian news outlet RBC. Alongside Singapore’s index news, Lithuania was a surprise entry into the top index ranking with a score of 6.3 overall after a strong performance in cultural readiness and institutional penetration. Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates also ranked in the top five, while Vietnam and Hong Kong entered the top ten. Chainalysis and TRM Labs’ late October report listed India, the United States, and Pakistan as leading countries in rising adoption rates, with special mentions of Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia when adjusting for population size.

You might notice things are quieter. Recent data reveals a significant cooling in market activity, as spot trading volume on major cryptocurrency exchanges fell by a staggering 28% in November. This notable drop, reported by Wu Blockchain, signals a potential shift in trader sentiment and market dynamics as the year draws to a close. Let’s dive into what caused this slump and what it could mean for your portfolio. Why Did Spot Trading Volume Crash in November? The overall 28% monthly decline in spot trading volume is more than a simple statistic; it’s a window into broader market psychology. Several factors likely contributed to this pullback. First, the cryptocurrency market often experiences volatility around macroeconomic announcements and regulatory news. Second, after periods of significant price movement, traders frequently enter a consolidation phase, leading to reduced activity. Finally, the traditional holiday season can see decreased participation across financial markets. This decline wasn’t uniform. A closer look at individual exchange performance reveals a more nuanced story. While the trend was negative across the board, the severity of the drop varied significantly from one platform to another. Which Exchanges Were Hit the Hardest? The data highlights clear winners and losers in terms of retaining trader engagement during the slowdown. The exchange experiencing the most dramatic fall was Bitget, which saw its spot trading volume collapse by 62%. This suggests specific challenges or a different user base reaction for that platform. Meanwhile, the industry giants also felt the pressure: Binance , the world’s largest exchange by volume, recorded a 25% decrease. Coinbase , a major player especially in the U.S., saw a more modest 8% dip. The disparity between Coinbase’s single-digit decline and Bitget’s steep fall is particularly telling. It may point to differences in geographic exposure, the types of assets predominantly traded, or the behavior of retail versus institutional users on each platform. What Does Lower Trading Volume Mean for Crypto Investors? For the everyday investor, a sustained drop in spot trading volume carries important implications. Lower volume often leads to increased price volatility for individual assets, as fewer trades are needed to move the market. This can create both risk and opportunity. Furthermore, exchanges themselves may feel the impact. Trading fees are a primary revenue source, so a prolonged volume slump could pressure their business models. However, it can also be a healthy market correction, washing out excessive speculation and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. The key for traders is to adjust their strategies—perhaps focusing on longer timeframes or being more selective with entries—during these quieter periods. Actionable Insights from the November Volume Data So, what can you do with this information? First, use it as a gauge of overall market sentiment. A shrinking spot trading volume often precedes significant price moves, as it indicates indecision. Second, consider diversifying the exchanges you use or monitor, as performance varies. Finally, this is an excellent time for education and research rather than impulsive trading. Building your knowledge when the market is calm prepares you for when activity—and opportunity—returns. In summary, the 28% drop in November’s spot trading volume is a crucial market signal. It reflects a collective pause among traders, with exchanges like Bitget bearing the brunt of the decline. While lower volume presents challenges like potential liquidity issues, it also offers a moment to strategize. Understanding these market rhythms is essential for navigating the crypto landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is spot trading volume? Spot trading volume refers to the total value of cryptocurrencies bought and sold for immediate delivery (“on the spot”) on an exchange within a specific period, like a day or a month. It’s a key metric for measuring market activity and liquidity. Why is a drop in trading volume significant? A significant drop in volume can indicate declining trader interest, market uncertainty, or a consolidation phase. It often leads to higher volatility, as fewer trades are needed to move an asset’s price, and can signal an impending larger price movement. Should I be worried about my exchange if its volume fell sharply? Not necessarily. All exchanges experienced a decline. However, a severe drop like Bitget’s 62% could be a point of monitoring. It’s always prudent to use reputable, well-established exchanges and consider diversifying where you hold assets. Does lower volume mean prices will fall? Not directly. Low volume indicates less trading activity, not a specific price direction. However, it can make the market more susceptible to large buy or sell orders, which can cause sharp price swings in either direction. Is this a good time to buy cryptocurrency? Periods of low volume and consolidation can sometimes present buying opportunities, as assets may be in a temporary lull. However, this depends entirely on your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and research. Never invest based on a single metric. Will trading volume recover? Historically, cryptocurrency trading volume is cyclical, often correlated with major price trends, news events, and broader market cycles. Volume typically recovers when a strong market narrative or price trend emerges to attract traders back. Found this analysis of the spot trading volume decline helpful?

SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Security Breakthrough Restores Trust in Shibarium The Shibarium team delivered significant news regarding a past bridge exploit. Authorities have successfully traced the hacker responsible for the incident. The case now sits with the FBI and Interpol for further action. Investigators continue tracking the stolen funds through KuCoin. This breakthrough marks a turning point for network security and user confidence. The team also completed an RPC upgrade following a brief reindex period. Operations have returned to normal across the network. Shibarium announced plans for a privacy upgrade in 2026. This addition could strengthen the technical foundation supporting SHIB's long-term value. The ecosystem shows signs of maturation as development milestones stack up. Futures Trading and ETF Speculation Build Momentum Coinbase will introduce SHIB futures contracts on December 12. This launch represents a major step toward institutional participation in the token's market. Futures products typically increase liquidity and trading volume. The exchange's decision signals growing recognition of SHIB's market presence. Institutional traders gain new tools to access the asset through regulated channels. This development could help SHIB break free from its current price compression. Discussions about a potential SHIB exchange-traded fund have surfaced in crypto circles. While still speculative, ETF conversations reflect evolving attitudes toward memecoin investments. Such products would offer traditional investors exposure to SHIB without direct token ownership. On-chain metrics reveal substantial movement by large holders. More than 45 billion SHIB tokens have migrated off centralized exchanges recently. Whales transferred approximately $35 million worth of tokens into private wallets. Analyst Javon Marks projects potential upside to $0.000032. This target implies gains exceeding 200% from present levels. The forecast depends on catalysts like the Coinbase futures launch and continued whale accumulation gaining traction.

This $193.9 million deposit is more than a simple transaction; it’s a powerful signal of how major institutions are actively managing their BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings. Let’s break down what this means for you and the future of digital asset investment. What Does This BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Transaction Actually Mean? According to on-chain analytics from SolidIntel, an address linked to the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF moved the funds to Coinbase Prime. This platform is not your standard exchange. Think of it as a high-security, white-glove service desk built for giants. It provides large-scale trading, custody, and prime brokerage services exclusively for institutional players like hedge funds and asset managers. Therefore, this deposit likely isn’t about selling. Instead, it points to core operational activities for the ETF, such as: Settling creation/redemption baskets: Authorized Participants (APs) use platforms like Coinbase Prime to handle the underlying Bitcoin that backs the ETF shares. Enhancing custody security: Moving assets to a dedicated prime brokerage can be part of robust risk management. Facilitating liquidity: It prepares the asset for efficient, large-scale transactions required by the ETF structure. Why Should Every Crypto Investor Pay Attention? This move is a masterclass in institutional behavior. While retail traders might focus on short-term price swings, giants like BlackRock operate on a different plane. Their actions are deliberate, strategic, and focused on long-term infrastructure. The sheer scale—$194 million in a single transfer—highlights the profound liquidity and operational maturity that a BlackRock Bitcoin ETF brings to the market. It demonstrates that Bitcoin is being treated not as a speculative toy, but as a serious, movable asset class within the world’s largest financial frameworks. Moreover, choosing Coinbase Prime reinforces the critical role of regulated, institutional-grade partners in this ecosystem. It builds trust and sets a standard for how traditional finance expects to interact with crypto assets. What Are the Real-World Implications of This ETF Activity? So, what’s the practical takeaway for your portfolio? First, understand that such movements create a stabilizing floor. Large, regulated ETFs absorb volatility by converting speculative trading into held assets. This institutional presence can dampen the wild price swings historically associated with crypto. Second, it signals deepening adoption. Every operational move by BlackRock’s fund validates the entire sector, encouraging other institutions to follow suit. Finally, it shifts market influence. The flow of assets through these regulated channels gives more weight to fundamental, long-term value over social media hype. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF depositing $194 million at Coinbase Prime is a quiet but monumental event. It’s a behind-the-scenes look at the machinery of modern finance adapting to a digital age. This isn’t just about price; it’s about protocol, process, and permanence. For the astute investor, it underscores that Bitcoin’s journey is now inextricably linked with the discipline of institutional capital, paving the way for a more mature and accessible market for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean BlackRock is selling its Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. A transfer to Coinbase Prime is typically for custody, settlement, or operational purposes within the ETF structure, not an immediate sale to the open market. Q: What is Coinbase Prime? A: Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform offering trading, custody, and prime brokerage services tailored for institutional investors, providing security and tools for handling large asset volumes. Q: How does this affect the price of Bitcoin? A: Direct short-term impact can be neutral, as it’s an operational move. However, it reinforces institutional confidence and market infrastructure, which supports long-term price stability and growth. Q: Why is the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) important? A: As one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock’s entry lends immense credibility, attracts massive institutional capital, and integrates Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. Q: Where can I track these kinds of transactions? A: On-chain analytics firms like SolidIntel, Arkham, and others track wallet addresses associated with large ETFs and institutions, providing transparency into these flows.

The incident has resulted in a pump-and-dump scheme that netted scammers approximately $55,000. MUBARA Pump-and-Dump Scheme Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was the first to alert users via X that the executive’s WeChat account had been compromised. CZ urged the crypto community not to buy any meme coins promoted in the posts, warning that “Web 2 social media security is not that strong. Stay safu!” On the other hand, Yi He confirmed that she hasn’t used the platform for a while and that the associated number had been taken over by the attackers. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that hours before posting the promotional content, the hacker created two new wallets and began accumulating MUBARA via PancakeSwap. On-chain data suggests they used this activity to run a pump-and-dump scheme. The attacker spent $19,479 to purchase 21.16 million tokens, triggering a price rally. The token rose from around $0.001 to $0.008 within minutes, pushing its market cap to around $8 million, which resulted in it being heavily traded on BNB. Lookonchain estimates that they have already sold 11.95 million MUBARA for $43,520 and still hold 9.21 million tokens worth $31,000, bringing total profits to roughly $55,000. MUBARA is a meme-based cryptocurrency that gained popularity in early 2025 due to its price movements and community-driven hype, and was officially listed on Binance Alpha in March through the BNB Chain Launchpad platform Four Meme. Pattern of Similar Hacks This occurrence is the most recent in a series of hacks targeting WeChat accounts of prominent crypto figures, a trend that stands out for its repeated use of meme tokens to defraud users. In a similar case, Tron founder Justin Sun’s account was compromised on November 30, showing a clear pattern in the attackers’ methods. The crypto X community has described these events as intense on-chain “hacker competitions” that are now spilling into off-chain platforms. CZ commented on the development, noting that he hoped the next compromised profile wouldn’t be his because he hasn’t used the social platform for many years. He also clarified that he would not directly endorse any meme coins on the platform. Following the latest development, Yi He has shared that her profile has been successfully recovered after external verification that led to the password being changed. However, she pointed out that the bad actors are reportedly still lurking, exploiting feedback issues, and attempting to add her as a friend.

That future is now unfolding as Pineapple Financial, a NYSE-listed fintech firm, begins a groundbreaking migration of its mortgage data to the Injective blockchain. This move signals a major leap for real-world asset tokenization, aiming to bring unprecedented clarity and security to the home loan industry. Why is Pineapple Financial Moving Mortgage Data to Injective? Pineapple Financial (PAPL) has launched a dedicated mortgage tokenization platform. The core mission? To solve a common industry headache: fragmented data. Previously, loan information was scattered across various internal systems and paper files. By migrating this mortgage data to Injective, the company consolidates everything into a single, auditable, and tamper-proof ledger. This isn’t a future plan—it’s happening now, with over 1,200 mortgage records already moved on-chain. What Are the Tangible Benefits of This Migration? Shifting mortgage data to a blockchain like Injective isn’t just a tech upgrade; it’s a strategic overhaul. The benefits are clear and impactful: Enhanced Security & Trust: Blockchain’s immutable nature means records cannot be altered after being written, reducing fraud risk. Operational Efficiency: Automating processes and having a single source of truth cuts down on administrative time and errors. Improved Auditability: Regulators or auditors can verify loan data in real-time, simplifying compliance. Future Innovation: Tokenized mortgages could eventually be fractionalized, creating new investment opportunities. Therefore, this move by Pineapple Financial is a practical step toward modernizing a traditional financial sector. How Does Injective Blockchain Support This Vision? The choice of the Injective blockchain is crucial. Injective is specifically built for finance, offering high speed and low transaction costs—essential for handling sensitive mortgage data.

With current price action pivoting around the key $1.95 level and technical targets projected as high as $9–$13. What Happens If XRP Repeats The 2017 Fractal? The analysis uses a long-range log chart from Binance, where the latest candle in the screenshot shows XRP trading around $2.0892. In this timeframe, the analyst divides XRP’s history into mirrored cycles: 2014–2017 on the left and 2021–2025 on the right, each broken into labeled segments “Part 1,” “Part 2” and “Part 3.” Related Reading: XRP Selloff: Whales Shed Coins Worth $1 Billion In A Week According to Cryptollica, “the cycle experienced by XRP between 2014 and 2017 is almost an identical copy of the current cycle spanning 2021 to 2025.” In both cases, Part 1 is described as an accumulation phase, with XRP suppressed below a dashed blue resistance band for an extended period while forming higher lows along a rising dotted trendline. The current Part 1, roughly 2022–2024, is said to have lasted substantially longer than in the earlier cycle. The analyst cites the rule that “the bigger the base, the higher in space,” arguing that this extended sideways structure signals a large build-up of potential energy. Part 2 is defined as the breakout and retest of that blue resistance band. Once XRP closes decisively above this zone and consolidates there, the chart treats the area as a new support and as confirmation that “the official end of the downtrend and the start of a bull market” has been registered. Cryptollica suggests XRP is now at the final stage of, or has just completed, this breakout phase on the 2-week timeframe. The pivotal reference point for the entire setup is the $1.95 level, drawn in green on the chart. “The $1.95 level, marked in green, is of vital importance,” the analyst writes, emphasizing the classic principle that “once resistance is broken, it turns into support.” In this framework, XRP “currently holding above this level (performing a successful retest) is the most crucial confirmation point for the continuation of the uptrend.” Related Reading: Pundit Highlights The Condition That Will Trigger A 2,300% XRP Rally To $50 If that confirmation holds, the analysis moves to Part 3, labeled the “Parabolic Rise – Discovery Phase.” In 2017, this segment corresponded to a near-vertical advance that pushed XRP into its all-time high zone. Cryptollica argues that XRP now stands “right on the precipice of this ‘vertical lift-off’ in the current cycle,” illustrated by a steep yellow arrow on the logarithmic chart. The first major objective is the region around the prior all-time high at roughly $3.30–$3.84. If the 2017 fractal “plays out precisely,” the post projects an “implied target” between $9.00 and $13.00. The analyst tempers this with several cautions. The crypto market is far larger than in 2017, and a move to $10+ would imply a “colossal market capitalization,” making a repeat of the exact 2017 multiple “mathematically more challenging,” even if “logic often takes a backseat in crypto mania.” The scenario also assumes supportive fundamentals, including the resolution of regulatory overhangs, potential XRP ETF developments and Ripple’s stablecoin strategy. Parabolic phases, Cryptollica warns, are typically accompanied by “sudden drops of 30–40%,” making them “the most dangerous territory for leveraged trading.” The analyst characterizes the overall outlook as “extremely positive (bullish)” as long as the $1.95 support holds, concluding that XRP is at the moment of “breaking its chains” and that, if broader market conditions remain constructive, “double-digit targets ($10+) for XRP are technically on the table.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.07.

With Bitcoin pushing through multiple all-time highs and institutional money flowing in faster than ever, 2025 has become the year that retail investors feel both more excited and more anxious at the same time. For every story of someone doubling their capital, there are countless examples of traders who lost savings, bought at peaks, held the wrong coins, or panicked at the worst moment. After working in the crypto space long enough, one thing becomes obvious: most retail investors don’t fail because opportunities are bad, they fail because their decisions are made with incomplete information and too much emotion. The good news? Investing smarter today has become easier. Thanks to the rise of AI-powered analysis tools and structured portfolio frameworks, reducing crypto risk no longer requires luck, insider access, or professional trading experience. It only requires better data and disciplined decision-making. This guide breaks down how ordinary investors can protect their capital , using simple principles backed by modern AI tools available on platforms like Forvest.io . Why Retail Investors Lose Money (Even During Bull Markets) Before getting into solutions, we need to understand the real causes of unnecessary loss. The pattern repeats every cycle: 1. Information overload with no filter Every hour, hundreds of influencers, traders, Telegram channels, and so-called “experts” make bold predictions. Most of this content is speculative, promotional, or misleading. Without a way to filter what matters, investors end up reacting to noise instead of fundamentals. 2. Emotional decision-making FOMO pushes people to buy late. Fear pushes them to sell early. Volatility amplifies both. Crypto is fast and too fast for emotional reactions. 3. Lack of structured, objective analysis tools Traditional finance relies on balance sheets, financial reporting, corporate records. Crypto relies on scattered data: GitHub activity, tokenomics, liquidity, community trust, centralization risks, market manipulation patterns. Evaluating a project manually is almost impossible for beginners. 4. Scam and rug-pull exposure Not every token listed on an exchange is safe. Many projects look legitimate until liquidity disappears or development stalls. Put together, these factors make crypto a difficult environment for anyone without solid tools. A Better Way: Using AI to Cut Through Crypto’s Chaos This is where AI tools come into play. Instead of reacting to hype or guessing based on sentiment, investors can rely on structured analysis. Platforms like Forvest.io use machine learning to evaluate cryptocurrencies, detect risks, summarize meaningful news, and break down portfolio exposure. Here’s how these tools directly reduce risk: 1. Evaluate Coins Based on Hard Data, Not Hype Many investors don’t know what metrics really matter. Is a project overhyped? Is liquidity stable? Is development active or dead? Does the community show real adoption or just bots? This is exactly what the Trust Score system is designed to answer. The Trust Score aggregates dozens of risk indicators market resilience, developer activity, credibility signals, token distribution health, long-term sustainability, and moreto help investors understand which projects are structurally sound. Example: Bitcoin’s Trust Score Bitcoin Trust Score on Forvest evaluates deeper risk factors using measurable, data-driven indicators such as: Return on Investment (ROI) over multiple timeframes Maximum Drawdown , showing how severely the asset has fallen during previous cycles Volatility Score , capturing how predictable (or unpredictable) price swings are Liquidity & Trading Reliability , assessing how safely large orders can be executed Risk Classification , which places Bitcoin within a structured scale of long-term risk AI-generated insights , providing a concise interpretation of Bitcoin’s structural strengths and potential weaknesses This kind of structured scoring is particularly useful when comparing Bitcoin to newer altcoins with shallow history or inconsistent performance patterns. 2. Stay Updated Without Being Overwhelmed A large percentage of crypto volatility comes from news events, regulation updates, security issues, protocol upgrades, and macroeconomic shifts. The problem? Most investors struggle to track real news without drowning in irrelevant noise. AI-powered summaries solve this problem by filtering and analyzing daily headlines so investors only see information that affects their holdings. Instead of reading dozens of articles, investors can follow news pages like: Weekly News Review This ensures they focus on market-moving events rather than distractions. 3. Manage Portfolio Risk Like a Professional Crypto success isn’t about predicting market tops, it’s about controlling exposure. Many beginners unintentionally build high-risk portfolios through over-allocation, hidden correlations, or unrealistic expectations of volatility. AI-powered tools make this easier. With Forvest’s Profit Calculator , investors can quickly see their real returns after accounting for trading fees, slippage, and execution costs, not just the inflated profit shown on exchange dashboards. A Realistic Scenario: How AI Actually Helps Investors Imagine this situation: Sara has $15,000 she wants to deploy in crypto. She’s excited but nervous because she previously lost money by buying into a hype project that collapsed. This time she takes a structured approach: Step 1 — She checks Trust Scores BTC and ETH score high. One new hyped altcoin scores low due to weak fundamentals. Decision: she avoids the risky token. Step 2 — She reviews market signals Through the risk-management category, she sees sentiment cooling after a rapid rally. Decision: she enters in smaller position sizes to manage volatility. Step 3 — She models her portfolio She tests multiple allocation scenarios and discovers her initial plan would have created dangerous concentration risk. Step 4 — She calculates real profit models When she simulates taking profit, she notices how much fees would cut into her expected gains. Final decision: 60% BTC 30% ETH 10% a small emerging project with reasonable fundamentals Sara moves from emotional, impulsive decisions to a structured, professional-style investing process. Her risk is now dramatically lower not because she avoided crypto, but because she avoided guesswork . The Shift : From Luck to Logic The mindset of successful investors has changed. It’s no longer about finding “the next 100x coin.” It’s about: understanding risk evaluating trustworthiness managing exposure tracking real returns staying updated intelligently AI tools turn chaotic markets into measurable data. They make discipline possible. They remove emotions from decision-making. And in a market as unpredictable as crypto, that difference is everything. If You Want to Reduce Crypto Investment Risk Here’s the simplest framework: 1. Stop guessing, use data Start with Trust Scores to evaluate asset reliability. 2. Stop chasing news, follow filtered insights Use curated categories instead of social-media noise. 3. Stop overexposing, model your portfolio See allocation risks before they hurt you. 4. Stop believing the dashboard, calculate real profit Turn your trading into a measurable strategy. You can explore all these tools on Forvest.io Final Thoughts Crypto will always be volatile. That’s the nature of the asset class. But volatility does not mean chaos, if you have the right tools . AI is transforming how investors measure risk, evaluate projects, and manage portfolios. You don’t need to be a professional trader or data scientist to invest intelligently. You just need clarity, structure, and objective analysis. If you’re ready to reduce guesswork, avoid costly mistakes, and invest with confidence rather than emotion, start by building a disciplined, data-driven process. The tools exist. The information exists. And the advantage goes to those who use them. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This now adds to Kalshi’s mounting legal battles across multiple states, including New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Maryland and Ohio. Meanwhile, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon faces a complex sentencing process in the US as Judge Paul Engelmayer examines how his criminal exposure in South Korea and prior custody in Montenegro should influence the outcome. Kwon pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges tied to the collapse of Terra, and could ultimately face decades in South Korea even after serving time in the US. Kalshi Scores Legal Reprieve A US federal judge gave prediction markets platform Kalshi a temporary lifeline after the state of Connecticut tried to shut down its operations. This is one of the latest developments in the escalating national battle over whether federally regulated event-contract platforms fall under state gambling laws. The dispute began on Dec. 2, when the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection issued cease and desist orders to Kalshi, as well as to Robinhood and Crypto.com, accusing them of running unlicensed online gambling operations by offering what the state deemed to be sports wagering through event-based prediction contracts. Kalshi pushed back immediately by filing a lawsuit the next day that argued its markets are fully compliant with federal law and fall squarely under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s exclusive jurisdiction. This means that states have no authority to regulate or ban its activities. On Monday, federal judge Vernon Oliver sided with Kalshi in the short term, and ordered Connecticut regulators not to take any enforcement action while the court considers the company’s request for a broader temporary halt. Under the timeline laid out in the order, the DCP must submit a response by Jan. 9, Kalshi must provide additional support by Jan. 30 and oral arguments are expected in mid-February. The case could become a major test of where the line is drawn between federal commodities oversight and state gambling laws. This issue has become very pressing as prediction markets gained a lot of traction in US finance and politics. Kalshi’s clash with Connecticut now adds to the growing list of state-level battles. The platform, which is a CFTC-designated contract market, quickly became one of the industry’s largest players, and even recorded $4.54 billion in trading volume in November. But that impressive rise brought heightened scrutiny from regulators across the country. New York issued its own cease and desist order in October, which also caused Kalshi to sue. Additionally, Massachusetts’ attorney general filed suit in September, while regulators in New Jersey, Nevada, Maryland and Ohio have all faced legal challenges from Kalshi after trying to impose state gambling rules on the platform. Do Kwon’s Legal Fate Up in the Air In other crypto-related legal news, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon is set to be sentenced on Thursday in the United States after pleading guilty to two felony counts, but a federal judge is already probing how his legal troubles in South Korea and Montenegro could shape the outcome. In a Monday filing, Judge Paul Engelmayer asked both prosecutors and defense attorneys to detail the charges Kwon faces in South Korea and the potential maximum and minimum sentences he could receive there. Kwon is expected to be extradited to his home country after serving any US prison time, and could face up to 40 years under South Korean law, according to his defense team. Do Kwon Engelmayer also questioned whether the time Kwon spent in custody in Montenegro—where he served a four-month sentence for using falsified travel documents and fought extradition to the United States for over a year—would count toward any US sentence. Prosecutors and defense lawyers were asked to clarify whether all parties agree that the Montenegro custody time should not be credited. The judge’s inquiries suggest that there are concerns that if the US were to send Kwon to South Korea to serve the latter portion of his sentence, authorities there could release him earlier than expected. Kwon pleaded guilty in August to wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud for his role in the 2022 collapse of the Terra ecosystem, which is widely considered one of the most damaging in crypto history. The implosion triggered a cascade of bankruptcies and billions in investor losses, and US prosecutors argued the harm caused by Kwon exceeded that of Sam Bankman-Fried, Alex Mashinsky and OneCoin’s Karl Sebastian Greenwood combined. Prosecutors are seeking at least 12 years in prison, while Kwon’s attorneys have requested no more than five. Even if Kwon were sentenced to time served in the United States, his lawyers said he would immediately be moved into pretrial detention in South Korea to face long-standing criminal charges there.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,ASIA|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 13:30:00

However, the price of the native token is deep in the red, while some important factors suggest the bulls are unlikely to regain control anytime soon. The Latest Updates For many Pi Network users, fulfilling the necessary KYC procedures has been a significant obstacle, often derailed by technical glitches or other setbacks. Just a few days ago, the Core Team integrated additional AI tools, making it easier and faster for Pioneers to complete the verification process. Specifically, the upgrade reduces validation shortages in regions with limited human reviewers, boosts Mainnet-unlocking KYC for more users, decreases the number of apps that need manual review, and increases privacy. Prior to that, Pi Network collaborated with CiDi Games (a platform that builds Pi-related games that users can play). The partnership aims to broaden the real-world use of the PI token and offer more opportunities for Pioneers. Some X users have speculated that further updates will be introduced at the start of next year, but there is nothing official yet. The Lawsuit Recently, a group of Pi Network users shocked the crypto community by claiming that the project secretly sold billions of PI tokens, manipulated the price, and deliberately delayed the Open Mainnet. Those people sued the entity, asking for $10 million in damages and accusing the team of misleading the community. The allegations directly target Pi Network’s co-founders, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdia Fan, as well as other unnamed individuals. The initial court hearing is scheduled for December 23, 2025. PI Price Outlook The uncertainty caused by the legal battle could be one reason Pi Network’s native token has once again headed south. Currently, it trades at around $0.21 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 14% decline on a two-week scale. Furthermore, the valuation is down a staggering 93% since the all-time high of $3 witnessed at the start of the year. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Some essential elements suggest that the price might not rebound soon but head towards a deeper correction. The upcoming token unlocks are among the evident examples. Data shows that more than 182 million PI will be released in the next 30 days, meaning an average unlock of over 6 million coins per day. This can increase the selling pressure and lead to a further pullback.

On the other hand, Polymarket predictions point to unchanged rates for most of 2026. The credit landscape in 2026 may include ECB rate hikes and an increased economic outlook for the Euro area, after a period of unchanged interest rates and low inflation. On the one hand, money market traders are pointing to a potential hike in 2026, as the Euro area economy is showing signs of a faster recovery. On the other hand, traders are pointing to more than a 50% chance that the European Central Bank will increase interest rates after a week of hawkish remarks. The Euro area inflation remains relatively low, but the period of extremely low rates in Europe may be ending. Despite the interest rate cuts in 2025 and a dovish Fed , the expectations are that in 2026, quantitative easing may stop, and some central banks may return to rate hikes. Based on money-market swaps, traders expect 13 basis points of ECB rate hikes by the end of 2026. The market shifted from an expectation for a rate cut last week. At the end of November, ECB Chief Christine Lagarde stated that the current rate level of 2% is correct and reflects the desired effect on Euro Area inflation. The expectation for rate hikes affected Euro area bond markets, with German 5-year bond yields still rising to 2.49% . The shift reflects ongoing preparation for the end of the rate cut cycles for most major central banks. Prediction markets see stability for ECB rate Polymarket traders see no surprises from the ECB, with 99% of the bets on no rate hikes in December, awaiting resolution as the market’s time runs out. For 2026, Polymarket traders show a different opinion, expecting the ECB to retain its current rates. Polymarket predictions on ECB rates are closely watched for the potential to quickly reverse their balance with new information as rate decision dates approach. | Source: Polymarket Around 84% of market participants expect no hike from the ECB. The market has a limited volume below $20K, but may become more active as the date of decisions approaches. The ECB rate market is considered undervalued, but is closely watched for whales positioning and the potential for fast gains in the case of early rate hikes from the ECB. Polymarket is not pricing in rate cuts, and some traders believe this is a likely scenario, though it clashes with the signal from money markets. ECB rate decision hinges on positive outlook The European Central Bank may issue a more optimistic outlook for economic growth in the next few days. ECB Chief Lagarde pointed at upgraded predictions from the recently completed projections, and may announce an improved outlook by the end of the year. The Euro Area has proven more resilient to the US tariffs, said Lagarde during the Financial Times Global Boardroom event. The euro has not depreciated from those measures, leaving little pressure for changing the rates to boost the economy. A positive outlook may also add another argument for a rate hike before the end of 2026.

Bitcoin is trading around $92,000 as markets price in an 89% chance of a rate cut that would lower the federal funds rate to 3.50%-3.75%. Source: CME FedWatch Tool The decision comes after a week of conflicting economic signals, including shockingly strong jobless claims ( 191K vs 219K expected, lowest since 2022 ), cooling core PCE inflation ( 2.8% from 2.9% ), and yesterday’s JOLTS data showing job openings unchanged at 7.7 million with quits declining 276,000 year-over-year. The combination of labor market stability and improving inflation supports the case for easing, but some Fed officials have expressed concern about cutting too aggressively, with employment still resilient. This marks the Fed’s third policy meeting since beginning its easing cycle with a 50 basis point cut in September, followed by another 25 basis point reduction in October. The central bank officially ended quantitative tightening on December 1, freezing its balance sheet at $6.57 trillion after draining $2.39 trillion from markets since June 2022. Markets are focused not just on today’s decision but also on Powell’s guidance for 2025. The updated dot-plot projections could signal whether the Fed sees two, three, or four more cuts next year. Any hawkish shift suggesting fewer cuts in 2025 would likely pressure Bitcoin and risk assets, while dovish guidance reinforcing the easing cycle could provide the catalyst for Bitcoin to break above $92,000 resistance. Bitcoin’s technical setup shows critical resistance at $92,000 and the descending trendline that’s capped rallies since mid-November, with support holding at $88,000-$90,000. Total crypto market cap sits at $3.23 trillion. Source: TradingView The key risk for crypto is a “hawkish cut”—where the Fed reduces rates 25 basis points today but signals a slower pace of easing in 2025 due to sticky inflation or resilient employment. Powell’s 2:30 PM press conference will be scrutinized for any hints about the January meeting and the overall trajectory of policy. With the Fed’s liquidity pivot complete (QT ended) and inflation moving in the right direction, the path of least resistance for Bitcoin is higher—but only if Powell doesn’t pour cold water on aggressive 2025 easing expectations.

Markets already know the December decision; the real question is whether Powell signals two or four more cuts next year. Bitcoin is holding $92,000 heading into the presser, with traders watching for any hawkish language about “patience” or “data-dependent” policy that could dampen aggressive easing expectations. The updated dot plot, released at 2pm, will show where Fed officials see rates ending in 2025, but Powell’s tone and forward guidance will determine whether crypto interprets today’s likely 25-basis-point cut as dovish or hawkish. The key risk for Bitcoin is a “hawkish cut” scenario where Powell emphasizes labor market strength (191K jobless claims, 7.7M job openings) as justification for slowing the pace of easing despite improving core inflation (2.8%). Any mention of skipping the January meeting or reducing 2025 cuts from four to two would be bearish for risk assets. Conversely, if Powell stresses that inflation is moving toward the target and the Fed remains committed to normalizing rates, Bitcoin could break above $92,000 resistance. Bitcoin’s technical setup shows resistance at $92,000 and support at $88,000-$90,000, with the descending trendline since mid-November still intact. Traders will parse every word from Powell for clues on the January 28-29 FOMC meeting and the overall 2025 trajectory. The Fed’s credibility is on the line after ending QT and cutting rates twice—backing away from easing now would signal either policy error or genuine concern about sticky inflation.

This isn’t just another blockchain launch—it’s a targeted solution for one of crypto’s most promising frontiers. What Makes Gravity’s Approach to Real World Assets Different? While many blockchains claim RWA capabilities, Gravity is taking a fundamentally different approach. The project is being developed specifically as a high-performance execution environment optimized for large-scale RWA issuance and complex financial applications. Unlike general-purpose chains that struggle with data-heavy operations, Gravity’s architecture is purpose-built from the ground up. The team behind Gravity understands that bringing real-world assets on-chain requires more than just tokenization capabilities. It demands robust infrastructure that can handle massive data throughput, reliable oracle systems, and execution environments capable of processing complex financial logic at scale. The Technical Power Behind Gravity’s RWA Infrastructure Gravity’s technical foundation reveals why it’s positioned to excel in the RWA space. The blockchain is based on Paradigm’s Reth and incorporates several cutting-edge features: Parallel EVM for simultaneous transaction processing Optimized mempool for efficient transaction ordering Pipelined execution structure for streamlined processing Target finality of approximately 1.9 Gigagas per second Perhaps most importantly, Gravity integrates an oracle layer directly at the protocol level. This isn’t an afterthought or add-on—it’s baked into the blockchain’s core architecture. The integrated oracle system is designed to anchor data from multiple sources including other chains, JWKs (JSON Web Keys), and DNS systems, then provide this data to smart contracts in structured, reliable formats. How Does Gravity Compare to Other RWA-Focused Blockchains? Understanding Gravity’s unique position requires comparing it to similar projects. Take Tempo, for example—another Reth-based blockchain that recently launched its public testnet. While both projects share some technical foundations, their focuses diverge significantly. Tempo concentrates on real-world payment flows and stablecoin settlements, essentially optimizing for financial transactions. Gravity, however, takes a broader view. Its emphasis is on creating a high-performance execution environment specifically for data-intensive applications. This includes not just RWAs but also prediction markets, complex derivatives, and other applications that require massive data processing capabilities. The distinction is crucial: Gravity isn’t just facilitating asset tokenization; it’s building the computational infrastructure that makes sophisticated RWA applications possible and practical. The Practical Applications: What Can Actually Run on Gravity? So what does this infrastructure actually enable? Gravity’s architecture opens doors to several previously challenging applications: Large-scale RWA issuance for real estate, commodities, and financial instruments Sophisticated prediction markets with complex conditional logic Data-intensive DeFi protocols that require real-time external data Native oracle services as a core blockchain feature Complex financial derivatives tied to real-world metrics These applications represent the next evolution of decentralized finance—moving beyond simple token swaps and lending protocols to complex financial instruments that interact with the real world. Why This Matters for the Future of Blockchain Adoption Gravity’s development signals an important maturation in blockchain technology. For years, the industry has talked about bringing real-world assets on-chain, but technical limitations have often been the bottleneck. Gravity addresses these limitations head-on by building infrastructure specifically designed for this purpose. The integration of oracle functionality at the protocol level is particularly significant. Most blockchains treat oracles as external services, creating potential points of failure and complexity. By making oracles a native feature, Gravity reduces friction and increases reliability for applications that depend on external data—which is essentially every meaningful RWA application. Conclusion: A Specialized Future for Blockchain Infrastructure Gravity represents a shift toward specialization in blockchain infrastructure. Just as we’ve seen specialized chains for gaming, social media, and other verticals, we’re now seeing infrastructure specifically optimized for Real World Assets and data-intensive applications. This specialization isn’t just convenient—it’s necessary for blockchain technology to fulfill its promise of transforming real-world finance. The project’s focus on performance, integrated oracles, and data-intensive applications positions it uniquely in the evolving blockchain landscape. As the RWA sector continues to grow, having purpose-built infrastructure like Gravity could accelerate adoption and enable applications we haven’t even imagined yet. Frequently Asked Questions What is Gravity blockchain’s main purpose? Gravity is a Layer 1 blockchain specifically designed to provide high-performance infrastructure for Real World Assets (RWA) and data-intensive DeFi applications, featuring integrated oracle capabilities at the protocol level. How does Gravity differ from other blockchains? Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Gravity is optimized from the ground up for data-heavy operations. It integrates oracle functionality directly into its protocol and uses parallel EVM technology to handle complex financial applications at scale. What technical features make Gravity suitable for RWAs? Gravity incorporates parallel EVM, an optimized mempool, pipelined execution structure, and targets a finality of 1.9 Gigagas per second. Most importantly, it has native oracle integration for reliable external data access. Can existing DeFi applications migrate to Gravity? Since Gravity is EVM-compatible, many existing applications could potentially migrate. However, developers would need to optimize for Gravity’s specific architecture to take full advantage of its RWA and data-intensive capabilities. What types of Real World Assets could benefit from Gravity? Gravity’s infrastructure is designed for large-scale issuance of various RWAs including real estate, commodities, financial instruments, and any assets requiring complex data verification and processing. When will Gravity be available for developers? While specific dates haven’t been announced, the project has shared its technical roadmap and development progress. Developers interested in RWA applications should monitor Gravity’s official channels for testnet and mainnet launch announcements. Found this deep dive into Gravity’s RWA infrastructure valuable?

The founding members, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Block, have pooled their proprietary agent- and AI-related technologies into a new open-source project called the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. This development follows tensions in the global race for dominance in artificial intelligence, leading U.S. AI firms and policymakers to unite around a new push to preserve American primacy. Open standards like MCP drive innovation and cross-platform collaboration Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht noted that open standards and protocols, such as MCP, are critical for establishing an evolving developer ecosystem for building agents . He added, “They ensure anyone can build agents across platforms without the fear of vendor lock-in.” American companies face a dilemma because they are seeking continuous income from closed APIs, even as they are falling behind in fundamental AI development, risking long-term irrelevance to China. And that means American companies must standardize their approach for MCP and agentic AI , allowing them to focus on building better models rather than being locked into an ecosystem. The foundation establishes both a practical partnership and a milestone for community open-sourcing, with adversaries uniting around a single goal of standardization rather than fragmentation. It also makes open-source development easier and more accessible for users worldwide, including those in China. Anthropic donated its Model Context Protocol (MCP), a library that allows AIs to utilize tools creatively outside API calls, to the Linux Foundation. Since its introduction a year ago, MCP has gained traction, with over 10,000 active servers, best-in-class support from platforms including ChatGPT , Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and VS Code, as well as 97 million monthly SDK downloads. “Open-source software is key to creating a world with secure and innovative AI tools for agentic applications,” Anthropic wrote. OpenAI added AGENTS.md, used in 60,000 repositories as a lightweight specification to standardize AI agent instructions. Block contributed Goose, a local-first agent platform. All three now operate under the neutral governance of the Linux Foundation. Foundation strengthens U.S. AI leadership amid rising competition from China The timing is ideal for U.S. AI leadership, as Chinese companies have released more open models, while American firms have focused on closed APIs. Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation executive director, added: “We are seeing AI come into a new kind of phase — that of conversational systems that will transition to autonomous agents that can co-exist.” The foundation addresses a fundamental weakness that relying on Chinese open-source models reduces the need for large U.S. cloud providers and APIs. Platinum members include Amazon, Anthropic, Block, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Some of the gold group members include Cisco, Datadog, Docker, IBM , Oracle, SAP, Snowflake, and Twilio. Other silver members include Hugging Face, Uber, and SUSE, among others. A single company does not head it. China’s competitive advantage stems from a concerted policy. Rather than giant AI plants, a focus on low-cost adaptability and modular innovation enables Chinese firms to create open-source weights that developers can use to build upon their technology. The U.S. recognizes the stakes. The Trump administration’s AI Action Plan highlights the geostrategic value of open-source and open-weight models, noting they could become global standards in business and academic research worldwide.

Consistent long-term profit comes not from luck or insider information, but from a disciplined approach to finding wagers where your independently estimated probability of an outcome exceeds the probability implied by available odds. This article explores how sophisticated bettors use line shopping and probability modeling to extract edge from the betting market. Understanding the Core Principles of Value Betting Stake Casino operator and bookmakers operate by setting odds that reflect both the true probability of outcomes and their profit margin, known as the vig or house edge. Smart bettors understand that the odds displayed across different platforms rarely align perfectly. These variations create opportunities for those who have accurately estimated the true probability of an event occurring. The foundation of successful value betting rests on two critical concepts working in tandem. First, you must develop accurate probability models based on relevant data and analysis. Second, you need to compare these estimates against the odds available in the market. When your calculated probability suggests a higher likelihood of an outcome than what the odds imply, you have found a value bet. Implied Probability and Expected Value Calculations Every set of odds contains an implied probability. Converting odds to implied probability allows bettors to assess whether the market has underpriced or overpriced an outcome. The relationship between your true probability estimate and the implied probability determines your expected value on each wager. Consider these fundamental calculations that separate winning bettors from the rest: Concept Formula Purpose Implied Probability (Decimal) 1 ÷ Decimal Odds Convert odds to probability percentage Expected Value (True Prob × Profit) – (Loss Prob × Stake) Calculate average profit per bet long-term Adjusted for Vig Subtract bookmaker margin from calculations Account for house edge in true odds Bettors who master these calculations gain a significant advantage. They can quantify exactly how much edge they hold on each wager and make rational decisions about stake sizes. Line Shopping Strategies Across Multiple Platforms Line shopping means comparing odds across multiple operators to find the most favorable prices for your bets. This simple but powerful practice directly impacts profitability because even small differences in odds accumulate significantly over hundreds of bets. The modern betting landscape offers numerous venues to place wagers. Different books set their lines independently based on their customer composition, risk management policies and betting patterns. This creates systematic differences that value bettors exploit daily. Practical Tools and Data Sources for Sharp Bettors Successful line shopping requires access to reliable information and the discipline to act quickly when opportunities appear. Here are the essential resources and approaches that professional bettors use: Historical sports data from official league sources and verified statistical providers Real-time odds comparison platforms that track lines across multiple bookmakers Advanced probability models incorporating player injuries, weather conditions and team form Public betting information showing where casual money has concentrated Sharp money indicators that reveal where professional bettors are positioned Closing line value tracking to measure model accuracy over time Access to these resources separates elite bettors from casual players. The professionals build comprehensive databases of historical information and continually refine their models based on actual results. Timing Bets and Exploiting Market Inefficiencies Markets move constantly and prices fluctuate based on new information and changing sentiment. Understanding when to place bets maximizes your edge and protects your capital from unfavorable line moves. The timing of your bet significantly affects expected value. Early betting offers different opportunities than late betting as the market incorporates new information. Sharp bettors understand these dynamics deeply and position their wagers strategically. Key Timing Considerations for Value Seekers The following table outlines critical factors that influence when professional bettors place their wagers: Timing Factor Characteristics Betting Implication Pre-Market Pricing Released early, reflects initial market opinion Find value before sharp money adjusts lines Sharp Money Action Professional bets that move odds quickly Follow sharp action or fade public money Breaking News Injuries, weather, lineup changes announced First-mover advantage before line adjustment Closing Line Value Final odds before event starts Benchmark for model accuracy assessment Building Sustainable Betting Systems Finding value bets represents only half the battle. Bettors must also manage their bankroll wisely and maintain disciplined record-keeping to survive inevitable variance and identify genuine edge. Long-term success requires systematic approaches that account for both skill and luck. Even accurate probability models produce losing streaks due to normal variance. Professional bettors size their stakes appropriately to withstand these downswings without depleting their capital. Essential Components of Professional Betting Operations Winning bettors track every wager meticulously and analyze results continuously. This disciplined approach reveals whether their models actually produce edge or whether apparent success stems from luck. Record-keeping also identifies specific markets where their edge proves strongest. Bankroll management protects professional bettors from catastrophic losses while maintaining sufficient capital to capitalize on high-value opportunities. Expected value calculations combined with variance analysis determine appropriate stake sizes for each wager.

This vision is now a reality. Blockchain pioneer Blockstream has announced a groundbreaking upgrade: its Blockstream Green wallet now supports atomic swaps between the Lightning Network and the Liquid Network. This development is a monumental leap for Bitcoin’s ecosystem, finally enabling trustless, peer-to-peer movement of value between two of its most important second-layer solutions. For users, this means unprecedented flexibility and control over their bitcoin. What Are Atomic Swaps and Why Do They Matter? Let’s break down this complex-sounding term. An atomic swap is a smart contract technology that allows two parties to exchange cryptocurrencies from different blockchains directly, without needing a third-party intermediary like an exchange. The swap is “atomic,” meaning it either completes entirely for both parties or doesn’t happen at all—eliminating counterparty risk. Previously, moving funds between Bitcoin’s Layer 2 networks like Lightning (for instant, cheap payments) and Liquid (for confidential, faster settlements) required cumbersome steps, often involving on-chain transactions with fees and delays. Blockstream’s integration streamlines this into a single, seamless operation within one wallet. How Does This Boost Bitcoin’s Utility? This interoperability directly tackles one of cryptocurrency’s historic challenges: siloed liquidity. By enabling atomic swaps between these networks, Blockstream is effectively creating bridges. Consider these practical benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Capital is no longer trapped on one network. Users can leverage Lightning for daily micro-payments and instantly swap to Liquid for larger, confidential transactions. Reduced Friction & Cost: It bypasses the traditional route of withdrawing to the base Bitcoin chain, saving time and substantial transaction fees. Strengthened Security & Sovereignty: Users maintain custody of their private keys throughout the entire swap process, adhering to the core “be your own bank” ethos of Bitcoin. This move significantly enhances the user experience, making Bitcoin’s layered ecosystem more cohesive and powerful. What’s Next for Blockstream and Cross-Chain Swaps? Blockstream isn’t stopping here. The company has revealed an ambitious roadmap to expand Bitcoin interoperability further. Future updates to Blockstream Green are planned to include: On-chain swap functionality, allowing direct swaps with the main Bitcoin blockchain. Integration with popular hardware wallets, bringing this advanced functionality to users prioritizing cold storage security. These steps indicate a clear vision: to make Blockstream Green a central, non-custodial hub for all types of Bitcoin transactions, across all its layers. The goal is to provide a unified interface that abstracts away technical complexity, empowering users to choose the best network for their needs without technical hurdles. What Challenges Remain for Widespread Adoption? While this is a revolutionary step, the path to mass adoption has hurdles. The technology, though elegant, requires both parties to be online and using compatible wallets. Furthermore, liquidity on both sides of the swap must be sufficient, which depends on network growth and user adoption. Educating the average user about the benefits of Layer 2 networks and how to use atomic swaps safely will be crucial. However, by integrating this feature into a user-friendly wallet like Blockstream Green, the company is taking a major step in lowering the barrier to entry. In conclusion, Blockstream’s support for Lightning-to-Liquid atomic swaps is more than a feature update—it’s a strategic unification of Bitcoin’s scaling trifecta. It empowers users with true financial agility, reduces reliance on intermediaries, and strengthens the overall network effect of Bitcoin’s layered architecture. This development marks a pivotal moment where advanced cryptographic technology translates into tangible, user-controlled freedom. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need special technical knowledge to perform an atomic swap? A: No. Blockstream has integrated this complex technology into its Green wallet interface. The user experience is designed to be as simple as confirming a regular transaction. Q: Are atomic swaps between Lightning and Liquid instant? A: They are significantly faster than on-chain transactions but are not necessarily instant like a standard Lightning payment. The process involves several cryptographic steps across both networks but typically completes within minutes. Q: Is there a fee for using this atomic swap service? A: Yes, there will be network fees associated with the operations on both the Lightning and Liquid networks, but these are dramatically lower than the cost and time of an on-chain Bitcoin transaction. Q: Can I swap any amount of Bitcoin? A: The amount may be constrained by the available liquidity in the specific payment channels and peg-in/out capacity on the Liquid side. The wallet interface should guide you on feasible amounts. Q: How does this differ from using a centralized exchange? A: The key difference is custody and trust. With an atomic swap, you never give up control of your private keys. The swap executes trustlessly via code, eliminating the risk of exchange hacks, fraud, or withdrawal freezes. Q: Will this feature come to mobile versions of Blockstream Green? A> While the initial announcement focuses on the desktop application, it is highly likely that this core functionality will be extended to mobile platforms in future updates to provide a seamless cross-device experience. This breakthrough in Bitcoin interoperability is a story worth sharing! If you found this explanation of atomic swaps helpful, consider sharing this article with your network on social media.

The clip provides a notable glimpse into how major assets, such as XRP, could gain new utility through cross-ecosystem DeFi. The analyst’s post drew attention to Hoskinson’s focus on building channels that let value move between networks that lack native smart contract capabilities . This includes the XRP Ledger, which he placed alongside Bitcoin as a prime candidate for deeper integration with Cardano’s dApps. Hoskinson discussed how tokens from various ecosystems can be integrated into applications that provide users with clear incentives. He said that users often stay inside ecosystems when those dApps meet their needs for yield and accessibility. Cardano's Charles Hoskinson mentioned $BTC and the $XRP Ledger as networks that lack native smart contract capabilities that can benefit from interoperability with $ADA :""That opens up the channel for capital and people. But also you can do the same for the XRP ecosystem."" pic.twitter.com/5uBNY78QBM — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) December 7, 2025 XRP’s Position in the Plan During the discussion, Hoskinson said that Cardano can support “Bitcoin DeFi” because it “opens up the channel for capital and people.” He added that developers can “do the same for the XRP ecosystem.” He grouped XRP with UTXO assets that “lack native smart contract capabilities,” which he sees as an opening for Cardano’s DeFi infrastructure to attract those holders. XRP is in a strong position within this category due to its liquidity and established base of active users. Hoskinson stressed that holders of these assets “want to get a yield.” He sees these users as a key audience for developers. By positioning XRP as a priority, he strengthens the connection between both networks and communities. It also indicates that Cardano’s growth plans involve more than internal scaling. They also aim to bring high-demand external assets onto the network. Cardano’s Role With XRP in View Hoskinson connected this opportunity to a broader strategy for ecosystem expansion. He highlighted hybrid dApps using Midnight , stating that the privacy angle can give Cardano developers an advantage because current DeFi lacks strong privacy features. Although he described improvements that directly benefit Cardano, he emphasizes the importance of integrating assets like XRP. He outlined a plan to identify leading Cardano projects, improve their resources, and help teams strengthen operations. He highlighted the need to build a larger capital base “so that we can get XRP on the ledger” along with Bitcoin. This places XRP integration as a meaningful target rather than a secondary option. Growing Access for Developers and Users Hoskinson said frequent hackathons can accelerate progress. He pointed to Midnight’s growth and events, like Endmaker’s Berlin session, as examples. He argued that bi-weekly hackathons can strengthen Cardano’s position and improve developer experience. This approach supports Cardano’s plan to expand DeFi access for external assets, giving XRP holders new options for liquidity and privacy-focused dApps.

55600932,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=876131,1765374355,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55600932.jpeg,Analysts refute IMF warning about stablecoin risk to emerging market currencies,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/imf-warns-stablecoin-undermine-currencies/,"The IMF released a report warning that stablecoins could pose a big risk to emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), potentially undermining local currencies. The December report claimed that stablecoins could facilitate capital outflow and currency substitutions across EMDEs, but experts say the market is too small for a meaningful macroeconomic impact. However, the IMF emphasizes that these fiat-pegged tokens/coins could be used to avoid CFMs (capital flow management measures), whose implementation relies on recognized financial mediators. Stablecoins could be used to undermine the implementation of CFMs by presenting an avenue for capital flows outside of standard financial rails. Additionally, the IMF report claimed that there is evidence indicating that stablecoins are being used as a means of capital flight in EMDEs. On the other hand, these concerns may not be unfounded since fiat-pegged stablecoins facilitate transactions outside common banking channels. For perspective, the U.S. dollar-pegged USDT and USDC collectively boast a market capitalization of nearly $264 billion, according to CoinMarketCap’s on-chain data. That amount could be comparable with France’s FX reserves, but it remains larger than that of many other countries, including Thailand, the UK, Israel, and the UAE. That also means that locals from panic-gripped EMs can move capital across borders using stablecoins, weakening the monitoring of capital flows. Acheson says stablecoins are too small for a macro impact on EMs The author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, Noelle Acheson, said that while the IMF’s claim could seem plausible, the stablecoin market is still too small to have this significant impact on the macroeconomics of emerging markets despite their rapid growth over the past few years. She also added that their total market size is tiny compared to FX flows. Acheson also noted that stablecoins being legalized by the GENIUS Act will not be relevant until sometime in January 2027, although the law has already been passed. She pointed out that stablecoins may never gain significant relevance in EMs whose traders are required to adhere to local legislation. Authorities in some of these EMs may be entirely against the use of stablecoins. Coinbase’s head of institutional research, David Duong, also shared the same sentiment, saying that stablecoins are too limited in scale and policies prevent systemic frictions. He noted that while stablecoins can accelerate flight-to-USD in nations where they are already popular, their overall scale is small compared to portfolio flows across borders. The bulk of NDF (non-deliverable forwards) channels, mutual fund outflows, and bond/equity redemption mechanisms would still dominate macro impacts, according to Duong. Stablecoins eclipse unbacked crypto assets in cross-border flows The IMF report revealed that stablecoin cross-border flows already eclipse those of unbacked crypto assets, such as Bitcoin, with the gap widening ever further. It also noted that the Asia-Pacific region leads in absolute stablecoin volumes, followed by North America. However, the economies of Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Latin America (EMDEs) stand out when scaled to GDP. Meanwhile, Acheson noted that the dollar remains too entrenched in the global economy, despite the rapid growth of fiat-backed stablecoins, which have increased from $5 billion in 2020 to roughly $300 billion currently. She further observed that although the dollar does not have a market cap like crypto or stocks, its global physical cash and reserves exceed $2.5 trillion. Broader measures, such as M2 and international liabilities, also dwarf stablecoins, at $20 trillion and $100 trillion, respectively. Besides, around 80% of stablecoins in EMDEs are used for crypto trading and not for managing treasuries, according to Acheson. The IMF report also noted that EMDEs dominate these corridors with 2024 flows reaching approximately $1.5 trillion. However, this represents only a fraction of the quadrillion-dollar global payments market, which is dominated by the USD.

The MSTR stock has collapsed 60% year-to-date, erasing $73 billion in market value. But the selloff hasn’t shaken Wall Street. Out of 19 analysts tracking the company, only three have downgraded it to a sell. The rest are still clinging to buy ratings, some even doubling down. Twelve of them expect shares to explode to $485, a 150% jump from Monday’s close of $189. Some of the lowest estimates come from Jeffrey Yu at President Capital and Brett Knoblauch at Cantor Fitzgerald. They think the stock will stay near $200. But the next step up in forecasts is $425, and Mark Palmer at Benchmark is calling for $705, nearly 4x the current price. The optimism hasn’t died down. Not even close. Bitcoin rebound drives bullish price targets “In crypto terms, a year is an eon, an awful lot can change,” said Palmer in an interview. That’s Wall Street’s bet on volatility. Bitcoin has bounced back before: in 2017, in 2022, and bulls think it’ll do it again. That approach, tying equity value to a single digital asset, puts Strategy in a weird league. These types of companies are called digital asset treasuries or DATs, and they don’t get analyzed like normal stocks. There’s no real valuation model. The share price just floats on Bitcoin’s price movements. Palmer, who remains ultra-bullish, said his target for Bitcoin is $225,000 by end-2026. If that plays out, Strategy flies with it. Among Nasdaq 100 stocks, Strategy has the largest upside gap between current price and analyst target. In the broader Russell 1000, it’s in third place, behind Viking Therapeutics and Aurora Innovation. To put that in context, most stocks in the Russell 1000 are trading just 17% below their median target. Strategy’s spread is off the chart. Saylor’s premium shrinks as competition grows The company’s wild ride began in August 2020, when Michael Saylor shifted Strategy from enterprise software into Bitcoin. Investors jumped in fast. Shares surged 600% in six months. At one point, the stock traded at a 2.5x premium over Bitcoin’s price; people were paying more for exposure to the coin through Strategy than for the coin itself. Then came the copycats. New DATs popped up everywhere. And with them, Strategy’s premium got crushed. It’s now down to 1.2x, as the market for listed crypto exposure has become saturated. That erosion is why Gus Gala, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., slashed his Strategy rating to sell in April. He didn’t think it would get into the S&P 500, nor did he believe it would earn an investment-grade credit rating. S&P Global Ratings gave it a B- junk rating in October. But after the stock tanked, Gala upgraded it to neutral in November. “There’s abundant economic incentive for share sales to continue and for capital raises to continue or for the underwriting to continue,” Gala said . “But the demand will be the demand, and I think that’s what you’ve seen play out.” Gala doesn’t expect a return to the old premium levels. “Will it go back to two times premium, possibly at some point, probably like near the peak of next cycle. But is that a sustainable end state, I don’t think so.” Even firms that cut their targets still see upside. Bernstein slashed its price estimate by 25% on Monday. Cantor Fitzgerald cut theirs by 59% last week. But both still think the stock is heading higher from here. Strategy may be bleeding, but the bulls haven’t left the building. Bitcoin was trading at $93,844 at press time. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is actively considering a major overhaul, moving its crypto regulation framework from the Payment Services Act to the stricter Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This potential change signals a new era of investor protection and market transparency in one of the world’s most mature crypto economies. Why is Japan Changing its Crypto Regulation? Japan has long been a pioneer in establishing clear rules for cryptocurrency exchanges. However, the rapid evolution of the market, particularly the rise of complex fundraising methods like Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs), has exposed gaps in the current system. The FSA’s move aims to close these gaps by applying the rigorous standards of securities law to a broader range of crypto activities. This shift fundamentally reclassifies many digital tokens as financial instruments, bringing them under a more comprehensive regulatory umbrella. What Does Stricter Crypto Regulation Mean for Projects and Exchanges? The proposed changes would introduce significant new requirements, primarily focused on transparency and disclosure. For market participants, this translates into concrete obligations: Enhanced IEO Disclosures: Exchanges must pre-disclose detailed information about token issuers, tokenomics, and security audit results. Project Accountability: All projects, even those claiming to be decentralized, must clarify their issuance methods, distribution plans, and operating entities. Expanded Enforcement: The FSA seeks authority to crack down on unregistered overseas platforms and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) targeting Japanese users. Explicit Insider Trading Ban: The rules would formally prohibit insider trading in crypto assets, aligning with traditional market standards. Who Benefits from this Regulatory Overhaul? This move is designed with a clear beneficiary in mind: the investor. By demanding higher levels of disclosure, the FSA empowers individuals to make more informed decisions. It reduces the risk of fraud and market manipulation, fostering a safer environment. Furthermore, clear rules provide legitimacy, which could attract more institutional investment into Japan’s crypto sector. For compliant exchanges and serious projects, a well-regulated market reduces uncertainty and builds long-term trust. What are the Potential Challenges of this New Crypto Regulation? While the intent is protective, the transition may present hurdles. Stricter compliance could increase operational costs for exchanges and startups, potentially stifling innovation. The regulation of decentralized entities also poses a complex legal and technical challenge. How will authorities enforce rules on permissionless protocols with no central operator? Balancing robust crypto regulation with the innovative, borderless nature of blockchain technology will be the FSA’s key test. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Global Crypto Regulation Japan’s potential regulatory pivot is more than a domestic policy update; it’s a bellwether for the global industry. By aligning digital assets with traditional securities law, Japan is setting a precedent for mature, investor-first crypto regulation . This approach may inspire other nations seeking to harness the potential of crypto while mitigating its risks. The move underscores a crucial evolution: from treating crypto primarily as a payment method to recognizing its role as a complex financial instrument that demands proportionate oversight. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main law Japan is using for crypto regulation now? A1: Currently, Japan regulates cryptocurrencies primarily under the Payment Services Act (PSA). The proposed change would shift the core framework to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). Q2: How will this affect my crypto investments in Japan? A2: For most retail investors, the impact should be positive. You can expect more transparent information from projects and exchanges, leading to a safer investment environment with reduced fraud risk. Q3: Will Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) be banned in Japan? A3: Not necessarily banned, but they will likely fall under new scrutiny. The FSA is seeking enforcement authority over DEXs that serve Japanese users, meaning they may need to find ways to comply with disclosure and operational rules. Q4: When will these new crypto regulations take effect? A4: The change is still under consideration. The FSA has announced it is exploring the shift, but formal legislation and implementation will take time, likely involving a public consultation period. Q5: Does this mean all cryptocurrencies will be classified as securities? A5: Not all, but many more will be. The FIEA’s application will depend on the characteristics of each token. Payment-focused tokens might be treated differently from those that function like investment contracts or shares. Q6: How does Japan’s approach compare to the US SEC’s stance on crypto? A6: The move aligns Japan more closely with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) view that many tokens are securities. However, Japan is creating a tailored framework within its existing laws, whereas the US is grappling with enforcement and new rulemaking.

According to details shared in Bloomberg’s report, major Wall Street names, including Citadel Securities, Fortress Investment Group, Brevan Howard, and Galaxy Digital, put $500 million into Ripple, giving the company a valuation of around $40 billion. This instantly turned the round into one of the strongest signs yet that traditional finance is taking a serious interest in the XRP ecosystem. How Wall Street Structured The Deal To Protect Themselves In early November 2025, Ripple closed a major private equity round that injected $500 million into the company, resulting in a valuation of roughly $40 billion. However, new details show that the most surprising part of the transaction is not the amount raised but the agreement behind it. Bloomberg reports that investors in this round did not simply buy Ripple shares and hope the value rises. Instead, they secured built-in protections that guarantee them profits later. Related Reading: Here’s The Level That XRP Price Must Reclaim To Trigger Another Surge They were given the right to sell their shares back to Ripple in three to four years at a 10% yearly return, unless Ripple goes public before then. At that rate, Ripple would need to pay roughly $732 million to buy the shares back after four years. That means even if Ripple’s valuation stays flat or drops, the investors still walk away with guaranteed gains. However, if Ripple decides to buy the shares back earlier, the investors get an even higher payout of around 25% annualized rate. A liquidation preference was also included, meaning these investors get paid first if anything goes wrong. Ripple noted in its announcement of the investment round that it has repurchased more than 25% of its outstanding shares over the past few years. Why The Deal Is Really A Bet On XRP Even though the investors bought equity in Ripple, not XRP itself, most of Ripple’s value still comes from its massive XRP holdings. According to Bloomberg, two of the funds that put in money noted that at least 90% of Ripple’s net value is tied to XRP. As of July 2025, Ripple held around $124 billion worth of XRP, although most of its XRP holdings are held in escrow. Related Reading: What’s Happening With XRP And Why Did Its Spot ETF Crash 20%? This means the investment round, in reality, is also a bet on XRP’s long-term relevance and future market strength. If the price of XRP grows, Ripple benefits, and so do the investors who now hold equity backed by a company sitting on one of the world’s largest digital asset reserves. However, the $500 million investment does show that serious investors believe Ripple will continue growing, but just that Ripple’s success is still directly linked to the XRP price.

Fraudsters increasingly use fake emails and counterfeit websites to steal secret keys and funds. These attacks are designed to appear urgent, often imitating legitimate wallet notifications to trick even experienced users. Wietse Wind, founder of XRPL Labs and creator of Xaman Wallet, issued a public alert emphasizing the severity of the threat . He clarified that official Xaman channels never request secret keys or sensitive information via email, and any message suggesting otherwise is fraudulent. His warning highlights the ongoing risk for XRPL users navigating phishing campaigns. The Scam Format and Red Flags Recent phishing emails mimic Xaman’s branding and professional tone. They claim a “new device” or “suspicious login” and urge users to verify account activity immediately. These emails include clickable links that direct recipients to cloned websites or fake desktop clients, designed to capture credentials. Warning! @XRPLLabs and @XamanWallet *do not* store your email address, IP address and we do not send you emails like this. If you receive an email like this, the sender is fake, the site is fake and the message is scam! This NEVER comes from us. This is a SCAM! pic.twitter.com/LjAA6Uc9cV — Wietse Wind – Xaman® + XRPL + Xahau (@WietseWind) December 9, 2025 Many phishing messages display falsified IP addresses, geographic locations, and device information to appear legitimate. Urgent call-to-action buttons create psychological pressure, prompting users to act without verifying authenticity. Recognizing these red flags is critical for anyone managing XRP or other digital assets. Why XRP Holders Are at Risk Phishing attacks on the XRPL are particularly dangerous because accounts lack a recovery mechanism for stolen secret keys. Once an attacker gains access, funds can be moved instantly and irreversibly. Past incidents demonstrate that scammers often exploit software or library vulnerabilities, targeting users who may not follow security best practices. Even experienced users can be deceived by emails that closely replicate official communications, making vigilance essential. Verifying Authenticity Users should rely solely on official channels embedded within wallet apps. Verify alerts and support requests directly through the application rather than external links. Carefully inspect sender domains for subtle misspellings or suspicious variations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-term security is enhanced by hardware wallets for significant balances. Never share secret keys, seed phrases, or account credentials via email or messaging platforms. Following these practices dramatically reduces the risk of compromise. Immediate Actions if You Receive the Email Do not click on links in phishing emails. If clicked accidentally, disconnect the device from the internet immediately to prevent potential data capture. Revoke any exposed keys and transfer funds to a secure wallet with new keys. Report suspicious emails to wallet providers and local authorities. Xaman’s official help pages provide clear instructions for reporting phishing attempts, helping prevent broader attacks on the community. Broader Security Measures for the XRPL Community Developers should audit third-party libraries and dependencies continuously to prevent vulnerabilities.

Their analysis reveals that Bitcoin has formed a formidable support level at $85,500 . This isn’t just a minor technical point; it represents a zone where massive institutional conviction met the market, creating a potential springboard for future price action. Let’s break down why this finding is so significant. What Does This Bitcoin Support Level Actually Mean? In simple terms, a support level is a price point where an asset, like Bitcoin, consistently finds enough buyers to prevent it from falling further. Think of it as a price floor. Fidelity’s analysis suggests that around $85,500, a tremendous wave of buying pressure emerged. This wasn’t casual accumulation. The firm estimates that approximately 430,000 BTC were purchased in this range. That’s a staggering amount of capital deployment, signaling deep confidence from major players. Therefore, this Bitcoin support level acts as a key psychological and technical benchmark. When the price revisits this zone, traders and analysts now watch closely to see if the buying interest holds. A strong bounce from support can reinforce bullish sentiment, while a break below could signal a shift in market dynamics. Why Is Fidelity’s Analysis a Game-Changer? Fidelity isn’t just another voice in the crowd. As one of the world’s largest traditional asset managers with a dedicated digital assets arm, their research carries substantial weight. Their identification of this support level provides a data-backed anchor for the market. It offers both retail and institutional investors a clearer framework for understanding where significant demand exists. Here are the key implications of this finding: Validation for Bulls: It confirms that major institutions are not just talking about Bitcoin; they are actively building positions at specific prices. A Risk Management Tool: Traders can use this level to set more informed stop-loss orders or identify potential entry points. Market Structure Clarity: It helps define the current trading range, with $85,500 acting as a crucial lower boundary. Could This Bitcoin Support Level Be Tested Again? Markets are never static. While the formation of this Bitcoin support level is powerful, it’s not a guarantee. The true test of any support or resistance level comes when price action revisits it. If Bitcoin’s price were to decline back towards $85,500, the market would witness a critical battle between buyers and sellers. A successful hold and bounce would powerfully reaffirm the strength of this zone, potentially fueling a new leg up. However, investors should always be aware that in volatile asset classes, even strong support levels can break under extreme selling pressure. This is why diversification and sound risk management remain paramount. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can you do with this information? First, recognize that institutional analysis is becoming a cornerstone of crypto market structure. This support level identified by Fidelity is now a key piece of market data. You can: Monitor the Level: Keep $85,500 on your radar as a significant price zone. Assess Market Sentiment: Watch trading volume and price action if BTC nears this area again. Avoid FOMO: Don’t blindly buy based on this single point. Use it as part of a broader, researched strategy. In conclusion, Fidelity’s pinpointing of a major Bitcoin support level at $85,500 is a landmark moment. It underscores the maturation of Bitcoin’s market, where sophisticated institutional analysis now provides clear reference points for all participants. This foundation, built on the purchase of hundreds of thousands of BTC, offers a compelling narrative of underlying strength as the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a support level in trading? A support level is a price point on a chart where an asset tends to stop falling and may even bounce higher, due to an increase in buying demand. Why is the $85,500 level so significant? According to Fidelity’s data, this is where approximately 430,000 Bitcoin were purchased, indicating exceptionally strong institutional buying interest and creating a solid price floor. Does a strong support level guarantee the price won’t go below it? No guarantee exists. While it indicates a high-probability zone of buying, extreme market conditions can lead to a “break” of support, which would then become a new resistance level. How does institutional analysis from firms like Fidelity affect Bitcoin? It brings traditional market frameworks, credibility, and data-driven insights to the crypto space, influencing both institutional and retail investor behavior and contributing to market maturity. Should I buy Bitcoin just because it’s near this support level? Not necessarily. A support level is one tool among many. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and develop a comprehensive investment strategy. What happens if Bitcoin breaks below $85,500? A decisive break below this key support level on high volume could trigger further selling as the market re-evaluates its structure, potentially leading to a search for a new, lower support zone.

According to a press statement shared with Cryptopolitan on Wednesday, the deal grants the project access to the names and images of more than 65,000 players, which gives the blockchain game a richer in-game ecosystem with real-world athletes from dozens of national unions. The license spans players from more than 70 member associations from football nations including England, France, Italy, Argentina, Portugal, Belgium, Scotland, Norway, and Sweden. With the Fédération Internationale des Associations de Footballeurs Professionnels’ (FIFPRO) greenlight, Soccerverse can deliver an experience similar to football titles like Fantasy Manager far more closely than earlier on-chain management games. The agreement applies to the game’s ongoing release on the Polygon blockchain , where Soccerverse has been live since January after over three years of development. Football authenticity pushes for a decentralized football world The licensing deal in place would see managers in Soccerverse use real players whose performance histories and identities are recognised globally. They will be able to build squads comprising stars from top leagues, trade their preferred footballers, and compete within the participant-performance-based economy. The debut of licensed players in the game is planned for the coming weeks through an update that will change the way clubs are assembled and how player values are determined within the game’s marketplace, much like real-world scouting and squad-building tactics. Partnering with FIFPRO is a landmark moment for Soccerverse and a massive win for our community. Trust and authenticity are critical to our vision, and this license is our commitment to building a legitimate football universe. This is a true partnership that also supports FIFPRO’s vital mission, providing a global platform for the entire collective of players and giving our community the chance to discover talent from under-represented footballing nations. Soccerverse CEO Andrew Gore. FIFPRO Commercial Enterprises views the project as an innovative addition to the digital sports industry. “FIFPRO is delighted to welcome Soccerverse, a community-driven system where fans can shape clubs, share influence, and build something together. We value partners who are willing to innovate and rethink the norm,” the organization stated. Soccerverse may be operating fully on-chain, but its origins stretch back decades through earlier football management titles created by members of the team behind it. Developers say those foundations informed the game’s economy of established management mechanics with the permanence and transparency of blockchain infrastructure. Gore reiterated the project’s commitment to continuity, adding that users want consistency because they dedicate significant time to multi-season football management. “If you are going to invest loads of your time into a forever game that spans months, years, or even decades like some users did with SM Worlds, it’s comforting to know that it can never get turned off,” he reckoned. In late November, Soccerverse expanded its ecosystem by partnering with Immutable Play to introduce new reward features and increase user numbers within and outside its core simulation. According to a statement from the blockchain game, the integration came with a quest system for users to earn Gems through simple interactions on channels. Participants can collect Gems by watching promotional clips, reading official project material, visiting the Soccerverse website, and following verified social accounts. The prize-based mechanic complements the game’s management loop with a digital wheel that can be spun using Gems. MENA region leads in blockchain gaming, BGA 2025 report confirms In other blockchain gaming news, the Middle East and North Africa have become the most influential and the fastest-growing contributors to the gaming sector, according to the 2025 State of the Industry Report from the Blockchain Game Alliance. The report shows that nearly one-fifth of all respondents now come from the region, a rise from its near absence in the survey only a few years ago.

55601497,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=242183,1765375811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Stunning Ethereum Price Prediction: Could ETH Really Hit $5,000?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-prediction-5000-target/,"BitcoinWorld Stunning Ethereum Price Prediction: Could ETH Really Hit $5,000? Ethereum is making headlines again, and this time the buzz is all about a potential surge to a staggering new all-time high. A compelling new Ethereum price prediction suggests that if ETH can decisively break and hold above the $3,500 level, its next major target could be the coveted $5,000 mark. This analysis, backed by key technical indicators, has ignited excitement across the crypto community. Let’s dive into the charts and expert insights to understand what’s driving this optimistic forecast. What’s Driving This Bullish Ethereum Price Prediction? The foundation of this Ethereum price prediction lies in a significant technical breakout. According to a report from Cointelegraph, Ethereum has recently broken above its crucial 50-week moving average on the weekly chart. This is a major event for technical analysts. Historically, such breakouts have often preceded powerful, sustained rallies for ETH. For instance, following a similar move in October 2023, the token embarked on a remarkable 147% surge that lasted until March 2024. This historical precedent provides a strong context for the current optimism. Moreover, the bullish momentum isn’t confined to the weekly view. Analyst StockTrader_Max has highlighted that ETH has also climbed above its 50-day moving average on the daily chart. This dual breakout across different timeframes strengthens the case for continued upward movement. The convergence of these signals suggests growing buyer confidence and a potential shift in market structure. The $3,500 Hurdle: A Make-or-Break Level for ETH All eyes are now on the $3,500 price zone. Why is this level so critical? This price point aligns with Ethereum’s 200-day moving average, a long-term trend indicator watched closely by institutional and retail traders alike. The current Ethereum price prediction hinges on a clear and sustained break above this resistance. The analyst’s thesis is straightforward but powerful: First, ETH must break through the 200-day MA resistance at $3,500. Second, and just as importantly, it needs to establish that level as a new support base. If Ethereum can achieve this—turning former resistance into solid support—it would signal a profound change in market sentiment. This successful retest would clear a major technical obstacle and open the path toward higher price exploration, with the all-time high near $5,000 becoming the next logical target. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? While this Ethereum price prediction is undoubtedly exciting, it’s essential to view it through a balanced lens. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and technical analysis provides probabilities, not certainties. A failure to hold above $3,500 could lead to a period of consolidation or a pullback to seek stronger support at lower levels. However, the breakout above key moving averages is a undeniably positive development. It indicates that the longer-term trend may be turning bullish. For investors, this analysis offers a clear framework: Watch the $3,500 level closely: A sustained break and hold is the key confirmation signal. Consider the broader context: Network upgrades, institutional adoption (like ETF developments), and overall crypto market health will also play crucial roles. Manage risk: Always base investment decisions on your own research and risk tolerance, not on predictions alone. In conclusion, the technical setup for Ethereum is generating one of the most optimistic Ethereum price predictions in recent months. The breach of major moving averages and the historical pattern of post-breakout rallies create a credible case for a run toward $5,000. The journey, however, depends on ETH conquering the $3,500 fortress and proving it can stand firm. If it does, the next chapter for Ethereum could be a historic one. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main reason behind the $5,000 Ethereum price prediction? The prediction is primarily based on technical analysis. Ethereum has broken above its key 50-week and 50-day moving averages. Analysts note that if it can break and hold above the 200-day moving average at $3,500, it could trigger a strong rally towards its previous all-time high. Has Ethereum done this before? Yes, similar technical breakouts have led to major rallies. For example, after breaking its 50-week MA in October 2023, ETH surged by 147% over the following months. Is $3,500 a guaranteed launchpad for ETH? No price level is guaranteed in crypto. $3,500 is a critical resistance level. The prediction depends on ETH not just breaking above it, but establishing it as a new support level, which would indicate sustained buying pressure. What could prevent ETH from reaching $5,000? Broader market downturns, negative regulatory news, failure to hold $3,500 as support, or a significant shift in investor sentiment could all act as headwinds. Should I buy Ethereum based on this prediction? This article presents an analysis, not financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research, consider your financial goals and risk tolerance, and understand that all cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risk. Where can I track these key Ethereum price levels? You can monitor ETH’s price and its relationship to moving averages (like the 50-day and 200-day MA) on most major cryptocurrency charting platforms and exchanges. Found this analysis insightful?

For context sake, the 2022 World Cup finals alone, where Lionel Messi’s Argentina triumphed over France, drew an astonishing 1.5 billion television viewers, with over 5 billion people tuning in to watch some part of the tournament (a number that eclipses any other sporting spectacle including the Superbowl by a huge margin). In this context, London-based blockchain game Soccerverse recently revealed that it had successfully tapped into the world’s love for soccer by bringing real professional players into its virtual football-universe, marking one of the most notable crossovers for the Web3 industry with the sports realm. A partnership with FIFPRO to help drive authenticity By securing a licensing deal with FIFPRO, the global representative body for professional footballers, the community-driven football management and trading game will henceforth (w.e.f December 10, 2025) use the real names and images of over 65,000 active professional players. In practical terms, this means Soccerverse players will be able to sign and trade actual football stars (be it iconic veterans or emerging talents) as part of their in-game clubs, with the license spanning 70+ national player associations covering a broad swath of major footballing nations. To elaborate, players from countries such as England, France, Italy, Argentina, Portugal, Belgium, Scotland, Norway, Sweden and many more will now be represented virtually, which for Soccerverse-ians is a significant step up in realism and credibility, injecting official authenticity into a genre of blockchain games that until now often relied on fictional or user-generated characters. Not only that, gamers will henceforth be able to manage their virtual clubs with real-world players, trade their favorite stars from top leagues, and compete in a dynamic economy driven by player transactions, much like the real transfer market. This level of authenticity has practically been unheard of when it comes to Web3 gaming, putting Soccerverse in the same league as traditional sports video titles (such as PES and FIFA) which feature real rosters. On the development, Soccerverse CEO Andrew Gore opined: ""Partnering with FIFPRO is a landmark moment for Soccerverse and a massive win for our community. Trust and authenticity are critical to our vision, and this license is our commitment to building a legitimate football universe. This is a true partnership that also supports FIFPRO's vital mission, providing a global platform for the entire collective of players and giving our community the chance to discover talent from under-represented footballing nations.”FIFPRO’s leadership echoed a similar, enthusiastic sentiment, praising its partners who are looking to “innovate and rethink the norm,” especially as digital entertainment evolves, underlining that Soccerverse’s fresh approach aligns with the forward-looking mindset of the players’ organization. Community-driven football on the blockchain Soccerverse isn’t an entirely new player on the pitch as it has been steadily building its community and game world (seemingly in anticipation of this moment). The game launched in January 2025 to much fanfare, and is now entering its second season with over 2,000 active managers guiding clubs across multiple virtual leagues. Uniquely, the title is built atop the Polygon network and is both community-driven and community-owned, meaning that every club in the game is an NFT-like asset and can have multiple fan-owners (called “influence holders”) who share in the decision-making process. The simulation features 5,350 clubs spanning a tiered league system, all managed by real people in real time. Even matches are played out twice a week, and managers are required to strategize everything from squad selection and tactics to transfers and financing, mirroring the challenges of real-world club management. Therefore as soccer’s unparalleled global popularity shows no sign of abating anytime soon, innovations like soccerverse which stand at the intersection of live action, player engagement and tech innovation stand to flourish in a big way, especially given that other established game franchises are already engaging over 150 million players globally regularly. By bringing a community-driven, blockchain-powered simulator with real player likenesses, fans no longer have to watch their heroes on a screen but interact with them while owning a piece of the action.

In a move that has captured the attention of the DeFi community, the Meteora project has made a powerful statement about its financial health and future vision. The team recently announced a substantial Meteora token buyback , spending a staggering 10 million USDC to repurchase its native MET tokens from the open market in Q4. This strategic decision is more than just a transaction; it’s a signal of profound confidence that could reshape the project’s trajectory. Let’s unpack what this means for token holders and the broader decentralized finance landscape. What Exactly Did the Meteora Token Buyback Involve? Meteora’s announcement on social media platform X provided clear, impactful numbers. The project deployed 10 million USDC from its treasury to buy back MET tokens. This purchase accounted for 2.3% of the token’s total circulating supply, a significant chunk by any measure. Crucially, the team didn’t frame this as a one-off event. They explicitly stated their intention to continue these buybacks in the future , turning a single action into a potential long-term strategy. This approach directly impacts the fundamental tokenomics of MET, reducing available supply and signaling that the leadership believes the token is currently undervalued. Why Would a Project Buy Back Its Own Tokens? You might wonder, why would a crypto project spend its hard-earned stablecoins to re-acquire its own asset? The reasons are multifaceted and speak to core principles of value and governance. Demonstrates Financial Strength: Spending $10 million requires a robust treasury. This action proves Meteora has substantial reserves, which builds immense trust with its community and investors. Signals Undervaluation: It’s a clear message from the insiders: “We believe our token is worth more than the market price, and we’re putting our money where our mouth is.” Reduces Circulating Supply: By removing tokens from circulation, the existing supply becomes scarcer. Basic economics suggests that if demand remains steady or grows, scarcity can support price appreciation. Rewards Long-Term Holders: The buyback can be seen as a method of returning value to loyal supporters who have held through market cycles, effectively redistributing treasury assets to the token holder base. Therefore, a Meteora token buyback is not just an accounting entry; it’s a strategic tool for value accrual and community alignment. What Are the Potential Impacts and Challenges? While the immediate reaction is often positive, it’s wise to consider the full picture. The primary benefit is the boost in investor confidence. Seeing a team actively invest in its own token is a powerful bullish indicator. It can lead to increased holding sentiment, reducing sell pressure. Furthermore, the commitment to future buybacks creates a potential price floor, as the market anticipates the project itself as a consistent buyer. However, challenges exist. The project must ensure these buybacks are sustainable and don’t deplete the treasury needed for development, security, and grants. There’s also the question of token utility—buybacks are most effective when paired with strong, ongoing use cases for the MET token within the Meteora ecosystem. The market will watch closely to see if the reduced supply is met with genuine, growing demand from users, not just the project’s treasury. What’s Next for Meteora and MET Holders? The announcement sets a new precedent for Meteora’s operational strategy. The promise of continued buybacks means token holders can expect periodic, positive supply shocks. This transforms the Meteora token buyback from a single event into a recurring mechanism for value distribution. For holders, the actionable insight is to monitor two key things: the health of the Meteora treasury to ensure sustainability, and the growth in real-world usage of the MET token across its DeFi platforms. The buyback is a strong foundation, but lasting value is built on utility and adoption. Conclusion: A Confident Step Forward Meteora’s $10 million token repurchase is a masterstroke of strategic signaling. It demonstrates fiscal responsibility, deep confidence in the project’s intrinsic value, and a commitment to its community. By proactively managing its tokenomics through this buyback , Meteora isn’t just spending money—it’s investing in the perceived and potential future value of its entire ecosystem. For the crypto space, it serves as a compelling case study in how transparent, treasury-driven actions can align incentives and foster long-term growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a token buyback in crypto? A: A token buyback is when a project uses its funds (often from its treasury) to purchase its own native tokens from the open market. This reduces the circulating supply and can signal the team’s belief that the token is undervalued. Q: How does the Meteora token buyback affect the MET price? A: By reducing the available supply of MET tokens, the buyback can create upward pressure on the price if demand remains constant or increases. It also boosts investor confidence, which can positively influence market sentiment. Q: Where did Meteora get the $10 million USDC for the buyback? A: The funds likely came from the project’s treasury, which is typically funded by a portion of protocol fees, initial token allocations, or other revenue generated by the ecosystem. Q: Will Meteora burn the bought-back tokens? A: The announcement did not specify a burn. They may be held in the treasury for future use (e.g., team incentives, grants) or permanently removed from circulation. The destination of the tokens is a key detail for future announcements. Q: What does ‘2.3% of the total supply’ mean for holders? A: It means a significant portion of all MET tokens that exist were removed from the circulating supply held by the public. This increases the relative ownership stake of every remaining token holder. Q: Should I buy MET because of this buyback? A: This is not financial advice. While a buyback is a strong positive signal, it is one factor among many. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) on the project’s fundamentals, technology, and roadmap before making any investment decision. Found this analysis of the Meteora token buyback insightful?

This vision is now a reality as Google launches managed MCP servers, fundamentally changing how AI agents interact with enterprise tools. For cryptocurrency developers and businesses leveraging AI for analytics and automation, this breakthrough means faster deployment and more reliable connections between intelligent systems and critical data sources. What Are Google MCP Servers and Why Do They Matter? Google’s new managed MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers represent a strategic move to solve one of enterprise AI’s biggest challenges: connecting AI agents to external tools and data. Instead of developers spending weeks building fragile connectors, they can now paste a URL to connect AI systems directly to Google Cloud services. This development follows Google’s Gemini 3 model launch and aims to pair advanced reasoning with dependable real-world connections. Steren Giannini, product management director at Google Cloud, told Bitcoin World: “We are making Google agent-ready by design.” The initial rollout includes MCP servers for four core services: Google Maps : Provides up-to-date location data for trip planning and logistics BigQuery : Enables direct analytics assistant queries Compute Engine : Allows infrastructure management through AI agents Kubernetes Engine : Supports operations automation How MCP Servers Transform Enterprise AI Integration The Model Context Protocol, developed by Anthropic about a year ago, has become an open-source standard for connecting AI systems with data and tools. Google’s implementation brings enterprise-grade reliability to this ecosystem. Giannini explained the protocol’s advantage: “The beauty of MCP is that, because it’s a standard, if Google provides a server, it can connect to any client.” This standardization means Google’s MCP servers work with multiple AI platforms: MCP Client Compatibility Status Primary Use Cases Gemini CLI & AI Studio Native integration Google’s own AI development tools Anthropic’s Claude Tested and working Enterprise AI applications OpenAI’s ChatGPT Tested and working General AI assistant integration The Enterprise Security Advantage of Managed MCP Servers Security remains a critical concern for businesses deploying AI agents. Google addresses this through multiple layers of protection built into their MCP server implementation: Google Cloud IAM : Explicit permission controls for agent actions Google Cloud Model Armor : Specialized firewall against agentic threats like prompt injection Audit logging : Complete observability for administrator monitoring Apigee integration : Existing API management controls extended to AI agents Giannini emphasized the security approach: “The same API guardrails companies use for human-built apps could now apply to AI agents, too.” This means enterprises can maintain their existing security postures while expanding AI capabilities. Practical Applications for Businesses and Developers The immediate benefits of Google’s MCP servers are already visible in several use cases. For location-based services, AI agents can now access current Maps data rather than relying on potentially outdated model knowledge. In analytics, assistants can query BigQuery directly for real-time business insights. Infrastructure management becomes more efficient as ops agents interact with Compute Engine and Kubernetes Engine services. Giannini provided a concrete example: “Without the MCP, developers would rely on the model’s built-in knowledge. But by giving your agent a tool like the Google Maps MCP server, then it gets grounded on actual, up-to-date location information for places or trips planning.” Future Expansion and Industry Impact Google plans significant expansion of its MCP server offerings. In the coming months, the company will add support for services across storage, databases, logging and monitoring, and security domains. “We expect to bring them to general availability very soon in the new year,” Giannini said, noting that additional MCP servers will be released weekly. The timing coincides with Anthropic’s donation of MCP to a new Linux Foundation fund dedicated to open-sourcing AI agent infrastructure. This industry-wide standardization effort suggests MCP will become increasingly important for enterprise AI deployments. FAQs About Google’s MCP Server Launch What is MCP and who created it? MCP stands for Model Context Protocol, an open-source standard developed by Anthropic to connect AI systems with external data and tools. Which Google executives are leading this initiative? Steren Giannini, Product Management Director at Google Cloud , is the primary spokesperson for the MCP server launch. How does this relate to other AI companies’ offerings? Google’s MCP servers are compatible with AI systems from OpenAI and Anthropic, creating interoperability across major AI platforms. What enterprise products integrate with MCP servers? Google’s Apigee API management product can translate standard APIs into MCP servers, extending existing enterprise controls to AI agents. When will these services be generally available? Google plans general availability “very soon in the new year,” with current access through public preview for enterprise customers. Conclusion: A New Era of Enterprise AI Integration Google’s managed MCP servers represent a pivotal advancement in enterprise AI capabilities. By providing standardized, secure connections between AI agents and Google Cloud services, businesses can deploy intelligent systems faster and with greater confidence. The integration with existing security frameworks through Apigee and Google Cloud IAM ensures that AI expansion doesn’t come at the cost of governance or control. As Giannini succinctly put it: “We built the plumbing so that developers don’t have to.” This approach—combining the flexibility of open standards with enterprise-grade management—positions Google as a key enabler of the next generation of AI applications. For cryptocurrency and blockchain companies looking to integrate AI for analytics, automation, or customer service, these developments offer a streamlined path to implementation.

In particular, the data implies that leveraged traders rapidly increased their bullish exposure. For instance, such a positive funding rate means that the futures price is trading at a significant premium to the spot price, as traders betting on XRP’s price to go up are more eager to maintain their long positions by paying high fees to those of the opposite conviction. Simultaneously, a 3.18% increase in XRP open interest suggests that the staggering figure was not the result of a mere adjustment of existing positions but a hint of fresh capital making its way into the market. In other words, more contracts are being opened, which means a growing number of participants and larger amounts of money in leveraged trades. XRP derivatives overview. Source: CryptoQuant XRP funding rates spike, but risk still remains As such, the simultaneous uptick in funding rates and open interest could signal strong short-term bullish momentum, albeit with a critical risk. Namely, the setup can also be interpreted as a step toward a more overheated trading environment. When the funding rate is this high, the potential for an XRP long squeeze also increases dramatically. That is, if the token’s price experiences a sudden dip, the leveraged long positions could be quickly liquidated. This forced selling by margin calls would create a cascading effect, driving the price down rapidly and obliterating crowded leveraged longs. Indeed, the cryptocurrency appears somewhat vulnerable to potential price swings, trading at $2.06 at press time, up 0.36% on the daily chart after having lost most of the gains from the 6% rally the day prior. XRP 24-hour price. Source: Finbold Likewise, the value of XRP held on exchanges has fallen sharply, dropping from $7.03 billion on November 10, 2025, to $5.70 billion on December 10, a decline of 18.8%. Historically, such decreases have coincided with XRP price fluctuations and suggest traders are exhibiting more cautious market behavior, profit-taking, or reduced speculative activity. Therefore, while the situation with rising funding rates and open interest might appear bullish , it represents a dose of extra volatility risk for the cryptocurrency that is already looking at a potential correction.

ChartNerd highlights two key bullish cross signals in 2025, whereby one sparked a 600% surge, the other a 130% rally, showcasing the explosive upside potential when market conditions align. XRP is currently trading at $2.06 and based on ChartNerd’s analysis, a bullish Stoch RSI setup could trigger a significant move, with potential targets ranging from $2.67 on the conservative side to $12.36 if momentum mirrors past trends, highlighting both crypto’s speculative nature and its strong upside potential. Technical analysis provides a framework for anticipating price moves based on historical patterns and market psychology. The Stoch RSI gauges momentum relative to recent highs and lows, highlighting overbought or oversold conditions. XRP’s weekly chart shows a bullish cross in oversold territory, a signal that downward pressure may have peaked and a reversal or strong upward correction could be imminent. Traders increasingly use such setups to time entries and exits in volatile markets like XRP. While broader macroeconomic factors and market sentiment will shape the outcome, the current technical positioning makes XRP a key asset to watch.

This high-stakes dialogue marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing conflict, with potential ripple effects across international diplomacy, security, and financial markets. For observers of global affairs, understanding the contours of this proposed draft peace plan is crucial. What Does This Draft Peace Plan Mean for the Conflict? The announcement signals a potential shift toward formalized negotiations. While details remain confidential, a US-backed draft peace plan suggests a framework is being prepared to move from battlefield stalemate to diplomatic resolution. This plan likely addresses core issues that have prolonged the war. However, the path from a draft to a signed agreement is fraught with challenges. Key Challenges on the Road to Peace Forging a lasting agreement requires navigating a complex web of interests. The primary hurdles include: Territorial Integrity: Agreeing on the status of Russian-occupied regions remains the most contentious point. Security Guarantees: Ukraine will demand ironclad assurances to prevent future aggression. Reconstruction Funding: A credible plan must outline who pays for rebuilding Ukraine’s devastated infrastructure. Accountability: Addressing war crimes and establishing justice mechanisms is essential for long-term stability. Therefore, today’s discussion is just the first step in a long and difficult process. Why Should the Crypto World Watch These Peace Talks? Geopolitical events directly influence market sentiment and asset volatility. A credible draft peace plan could act as a stabilizing force. Specifically, reduced geopolitical risk often leads to decreased demand for traditional safe-haven assets, potentially redirecting capital flows. Moreover, stability in Eastern Europe can improve global supply chains and energy markets, reducing inflationary pressures that impact investment decisions. Consequently, progress in these talks is a key macro indicator for traders and long-term holders alike. Actionable Insights for Informed Observers While the situation is fluid, you can stay ahead by monitoring reliable sources. Focus on official statements from the Ukrainian government and the US State Department for factual updates. Be skeptical of unverified claims on social media. Furthermore, watch for reactions from other key players, especially European allies and Russia itself. Their responses will indicate the plan’s viability. Finally, understand that markets may react to headlines, but sustainable trends will only emerge from concrete, implemented agreements. A Hopeful Step Toward a Secure Future The discussion of a US-Ukraine draft peace plan represents a glimmer of hope in a prolonged conflict. It underscores a shared commitment to finding a diplomatic off-ramp.

The cryptocurrency’s volatility, a key ingredient for major price moves, has collapsed to multi-month lows. This sharp decline in Bitcoin volatility is now casting serious doubt on the possibility of a traditional Santa Claus rally for the flagship digital asset. What Does Plummeting Bitcoin Volatility Actually Mean? Think of volatility as the market’s heartbeat. High readings signal excitement, fear, and the potential for big swings. Low readings, like we see now, indicate calm, consolidation, and often, a lack of directional momentum. The specific metric causing concern is the Volmex BTC 30-day Implied Volatility Index (BVIV), which has fallen sharply from 65% in mid-November to just 49%. This index doesn’t measure past price swings. Instead, it looks at options market data to gauge what traders expect for future turbulence. The message is clear: the smart money is betting on a quiet end to the year. Why Is Low Bitcoin Volatility a Problem for Bulls? A year-end rally typically needs a catalyst—a spark that ignites buying frenzy. However, suppressed volatility creates a challenging environment for such a spark to catch fire. Here’s why low volatility can be a rally killer: Reduced Trader Interest: Many active traders thrive on price swings. Calm markets often lead to lower trading volumes. Fewer Liquidations: Dramatic rallies often get fuel from cascading short liquidations. In a flat market, these events are less likely. Catalyst Dependence: Any positive news must be exceptionally powerful to break the market out of its low-volatility slumber. Matrixport, a prominent crypto services firm, directly linked the shrinking implied volatility to reduced chances for a significant December price surge. Is There One Last Hope for a Volatility Spike? Analysts point to one potential, but fleeting, catalyst on the horizon: the upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on December 11th. These meetings, where interest rate decisions are discussed, have historically caused ripples across all risk assets, including Bitcoin. The market will scrutinize every word from Fed Chair Jerome Powell for hints about the 2024 policy path. A surprisingly hawkish or dovish tone could inject a short-term dose of volatility. However, the consensus warning is clear: any spike may be temporary. Matrixport suggests that after this event, market volatility could slow down even further, leading into the holiday season. Actionable Insights for Navigating Low Bitcoin Volatility What should an investor do in this environment? Panic isn’t the answer. Instead, consider adjusting your strategy: Manage Expectations: Dial back hopes for a 20%+ moonshot in December. Focus on consolidation and accumulation. Explore Different Strategies: Low volatility environments can favor certain options strategies, like selling premium, which benefit from calm markets. Think Longer-Term: Use the quiet period to research and plan for 2024. The next major volatility cycle will come. Remember, low volatility is not inherently bearish. It often represents a coiling period that precedes the next major directional move, even if that move now seems more likely to occur in the new year. Conclusion: A Quiet End to a Volatile Year? The dramatic drop in the Bitcoin volatility index presents a clear narrative. The explosive price action many investors associate with crypto is taking a year-end break. While the FOMC meeting offers a final potential spark, the underlying data suggests traders should prepare for a quieter finish to 2023. This period of calm, however, may simply be the market gathering its breath before the next major trend emerges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIV)? A1: The BVIV, or Bitcoin Volatility Index, is a metric that measures the market’s expectation of future Bitcoin price volatility over the next 30 days. It is derived from options prices, not past price movements. Q2: Does low Bitcoin volatility mean the price won’t go up? A2: Not necessarily. It means the market expects smaller, less dramatic price swings. The price can still trend upward, but likely in a slower, more gradual manner without large daily spikes. Q3: Why is the FOMC meeting important for Bitcoin volatility? A3: The Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates influence the entire global financial market. Surprises or shifts in policy tone can cause sudden reassessments of risk, impacting assets like Bitcoin and triggering short-term volatility. Q4: Should I sell my Bitcoin because volatility is low? A4: Low volatility alone is not a sell signal. It’s a market condition. Your decision should be based on your investment thesis, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Many long-term investors use low-volatility periods to accumulate assets. Q5: Could Bitcoin volatility suddenly spike again? A5: Absolutely. Volatility is cyclical. An unexpected major news event, a regulatory announcement, or a large market move can cause volatility to return very quickly. Q6: How does this affect altcoins? A6: Altcoins typically exhibit even higher volatility than Bitcoin. When Bitcoin’s volatility compresses, it often leads to reduced trading activity and liquidity across the entire crypto market, usually suppressing altcoin volatility as well.

The meetings bring US Deputy Trade Representative Rick Switzer face-to-face with India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal. According to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the talks covered trade, technology, and supply chains as both sides pushed for movement before year-end. Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the meetings focused on the strong India–US economic and technology partnership, ongoing negotiations, and chances to raise two-way trade and build resilient supply chains. Rick and Brendan Lynch, the chief US trade negotiator, are in India from December 9 to 11 to advance the broader deal that has been under quiet negotiation since March. The goal on both sides is to lock the first stage before December ends and prevent another public slip of the deadline that already caused unease. Switzer presses for tariff phase as Trump keeps pressure on rice Washington and New Delhi are building the agreement in phases, with the opening stage aimed at removing the retaliatory duties Donald Trump placed on Indian goods. The 50% rate also reflects penalties tied to India’s continued purchases of Russian oil. In November, Trump said he would cut tariffs at some point, but days ago he warned he could act against India over claims of Indian rice being dumped into the US market if dispute grows. The two governments had planned to finish the first tariff-focused portion of the deal by the fall, but the calendar ran out. In recent weeks, Indian officials have said they now see a chance to close that opening section before December ends. One official said the talks also covered broader economic and trade ties alongside the push to complete a deal both sides see as mutually useful after several rounds that failed to bridge gaps. Refiners buy discounted Russian crude as Reliance stays out Four of India’s seven largest refiners are now shopping for Russian crude as deep discounts pull buyers toward barrels that avoid sanctions, while Reliance Industries stays out. Indian Oil Corp. and Bharat Petroleum Corp. have bought about 10 cargoes of unsanctioned crude, including Urals, in recent days. Hindustan Petroleum Corp. is seeking supply for January delivery. Including Nayara Energy, which continues to take Russian crude even after being blacklisted in Europe, those four refiners made up just over 60% of India’s oil imports this year, based on tracking firm Kpler. None of the companies returned emailed questions. One large buyer is missing from that group. Reliance is now avoiding Russian oil even under a term contract with Rosneft for 500,000 barrels a day. Retreat reflects sanctions. Russian crude is trading near $40 to $45 a barrel in India as price cuts try to outrun political risk. India imported more than 2 million barrels per day at the June peak. That flow is expected to slide to about 1.3 million barrels in December, helped by cargoes booked before new curbs, and then sink lower in January. It remains unclear whether those reduced volumes satisfy Trump, who has accused India of financing Vladimir Putin’s war and demanded the two cut ties. A long-awaited trade deal still remains unfinished.

That’s exactly what the Sei blockchain is achieving through its groundbreaking partnership with tech giant Xiaomi. This strategic move represents one of the most significant mass adoption plays in cryptocurrency history, potentially bringing blockchain technology to mainstream consumers worldwide. How Is Sei Blockchain Leveraging Xiaomi’s Global Reach? According to reports from Solid Intel, the Sei blockchain project is expanding its business through a clever integration strategy. Xiaomi will pre-install a Sei-powered application on its smartphones, which are used by millions globally. This approach bypasses traditional adoption barriers by placing blockchain technology directly into users’ hands from the moment they unbox their devices. This partnership works because Xiaomi ranks among the world’s top smartphone manufacturers. Their devices reach markets across Asia, Europe, and beyond. Therefore, the Sei blockchain gains immediate access to a diverse, global audience without requiring users to seek out blockchain applications independently. What Does This Mean for Everyday Users? For the average smartphone user, this integration means seamless exposure to blockchain technology. The pre-installed app will introduce users to the Sei blockchain ecosystem without technical complexity. Consider these potential benefits: Frictionless onboarding: Users encounter blockchain naturally through their daily device use Educational opportunities: The app can introduce blockchain concepts through practical applications Real-world utility: Immediate access to blockchain services without additional downloads Global accessibility: Technology reaches users in both developed and emerging markets What’s Next in the Sei and Xiaomi Collaboration? The partnership extends beyond simple app installation. The Sei blockchain team is developing a new payment system specifically for the next phase of collaboration. This system could revolutionize how Xiaomi users interact with digital payments and financial services. This payment solution might integrate with Xiaomi’s existing ecosystem, which includes smart home devices, wearables, and other connected technologies. Consequently, the Sei blockchain could become the underlying infrastructure for a comprehensive digital economy spanning multiple device categories and user interactions. Why This Partnership Matters for Crypto Adoption Mass adoption remains cryptocurrency’s greatest challenge. Most blockchain projects struggle to move beyond tech-savvy early adopters. However, the Sei blockchain approach through Xiaomi represents a paradigm shift. Instead of asking users to come to blockchain, blockchain comes to users through devices they already own and trust. This strategy addresses several critical adoption barriers simultaneously: Trust: Users already trust their Xiaomi devices Convenience: No additional installation or setup required Education: Learning happens through use rather than study Scale: Immediate access to millions rather than gradual growth Potential Challenges and Considerations While promising, this expansion faces legitimate challenges. Regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions requires careful navigation. Moreover, user experience must be flawless to prevent frustration that could turn users away from blockchain technology entirely. The Sei blockchain team must ensure their technology scales effectively to handle potential millions of simultaneous users. Additionally, they must provide clear value propositions that encourage continued engagement beyond initial curiosity. The Future of Blockchain Integration This partnership could establish a blueprint for other blockchain projects seeking mass adoption. If successful, we might see similar integrations between blockchain platforms and consumer electronics manufacturers worldwide. The Sei blockchain initiative demonstrates how strategic partnerships can accelerate technology adoption more effectively than organic growth alone. Looking ahead, the payment system development suggests this collaboration will deepen over time. We might eventually see the Sei blockchain integrated into Xiaomi’s broader ecosystem, including IoT devices, financial services, and digital marketplaces. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto The Sei blockchain partnership with Xiaomi represents more than just another business deal. It’s a strategic masterstroke that could bring blockchain technology to mainstream audiences at unprecedented scale. By leveraging Xiaomi’s global user base through pre-installed applications, Sei bypasses traditional adoption barriers and positions itself at the forefront of the next wave of cryptocurrency integration. As the collaboration progresses to payment system development, watch how this partnership evolves. It could well become the model that other projects emulate, fundamentally changing how blockchain technology reaches everyday users worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Sei blockchain? The Sei blockchain is a specialized blockchain network designed for trading and financial applications, focusing on high speed and low transaction costs. How will Xiaomi users access the Sei blockchain? Xiaomi will pre-install a Sei-powered application on their smartphones, making the technology immediately available to users without requiring them to download anything additional. What benefits does this partnership offer regular users? Users gain exposure to blockchain technology through trusted devices, potential access to new payment systems, and entry into the cryptocurrency ecosystem with minimal technical knowledge required. When will this integration be available? While specific timelines haven’t been announced, reports indicate the pre-installed app is part of current expansion plans, with a payment system in development for future stages. Is this partnership exclusive to certain regions? Details about regional availability haven’t been specified, but given Xiaomi’s global presence, the integration likely targets multiple international markets. What makes this different from other crypto adoption strategies? This approach brings blockchain to users through devices they already own and use daily, rather than requiring them to seek out blockchain technology independently.

As a result, the Payments Market Practice Group (PMPG) has published guidelines aimed at addressing the lack of data quality. As reported by Cryptopolitan, ISO 20022 assumed several roles in supporting various payment and settlement processes, including cross-border wire transfers and securities transactions. It provides more detailed, structured, and machine-readable information to be carried in payment messages, which the older formats could not efficiently support. However, just weeks into full enforcement, banks are grappling with real-world disruptions. Although the large institutions, including the top 175 SWIFT members that handle 80% of the volume, largely met the deadline, smaller and mid-tier banks report ongoing issues. Adoption rates are hovering around 80-90% globally. Surveys show 10-18% of FIs in EMEA/NA and 7.5% in APAC said they weren’t ready before the deadline , leading to immediate operational strains. Decades-old core banking systems struggle to handle ISO 20022’s data structures According to reports, poor data quality is often attributed to hybrid address formats. Enhanced fields, like structured addresses, go beyond the old limits. This cuts off data in transitions and creates compliance holes in sanctions screening. BREAKING: Banks appear to be experiencing issues with the hybrid address introduced in #ISO20022 . As reported by @DPS_Gruppe , the Payments Market Practice Group (PMPG) has therefore published guidelines aimed at addressing the lack of data quality. https://t.co/LUnnBK2sR3 — Payment Infrastructure News (@payment_infrast) December 10, 2025 Non-compliant messages are also being rejected immediately. This causes delays in cross-border transactions and forces manual interventions. Banks that rely on Swift’s short-term translation solutions experience “lossy” changes, which means important data is either cut off or lost. This has led to many failed payments. As of early December, “ripple effects” in correspondent banking networks, with isolated non-adopters causing problems in whole chains. Smaller US banks and those in developing markets report that up to 10% of payments are stalling, which is harming customer trust and incurring recovery costs. Additionally, decades-old core banking systems can’t natively handle ISO 20022’s XML-based data structures. This is causing costly middleware or full replacements. Batch-to-real-time processing shifts have exposed vulnerabilities in end-to-end chains, with 48% of banks identifying this as their top hurdle. Regional differences make it challenging to perform multiple transfers simultaneously. Emerging markets are lagging, forcing non-STP processes to adapt. According to BIS data, 50% of central banks were behind schedule by mid-2025, which caused “operational headaches” such as payments that couldn’t be processed. If partners demand native ISO support, banks say they will be cut off from global flows, and their image will suffer. However, 97% of compliant cross-border flows now benefit from reduced failures and STP rates up 20-30%. PMPG puts out a new Hybrid Postal Address The Payments Market Practice Group (PMPG) has released a new guide for banks on Hybrid Postal Addresses, including a grace period. This gave banks helpful guidance on how to get through the ISO 20022 transition period, which runs from November 2025 to November 2026. The guide addresses increasing data quality issues surrounding hybrid addresses, including the misuse of fields, missing mandatory information, and duplicate information. These issues can lead to rework, delays, and increased screening risk. By 2026, all unorganized addresses will be thrown away as part of the change. By 2027, new E&I messages camt.110/111 will be in use, and the move of MT101, MT9xx, and other message groups will be done by 2028 at the latest. Some banks are already on the move. For instance, Deutsche Bank stressed that starting in 2026, there will be yearly changes based on ISO 20022. This means that new validation rules and stricter data quality standards will come into effect. Market platforms like T2 are changing their policies and release cycles to make sure they follow ISO 20022 requirements. The new FATF standards and CPMI harmonization criteria also mean that the data model needs to be changed. To that end, the industry is now transitioning from migration to harmonization, focusing on data quality and the comprehensive utilization of the structured standard.

This remarkable achievement sees the AI assistant surpassing social media giants and essential utilities, demonstrating how artificial intelligence is fundamentally changing how Americans interact with their devices. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching the intersection of AI and technology adoption, this represents more than just app store rankings—it’s a glimpse into how AI tools are becoming daily essentials, potentially creating new opportunities at the convergence of AI and blockchain technologies. ChatGPT’s Meteoric Rise in the Apple App Store The journey of ChatGPT through Apple’s download charts tells a compelling story of rapid adoption. In 2023, despite launching on iPhone in May with strong initial interest, the AI app failed to crack the top ten. By 2024, it had climbed to number four, trailing behind Chinese shopping app Temu. Now in 2025, ChatGPT stands alone at the summit, followed by Meta’s Threads, Google, TikTok, and WhatsApp. This three-year progression from outside the top ten to number one demonstrates accelerating mainstream acceptance of AI tools. How AI Apps Are Reshaping Mobile Behavior The fact that an AI chatbot now outranks essential utilities like Google Maps and communication platforms like Instagram reveals a significant shift in user priorities. Several factors contribute to this transformation: Versatile functionality: ChatGPT serves as research assistant, writing partner, coding helper, and creative collaborator Time efficiency: Users can get answers faster than traditional search methods Personalization: The AI adapts to individual user needs and conversation styles Educational value: Many users treat ChatGPT as a learning tool across multiple subjects The Battle for Mobile Search Supremacy Perhaps the most significant implication of ChatGPT’s dominance is the potential disruption of Google’s mobile search stronghold. As more users turn to conversational AI for answers first, traditional search engines face unprecedented competition. This shift represents more than just changing user preferences—it suggests a fundamental rethinking of how information should be accessed on mobile devices. The inclusion of Google’s own AI offering, Gemini, at number ten on the list shows that even established players recognize this transformation. 2025 Apple App Store Rankings Comparison Rank Free iPhone Apps Free iPhone Games Paid iPhone Apps 1 ChatGPT Block Blast! HotSchedules 2 Threads Fortnite Shadowrocket 3 Google Roblox Procreate Pocket 4 TikTok Township AnkiMobile Flashcards 5 WhatsApp Pokémon TCG Pocket Paprika Recipe Manager 3 Global Momentum and Market Implications The US achievement follows ChatGPT’s global milestone in March 2025, when it became the world’s most downloaded app, outpacing TikTok and Instagram. This consistent performance across markets suggests that AI adoption is not a regional phenomenon but a global trend with staying power. For investors and technology observers, this signals several important developments: AI tools are transitioning from novelty to necessity >The app store economy is shifting toward productivity and utility >User behavior is evolving toward conversational interfaces >The barrier between search and assistance is blurring What This Means for the Future of Mobile Technology ChatGPT’s position at the top of Apple’s download charts represents more than just a successful app—it signifies a turning point in how we interact with technology. The implications extend across multiple domains: For developers: The success demonstrates demand for intelligent, conversational interfaces For businesses: AI integration becomes increasingly important for customer engagement For users: Expectations for intelligent assistance will continue to rise For competitors: The pressure to deliver comparable AI experiences intensifies Frequently Asked Questions What was the most downloaded iPhone game in 2025? Block Blast! claimed the top spot for free iPhone games, while Minecraft remained the most popular paid game. How does ChatGPT’s performance compare to previous years? ChatGPT showed remarkable growth, moving from outside the top ten in 2023 to number four in 2024 before reaching number one in 2025. What other AI apps made the top lists? Google’s Gemini AI assistant ranked tenth among free iPhone apps, indicating growing competition in the AI assistant space. Who developed ChatGPT? ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI , an artificial intelligence research laboratory. What social media apps ranked highly in 2025? Threads (Meta’s platform), TikTok, Instagram, and WhatsApp all placed in the top ten, showing continued social media dominance alongside AI growth. The Unstoppable Rise of AI Integration The ascension of ChatGPT to the top of Apple’s download charts represents a watershed moment for artificial intelligence in everyday life. This isn’t merely about one app’s success—it’s about the mainstream acceptance of AI as an essential tool. The fact that users are choosing an AI assistant over established social networks and utilities suggests we’re entering a new phase of digital interaction. As AI continues to evolve and integrate more deeply into our daily routines, we can expect this trend to accelerate, potentially reshaping everything from how we work to how we learn and communicate.

Strategy has submitted its response to MSCI’s consultation on digital asset treasury companies. Index standards should be neutral, consistent, and reflective of global market evolution. Read our letter and share your support: https://t.co/QVmKAkwRCP — Strategy (@Strategy) December 10, 2025 MSCI has proposed excluding from its Global Investable Market Indexes any company whose digital asset holdings represent 50% or more of total assets. In a letter dated December 10, sent by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor and CEO Phong Le, Strategy argues the move is “misguided” and would have “profoundly harmful consequences” for capital markets, innovation, and U.S. leadership in digital assets. “DATs Are Operating Companies, Not Investment Funds” The core of Strategy’s argument is that DATs like itself are operating businesses, not passive investment funds. Strategy stresses that it does not simply sit on a Bitcoin hoard; instead, it runs a Bitcoin-backed corporate treasury and capital markets program, issuing a range of equity and fixed-income instruments that provide investors with varying degrees of Bitcoin exposure. It compares this model to banks and insurers that capture a spread between financing costs and returns on underlying assets. The company notes that many traditional firms—such as oil majors, REITs, timber companies and media groups—are also heavily concentrated in a single asset type, yet are not treated as funds or excluded from indices. Singling out digital-asset-heavy balance sheets, it says, would be discriminatory and inconsistent. Strategy Warns of Index Instability and Policy Bias Strategy contends that MSCI’s proposed 50% digital asset threshold is both arbitrary and unworkable. Given crypto price volatility and divergent accounting standards (GAAP vs. IFRS), companies could “whipsaw on and off” MSCI indices as market values fluctuate, undermining index stability and investor confidence. The letter also accuses MSCI of improperly injecting policy judgments into index construction, departing from its stated role as a neutral provider of “exhaustive” benchmarks that reflect market evolution rather than deeming certain business models “good or bad.” Excluding DATs, Strategy argues, would structurally under-represent a fast-growing segment of the economy and call into question the neutrality of MSCI’s indices. Conflict with U.S. Digital Asset Strategy and Call for Extended Review Strategy further argues that the proposal conflicts with the current U.S. administration’s pro-innovation digital asset agenda, including initiatives like a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and efforts to expand access to digital assets in retirement plans. Excluding DATs from major benchmarks, the company says, would choke off access to passive capital, chill innovation, and weaken U.S. competitiveness in a strategically important sector. Concluding, Strategy urges MSCI to reject the proposal outright or, at minimum, extend the consultation and undertake a longer, more deliberate review as digital asset treasury models continue to mature. “The wiser course,” the letter states, “is for MSCI to remain neutral and let the markets decide the course of DATs.” The post Strategy Challenges MSCI Plan to Exclude Digital Asset Treasury Firms from Key Indexes appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitcoin|Michael Saylor|Strategy,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-12-10 15:46:06

In a move that has captured the attention of the crypto markets, Bitcoin mining giant MARA Holdings has made a significant transaction. According to on-chain sleuths at Lookonchain, the company deposited a substantial 275 BTC, valued at approximately $25.31 million, to the prime brokerage platform FalconX. This single action by MARA Holdings deposits 275 BTC into the spotlight, raising immediate questions about the firm’s strategy and potential ripple effects for Bitcoin’s price. Let’s decode what this major transfer could truly mean. What Does the MARA Holdings 275 BTC Deposit Signal? When a publicly traded mining company moves a large chunk of its mined Bitcoin, the market takes notice. The deposit from MARA Holdings to FalconX, a platform known for serving institutional clients with trading and lending services, is particularly telling. Analysts often view such transfers to prime brokers as a precursor to several actions. Therefore, this isn’t just a routine wallet movement; it’s a strategic financial decision with clear intent. Lookonchain’s report suggests the deposit could indicate a potential sale. However, it’s crucial to consider the full spectrum of possibilities. The move could also be for: Collateral for Financing: Using Bitcoin as collateral to secure loans or other financial instruments. Risk Management: Moving assets to a secure, institutional-grade custodian. Preparing for a Trade: Setting up capital for more complex trading strategies beyond a simple spot sale. Why Is This Bitcoin Mining Transaction So Significant? MARA Holdings is a major player in the Bitcoin mining industry. Their actions provide a transparent, on-chain look into the financial strategies of large-scale miners. These entities are not just network supporters; they are significant holders and sellers of Bitcoin. Their need to cover operational costs like electricity and hardware often means they are a consistent source of sell-side pressure. The timing and size of this transaction are key. A $25 million potential sale is substantial enough to influence market sentiment, even if it doesn’t drastically move the price on its own. It acts as a barometer for miner confidence and financial health. When MARA Holdings deposits 275 BTC to a broker, it sends a signal about their immediate liquidity needs and their view on holding versus converting their mined assets. Decoding the Broader Impact on the Crypto Market This event is a perfect case study in how on-chain analytics and institutional behavior intersect. For everyday investors, understanding these flows is becoming increasingly important. The deposit highlights several ongoing trends in the cryptocurrency space: Institutional Infrastructure at Work: The use of FalconX underscores the growing role of specialized prime brokers in crypto. Transparency of Public Miners: As public companies, their wallets are watched, making their strategies more transparent than private entities. Market Sentiment Driver: News of large potential sales can create short-term fear or uncertainty, affecting trader psychology. Ultimately, while the move by MARA Holdings deposits 275 BTC into a realm of speculation, it underscores a mature market phase. Large players are actively managing their treasury assets with sophisticated tools, moving beyond simple HODLing. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers What should you take away from this news? First, don’t panic. Large transactions are a normal part of a functioning market. Second, use resources like Lookonchain and other analytics platforms to follow these flows yourself. They offer invaluable, real-time data on whale movements. Finally, consider the context. Always ask: Is this part of a regular operational pattern for the miner, or does it deviate from their normal behavior? Monitoring when MARA Holdings deposits 275 BTC or similar assets helps you understand the undercurrents moving beneath the surface price action. It transforms you from a passive observer into an informed participant. Conclusion: A Strategic Move in a Maturing Ecosystem The deposit of 275 BTC by MARA Holdings to FalconX is more than a headline. It is a snapshot of the evolving Bitcoin economy, where mining companies act as sophisticated corporate treasuries. Whether this leads to a sale, secures financing, or serves another strategic purpose, it demonstrates calculated asset management. For the market, it’s a reminder of the constant interplay between mining rewards, operational costs, and strategic capital allocation that helps shape Bitcoin’s journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when a mining company deposits Bitcoin to a prime broker like FalconX? A: It typically means they are preparing to use those assets for financial activities, such as selling, using as loan collateral, or engaging in advanced trading. Prime brokers provide the infrastructure for these institutional-grade services. Q2: Will the MARA Holdings deposit of 275 BTC cause the Bitcoin price to drop? A: Not necessarily. A single transaction of this size is unlikely to crash the market on its own. However, it can influence short-term sentiment.

These tools track wallet addresses of known entities. Q4: Is it common for mining companies to sell their Bitcoin? A: Yes, it is standard practice. Miners often need to sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin to cover significant operational expenses like electricity, hardware costs, and staff salaries. Their selling activity is a regular part of market dynamics. Q5: What is FalconX? A: FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime brokerage that provides trading, credit, and custody services primarily for institutional clients like hedge funds, mining companies, and trading firms. Q6: Why is the transaction from MARA Holdings so transparent? A: MARA Holdings is a publicly traded company.

Introducing pre-installed SEI wallets on their devices could revolutionize crypto adoption. This bold step raises questions: Will this ignite the next surge in retail crypto engagement? Which coins stand to benefit from this wave? Discover the potential impacts and promising coins set for growth. Sei (SEI) Eyes Potential Growth Amid Current Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Sei (SEI) is presently trading between twelve and fourteen cents. It faces resistance at the fifteen-cent mark but finds support at eleven cents. With the Relative Strength Index at over 72, the coin is experiencing some price strength. The recent one-week uptick of almost 5% hints at potential upward momentum. If SEI breaks through its current resistance, it might aim for the seventeen-cent level, representing a possible gain of over 21%. However, with a one-month decline of 20%, traders are keeping an eye on longer-term trends. While recent movements suggest optimism, SEI remains a volatile asset under current market conditions. Conclusion The partnership between Xiaomi and SEI introduces the potential for broader crypto adoption. With wallets pre-installed on Xiaomi devices, SEI, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other principal coins may see increased use among new users. This accessibility could drive more retail interest in cryptocurrencies, making them more commonplace. The ease of use provided by pre-installed wallets can lower entry barriers, possibly leading to a rise in everyday transactions using these coins. The integration aims to make crypto a regular part of users' financial activities. If successful, this could contribute to a significant shift in how people view and use cryptocurrency.

At the same time, Bitcoin price action continues to react to Federal Reserve meetings and now hovers near the average cost basis of spot ETF buyers. Lummis Says Crypto Market Structure Bill Could Move Within Weeks Senator Cynthia Lummis says the long-awaited U.S. crypto market structure bill could advance within weeks as Senate negotiators finalize the latest draft. She discussed the timeline during recent policy meetings in Washington, noting that the Banking Committee is close to completing the text after months of revisions. Lummis and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand are leading the effort to create a federal framework that defines when a digital asset falls under SEC or CFTC oversight, sets licensing standards for trading platforms and custodians, and introduces clearer rules for market conduct. They aim to align their bill with the House’s earlier market-structure package, which already passed its first chamber. Despite her optimism, the bill still must clear committee markup, move through the full Senate and then be reconciled with the House version. Negotiators are also working through remaining points with the White House. Lummis said the final text is nearly ready, but progress depends on how quickly leadership schedules the next steps. Bitcoin Has Mostly Dropped After This Year’s Fed Meetings Bitcoin has usually moved lower after Federal Reserve policy decisions this year, according to data compiled by analyst Ali Martinez. The chart compares the seven 2025 Federal Open Market Committee meetings with subsequent price action and shows that six were followed by clear corrections in the BTC/USDT pair, while only one produced a short-lived bounce. Bitcoin Price Reactions After 2025 FOMC Meetings: Source: Ali, @ali_charts On the image, shaded boxes mark the trading windows that followed each FOMC announcement. After the late-January meeting, Bitcoin fell roughly 27 percent, while the March decision preceded another slide of about 14 percent. A smaller pullback of around 7 percent followed the June meeting, and the most recent decision in late October lined up with the steepest drop on the chart, a decline of about 29 percent from the local high. The lone exception came in early May, when Bitcoin briefly rallied more than 15 percent before giving back part of the move. Taken together, the sequences underline how closely Bitcoin has traded with shifting expectations for U.S. interest rates this year, with Fed days often acting as turning points that usher in fresh volatility and downside pressure. Bitcoin Tests ETF Cost Basis as Support Meanwhile, Bitcoin has pulled back to the area where U.S. spot ETFs hold their average purchase price, according to data shared by analyst Crypto Rover using Glassnode figures. The chart plots BTC’s dollar price against the cost basis of major issuers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, as well as a combined “all ETFs” line. Average Cost Basis of US Spot Bitcoin ETF Deposits: Source: Crypto Rover, Glassnode The white price line shows several earlier dips in 2024 and mid-2025 that briefly undercut or met the green “all ETFs cost basis” line before Bitcoin rebounded. The latest circled move at the right edge of the chart again brings BTC down toward that aggregate entry level, while ETF cost bases remain clustered below spot, indicating the cohort is still sitting on unrealized gains. Because of this, traders now watch the ETF cost-basis region as a potential support zone. If Bitcoin continues to respect that band, it would suggest that large ETF buyers are not yet deeply under water, even after the recent correction.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 15:59:24

The more interesting development for traders this week, however, remains the explosive surge of interest observed in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi crypto that has recently caught the attention of analysts. Although XRP’s bullish formation remains a magnet for traders who focus on a potential break-out in this cryptocurrency, other factors have contributed to a newly realized wave of momentum for MUTM because of its fast-growing presale stage and new investor base. Its presale nears completion in the 6th stage with more than 18,400 early adopters participating. XRP Aims for a Rebound as Bulls Monitor Major Levels Before a Potential Surge towards $3 XRP has also made a 1.66% price gain within the last 24 hours. Traders are currently focused on this critical $1.852 level where a strong and well-known floor has bounced off in previous cycles. A successful hold above this level with continually accumulating momentum could signal a shift in trends and thus pave the way for an overall recovery while keeping the $3 price target in focus. While traders wait for direction on where XRP might go and examine strength levels for this potential countertrend move, some traders’ eyes are also attracted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the best crypto to buy today for early exposure in DeFi. Mutuum Finance Strengthens its Leadership Position in DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly making a name for itself as a distinguished project in the DeFi arena and providing a rare investment opportunity for purchasers to obtain a token before trading begins. This presale gives individuals access to a potentially powerful cryptocurrency for a fraction of its price. At present, presale stage 6 is ongoing with a price of $0.035. This is more than triple the initial price of $0.01 in stage 1. Early investors in this coin therefore have a great investment opportunity before phase 7 opens and further hikes the price to $0.04. With more than 95% being sold out in stage 6 with total contributions exceeding 18,400 individuals amounting to $19.25 million, MUTM has made a great entry in the marketplace. This makes it the best crypto to buy for late 2025 and early 2026, as well as a top DeFi crypto with solid fundamentals. Encourage Community Engagement Through Incentives Mutuum Finance engages its community and retains its loyalty through various incentives. Presale participants are rewarded with a $100,000 giveaway . This targets ten individuals who will be awarded $10,000 each. This campaign rewards those who have invested in Mutuum Finance early while also drawing in more investors. By encouraging transparency, user engagement, and ongoing involvement, MUTM distinguishes itself in the DeFi space and lays a strong groundwork for future successful expansion. By encouraging involvement and offering rewards right away, this project further cements its importance as a promising investing opportunity in DeFi. Foundational Pillars: Security & Trustworthiness Security continues to be one of the most prominent concerns for Mutuum Finance. The smart contracts for loans and borrowing on this platform are being thoroughly audited for security by Halborn Security , a renowned company in this space. After completing this audit process, the team will make a public announcement regarding the schedule for the testnet launch. This helps early users connect with this platform in a fully verified and secure manner. By securing a scaled DeFi environment with appropriate security measures, MUTM is providing confidence to its investors regarding its technological strength.

Related Reading: NFT Slump Worsens With Monthly Sales Hitting Rock Bottom According to TradingView data, Bitcoin price topped out at $94,600 late in the session — its highest level since November 25 — then eased to about $92,450 at the time of reporting. Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, said social chatter calling for “higher” and “above” exploded during the spike, but market action remained uneven. Bitcoin: Trader Frenzy And Skepticism Reports have disclosed that the surge drew heavy retail attention and a flurry of social-media posts urging more buying. Some market watchers questioned how organic the rise was. A well-known long-term investor using the handle “NoLimit” told his 53,000 X followers that the $94,000 push looked engineered: big buys packed into a few minutes, thin order books, then little follow-through. 🤑 Bitcoin enjoyed a much needed rebound back to $94.6K today, reinvigorating traders, causing them to FOMO back in and expect higher prices. According to our social data scraping X, Reddit, Telegram, & other data, calls for “higher” & “above” exploded. 🟦 High bars indicate… pic.twitter.com/o3U3yWkwkk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 9, 2025 That pattern, he argued, is how larger traders can create short-term fear of missing out so they can sell into strength. Santiment also highlighted a behavioral twist: smaller traders appear to pile in after spikes, often leaving them on the wrong side of moves. Volatility followed the high, as prices pulled back by a couple thousand dollars within hours. Exchange order depth and timing of large blocks, analysts say, matter a lot when liquidity is shallow. Fed Decision Could Shift Momentum The US central bank meeting this week is a key wildcard. Market pricing on CME Group futures showed an 88% chance of a 0.25% rate cut, which many traders think helped fuel the rally. Yet some analysts warned that any sign of hesitation about future cuts could dampen risk appetite. Beyond US policy, next week’s potential Bank of Japan rate action is being watched because a tighter stance there could lift yields and pull capital back to Japan, tightening global liquidity. That kind of flow can pressure risky assets across markets. Liquidity, Institutions And The Bigger Picture Meanwhile, long-term holders pared back supply after a 36% correction from the all-time high, and some addresses now hold levels seen in March. Jessica Gonzales, an analyst cited in reports, said M2 money supply sits at about $22.3 trillion and stablecoin reserves remain elevated, suggesting there is capital around but not necessarily evenly distributed in markets. Institutional moves also feature: big firms such as BlackRock and Strategy have expanded crypto exposure, which could add a steadier buyer base — or simply shift where risk sits.

The next 25 days were flagged as especially important by several observers because liquidity swings and regulatory updates could flip the narrative fast. If a true broad-based bid forms, prices could move quickly. If the Fed signals caution, the opposite could happen.

One of the methods currently adopted by these companies to grow their ETH portfolios is via Ethereum Staking, where they earn notable rewards. SharpLink Scores Another Major Ethereum Staking In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, the Ethereum staking economy is still demonstrating its durability. As the staking economy gains traction, SharpLink Gaming, a leading public company, is once again at the center of this wave, with massive rewards from its ETH staking positions. Being the first publicly traded company to adopt ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset , SharpLink continues to increase its exposure to Ethereum, as evidenced by its staking gains. A recent post on the X platform by the company reveals another round of significant staking rewards in the past week. This development showcases the power of ETH’s proof-of-stake network in general as well as the company’s increasing yield performance. Furthermore, the most recent gains are bolstering confidence in long-term staking plans, which comes at a time when investors are keeping a closer eye on on-chain returns than ever. As seen in the latest report, SharpLink scooped in over 446 ETH from staking rewards just last week. It was worth noting that since the company launched its ETH treasury in June 2025, they has experienced a persistent rise in their cumulative staking rewards. Following the recent gains, the total cumulative rewards have reached 8,776 ETH, which seems to have ignited a frenzy in the community. The firm’s ETH holdings remain 100% staked in an institutional-grade manner and maintain compounding value for the treasury. Mlik Road, a crypto enthusiast, highlighted that at current prices and holdings, SharpLinks’ latest staking reward in one week is valued at $1.38 million. Interestingly, this amounts to around $70 million in income for the gaming firm annually. As rewards keep rolling in, the important part of this development is that this figure is only expected to continue growing. When the price of ETH rises, the staking revenue of SharpLink will increase. In addition, when the firm’s ETH holdings increase, its staking income will multiply. Whales Are Adding More ETH To Their Wallets Ethereum’s bounce appears to have shifted the sentiment of investors , especially large investors or whales, toward a bullish standpoint. According to Santiment, a leading market intelligence and on-chain data analytics platform, ETH was a notable gainer on Tuesday, with a rise of +8.5% and an optimistic accumulation trend from whales and sharks.

An 8 trillion SHIB withdrawal has stirred the crypto sphere, raising questions and speculation. Why such a large movement? What could it signal for the market? This article delves into the possible implications and coins poised for potential growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Hovers with Growth Potential on the Horizon Source: tradingview The Shiba Inu coin is dancing between two price points, hovering around $0.000008. It struggles to stay above its current resistance at a micro fraction above $0.00001. Pessimism reigns with a month-long drop of over 14%. Yet, hope gleams as the moving average suggests stability nearby. The coin’s struggle isn't over, but it could surge roughly 30% to its second resistance if it pushes forward. Expect a bump if buying interest rises, but caution remains with levels below $0.000007 as possible anchors. Investors see a tightrope between slow decline and a possible comeback on the crypto stage. Conclusion Large transactions involving SHIB indicate significant interest from big investors. An 8 trillion SHIB move points to potential future price shifts. Such activity can signal strategic positioning or anticipation of changes in market value. It's crucial to monitor these movements as they can influence market sentiment and inform trading strategies. Understanding the motives behind such large transfers could provide insights into broader market trends and investor behavior in the cryptocurrency space.

At the same time, a developing inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly chart suggests Ethereum may be building a long-term bullish base. Early Ethereum ICO Whale Moves Funds After 10,663x Gain An early Ethereum ICO participant shifted a small portion of long-held coins, onchain data from Onchain Lens shows. The wallet, labeled “ETH Millionaire,” controls 850 Ether bought for about $264 during the token sale. At current prices, that stash is valued near $2.82 million, marking a 10,663x return on the original outlay. Ethereum ICO Whale Transfer. Source: Onchain Lens In the latest activity, the address moved 22 ETH worth roughly $72,936. The holder sent 21 ETH to a deposit address linked to Coinbase and transferred 1 ETH to a fresh wallet. The remaining balance stayed in the original address, which still holds the bulk of the ICO-era coins. The transactions add to ongoing tracking of early Ethereum investors who are gradually testing liquidity on exchanges. However, the movement so far represents only a small fraction of the whale’s total holdings, while most of the 850 ETH remains untouched onchain. Ethereum Whales Add 800,000 ETH in One Month Meanwhile, Ethereum whales quietly increased their holdings over the past month, onchain data from Santiment shows. Addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH accumulated more than 800,000 coins during this period, even as price action stayed choppy. The chart from analyst Ali highlights how whale balances climbed while ETH moved through a wide trading range near the 3,000-dollar area. Ethereum Whale Accumulation Chart. Source: Ali Charts / Santiment This steady accumulation signals that large holders continued to buy on dips rather than reduce exposure. As the line tracking whale supply pushed higher, the price line showed several sharp swings, with rallies fading and new lows forming before a recent bounce. Yet, through these moves, the total held by big wallets kept rising, suggesting that long-term players treated volatility as an entry opportunity instead of a reason to exit. Ethereum Weekly Chart Maps Out Potential Inverse Head-and-Shoulders Ethereum’s weekly chart is shaping a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, analyst Merlijn The Trader noted on X. The structure shows a deep low in the middle, or “head,” flanked by two higher troughs that form the left and right shoulders under a long-term resistance line. Ethereum Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern. Source: Merlijn The Trader In this view, the left shoulder emerged after the early 2024 rally cooled, while the head formed during the sharp drawdown that followed. The current rebound from late-2025 lows is now carving out the right shoulder, with price attempting to stabilize above prior support levels. Merlijn describes this setup as one of the strongest bullish structures in crypto, pointing to its macro context on the higher timeframe.

Why does it matters: In July 2025, Ripple applied to the OCC for a national bank charter and a Federal Reserve master account. Approval would let Ripple operate as a federally regulated bank, offering deposits, custody, and direct Fed settlements, while giving its stablecoin RLUSD regulatory parity with traditional bank money. Securing a U.S. bank license would catapult Ripple into mainstream finance, giving it unmatched credibility among crypto projects. As a fully regulated institution, Ripple could transform XRP from a speculative token into a trusted ‘bridge asset,’ unlocking use cases in cross-border payments, stablecoin issuance, and institutional liquidity, marking a pivotal step in merging blockchain with traditional banking. Steph is Crypto says Ripple’s ‘imminent’ U.S. bank license isn’t just regulatory, it’s a potential financial infrastructure breakthrough. Integration into the regulated banking system could boost confidence among U.S. and global institutions, driving real-world demand for XRP, RLUSD, and Ripple payment solutions, likely fueling price gains. XRP Holds $2 Support as Buyers Step In Ahead of Potential Volatility Surge Market expert Vlad Anderson notes XRP is retesting the critical $2 support, with buyers stepping in strongly. While BTC, ETH, and SOL saw muted action, XRP surged with a 77% jump in trading volume, holding above $2.08. XRP is drawing heightened attention as it navigates a critical price juncture. With the $2.02 support under watch, a breach could push the cryptocurrency into a lower range of $1.85–$1.90, fueling short-term volatility. According to Anderson, XRP stands at a crossroads. Strong buying interest and key technical setups point to a “final squeeze,” a tightening phase that often precedes sharp directional moves. Such conditions typically attract speculative traders and whale activity, amplifying market momentum and potential price swings. Well, XRP’s recent performance stands out sharply against major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL, which struggled to gain momentum. A surge in XRP’s trading volume shows buyers actively defending key support levels, signaling investor confidence and short-term stability. Now perched between critical support and potential breakout, XRP is on the verge of heightened volatility. The coming days could define its next major move—whether a bullish surge or a temporary pullback, XRP is poised to dominate the crypto spotlight. Conclusion Ripple’s potential U.S. national bank license isn’t just regulatory approval, it could transform the company into a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain. This milestone would boost Ripple’s credibility, drive institutional adoption, and position XRP as a critical asset for cross-border payments and global finance. On the other hand, XRP’s hold above $2 marks a pivotal moment. With strong buying interest, a surge in volume, and the market entering a “final squeeze,” volatility is set to intensify. The $2.02 level is crucial because a breach could push XRP toward $1.85–$1.90, while a hold may trigger a bullish breakout. At this decisive crossroads, the next few days could define XRP’s next major move in the crypto markets.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 16:05:20

Extreme panic often pushes prices below intrinsic value. Historically, these moments have preceded some of crypto’s sharpest rebounds. Crypto commentator STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted XRP’s current situation on X. Steph argues that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index reading of 22 signals a prime buying opportunity . According to him, this extreme fear environment could allow investors to accumulate XRP at favorable prices. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index translates complex market sentiment into a single number between 0 and 100. Scores between 0 and 24 are classified as “Extreme Fear,” 25–49 as “Fear,” 50 as “Neutral,” 51–74 as “Greed,” and 75–100 as “Extreme Greed.” A reading of 22 falls deep into “Extreme Fear,” reflecting widespread panic and heavy selling pressure. Prices often overreact during these periods, creating potential opportunities for contrarian investors. Buy when there is blood in the streets. $XRP pic.twitter.com/C0A8ULzNcO — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 9, 2025 Contrarian Strategy: Buying in Fear Steph promotes a contrarian approach: buying when fear dominates the market . Panic-driven selling can push prices below fair value, creating a favorable entry point. This strategy is often summarized as “buy when there is blood in the streets.” For XRP, this could be especially relevant. The asset’s strong fundamentals, liquidity, and institutional adoption make it more likely to recover when sentiment improves. Early accumulation during extreme fear could yield significant long-term gains. XRP’s Fundamental Strength XRP benefits from real-world adoption, particularly in cross-border payments and institutional solutions . Unlike speculative tokens, XRP has established networks and ongoing partnerships, making it resilient during market stress. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This resilience is crucial during fear-driven downturns. While weaker tokens may collapse, XRP’s strong foundation increases the probability of a market rebound once panic subsides. Risks and Considerations Extreme fear may also reflect legitimate structural risks, such as regulatory uncertainty or broader macroeconomic weakness. Investors must combine sentiment analysis with technical and fundamental evaluation to manage potential losses. The Fear and Greed Index mainly reflects Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies, which may not fully capture altcoin-specific sentiment, including XRP. Therefore, careful assessment is necessary. Timing the Opportunity With the Crypto Fear and Greed Index at 22, Steph believes the current market presents an exceptional opportunity to buy XRP . Investors willing to act during panic may benefit from lower entry prices and long-term upside potential. This strategy should be applied judiciously, combining contrarian principles with risk management. For those confident in XRP’s fundamentals, the present fear-driven dip may offer one of the most compelling buying moments of the year.

Its newest Blackwell chips are expected to be the first to receive its location tracking feature, effectively deterring smugglers from transporting the advanced chips to banned countries. The new feature would work as optional software that data center operators could install on their systems. According to a Reuters report, Nvidia has developed location verification technology for its artificial intelligence chips that could help stop smugglers from moving restricted hardware to banned countries like China. The company has been demonstrating the software privately in recent months but has not yet released it to customers. According to sources familiar with the matter, the software measures the time delay in communications between the chips and Nvidia’s servers to estimate where the chips are located, similar to how other internet services determine location. Has Nvidia introduced location tracking in its chips? “We’re in the process of implementing a new software service that empowers data center operators to monitor the health and inventory of their entire AI GPU fleet,” Nvidia said in a statement. “This customer-installed software agent leverages GPU telemetry to monitor fleet health, integrity and inventory.” The location tracking feature will first become available on Nvidia’s newest Blackwell chips, which include more advanced security features for a process called attestation. Nvidia is also looking at ways to add the capability to its older Hopper and Ampere chip generations. Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has brought multiple criminal cases against China-connected smuggling networks that have tried to move advanced AI chips worth more than $160 million to China. Authorities announced Operation Gatekeeper this week, and so far it has led to the arrest of two Chinese nationals and the seizure of over $50 million in advanced Nvidia chips and cash. Between October 2024 and May 2025, smugglers exported and attempted to export at least $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 chips to China. The smugglers used fake companies, falsified shipping documents, and routed the contraband chips through third countries to avoid detection. In November, federal prosecutors charged four people with smuggling around 400 Nvidia A100 processors to China between October 2024 and January 2025. Law enforcement also disrupted two additional shipments that would have included supercomputers with H100 GPUs and H200 chips. The defendants allegedly received over $3.8 million in wire transfers to fund their operations. In July, China’s top cybersecurity regulator summoned Nvidia to ask if its products contained backdoors that would allow the U.S. to bypass security features. The Chinese regulator pointed out that U.S. lawmakers have previously made demands for tracking features. He also cited claims from U.S. AI experts about mature remote control technologies. Nvidia has strongly denied that its chips have backdoors. “Cybersecurity is critically important to us. Nvidia does not have ‘backdoors’ in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them,” the company stated. Trump’s H200 export policy President Donald Trump announced this week that he would allow Nvidia to export its H200 chips to approved customers in China, reversing the restrictions imposed during Biden’s tenure. Trump said the policy would require a 25% cut to the U.S. and would also apply to other chipmakers like AMD and Intel. He claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping “responded positively” to the proposal. The H200 is more advanced than the H20 chips previously allowed for export to China, but less powerful than Nvidia’s cutting-edge Blackwell and Rubin chips. A group of senators has called Trump’s decision a “colossal economic and national security failure,” arguing the H200 chips would give Chinese AI firms a meaningful performance boost. Think tank analysis suggests that the current advantage the U.S. has in AI computing power over China could shrink from ten times to five times if H200 exports are allowed. Cryptopolitan reports that Beijing plans to limit access to H200 chips through an approval process.

55606036,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=242239,1765383373,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Breakthrough: CFTC Greenlights BTC as Derivatives Collateral in Landmark Decision,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-derivatives-collateral-cftc/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Breakthrough: CFTC Greenlights BTC as Derivatives Collateral in Landmark Decision In a landmark move for cryptocurrency, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has officially opened the door for Bitcoin to be used as collateral in the derivatives market. This pivotal decision, confirmed by Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham on CNBC, signals a seismic shift in how regulators view digital assets and paves the way for greater institutional adoption. For investors and traders, this development fundamentally changes the Bitcoin derivatives collateral landscape. What Does the CFTC’s Bitcoin Derivatives Collateral Decision Mean? Caroline D. Pham’s confirmation on Squawk Box wasn’t just an offhand comment; it was a formal regulatory acknowledgment. The CFTC is launching a pilot program specifically for tokenized derivatives collateral. Initially, this program will permit only Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and USD Coin (USDC) to serve as collateral for the first three months. This structured approach allows the CFTC to monitor the integration of Bitcoin derivatives collateral into the existing financial framework safely. Why Is This a Game-Changer for Crypto Markets? This decision transforms Bitcoin from a speculative asset into a recognized financial instrument with utility. Previously, traders had to convert crypto to fiat to post collateral, incurring fees and delays. Now, they can use their Bitcoin holdings directly. This unlocks significant capital efficiency. Consider the immediate benefits: Capital Efficiency: Traders can leverage existing Bitcoin holdings without selling, preserving potential upside. Increased Liquidity: Billions in dormant Bitcoin can now be deployed in derivatives markets. Institutional Validation: A major U.S. regulator endorsing Bitcoin’s use adds immense credibility. Market Maturity: It integrates crypto deeper into the traditional financial plumbing. Therefore, the acceptance of Bitcoin derivatives collateral is more than a technical rule change; it’s a vote of confidence in the asset’s stability. What Are the Practical Implications and Challenges? While the news is transformative, practical implementation brings challenges. The pilot program’s limited scope (BTC, ETH, USDC) shows a cautious, phased approach. Regulators must ensure robust risk management, as crypto’s volatility directly impacts margin requirements. How will daily price swings be managed? Furthermore, the infrastructure for custody and valuation of Bitcoin derivatives collateral needs to be bulletproof to prevent systemic risk. This move, however, creates a blueprint for other assets, potentially leading to a wider array of tokenized collateral in the future. How Does This Decision Shape the Future of Finance? The CFTC’s action is a decisive step toward the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). By allowing digital assets as collateral, it bridges decentralized finance (DeFi) concepts with regulated markets. This could lead to more innovative financial products and greater accessibility. For the average investor, it means the lines between traditional and crypto finance are blurring rapidly. The successful use of Bitcoin derivatives collateral in this pilot could accelerate similar approvals worldwide, creating a more unified global digital asset framework. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption The CFTC’s confirmation is a watershed moment. It moves Bitcoin further into the regulatory mainstream and provides a clear, practical use case beyond investment. This decision reduces friction, enhances liquidity, and signals to other institutions that crypto integration is not only possible but actively underway. The era of Bitcoin derivatives collateral has begun, marking a new chapter of maturity and utility for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly did the CFTC confirm? A: Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham confirmed the launch of a pilot program allowing Bitcoin (BTC), along with Ethereum (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC), to be used as collateral for derivatives trades. Q: Can I use my Bitcoin as collateral right now? A> Not immediately for everyone. This is a pilot program involving specific, registered entities. Widespread availability will depend on the pilot’s results and individual broker/dealer implementation. Q: Why is using Bitcoin as collateral important? A> It allows traders and institutions to use their existing crypto holdings to secure trades without selling them. This improves capital efficiency and brings new liquidity into derivatives markets. Q: What are the risks of using Bitcoin as collateral? A> The primary risk is volatility. If Bitcoin’s price drops significantly, additional collateral (a margin call) would be required to maintain the position, potentially forcing a sale at a loss. Q: Does this mean Bitcoin is now officially a commodity? A> The CFTC has long considered Bitcoin a commodity under its jurisdiction. This decision reinforces that classification by treating it as a functional asset like other commodities used in finance. Q: Will other cryptocurrencies be added as collateral? A> The pilot starts with only BTC, ETH, and USDC. The CFTC will likely review the results after three months before considering expanding the list to other digital assets.

According to The Information, DeepSeek obtained Nvidia Corp. Blackwell chips through smuggling routes directly from countries that are allowed to purchase the chips. Sources told the Information that computer servers holding the chips were disassembled before entering China. DeepSeek has not responded to requests for comment on the allegations. The company grabbed worldwide attention in January after introducing an AI system that matched the performance of top American technology while costing far less to develop. High-Flyer, a Chinese investment firm, provides financial backing for DeepSeek and had purchased 10,000 Nvidia graphics processing units in 2021, before Washington banned sales of advanced Nvidia chips and similar hardware to China. President Donald Trump gave Nvidia approval earlier this week to send an older chip model, the H200, to China. However, restrictions on the newer Blackwell chips remain active. DeepSeek put out a fresh model in September and said it was partnering with Chinese chip manufacturers on the project. Nvidia disputes smuggling claims On Wednesday, Nvidia challenged the smuggling claims about DeepSeek and its use of Blackwell technology. American officials have blocked Blackwell chip exports to China, viewing them as Nvidia’s most sophisticated products, in an attempt to maintain an edge in artificial intelligence development. The Information reported that DeepSeek acquired chips that entered the country illegally. A Nvidia representative issued a statement saying the company has not discovered any confirmation of hidden data facilities built to mislead Nvidia and its manufacturing partners, then torn down, moved secretly, and reassembled elsewhere. The spokesperson added that while such smuggling appears unlikely, the company investigates every tip it gets. “We haven’t seen any substantiation or received tips of ‘phantom datacenters’ constructed to deceive us and our OEM partners, then deconstructed, smuggled, and reconstructed somewhere else … While such smuggling seems farfetched, we pursue any tip we receive.” – Nvidia Spokesperson. Nvidia has profited enormously from the AI surge because it makes the graphics processing units essential for training AI systems and handling massive computing tasks. Because this equipment plays such a vital role in AI advancement, Nvidia’s dealings with China have become a contentious issue among American political leaders. Trump allows older chip sales to China Trump announce d Mo nday that Nvidia can deliver H200 chips to cleared buyers in China and other locations, with the United States receiving 25% of revenue from those transactions. Some Republican lawmakers objected to the announcement. DeepSeek startled American technology companies in January by launching a reasoning model named R1 that climbed to the top of download charts and industry rankings. Experts estimated that R1 was built for a small fraction of what similar American models cost. Last August, DeepSeek suggested that China would soon produce its own advanced chips to power AI systems.

The video game retailer reported a $9.4 million unrealized loss on its Bitcoin investment for the third quarter. This GameStop Bitcoin loss highlights the volatile dance between traditional corporations and the digital asset space. Let’s unpack what happened and why it matters for the future of business investments in cryptocurrency. What Exactly Is an Unrealized GameStop Bitcoin Loss? First, it’s crucial to understand the term “unrealized loss.” This doesn’t mean GameStop sold its Bitcoin at a loss. Instead, it reflects the decrease in the market value of its holdings compared to their purchase price at the end of the quarter. Think of it like this: you buy a collectible game for $100. If its market value drops to $50, you have a $50 “unrealized” loss on paper. You only realize that loss if you actually sell it. GameStop’s situation is identical, just on a multi-million dollar scale with digital currency. How Did GameStop Accumulate Its Bitcoin Holdings? GameStop’s foray into crypto wasn’t a sudden gamble. The company made a strategic purchase in May, acquiring 4,710 BTC. Since then, they have not announced any further buys or sells. This suggests their GameStop Bitcoin loss calculation is based on that original stash. The value of Bitcoin fluctuated dramatically throughout Q3, leading to this paper loss. Key points about their position include: Holding Steady: No new purchases indicates a “hold” strategy despite market dips. Long-Term View: An unrealized loss suggests they are waiting for a potential price recovery. Balance Sheet Impact: Such losses affect quarterly earnings reports and investor perception. Why Does This GameStop Bitcoin Loss Matter for the Crypto Market? This isn’t just a line item on one company’s financial statement. GameStop, a meme stock icon, represents a bridge between mainstream retail and alternative assets. Its GameStop Bitcoin loss serves as a real-world case study for other businesses considering cryptocurrency treasury investments. It demonstrates the inherent volatility and accounting challenges. Therefore, this event may cause other corporations to pause and refine their crypto investment strategies, prioritizing risk management over hype. What Are the Broader Implications for Corporate Crypto Adoption? The journey of companies like GameStop into Bitcoin is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it legitimizes crypto as a viable, albeit risky, asset class for corporate treasuries. On the other, quarterly reports of losses can scare off more conservative institutions. The key takeaway is transparency. By publicly reporting this GameStop Bitcoin loss , the company adheres to financial regulations and provides clear data. This honesty is vital for building a mature, regulated framework around corporate digital asset investing. Conclusion: A Volatile Lesson in Modern Finance GameStop’s $9.4 million paper loss on Bitcoin is more than a headline. It’s a snapshot of a new financial era where traditional companies test the waters of digital assets. While the loss is unrealized, its impact on investor sentiment and corporate strategy is very real. This event underscores a critical lesson: cryptocurrency investments offer potential reward but come with significant, quantifiable risk that must be managed on the public balance sheet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Did GameStop actually lose $9.4 million in cash? A: No. This is an “unrealized” or “paper” loss. It means the current market value of their Bitcoin is $9.4 million less than what they paid. The loss only becomes real if they sell at the lower price. Q2: How much Bitcoin does GameStop still own? A: Based on their last announcement, they likely still hold the 4,710 BTC purchased in May, as they reported no subsequent transactions. Q3: What does “unrealized loss” mean for a company’s health? A: It affects the company’s reported earnings and overall asset value on its balance sheet, which can influence its stock price and investor confidence, even though no cash has left the company. Q4: Are other companies reporting similar Bitcoin losses? A: Yes, other firms like Tesla have also reported quarterly unrealized losses on their Bitcoin holdings when the market price falls, highlighting the common volatility of such investments. Q5: Could this loss turn into a gain? A> Absolutely. If Bitcoin’s price rises above GameStop’s purchase price in a future quarter, the company would then report an “unrealized gain” on the same holdings. Q6: Should investors be worried about GameStop’s crypto strategy? A> It depends on their risk tolerance. This loss shows the strategy is speculative. Investors should assess if GameStop’s core business and its crypto investments align with their own portfolio goals. Found this analysis of GameStop’s Bitcoin loss insightful?

New collateral currency choice Here’s the new asset being added to Kraken’s margin collateral lineup, bringing the total to over 50 options: Asset Haircut Global Dollar (USDG) 1% Start margin trading on Kraken Pro What is a collateral currency? A collateral currency can be fiat, crypto or stablecoin you can use for trading on margin. Unlike standard spot trading, margin trading allows you to open long or short positions by borrowing funds directly from Kraken. When you trade on margin, Kraken’s margin pool is used for the purchase or sale of the cryptocurrency, while your collateral secures the extensions of margin. The collateral currency you use does not need to match the trading pair of the order book you’re trading on, allowing for greater flexibility to go long or short in any margin enabled trading pair . Note: Both unstaked and Kraken Rewards assets can be used as margin collateral. However, assets held in Kraken Pro on-chain staking are ineligible to use as margin collateral. Maximizing the benefits of margin trading Expanding the range of collateral currencies may empower s traders in several ways: Tax advantages In some jurisdictions, using digital assets as collateral rather than selling them outright can defer taxable events. By leveraging collateral currencies for margin trading, traders can potentially reduce immediate tax liabilities while maintaining exposure to their holdings. Diversification of collateral By using multiple collateral currencies, you can better manage risk and reduce exposure to volatility in any single asset. This is particularly valuable for traders seeking to safeguard their positions in unpredictable markets. Improved liquidity With more assets eligible as collateral, you can free up funds for other trading opportunities while maintaining robust positions on margin. This ensures your portfolio remains active and responsive to market changes. Strategic flexibility The ability to combine assets with different haircuts enables fine-tuned margin strategies tailored to your risk tolerance and market outlook. Whether you prefer conservative or aggressive trading, expanded collateral options provide the adaptability you need. Hedging and short selling opportunities With access to margin trading and a diverse range of collateral currencies, traders can hedge their existing positions or take advantage of downward market movements through short selling. This opens up opportunities for profit regardless of market direction. Leverage and capital efficiency Margin trading can amplify your buying power, allowing you to take larger positions than your available capital. This capital efficiency is further enhanced by the ability to use a broader range of collateral currencies, enabling you to maximize potential returns while optimizing resource allocation. Trade with caution There is no guarantee that a limit order will execute. There is no guarantee of margin pool availability at all times. There is also no guarantee of a market order executing at a certain price. The availability and liquidity of the particular digital asset will impact these types of orders.

The massive decline in validators has sparked discussions about whether this could become a threat to the blockchain network or a natural pruning of inactive nodes to increase efficiency. Solana loses 68% Of Its Validators In 3 Years A new report from Criptonocias reveals that Solana has experienced a dramatic decline in the number of its validators, active and non-active, since March 2023. This decrease has raised concerns across the crypto community about the network’s overall health and security. Related Reading: Why Has The Solana Price Been Crashing Since October? This Major SOL Player Is Selling Over the last three years, the Solana network has steadily lost validators, going from 2,500 to 2,100 in November 2022 and now hovering around 800. This decline means the blockchain has lost a total of 1,700 validators. Although this considerable decrease should trigger warning alerts, it could be a result of ledger pruning, which involves removing inactive or redundant nodes to streamline a network and improve its performance without compromising security. Notably, validators are crucial for the operation of a blockchain network, as they run nodes, confirm transactions, and help maintain the integrity of the system. Each validator adds to the diversity of the network and reduces the risk of any single entity gaining excessive control. According to the report, some voices in the Solana ecosystem see the reduction of validators in a positive light. They argue that losing “Sybil validators,” which are nodes pretending to be multiple independent operators but are actually controlled by a single party, can be beneficial. Based on this perspective, having a smaller number of reliable and active validators is healthier than maintaining thousands of nodes that do not contribute meaningfully to the blockchain network. Criptonocias revealed that teams such as Layer 33, which develops infrastructure node tools and provides network services for Solana, point out that many of the validators leaving the blockchain are not Sybils but legitimate node operators. This suggests that the drop in numbers does not automatically equate to improved network quality despite widespread talks about ledge pruning. Notably, the potential impact on the Solana network, whether negative or positive, depends on the independence of the remaining validators and the distribution of power among them. An updated report of the validator count reveals that it has dropped again from 800 to 795. Solana Faces Liquidity Crunch As Profitability Declines Amidst its decline in validators, the Solana network is showing signs of strain as liquidity dries up and profitability declines. On-chain data from Glassnode highlights a troubling trend in the network’s trading activity, with the 30-day average realized profit-to-loss ratio remaining below 1 since mid-November. Related Reading: Solana Welcomes Bearish December, But Pundit Shares Possible Move To $170 This level is typically associated with bear market conditions and points to a growing imbalance between gains and losses among traders. A ratio below 1 also indicates that traders are realizing losses more frequently than profits, underscoring the cryptocurrency’s weakening market sentiment.

The CEO spoke about XRP amid his talk on how his company is building the “internet of value.” Ripple CEO Talks About XRP During Banking Committee Appearance In an X post , JackTheRippler shared a video of the Ripple CEO at the Banking Committee hearing, where he spoke about Ripple and XRP. Garlinghouse stated that they were building the internet of value, where money moves as easily as information. He added that their payment services were made possible through the use of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its native token XRP. The Ripple CEO further noted that XRP is built to enable fast, low-cost, and highly scalable transactions, which makes it suitable as the bridge currency for their cross-border payment services. Garlinghouse made these comments in relation to his testimony on the need for “smart” crypto regulations, including market-structure legislation, to eliminate regulatory uncertainty and advance innovation in the U.S. The CEO mentioned that his company was among the notable victims of the previous SEC administration’s regulation-by-enforcement approach. The commission had sued the crypto firm, arguing that XRP was a security and that the firm had violated securities laws through institutional sales of the token. However, as the CEO noted, Judge Torres ruled that XRP was not a security in itself. Garlinghouse believes that the crypto market structure legislation will help the crypto industry progress while also protecting consumers, like XRP holders, who were affected by the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. XRP’s price was affected by uncertainty about its legal status at the time of the lawsuit, which spanned over four years. DAS Research Provides Bull Case For XRP In an X post , market expert Stern Drew highlighted a report from DAS Research, which provided a bull case for XRP. Drew highlighted how the report stated that XRP and Ripple are no longer competing in crypto. Instead, they are evolving into a global payment infrastructure, which will be adopted by banks, fintechs, and cross-border networks that demand speed, scale, and settlement certainty. Drew further pointed out three core realities highlighted by the report. The first is that XRP is said to have the structural advantage with fast settlement, low cost, being a neutral bridge asset on a globally distributed ledger, and with institutional-grade reliability. The expert noted that this is why adoption is rising among enterprises that need predictable value transfer. The other two realities are Ripple’s integration of the RLUSD stablecoin and its institutional partnerships, which will help boost XRP’s utility. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.08, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|Brad Garlinghouse|Coinmarketcap|DAS Research|JackTheRippler|Judge Torres Analisa|ripple|RLUSD|SEC Vs.

Exchange balances have dropped sharply , signaling a potential liquidity squeeze. Chad Steingraber highlighted this trend on X, noting that Glassnode data shows XRP exchange reserves decoupling from historical price correlations for the first time. Balances have fallen to roughly 1.6 billion tokens, even as XRP trades near $2. This marks a structural shift with major implications for market liquidity. Falling Exchange Balances Signal Tightening Supply Exchange balances represent XRP held on centralized platforms and immediately available for trading. A decline suggests accumulation into private wallets or institutional custody. Over the past three weeks, nearly 1 billion XRP left exchanges, driven by ETF inflows exceeding $874 million, institutional holdings, and retail demand. Supply on exchanges has now fallen by 45 percent in just two months. This reduction tightens the market, limiting sell-side availability. Even moderate buying pressure could now trigger amplified price movements. Glassnode Exchange XRP Balances The first time that balances (green) are WELL below the price structure (black). https://t.co/hYDBYF6bTx pic.twitter.com/ryHDrSKqG5 — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) December 9, 2025 Implications for Liquidity and Market Behavior Lower liquidity on exchanges can create stronger support levels. Sellers have fewer tokens to unload quickly, potentially stabilizing price during market stress. At the same time, reduced supply could magnify buying effects . Institutional or retail purchases may have an outsized impact on XRP price, increasing volatility and potential upside. Institutional and Retail Accumulation ETF inflows and institutional custody are major drivers of these withdrawals. Large-scale holders are storing XRP off exchanges for long-term purposes. Retail investors also contribute, withdrawing tokens to private wallets. These accumulations indicate confidence in XRP’s fundamentals and a potential setup for future upward movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risks and Market Fragility Despite tightening supply, structural risks persist. On-chain data shows about 41.5 percent of XRP supply is currently underwater. These holders may sell if prices drop further, creating renewed volatility. Macroeconomic or market-wide pressures could also affect XRP. Low exchange balances alone cannot prevent price declines if broader sentiment turns negative. What to Watch Next Market participants should monitor exchange balances, ETF flows, and large wallet movements. Continuous accumulation off exchanges could push liquidity even lower. Price support levels and sentiment indicators will also be crucial. A combination of tight supply and strong demand may create conditions for a significant upward move. In conclusion, Glassnode data, highlighted by Chad Steingraber, reveals XRP exchange balances falling below historical price correlations for the first time. This signals a tightening market and potential supply squeeze. ETF inflows, institutional holdings, and retail accumulation continue to reduce tokens available on exchanges. While this dynamic could fuel upside momentum, the large portion of XRP held at a loss reminds investors that structural risk remains. Close attention to supply and sentiment trends will be critical in assessing XRP’s next moves. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The corporation now holds 4,783 BTC in its treasury. American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC), a U.S.-based bitcoin mining and treasury management company backed by Eric Trump, executed a strategic purchase of 416 Bitcoins for $38 million on December 10. The purchase brings each acquired BTC to an average buying price of $91,346. American Bitcoin Corp. now holds 4,783 BTC According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, the Nasdaq-listed corporation now holds 4,783 BTC worth $440.16 million at current BTC prices. The BTC holdings represent those held in custody or pledged for miner purchases under an agreement with BITMAIN, according to the company. The data also shows that American Bitcoin Corp now ranks 22nd among the largest Bitcoin holding corporations, surpassing Gamestop and HIVE Digital Technologies. American Bitcoin Corp. also updated investors on its Satoshis Per Share (“SPS”) metric, which tracks the amount of Bitcoin attributable to each outstanding share of common stock. The firm’s SPS grew by more than 17% in just over a month. Eric Trump , Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of American Bitcoin, commented on the purchase, saying that the company has built one of the largest and fastest-growing Bitcoin accumulators since listing on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange about three months ago. He also said that the company will continue to advance its Bitcoin reserve strategy to ensure long-term value creation for investors. Source: ABTC Satoshis Per Share (SPS) and Bitcoin Reserve ABTC shares rose by 1.5% on Tuesday, likely due to the recent purchase of BTC. However, the stock’s performance has not been promising. According to data from Google Finance, the company’s share price has declined by 19.42% over the last five days and by more than 50% in the last month. On November 14, the firm published its third-quarter 2025 financial results, which revealed that ABTC added more than 3,000 Bitcoin through mining activities and at-market-price purchases. The firm recorded revenue of $64 million for the three months ending September 30, indicating a significant improvement from $11.6 million recorded in the same period the previous year. The three-month net income totaled $3.5 million, compared to a net loss of $0.6 million in the prior-year period. Institutional interests in Bitcoin surge as BTC prices stabilize American Bitcoin Corp’s recent purchase signifies renewed institutional interest in Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as Microstrategy) leads with the largest corporate Bitcoin balance in its books. The tech company recently bought $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, marking its largest Bitcoin purchase in months. Strategy now holds 660,624 BTC valued at $60.63 billion. According to Bitcoin Treasuries , the firm’s average cost per BTC is $74,702, resulting in an unrealized profit of 23.11% at the time of this publication. Strive, a U.S.-based asset management firm, also recently announced a $500 million at-the-market offering program for its Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock (SATA). The firm announced that it intends to use the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related products, among other operational expenses. Data from ETF tracking Website SosoValue shows that US BTC spot ETFs registered inflows worth $151.74 million. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s BTC led the pack with inflows worth $198.85 million and $33.79 million, respectively. BlackRock’s IBIT was the only ETF that registered negative flows worth $135.44 million despite being the largest exchange-traded fund with over $60 billion in net assets under management. Bitcoin is currently trading at $92,121. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the crypto asset has remained relatively unchanged over the last week, with a 0.83% drop in the last seven days and a 1.12% rise in the last 24 hours.

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethena Ticker ENA Price $0.26 (-9%) Market cap $3.59 Trading volume (24-hour) $457M Circulating supply 7.15B ENA All-time high $1.52 (11 April, 2024) All-time low $0.1858 (11 October, 2025) ENA technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.26 Price Prediction $ 0.2148 (-25.34%) Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.54% (Very High) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.3373 200-Day SMA $ 0.4831 14-Day RSI 46.80 (Neutral) ENA price analysis Resistance for ENA is at $0.3110 Support for ENA/USD is at $0.2182 The ENA price analysis for December 10 confirms that ENA witnessed bearish pressure as it declines toward $0.26. Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a bearish rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price toward support lines. Sellers are now aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels around $0.26. The 24-hour volume dropped toward $41 million, showing a decline in trading interest today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.26, which has dropped by over 9% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers within the neutral region at 43, showing that bears control price momentum slightly. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.05, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening selling positions. ENA price predictions: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.4056 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.3367 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.3254 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.2973 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.3373 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.4831 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.4831 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.3005 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.3462 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.4359 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.5275 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5549 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.5118 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.4874 SELL What to expect from ENA price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the ENA price from an immediate surge. However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.3110, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.4072. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2182, resulting in a correction to $0.1391. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a minor downward push. This created a decline toward $0.26. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.3 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA 21Shares has launched the Ethena ETP (EENA) on European exchanges, giving investors regulated access to ENA and following Ethena’s strong $151M Q3 fees and its new Hyperliquid partnership.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3. By the end of November, ENA declined below $0.23.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-10 17:18:06

The firm submitted a Form 8-A to the Securities and Exchange Commission, signaling that its Solana ETF may begin trading soon. This filing arrives during a period of expanding institutional interest in Solana exposure and growing competition among issuers. Invesco Galaxy Prepares Market Entry with QSOL Listing Invesco Galaxy advanced its product launch after updating its registration details last month. The firm outlined operational terms for its planned Solana ETF and confirmed that the product will list under the ticker QSOL. Besides regulatory progress, Invesco injected initial capital into the trust with a 4,000-share purchase worth $100,000. The filing includes finalized operational disclosures and an independent audit, which signals readiness for trading. Moreover, the move follows the recent debut of Franklin Templeton’s Solana ETF, which entered the market last week. Hence, a new listing could become the eighth Solana ETF available to U.S. investors. SOL Price Trades Lower as Range Persists Solana trades near $136 after a sharp daily decline. The token dropped more than 4% over the last 24 hours as the broader market faced pressure. Analyst Ali Martinez tracks a clear multi-week range between $124 and $145. He notes repeated rejections near the upper boundary. Price now sits near the middle of the range, which limits near-term momentum. Additionally, traders watch $134 as the next level that could determine direction. A loss of that level may expose $128 before another test of $124. Source: X Umair Crypto tracks a separate technical setup. He notes that Solana defended the $128 level twice and gained nearly 13% on the recent rebound. Momentum now strengthens above the 50-RSI. He sees a break above $150 as a potential spark for broader altcoin rotation. Moreover, he points to $176 as the next zone if Solana regains its 50-day moving average.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 17:18:25

According to the latest research report from CryptoQuant, after briefly falling to $80,000 on November 21, Bitcoin has rebounded to a one-month high of $94,000, supported by declining exchange inflows and reduced selling activity from large holders. Exchange Deposits Fall, Easing Price Pressure A major driver behind Bitcoin’s recent price stabilization is the sharp decline in BTC transferred to exchanges. Deposits have fallen to 21,000 BTC today, compared with 88,000 BTC on November 21, marking a 76% decrease in sell-side supply over the past three weeks, according to CryptoQuant. This decrease indicates that holders, especially short-term traders, are less inclined to sell immediately into the market. Lower exchange inflows traditionally reduce downward pressure, creating more opportunity for price recovery in the near term. Large Holders Pull Back: Lower Deposits, Smaller Transfers Institutional-scale investors and whales have played a major role in the shifting environment. The share of exchange deposits linked to large holders dropped from 47% in mid-November to 21% today, while the average transfer size fell 36%, from 1.1 BTC to 0.7 BTC. These patterns suggest that major players are stepping back rather than accelerating sell-offs. Large holders tend to dictate market direction during periods of volatility, and their reduced activity typically supports more orderly price behavior. Loss Realization Peaks, Reducing Future Sell-Side Pressure Bitcoin’s recent rebound also comes after a wave of realized losses, often a turning point in market psychology. On November 13, as Bitcoin broke below $100,000, whales and short-term holders realized $646 million in losses, the highest since July. Across the last several weeks, that figure has climbed to $3.2 billion in net losses, likely flushing out weaker hands and reducing forced selling. Loss realization can fuel capitulation in bear phases, but once completed, it can set a foundation for more stable price action. Key Levels to Watch: $99K, $102K, and $112K If selling remains muted, analysts say Bitcoin could advance toward $99,000, marking the lower band of the Trader On-chain Realized Price indicator, typically a major resistance during market drawdowns. Beyond that, major resistance levels stand near $102,000 (one-year moving average) and $112,000 (Trader On-chain Realized Price) reports CryptoQuant. Market uncertainty remains, particularly ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision, but Bitcoin’s latest trend suggests a market catching its breath—the calm before the next wave of volatility. BTC neared $94K and ETH hit $3,250 early December, driven by MSTR’s buy and Fusaka anticipation, per Laser Digital. #Bitcoin #Crypto https://t.co/pMYuzVS329 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 9, 2025 The post Bitcoin Selling Pressure Eases as Exchange Inflows Drop: CryptoQuant appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|CryptoQuant,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-12-10 17:23:12
55608436,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=242255,1765387511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stunning Prediction: More Eurozone Nations Will Buy Bitcoin Following Czech Republic’s Lead,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eurozone-nations-buy-bitcoin-prediction/,"BitcoinWorld Stunning Prediction: More Eurozone Nations Will Buy Bitcoin Following Czech Republic’s Lead Could a single, modest $1 million investment by a European central bank trigger a continent-wide shift? According to a top Coinbase executive, the Czech Republic’s recent move to buy Bitcoin is a powerful signal, and it’s one he believes will inspire other Eurozone nations to follow suit. This development marks a pivotal moment for institutional crypto adoption. Why Are Eurozone Nations Buying Bitcoin Now? John D’Agostino, Head of Institutional Strategy at Coinbase, has made a compelling prediction. He expects more Eurozone nations will buy Bitcoin after observing the Czech National Bank’s recent activity. While the initial $1 million test portfolio is small in the grand scheme of central bank reserves, its symbolic weight is immense. D’Agostino highlights that the bank isn’t just holding the asset; it’s actively testing Bitcoin as a payment method within its treasury operations. This practical, real-world testing is what makes the move so significant. It moves the conversation beyond theoretical debate into tangible application. When one nation within the economic bloc takes this step, it provides a blueprint and reduces the perceived risk for its neighbors. The action suggests a growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s potential role in modern finance. What Did the Czech National Bank Actually Do? In November, reports confirmed the Czech central bank had allocated funds to a digital asset experiment. Their $1 million test portfolio included: Bitcoin (BTC) : The flagship cryptocurrency. Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins : Digital assets designed to maintain a steady value. Deposit Tokens : Digital representations of traditional bank deposits. This diversified approach is key. It shows the bank is exploring the entire digital asset ecosystem, not just making a speculative bet on Bitcoin’s price. By incorporating Bitcoin into its treasury and examining its use for payments, the Czech National Bank is conducting vital research that other Eurozone financial authorities are undoubtedly watching closely. What’s Stopping Other Countries From Buying Bitcoin? The path for Eurozone nations to buy Bitcoin isn’t without hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a primary challenge, with frameworks like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation still being implemented. Volatility concerns and custody security for large-scale holdings are also major considerations for risk-averse institutions. However, the Czech move demonstrates a way forward: start small, learn, and build internal expertise. The potential benefits driving this exploration are substantial. Nations may see Bitcoin as: A potential hedge against currency devaluation. A way to engage with innovative financial technology. A strategic reserve asset in a digitizing global economy. Therefore, the action by one central bank lowers the barrier for others, creating a potential domino effect within the Eurozone. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Adoption? The prediction that more Eurozone nations will buy Bitcoin points to a broader trend of institutional normalization. When respected financial entities engage with crypto, it legitimizes the asset class for a wider audience. This could lead to increased market stability, more sophisticated financial products, and accelerated development of supporting infrastructure like regulated custody solutions. For investors and observers, the key takeaway is to watch for similar announcements from other European central banks. The Czech Republic may have provided the template, and as D’Agostino suggests, the model could “easily spread.” The era of central banks purely as bystanders in the crypto space is clearly ending. In conclusion, the Coinbase executive’s insight is more than just speculation; it’s an analysis based on observable precedent. The Czech National Bank’s foray into Bitcoin, though experimental, has broken new ground. It provides a working example that other Eurozone nations can study and potentially emulate, signaling a profound shift towards the institutional acceptance of digital assets. The question is no longer if, but which nation will be next to make a move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Which Eurozone nation recently bought Bitcoin? A1: The Czech Republic’s central bank, the Czech National Bank, recently included Bitcoin in a $1 million test portfolio of digital assets. Q2: Why is this purchase significant if it’s only $1 million? A2: The amount is small for a central bank, but the action is highly symbolic. It represents a major, regulated financial institution officially testing Bitcoin within its treasury and payment systems, setting a precedent for others. Q3: What did the Coinbase executive predict? A3: John D’Agostino, Coinbase’s Head of Institutional Strategy, predicted that the Czech Republic’s move will lead more Eurozone nations to buy Bitcoin, as the model of testing and adoption could easily spread. Q4: What other assets were in the Czech bank’s test portfolio? A4: Alongside Bitcoin, the portfolio contained dollar-pegged stablecoins and deposit tokens, indicating a broad exploration of the digital asset landscape. Q5: What are the main challenges for central banks buying Bitcoin? A5: Key challenges include regulatory uncertainty, concerns over Bitcoin’s price volatility, and the technical complexities of securely storing and managing large cryptocurrency holdings. Q6: How could this trend affect the average cryptocurrency investor? A6: Increased institutional adoption by entities like central banks can enhance market legitimacy, potentially reduce extreme volatility, and drive the development of more secure and accessible crypto investment infrastructure for everyone.

As it has already increased by 250% and a minor part of its allocation remains below the $0.04 mark, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most observed potential breakout contenders in the next four years. The continuous hype is putting the project on a narrow new frontier that many are thinking could close even earlier than they thought. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has created a decentralized system of lending that is made up of systematic borrowing and lending. The Peer to Contract market has two parties, the assets lent to it include ETH or USDT and lenders obtain mtTokens, which appreciate in value as the interest is returned by borrowers. The Peer to Peer market would allow the borrowers to access the lenders in a direct manner. The rate of borrowing is flexible. Rates remain lower when the liquidity is high. In case of tightening of liquidity, the cost of borrowing increases. The loan-to-value restraints control prudent usage of collateral. Liquidation can be done in case the collateral of a borrower depreciates a great deal. Discounted collateral is received and part of the debt is repaid by liquidators. These workings facilitate the protocol to run even when fast moving markets are involved. Growth and Increasing Demand in Presale Mutuum Finance was opened at the beginning of 2025 at $0.01. It currently is priced at $0.035 indicating a 2.5x increase in the course of development. It has been funded to more than $19.250M and the community has increased to 18,500 holders. It has sold 815M tokens on the project. Of the total amount of 4B MUTM tokens, 1.82B, or 45.5% is channeled towards presale phases. Phase 6 has now over 95% claim and it has 5% tokens remaining at the present price. Phase 7 would come with an almost 20% price rise and the listing price is pegged at $0.06 that would place Phase 1 buyers in a possible 500% upsurge upon commencing. The 24-hour leaderboard is another position of the project where the best contributor wins $500 MUTM every day. Card payment access has ensured ease of participation to new users thereby assisting in boosting demand in the last phase. V1 Testnet, Security Prep and Analyst Projections On the official X account, Mutuum Finance affirmed the V1 testnet will go live in the fourth quarter of 2025. The initial one includes the lending pool, the mtTokens, the liquidation engine and the debt module. Other currencies, such as ETH and USDT, will be launched. This is the initiation point of live borrowing and lending, and it is usually when a nascent DeFi project gains steam. The other reason why investors are keeping a watch on MUTM is security. The project had an audit of a CertiK with a 90/100 score on the Token Scan. Halborn Security is considering the lending agreements to analyze the rules of liquidation, behavior of collateral and logic of interest. There is an open bug bounty of 50K to identify the problems before V1 is released. When V1 switches on and the demand to borrow escalates, certain analysts looking at the mechanics of the protocol may go to a range between 5x and 8x. These premature predictors are fuelled by the developing yield of the mtTokens, buy-pressure and long-term growth. Stablecoin Implementation Mutuum Finance is going to roll out an interest-backed USD-pegged stablecoin according to the official Roadmap. The stablecoins contribute to the expansion of the lending markets due to providing predictable lending conditions and the increase of liquidity. The stablecoin with a great power tends to become the basis of more effective lending pools. The roadmap also includes layer-2 scaling. Introduction of L2 reduces costs and accelerates transactions. The lending systems are based on real time updates of collateral, interest and liquidation levels. Quick performance increases stability and user experience. In conjunction with the stablecoin growth, oracle reliability and L2 growth, certain long-run models suggest that Mutuum Finance could enter into a 10x to 12x region by 2027 given the adoption success. Phase 6 Almost Complete Phase 6 is almost fully sold. The future price increase and the rising popularity of the project also have contributed to hastening the demand. Whale entry of more than $100K in recent days further decreased the leftover supply. Participation of whales generally means an assurance of larger investors who anticipate tremendous improvements in the following milestone. Mutuum Finance has already established itself as among the potential next crypto to explode in the next quarter of 2026. Its developing utility, early pricing, solid investment, increasing participation and approaching V1 launch have put in place a situation that many investors are keeping close tabs on.

This revolutionary development represents a significant shift in the relationship between technology giants and traditional news media, with major publishers including The Guardian, The Washington Post, and The Times of India participating in this commercial partnership. What Are Google News AI Summaries? Google’s new AI summaries represent a fundamental change in how news is presented to users. Instead of simply displaying headlines and snippets, the system generates comprehensive overviews that provide context before readers click through to full articles. This approach aims to give users more information upfront, potentially changing how people engage with news content. The AI-powered article overviews work by: Analyzing multiple articles on the same topic Generating concise summaries that cite participating sources Providing clear attribution to original publishers Including direct links to full articles Major News Publishers Embrace AI Technology The pilot program includes an impressive roster of international news organizations. Participants span multiple continents and languages, demonstrating Google’s global approach to this initiative. The participating news publishers include: Publisher Country Language The Guardian United Kingdom English The Washington Post United States English Der Spiegel Germany German El País Spain Spanish The Times of India India English Folha Brazil Portuguese Infobae Argentina Spanish Kompas Indonesia Indonesian The Washington Examiner United States English How the Gemini App Enhances News Discovery Google’s integration extends beyond traditional news platforms into the Gemini app, where the company is partnering with organizations including The Associated Press, Estadão, Antara, and Yonhap to incorporate real-time information. This expansion represents a multi-platform approach to AI-enhanced news delivery. Key features coming to the Gemini app include: Dedicated carousels for news subscriptions AI Overviews providing synthesized information AI Mode for enhanced search capabilities Increased inline links with contextual introductions The Financial Model: Direct Payments to Publishers One of the most significant aspects of this pilot program is Google’s commitment to providing direct payments to participating news publishers. This financial arrangement addresses a major concern in the industry: that AI summaries might reduce traffic to publisher websites, potentially impacting advertising revenue. The commercial partnership model includes: Direct compensation from Google to publishers Potential to offset traffic decreases Collaborative experimentation with new features Exclusive appearance on participating publications’ pages Global Expansion of Preferred Sources Feature Alongside the AI summaries pilot, Google announced the global rollout of its “Preferred Sources” feature. Originally launched in the U.S. and India in August, this tool allows users to select their favorite news sites and blogs to appear in the Top Stories section of Google search results. The rollout schedule includes: Immediate availability for English-language users worldwide Expansion to all supported languages in early 2025 Integration with news subscription highlighting Potential concerns about ideological bubbles Audio Briefings: News for the Listening Generation Recognizing changing consumption habits, Google is experimenting with audio briefings as part of the pilot program. This feature caters to users who prefer listening to news rather than reading it, representing another dimension of Google’s multi-format approach to information delivery. Potential Impact and Industry Implications The introduction of AI overviews represents both opportunity and challenge for the news industry. While publishers gain financial compensation and potential audience engagement benefits, they also face the reality that users might consume summaries without visiting their websites. Key considerations include: Balancing convenience with publisher sustainability Maintaining journalistic integrity in AI-generated content Ensuring proper attribution and source visibility Addressing potential bias in algorithmic summarization Google’s Evolving Approach to News Distribution This pilot program follows Google’s July introduction of AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google’s search app. The company has been gradually expanding its AI capabilities in news delivery, suggesting a long-term strategy to integrate artificial intelligence throughout its information ecosystem. Google emphasizes that these developments are part of an ongoing evolution: “As the way people consume information evolves, we’ll continue to improve our products for people around the world and engage with feedback from stakeholders across the ecosystem.” FAQs About Google’s AI News Summaries Which publishers are participating in Google’s AI summaries pilot? The program includes The Guardian , The Washington Post , Der Spiegel , El País , The Times of India , and several other international publications. How does Google ensure proper attribution in AI summaries? The system includes clear publisher logos and citations, with direct links to full articles. Google states these features will include “clear attribution and a link to articles.” What is the Gemini app’s role in this initiative? Google’s Gemini app will feature enhanced news capabilities including subscription carousels and AI Overviews, with partnerships including The Associated Press for real-time information. How are publishers compensated for participation? Participating news publishers receive direct payments from Google as part of the commercial partnership, which may help offset potential traffic decreases from AI summaries. When will Preferred Sources be available globally? The feature is now available for English-language users worldwide, with expansion to all supported languages planned for early 2025. Google’s AI-powered article overviews pilot represents a pivotal moment in the intersection of artificial intelligence and journalism. By partnering with major news publishers and introducing direct compensation models, Google is attempting to balance technological innovation with publisher sustainability. The success of this initiative will depend on how effectively it serves both users seeking convenient information and publishers needing sustainable revenue models. As AI continues to transform information consumption, this pilot program offers valuable insights into potential future directions for the entire news industry.

The warning comes as the broader crypto market eyes a potential rebound, with Bitcoin showing signs of strength. Gooner highlighted a key price range between $0.000014 and $0.00001 as essential for SHIB’s survival. Without reclaiming this zone, he suggests the token’s long-term outlook remains bleak. Crucial Support Zone Holds Historical Significance In a post on X, Gooner argued that Shiba Inu is “effectively dead” unless it climbs back into a horizontal band marked in red on his chart. This zone previously acted as multi-year support, where SHIB repeatedly consolidated and surged. The token notably recorded one of its strongest rallies after touching this area in early March 2024, climbing to $0.000045. Since then, SHIB has experienced a sharp decline, revisiting the support range between $0.000014 and $0.00001 earlier this year. Source: X Gooner emphasized that losing such a major support level often signals trend exhaustion or a deeper bearish phase. He noted that once a key support area breaks, it can flip into strong resistance, making upward recovery difficult. Consequently, he warned that failing to rebound into this critical zone could render SHIB “dead,” as any rally may lack momentum. Currently, Shiba Inu trades at $0.000008551, around 33–38% below the $0.000013–$0.000014 support range. The token has dropped 5.27% in the past 24 hours. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Market commentators on Gooner’s post noted that SHIB’s situation mirrors a broader trend, with most altcoins appearing stalled during the current market phase. Some argued that recovery may remain limited until the next altcoin season begins. Recovery Hinges on Team Strategy and Bitcoin Movement Despite the bearish outlook, some community members believe SHIB could replicate its 2021 surge if the project’s team refocuses its efforts. Zach Humphries highlighted the need for Shiba Inu’s ecosystem initiatives to center around SHIB. He emphasized positioning the token to capture renewed retail interest and developing a clear, actionable roadmap to restore past momentum. Analysts also suggest that Bitcoin’s performance could influence SHIB’s trajectory. Captain Faibik recently predicted that Bitcoin might rebound from $90,000 to $125,000 later this week. Such a rally could provide the broader crypto market, including SHIB, with the momentum needed to recover lost ground. However, Gooner maintains that without regaining the $0.000014–$0.00001 support zone, Shiba Inu’s long-term prospects remain uncertain.

However, long-term holders are still not selling and continue to show the kind of commitment that favors a bullish XRP price prediction . According to data from Santiment, whale wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP have sold nearly $600 million worth of tokens since December 5. Meanwhile, since December 7, whales dumped over $100 million, showing that deep-pocketed investors are still selling even though the price has recovered. This explains why XRP has struggled to move past the $2 mark. The token has accumulated a 5% in the past 7 days as the Federal Reserve prepares to make a decision on interest rates today. Meanwhile, trading volumes have jumped by 60% in the past 24 hours, reaching nearly $4 billion. This accounts for 3% of the token’s circulating market cap and reflects a spike in trading activity ahead of the Fed’s interest rate decision. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Fully Recover If It Breaks This Key Resistance XRP needs to clear the $2.20 level to reverse its downtrend. The FOMC meeting could provide the necessary catalyst for this to happen, as traders will be reassured about what the future holds once Powell speaks. Such a bullish breakout would also push XRP above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) needs to rise past the mid-line and above the 14-day moving average as well. This is typically interpreted as confirmation that bullish momentum is accelerating. If XRP breaks through its current resistance, the $3 level could be the first major target, backed by strong psychological significance and historical price action. As broader sentiment improves, high-upside crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could rally even harder. With nearly $30 million raised in its ongoing presale, the project is bringing Solana’s technology to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Esteemed investor and founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, Ric Edelman, has placed a bold bet on this very outcome. His latest Bitcoin price prediction is sending ripples through the crypto community, offering a detailed rationale for why the world’s leading cryptocurrency could more than triple its current value by 2026. Let’s unpack his compelling analysis. What is the Basis for This $180K Bitcoin Price Prediction? Ric Edelman’s forecast isn’t just a random number. He provides a clear market narrative to support his Bitcoin price prediction . According to his analysis shared with DL News, the 2024 bull run faced significant headwinds. Edelman points to two primary factors that curbed the rally: early whales taking profits and a wave of large-scale forced liquidations. However, he sees this not as a bearish signal, but as a necessary market cleanse. His core argument is simple yet powerful. As this selling pressure exhausts itself and excessive market leverage disappears, the stage is set for a major rebound. This forms the foundation of his optimistic Bitcoin price prediction . He anticipates a robust recovery phase where organic demand can finally drive prices upward without the overhang of mass sell-offs. How Does the Path to $180,000 Unfold? Edelman’s timeline provides a concrete roadmap. He forecasts a substantial price surge for both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the coming year. Specifically, he predicts a 50% to 100% rise for both assets in 2025. This intermediate step is crucial for reaching his ultimate Bitcoin price prediction of $180,000 by 2026. Let’s break down the math and implications: For Bitcoin: A 50-100% rise from current levels sets the stage for the final push to $180,000. For Ethereum: A parallel rise would position ETH around $6,600, according to his model. Market Mechanics: The disappearance of leverage means fewer cascading liquidations, creating a more stable foundation for growth. This phased approach suggests Edelman believes in a sustained, multi-year bull cycle rather than a short-lived spike. His Bitcoin price prediction relies on fundamental market resetting, not just speculative hype. What Challenges Could Derail This Bitcoin Price Prediction? While Edelman’s outlook is bullish, savvy investors must consider potential obstacles. No Bitcoin price prediction is guaranteed, and the crypto market is notoriously volatile. Key challenges include: Regulatory shifts from governments worldwide Unforeseen macroeconomic crises impacting risk assets Technological issues or security concerns within the Bitcoin network A slower-than-expected exhaustion of the current selling pressure However, Edelman’s analysis implies that the largest systemic overhang—excessive leverage and whale distribution—is already being addressed by the market. This forms a compelling part of his Bitcoin price prediction thesis. Actionable Insights from This Forecast What should an investor do with this Bitcoin price prediction ? First, understand that it’s a forecast, not financial advice. However, Edelman’s status as a respected financial professional lends weight to his analysis. Consider these steps: Conduct your own research (DYOR) beyond any single prediction. Review your portfolio allocation to crypto assets. Dollar-cost average to mitigate timing risk if you believe in the long-term thesis. Monitor market leverage metrics to see if Edelman’s premise about disappearing leverage holds true. Remember, the journey to any lofty Bitcoin price prediction is rarely a straight line. Volatility will remain a constant companion. Conclusion: A Vision of Crypto’s Future Ric Edelman’s $180,000 Bitcoin price prediction for 2026 paints a vivid picture of crypto’s potential next chapter. It’s a forecast built on the idea of market renewal—where current pressures subside, making way for a powerful new advance. Whether this exact number materializes, the underlying analysis highlights critical market dynamics every investor should watch. The convergence of exhausted sellers, reduced leverage, and sustained institutional interest could indeed create a fertile environment for significant growth, making this a Bitcoin price prediction worth serious consideration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is Ric Edelman? Ric Edelman is a noted financial advisor, author, and the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), an organization dedicated to educating financial professionals about blockchain and digital assets. What was Edelman’s main reason for the 2024 rally stalling? He attributed the curbed rally to two factors: early large holders (whales) taking profits and a series of large-scale forced liquidations that created sustained selling pressure. Does Edelman’s prediction include Ethereum? Yes. His model forecasts a 50-100% rise for both BTC and ETH in 2025, which would put Ethereum around $6,600 as part of the same market recovery thesis. Is a $180K Bitcoin price prediction realistic? While ambitious, it is within the realm of historical Bitcoin volatility and previous bull market multiples. Its realism depends heavily on the broader adoption cycle, regulatory environment, and macroeconomic conditions playing out favorably. What does ‘market leverage disappearing’ mean? It refers to a reduction in traders using borrowed funds (leverage) to amplify their bets. High leverage increases volatility and forced selling. Its reduction can lead to a more stable and organic price discovery process. Should I invest based solely on this prediction? No. Treat any price prediction, including this one, as a perspective to inform your research, not as direct investment advice. Always make decisions based on your own financial situation, risk tolerance, and due diligence.

According to the company, the wiser course for MSCI, for investors, and for the broader economy is for MSCI to remain neutral and let the markets decide the course of DATs. According to Cryptopolitan , MSCI argued that crypto treasury companies are more like investment funds than operating companies. However, Strategy led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor argued that it builds Bitcoin-backed credit instruments, manages an active corporate treasury program, and maintains a global enterprise analytics software business, not a passive vehicle for tracking price movements. Investors buy the company’s strategy and management, not a static wrapper for Bitcoin. “Strategy is not an investment fund, and it does not passively hold Bitcoin. Strategy is an operating business that actively uses the Bitcoin it holds to create returns for shareholders,” the company wrote. Strategy says the proposal is discriminatory, arbitrary, and has zero positive effect The company warned that implementing the proposal’s 50% threshold is discriminatory, arbitrary, and has zero positive effect. It singles out digital asset businesses while leaving untouched companies in other industries with similarly concentrated holdings in oil, timber, gold, media and entertainment, and real estate. Additionally, Strategy stated that such a move would disrupt market stability. The leading corporate holder of Bitcoin is urging MSCI to consider DATs as operating entities that contribute to economic progress and innovation. Strategy also claimed that the proposal is believed to conflict with US policy. President Trump signed an executive order to promote the growth of digital financial technology. The administration also established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and promoted the inclusion of digital assets in 401(k) plans. The company also requested that MSCI provide further consultation. “MSCI should allow time for the digital asset industry and DATs to evolve and gain their footing before proposing broad-stroke rules and criteria. At a minimum, MSCI should not take such a consequential step without engaging in further consultation,” the letter read. Besides Strategy, Strive, a structured-finance company listed on Nasdaq, is fighting MSCI’s proposal to exclude Bitcoin-heavy companies from major global equity benchmarks. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the firm that holds over 7,500 Bitcoins sent a letter this week to Henry Fernandez, MSCI’s CEO, stating that the proposed exclusion would violate the “long-established principle of index neutrality.” According to analysts, Strategy could see up to $2.8 billion of its stock liquidated under MSCI’s proposal. The company was added to MSCI’s indices in May 2024 and has been included for approximately a year and a half. Strategy adds over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin in two months Strategy has continued its aggressive accumulation approach through November and December 2025. In November, the company added a total of approximately 9,062 BTC across several transactions, including a major purchase of 8,178 BTC for $835.6 million at an average price of $102,171 per coin. The company added 130 BTC for $11.7 million early this month, reaching a symbolic 650,000 BTC milestone, valued at roughly $58.5 billion at the time. The pace accelerated slightly later in the month with a blockbuster purchase of 10,624 BTC for $962.7 million between December 1 and 7 at $90,615 per coin. This brought the total holdings to 660,624 BTC, acquired for approximately $49.35 billion at an average cost of $74,696 per BTC. In a recent statement, CEO Phong Le said that Bitcoin sales are possible in extreme situations, such as a 95% price drop that would trigger margin calls. This goes against Saylor’s long-held “never sell” mantra and has led to speculation about an unimaginable fire sale of their 3% share of the total Bitcoin supply. The company’s mNAV is hovering near 1.0, and shares have dropped 50% since October. Get seen where it counts.

Crypto analysts say the domino effect of this direct custody could positively impact the trajectory of the Bitcoin price prediction . U.S Banks Break Down Barriers to Bitcoin Access The new PNC bank service enables qualified private banking clients to purchase, hold, and sell Bitcoin without relying on external cryptocurrency exchanges. Today marks a major milestone for institutional crypto adoption. @Coinbase ’s Crypto-as-a-Service platform is now powering @PNCBank ’s launch of direct bitcoin trading for PNC Private Bank clients – the first to market with such an offering among the major U.S. banks. pic.twitter.com/wwuOIRuBfK — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) December 9, 2025 This development follows a crucial regulatory milestone from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which recently confirmed that national banks may conduct riskless principal crypto-asset transactions. The decision permits U.S. banks to function as intermediaries in crypto trades by simultaneously buying from one customer and selling to another without maintaining inventory. Last week, Bank of America authorized its 15,000 wealth management advisers to recommend 1%–4% crypto allocations for client portfolios, signaling a broader institutional embrace of mainstream Bitcoin exposure. In October, Citibank announced plans to launch crypto custody services in 2026, after developing the infrastructure over two to three years. Meanwhile, Cryptonews reported in September that BNY Mellon is advancing toward offering custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum, specifically targeting exchange-traded product clients. If other major banks replicate PNC’s approach, BTC could establish stronger support levels in the coming months and position itself for a further push toward the $100,000–$130,000 range heading into 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Breakout Targets $105K, $110K, $120K Bitcoin is attempting to escape a multi-week descending channel after defending critical support near $83,000. The recent bounce pushed the price back above the 9-day simple moving average, demonstrating early momentum, though it remains near the channel’s upper boundary. The RSI has climbed out of oversold territory and is now approaching the mid-50s, indicating recovering bullish momentum following a prolonged downtrend. Source: TradingView If Bitcoin closes decisively above the descending channel and maintains support above $90,000–$92,000 , charts suggest upside continuation toward resistance clusters at $105,000, $110,000, and potentially $120,000. However, failure to sustain this breakout zone risks a retest of $83,000 support. This New Meme Coin Raised $4.3M Fast – Is It the Next Dogecoin? As Bitcoin gears up for its next major move, early-stage projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are quickly gaining traction among investors looking for high-upside plays.

The recent integration of Space and Time (SxT), which now indexes the full Stellar network and provides cryptographically verified data to institutions, also strengthens the chain’s infrastructure. Together, these upgrades position Stellar as a functioning payments network rather than a speculative asset alone. Early market reaction has been modest, but analysts note that expanding stablecoin flows could support stronger demand for XLM over time. Price Holds Key Support as Traders Watch $0.245 Despite the momentum in utility, XLM continues to sit at one of its most important technical zones. The token has trended downward since November 2024 and now trades just above the $0.245 horizontal support, an area that has repeatedly prevented deeper losses over the past year. Weekly indicators remain bearish, with RSI below 50 and MACD negative, suggesting that long-term momentum still leans downward. Short-term charts show a contained bounce within an ascending channel, which analysts view as corrective rather than a new uptrend. A decisive break below $0.245 could open the door to new lows, while holding this level would give bulls another chance to challenge overhead resistance. Resistance Blocks Cap Upside Expectations Even with potential catalysts from network growth, analysts remain cautious about XLM’s ability to retest previous highs. Multiple reports highlight the $0.26–$0.27 range as the first major resistance zone, followed by a broader cluster near $0.28–$0.31. Some forecasts suggest a possible move toward $0.31 by year-end if momentum strengthens, though this outlook carries medium confidence given the broader market’s uncertainty.

55609902,643086,1765389649,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55609902.jpeg,Ethereum Founder Buterin Slams Elon Musk As Anti-Europe Attacks Ignite,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-buterin-slams-elon-musk-europe-attacks/,"Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has issued a sharp public warning to Elon Musk over how X is being used to direct increasingly aggressive rhetoric at Europe, arguing that the platform is drifting from a free-speech ideal toward orchestrated hostility. Ethereum Founder Calls Out Elon Musk In a series of posts on X, Buterin said that “the attacks on Europe I’ve seen here the last couple of days, including from people I’ve generally considered interesting and sophisticated, have been getting unhinged.” He acknowledged that the European Union has serious shortcomings, listing “GDPR clickthroughs are dumb, Chat Control is awful, they need to be less bureaucratic and supportive toward entrepreneurs,” and criticizing what he called Europe’s selective moral stance, noting that its “kindness toward Ukraine often doesn’t extend well to Gaza or Sudan or other places.” He also described “people saying mean things about criminals getting longer sentences than the criminals” as “just crazy.” Despite that, the Ethereum founder argued that the way some users on X are talking about Europe has moved well beyond legitimate criticism. He described “the apocalyptic attitude about the issues, evoking imagery of barbarians pillaging Rome etc,” as “really over the top” and said it “feels more like a coordinated attempt to delegitimize than constructive criticism.” He rejected the idea that the real target is only Brussels-based institutions, writing: “I don’t believe the line that ‘the target is not Europe, it’s the EU’: I’ve seen many instances of London specifically being targeted in the hate session, so no, much of it is an attack on Europe.” This, he argued, does not match his experience from “spending an average of two months every year there for the last decade.” The central confrontation came in a direct reply to Musk. Addressing the X owner’s self-positioning as a defender of free speech , the Ethereum founder wrote: “I think you should consider that making X a global totem pole for Free Speech, and then turning it into a death star laser for coordinated hate sessions, is actually harmful for the cause of free speech. I’m seriously worried that huge backlashes against values I hold dear are coming in a few years’ time.” Buterin Hints At Russian Involvement The thread sparked pushback from some users who argued that his framing underplays European complicity in current conflicts. One critic responded that “’not extending kindness’ is an incredible way to frame funding, arming and politically backing a genocide,” and claimed that it is “hilarious to think the US doesn’t suffer from many of the same things or worse that Americans say about the EU.” The Ethereum founder replied that Europe is “a genuinely mixed bag,” emphasizing that “different countries in Europe have very different policies,” and pointing out that the continent “also hosts ICC, which is under a lot of pressure (see: judges being financially deplatformed).” Other replies widened the lens to geopolitics. Commenting on a suggestion that the current discourse looks like “a coordinated campaign due to the Kremlin liking the new US ‘going back to Monroe’ global security policy,” Buterin answered “yeah basically” and added that “a lot of powerful people really like the vision that the world should just be 5–20 adults who have their spheres and sometimes get together in a room to hash out any differences, and everyone else can be shut out because they are annoying and inconvenient.” At the same time, Buterin restated his support for the European project as an institutional experiment. “I have a lot of respect for the idea of EU, as an experiment in trying to get the benefits of a superstate, without the homogenization, becoming an aggressive ‘great power’, and other downsides,” he wrote, while stressing that “the experiment does need to be adjusted in a lot of ways; eg. we see not enough unity in its external policy and too much unity on top-down bureaucracy and surveillance at the same time.” If improved, he argued, “it’s a model that could set a really good example for the world.” On the technical side, the Ethereum founder used the debate over “gdpr clickthroughs” to propose a different approach to online control, calling for “more sophisticated user-side software (browsers, local LLMs…) that helps the user navigate the internet and make intelligent decisions about what requires confirmations from the user.” In contrast to the centralized dynamics he criticizes on X, he is effectively pointing back to user-empowering, decentralized tools as the way to reconcile regulation, usability and free expression. Musk Vs. The European Union Notably, Musk’s anti-EU outburst comes after the Commission has issued a fine of €120 million to X for breaching its transparency obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA). Musk wrote via X that “The ‘EU’ imposed this crazy fine not just on @X, but also on me personally, which is even more insane!” and says it would be “appropriate to apply our response not just to the EU, but also to the individuals who took this action against me.” In subsequent posts he escalated further, declaring that “The EU should be abolished and sovereignty returned to individual countries,” calling to “Dissolve the EU and return power to the people,” and even asserting that “The EU commissars are responsible for the murder of Europe.” At press time, Ethereum traded at $3,316.",Ethereum|Elon Musk|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|eu|europe|vitalik buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-10 18:00:49

Companies across the sector are cutting back on hardware to slow the cash burn. The hash price just dropped to its lowest level ever, which shows how little miners now earn per unit of computing power. TheMinerMag reports that the median cost to mine (including equipment, energy, and debt) now sits above that revenue level, leaving many public miners operating at a loss. Mining firms are slowing down machines to reduce power usage after the latest drop in income. “As hash price falls, we have seen almost a 8% drop in network hashrate, this is a result of miners using firmware to underclock their machines to save power,” said Ethan Vera, the chief operating officer at Luxor Technology. Ethan said the downturn is forcing operators to stretch out every kilowatt as they continue trading used rigs to stay afloat. Miners move revenue into AI infrastructure The main pressure point is the April 2024 halving, which cuts the reward miners earn from the network. That event hits every four years and reduces the Bitcoin output they receive for validating blocks, which instantly reshapes business math. Many miners now rely on hybrid setups involving AI and high-performance computing, a shift that lifted their stocks earlier this year even as core mining revenue shrank. Companies that now operate AI data centers pulled in billions of dollars to expand those facilities, but Bitcoin still brings in most of their income. Core Scientific collected about 21% of third-quarter revenue from high-performance compute services, while Terawulf brought in 14% from the same line. IREN Ltd., which saw its stock climb more than fourfold this year, generated around 3% of its revenue from high-performance computing, based on TheMinerMag’s estimates. TheMinerMag also reported that break-even prices for 14 tracked miners climbed by roughly 20% from a mean of $90,000 per Bitcoin in the third quarter. With Bitcoin averaging $104,000 so far in the fourth quarter, down from $114,000 the prior quarter, and trading around $92,000 on Wednesday, most miners fall short of profit. “Investors that are piling in or had piled in to these companies over the most recent months are mainly concerned about the AI business, with very little interest in their Bitcoin mining operations,” said Mike Colonnese, managing director of equity research at HC Wainwright & Co. Mike said miners are preparing to unplug machines and replace them with AI data centers over the coming years. Companies pull back as non-US miners ramp capacity Public miners are also separating their stock performance from movements in Bitcoin, as more facilities once dedicated to mining switch to AI support. Core Scientific, Terawulf, IREN, and Cipher Mining have long-term contracts with companies like Google and Microsoft to host AI demand that could bring in billions of dollars. “There has been a fundamental shift in Bitcoin mining as many major players exit the sector,” said Wolfie Zhao, analyst at TheMinerMag. Wolfie pointed out that Bitfarms Ltd. announced plans last month to wind down mining operations over the next few years to build new AI centers instead. Other miners that once chased aggressive expansion have paused announcements about growth plans. Wolfie said private companies outside the U.S. now account for more of the global hashrate, as U.S.-listed operators lose ground. “It is the companies with smaller balance sheets and a lot of debt that will struggle the most,” Ethan said. “It is going to be a pretty grim Q4 for a lot of miners, and it is even worse if you include their GPU businesses, which haven’t made any revenue yet.” The mining boom of early 2021 pushed the sector into a multibillion-dollar industry as companies bought specialized machines, built large data centers, and secured huge amounts of power across the country. Today, some of those same sites are being reused for AI, while others require brand-new construction. More than 95% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist have already been mined. Once the final coin arrives sometime around 2140, miners will rely entirely on transaction fees. “There is only a finite amount of Bitcoin to be mined,” Wolfie said. “Unless Bitcoin prices go to the moon, AI demand seems to be a better bet since that is a much bigger pie to begin with.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

He said, “XRP is like a Bitcoin. It’s a digital asset. It’s today the third most valuable digital asset. And what we do is we take a transaction between banks.” His remarks have reignited discussion across the crypto and financial world about XRP becoming a foundational instrument for cross-border settlement. Lord XRP, via a post on X, shared key quotes and insights from Garlinghouse’s interview — highlighting how XRP’s speed, liquidity, and technical design offer banks and payment providers a real alternative to legacy correspondent banking. From Correspondent Banking to Real-Time Liquidity Garlinghouse explained the inefficiencies of traditional banking: “Instead of having a bank pre-fund an account at the other bank, which is how correspondent banking works today, the Bank of Brad in dollars would pre-fund the Bank of Julia, perhaps in pounds, and then I would debit and credit that. But that means I have to pre-fund and have dormant capital sitting at that other bank.” Ripple’s solution allows financial institutions to tap directly into XRP liquidity , removing the need for pre-funding. Payments settle instantly, reducing costs and improving efficiency. LISTENING TO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE ON CNN!! #RIPPLE IS ONE STEP AWAY FROM BECOMING A WORLD BANK! #XRP IS F***** CHEAP IN MY OPINION pic.twitter.com/iggrgcue7F — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) December 10, 2025 Under RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), a sending bank converts local currency into XRP, transfers it over the XRPL, and the receiving bank converts it back into the destination currency. The result: live cross-border settlement in seconds instead of days. Massive Adoption: Institutions, Corridors, and Volume As of 2025, RippleNet counts more than 300 banks and financial institutions across six continents. Garlinghouse highlighted real-world use cases: “The consumer itself doesn’t actually see that it’s flowing through XRP to solve a problem, but the consumer sees simply a better product at a better price.” Major financial players such as Santander (Europe), SBI Holdings (Asia), and Standard Chartered (Middle East & global markets) use Ripple infrastructure. About 40 % of RippleNet partners actively use XRP for ODL-based settlements, with total processed value exceeding US$1.3 trillion in the first half of 2025. Speed, Cost, and Technical Superiority Garlinghouse emphasized XRP’s technical advantage: “Even compared to Bitcoin, which takes up to 12 minutes to complete one transaction, XRP is extremely fast at about three seconds per transaction . That has meant XRP is extremely scalable in contrast to how Bitcoin works.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Fees remain negligible . Average XRP transaction fees are roughly US$0.0002, dramatically lower than traditional cross-border transfers. These features make XRP ideal for micropayments, remittances, and high-volume transfers. Ripple’s Strategic Momentum and Growth Trajectory Garlinghouse shared Ripple’s ambition: “We’re seeing more momentum than we’ve ever had around using XRP to move this liquidity around the world. We couldn’t really be happier about how that has played out in a world where there’s still a lot of uncertainty and doubt about what’s going on in crypto. This is a real use case solving a real problem for real customers.” Ripple’s global footprint continues to grow. Partnerships with banks, launch of RLUSD, and acquisitions of corporate-crypto service firms signal strategic expansion. Within five years, Garlinghouse projects XRP could handle 14 % of cross-border payments volume currently dominated by SWIFT. Real-World Challenges and Adoption Nuances Despite growth, adoption remains uneven. Some banks use RippleNet for messaging only, without XRP as a bridge currency. Regulatory and risk management concerns may slow broader adoption. Still, data show clear upward trends. Increased corridor launches, rising on-chain volume, and growing institutional usage suggest XRP’s integration into banking is accelerating. In sum, Garlinghouse’s CNN statements highlight XRP’s transformation from a speculative token to a global liquidity bridge. Fast, low-cost, and scalable, XRP’s role in international banking may be closer than most expect. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Apps like Monzo and Revolut have proved that a slick mobile UX beats high-street branches, and now consumers are happy to hold salaries and savings with digital-only institutions. And this will only accelerate as Gen Z and Millennials become the more dominant demographics. But while neobanks have improved the UX, they still run almost entirely on legacy rails. Stablecoins are shaking up global payments and opening the door to another financial revolution. Digitap ($TAP) , an omni-banking app with a live global money app, is looking like the best pure-play bet on the convergence of neobanks and stablecoin rails, and one of the best cryptos to buy for 2026 . With a live global money app, a Visa card program, and a token explicitly designed to capture value, this crypto presale could become the next neobank to take the world by storm. Revolut is still private but already valued at $75 billion, and Digitap is a project that could one day rival it. And investors can lock in ground-floor access today. Neobanks Changed Banking, Now Crypto Neobanks are Ready to Do the Same Again Neobanks solved clear pain points. These digital-only institutions offered intuitive apps, fee transparency, and real-time spending insights that legacy banks still cannot match. Monzo’s instant notifications and budgeting tools, and Revolut’s low-friction FX and cards, quickly captured younger demographics across Europe and beyond. However, beneath the slick app interface, the underlying infrastructure remains old-world. While this works for domestic spending, for global freelancers billing in multiple currencies, underbanked users sending remittances back home, or businesses dealing across borders, it is not quite good enough. At the same time, stablecoins have started to eat into global payments, and the total supply has climbed into the hundreds of billions of dollars. These digital dollars move 24/7, across borders, and settle in seconds instead of days. And that’s how crypto neobanks like Digitap plan to leapfrog existing neobanks. Digitap offers a neobank-grade experience designed from day one to treat stablecoins, fiat, and crypto as first-class citizens inside a single balance. The end result? All the convenience, but now users can move money much faster and send it anywhere they want. How Digitap Built an Omni-Bank Digitap’s core proposition is simple: one account, all forms of value. The omni-bank supports more than 20 fiat currencies alongside over 100 crypto assets across multiple chains. All accessible through a neobank-style app downloadable on iOS and Android today. Under the hood, Digitap runs a multi-rail system with an AI-powered routing engine. When a user sends funds, the system can select between public blockchains or established banking corridors such as SWIFT, SEPA, ACH, or Faster Payments. Payments are optimized for speed and cost, all abstracted away for the end user. And Digitap can leverage stablecoins to provide real-time settlement. This is massive for remittances and cross-border payments—the largest capital flows globally. The average fee for remittances is still 6.4% of the transaction value, with a settlement time of multiple business days. Digitap’s solution slashes this to less than 1% and the payments land in minutes. Another great feature is the Visa card program, and crypto natives can now spend their on-chain balances with millions of merchants. Users can swap between fiat and crypto instantly on the app, and as more value comes on-chain, the value of apps that allow seamless swaps between two systems naturally grows. Digitap’s design perfectly tracks how Gen Z and Millennials already manage their finances, and its combination of UX and better rails is putting this project on the list of best cryptos to buy now because it is anchored in real-world usage. $TAP is already beginning to look like the standout crypto presale for stablecoin and neobank exposure heading into 2026. $TAP’s Value Capture Tokenomics: The Best Crypto Presale for 2026? The biggest difference between Digitap and traditional neobanks is how value is captured. Monzo and Revolut route value to private shareholders and, eventually, public equity investors. Digitap routes value to its token holders. The platform has committed 50% of profits to purchasing $TAP on the open market. 50% will be burnt forever, and the other half will go to users who stake $TAP, unlocking passive income for long-term believers. This means that as the platform grows, the $TAP token will experience greater structural buy pressure. Digitap clearly believes the days of governance-only tokens are over and is delivering a token more like an equity that pays a dividend. The presale price of $0.0361 looks very undervalued, and the fact that Digitap has raised more than $2.3 million amid bearish market conditions speaks volumes. This crypto presale effectively offers discounted entry to a revenue-sharing layer of a live global money app that could grow as large as Monzo and Revolut in the coming years. Why Digitap Leads the Crypto Neobank Race Neobanks have done an excellent job upgrading finance. But a decade after Revolut’s launch, the next wave of growth is likely to come from projects such as Digitap, which marry the neobank UX with stablecoin rails. Digitap has enjoyed early presale success because its omni-banking product feels familiar to Monzo or Revolut customers, but offers much higher throughput and enhanced privacy. It targets a massive market for remittances and cross-border flows, and the $TAP token allows investors to become partial owners of this growth story. Banking tokens are emerging as the most interesting altcoins to buy this year. Digitap’s omni-bank and revenue-sharing design make this crypto presale a fascinating opportunity at the current price, and with the banking bull run about to begin, $TAP could be the standout crypto to buy now before 2026 begins.

This marks a 45% reduction over a period of fewer than 60 days. $XRP ‘s total balance on exchanges has fallen off a cliff dropping from 3.95 billion tokens to roughly 2.6 billion marking a 45% collapse in just under 60 days —1.35 billion #XRP removed from public order books pic.twitter.com/flh3UXCQAp — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 9, 2025 Such a shift could mean that tokens are being moved into cold wallets. When coins leave exchanges, they are less likely to be sold in the short term. As CryptoPotato reported , over 510 million XRP moved between large wallets in a single week, raising questions around distribution or storage changes. Meanwhile, XRP Ledger velocity has risen , showing that tokens are changing wallets more often. While the exchange balance dropped, XRP’s price also moved lower. It is trading at $2.08 as of press time, down more than 42% from the July 2025 high of $3.65. In the last week, the price has fallen by 5%. The trading volume in the past 24 hours reached 3.6 billion, an upsurge of 38% compared to the weekly average (per CoinGecko data). Although activity levels went up, the price could not sustain above $2.10 after briefly surging to $2.17, showing that sellers may be active near that level. Technical Pattern Points to 16% Move XRP is trading inside a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart, according to analyst Ali Martinez. These patterns often lead to breakouts once price pressure builds near the tip of the triangle. “$XRP is trading inside a triangle and setting up for a 16% move,” Martinez posted. XRP Price Chart 10.12. Source: Ali Martinez/X A move above the upper trendline could push the price toward $2.4 to $2.45. A drop below support may send the price to the $1.8–$1.85 zone. Martinez also flagged $1.94 as the level XRP needs to hold to bounce higher. Long-Term Structure Targets $22 Peak Analyst CW shared a chart showing XRP in a four-phase market cycle. This cycle includes a base, a sideways range, a tightening pattern, and a breakout move. The current setup mirrors a pattern seen in 2017. Notably, the chart places the next possible price target at $22. This level is based on a Fibonacci extension of 6.618 from the prior move. On the weekly chart, the Stochastic RSI is rising from oversold levels. In past cycles, this indicator turned upward ahead of strong price increases.

GeeFi is leading this charge, having successfully concluded its first phase by selling 10 million tokens and raising $500,000. The project's total figures are even more impressive, with over 23 million tokens sold and more than $1 million raised from a growing community of 2,400+ investors. As a complete non-custodial ecosystem, GeeFi is drawing significant interest, with analysts forecasting its third phase will sell out in under 10 days amid rumors of major exchange listings. Beyond Solana’s Network Issues While Solana (SOL) contends with network outages and performance issues that frustrate its user base, astute investors are seeking more reliable, high-utility alternatives. Their attention is turning to GeeFi, a project that many industry experts are identifying as 2026's 100x gem. It offers a single, streamlined platform to manage digital assets across more than 14 networks, facilitating token swaps and bridging between chains without the usual technical hurdles. This all-in-one solution addresses a critical need for security and simplicity. The GeeFi Team, which started development in 2023, prioritized building a functional product before its public offering. This product-first strategy sets it apart. The platform gives users complete control over their private keys, guaranteeing their assets remain secure. With the Android app already launched and an iOS version in development, GeeFi is demonstrating its commitment to real-world progress, reinforcing the belief that it is 2026's 100x gem. The GeeFi Presale Advantage GeeFi is currently in Phase 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.06. This entry point provides a guaranteed return of 667%, based on the planned $0.40 listing price. The potential for exponential growth is enormous; an investment of $1,800 at today's price could transform into $90,000 if the token reaches the analysts' forecast of a $3 valuation, achieving a remarkable 4,900% ROI. Market analysts have praised the presale's impressive momentum. The energy from Phase 1 has carried into Phase 2, which has now surpassed 80% completion. This stage alone has raised over $750K from the sale of 13 million tokens. Experts anticipate Phase 3 will start next week and sell out rapidly due to mounting speculation about listings on major exchanges, a key factor behind its reputation as 2026's 100x gem. Powerful Staking and Referral Rewards One of the most attractive features driving demand for GeeFi is its robust staking program. Investors can generate considerable passive income through several flexible options. By locking tokens, users can earn an impressive 15% APR for one month, 22% APR for three months, or a massive 55% APR for a 12-month term. For those who prefer liquidity, GeeFi also provides a staking option with no locked funds that still yields returns of up to 10%. To further enhance earnings, GeeFi has implemented a valuable referral program. By sharing your personal link, you can receive a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by your referrals. This system creates a powerful incentive for community growth and allows early supporters to multiply their holdings. These features provide real, sustainable yield, attracting investors focused on maximizing portfolio performance. Your Final Opportunity for a Ground-Floor Entry The window for life-changing crypto investments is often short. GeeFi's presale presents a rare moment to get in on a project with huge potential before it hits the mainstream. The combination of a deflationary token model, a working product, and a clear path to adoption positions GeeFi to become a major industry player. The rapid pace of the presale is a clear signal of strong market confidence. As the market readies for the next bull cycle, projects with solid fundamentals and real utility are set to lead the way. Missing out on GeeFi now could become a major regret when the token launches on major exchanges, solidifying the belief that it is 2026's 100x gem. The time to secure a position is now. Participating in this presale is the best way to capitalize on the explosive growth that experts are forecasting.

The firm now enables SEC-registered companies to sell new tokenized shares directly to investors on Ethereum and Solana. The move signals a shift toward faster capital formation as firms search for more efficient fundraising channels. Moreover, the development arrives as U.S. regulators accelerate experiments that merge traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. Consequently, the launch positions Superstate at the center of efforts to modernize how public companies raise money and maintain shareholder records. Direct Issuance Targets Faster Funding and Instant Settlement The Direct Issuance Program lets issuers receive capital in stablecoins while investors receive tokenized shares in real time. This structure allows companies to manage shareholder updates instantly through Superstate’s regulated transfer agent system. Additionally, the program supports existing share classes or new digital-only classes, giving companies more flexibility in how they engage investors. Superstate expects the first offerings to launch in 2026. The firm argues that companies need issuance rails that match global capital flows and deliver immediate settlement. Hence, the appeal of stablecoin-based transactions grows as markets demand more certainty and speed. The approach may also help smaller issuers reach investors who prefer blockchain-based assets with transparent lifecycle tracking. Regulators Accelerate Blockchain Experiments Regulators under the Trump administration encourage more crypto-financial innovation, which strengthens interest in tokenized securities. Both the SEC and CFTC now advance guidelines that reduce uncertainty around digital issuance. Moreover, large issuers and fintech firms continue to test onchain models that integrate with compliance tools and custodial systems. Earlier efforts by Galaxy and Sharplink involved tokenizing existing shares for onchain holding. However, those initiatives did not raise new capital. Superstate now extends that foundation by enabling primary issuance that interacts directly with blockchain liquidity. Programmable Securities Unlock New Use Cases Tokenized shares issued through the program can include programmable features that update governance or distribution rules automatically. Besides, the digital structure allows integrations with onchain settlement, portfolio management, and institutional custody providers. These features may attract investors seeking assets that combine regulatory protection with efficient blockchain execution. Superstate intends to open its offering to both retail and institutional buyers after KYC checks. Consequently, the initiative may reshape how issuers approach capital formation and how investors access regulated digital securities.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-10 19:16:46

The Federal Reserve has just announced it will begin Treasury purchases on December 12, planning to buy around $40 billion in bonds over the next month. For anyone with skin in the game—from traditional investors to crypto traders—this isn’t just a dry financial headline. It’s a signal that could ripple through every asset class, influencing everything from bond yields to the price of Bitcoin. Let’s break down what this pivotal move really means. What Are These Treasury Purchases and Why Do They Matter? Simply put, when the Fed buys Treasury bonds, it’s creating new money to inject into the financial system. This process, often called quantitative easing (QE) or in this case, a form of balance sheet expansion, aims to increase liquidity. The goal? To keep markets functioning smoothly and support economic activity. This specific round of Treasury purchases starting December 12 is a targeted operation to manage the supply of safe assets and influence key interest rates. For the crypto world, this is critical intelligence. Historically, massive liquidity injections have weakened the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power over time. Many investors view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as digital hedges against this very phenomenon. Therefore, the Fed’s decision to restart Treasury purchases is a direct input into the macro environment that drives crypto market sentiment. How Will $40 Billion in Purchases Impact Markets? The Fed’s plan to acquire $40 billion in Treasurys over 30 days is a substantial flow of capital. Here’s the potential chain reaction: Bond Prices & Yields: Buying pressure typically pushes bond prices up, which in turn pushes their yields down. Lower Treasury yields can make riskier assets, including stocks and crypto, more attractive by comparison. Dollar Strength: Increasing the money supply can put downward pressure on the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). A weaker dollar has often correlated with stronger performance in dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. Market Liquidity: The new money enters the banking system, increasing the cash available for lending and investment. This liquidity can eventually find its way into various asset markets. However, it’s not a one-way bet. The Fed is walking a tightrope. These Treasury purchases provide support, but they also occur in a context of high inflation. The central bank must balance market stability with its overarching fight against rising prices. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? If you’re holding digital assets, you should view this policy move through a macro lens. The resumption of significant Treasury purchases by the Fed signals a continued commitment to providing market liquidity, even as it talks tough on inflation. This creates a complex backdrop: Short-Term Tailwind: Increased liquidity and a potentially weaker dollar can be positive catalysts for crypto markets, improving risk appetite. Long-Term Narrative: It reinforces the “digital gold” thesis for Bitcoin, positioning it as a scarce asset in a world of increasing fiat money supply. Caution Required: If markets perceive this move as the Fed losing its grip on inflation, it could lead to volatility. Always monitor the broader economic indicators. The key takeaway? Don’t operate in a vacuum. The traditional financial system’s plumbing, managed by actions like these Treasury purchases , directly feeds into the crypto ecosystem’s performance. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Shift Knowledge is power, but action creates results. Here’s how you can respond to this developing story: Watch the Dollar (DXY): Keep an eye on the U.S. Dollar Index. Sustained weakness post-December 12 could be a green light for crypto accumulation. Monitor Treasury Yields: Follow the 10-year Treasury yield. If it continues to trend lower, the “search for yield” could benefit risk assets. Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Does your crypto portfolio balance reflect this new macro input? Consider if you are adequately positioned. Stay Informed on Fed Speech: Listen for comments from Fed officials. They will clarify if this is a technical operation or a shift in broader policy. Conclusion: A Pivot Point for Watchful Investors The Federal Reserve’s decision to begin Treasury purchases on December 12 is more than a routine operation; it’s a significant data point in the ongoing story of post-pandemic monetary policy. For the astute investor, it underscores the inseparable link between central bank actions and digital asset markets. While it presents potential opportunities, it also demands vigilance. By understanding the flow of capital from these purchases, you can make more informed decisions, aligning your crypto strategy with the powerful currents of global finance. The era of free money may be over, but the Fed’s balance sheet moves remain a dominant force. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is the Fed restarting Quantitative Easing (QE)? A: Not exactly. This is a targeted operation to manage Treasury market liquidity and support smooth functioning. It is a form of balance sheet expansion but is currently framed as distinct from the large-scale QE programs seen during crises. Q2: Will this cause inflation to rise again? A: It adds liquidity to the system, which can be inflationary. However, the Fed has stated its commitment to fighting inflation. The impact will depend on the scale and duration of these purchases relative to other tightening measures. Q3: How do Treasury purchases directly affect Bitcoin? A: They don’t directly affect it. The link is indirect through macro channels: potential dollar weakening, increased system liquidity, and lower real yields can improve the investment case for scarce, non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin. Q4: Should I buy crypto because of this news? A: This news is a factor to consider, not a sole reason to buy. It creates a potentially favorable macro backdrop, but you must combine this with your own research, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Q5: How long will these purchases continue? A: The initial announcement covers approximately $40 billion over 30 days starting Dec. 12. The Fed will likely adjust the pace based on market conditions and its broader policy goals. Q6: Where can I track this data? A: The Federal Reserve’s website publishes its balance sheet and market operations data weekly. Financial news outlets and market data terminals will also report on the pace of these Treasury purchases. Found this breakdown of the Fed’s crucial Treasury purchases helpful?

And with dovish speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, further interest rate cuts could be expected going into 2026. Solana could have the fuel for a much greater $1,000, 630% run .

The central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 25-basis-point cut to the benchmark interest rate . This action directly lowers borrowing costs and sends a powerful signal about the U.S. economic outlook, with immediate ripple effects for investors in all asset classes, including digital currencies. What Does the Fed’s Benchmark Interest Rate Cut Mean? The FOMC’s decision lowers the target range for the federal funds rate to 3.50% to 3.75%. This benchmark interest rate is the foundation for most other borrowing costs in the economy. Consequently, when the Fed adjusts this rate, it influences everything from mortgage rates and business loans to the potential returns on savings and investments. For the crypto market, which is highly sensitive to macroeconomic liquidity, this cut is a significant event. Was the Fed’s Decision Unanimous? While the 25-point cut was widely expected, the vote revealed notable disagreements within the committee. Nine members voted in favor, but three dissented, highlighting the complex economic landscape. For Holding Steady: Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee argued for maintaining the current rate, likely due to concerns about persistent inflation. For a Deeper Cut: In contrast, Fed Governor Steve Miran advocated for a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction, suggesting a greater focus on stimulating economic growth. This split vote shows the Fed is carefully balancing risks between inflation and economic slowdown. How Will This Affect Cryptocurrency Markets? Historically, lower interest rates create a environment favorable for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Here’s why this benchmark interest rate move matters for crypto investors. Increased Liquidity: Lower rates make borrowing cheaper, potentially freeing up capital that can flow into various markets, including digital assets. Weaker Dollar: Rate cuts can put downward pressure on the U.S. dollar. Since many cryptocurrencies are priced in dollars, a softer dollar can make them relatively more attractive. Search for Yield: With lower returns on traditional safe-haven assets, some investors may turn to crypto in pursuit of higher potential gains. However, it’s crucial to remember that crypto markets are volatile and react to a mix of factors beyond just Fed policy. What’s the Future Path for Interest Rates? The key question for investors is whether this is a one-time adjustment or the start of a new cycle. The Fed’s statement and future economic data on inflation and employment will provide clues. Markets will now scrutinize every word from Fed officials to gauge if further cuts to the benchmark interest rate are likely this year. This forward guidance will be as important as the cut itself for shaping market sentiment. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Understanding monetary policy is no longer just for traditional finance experts. In today’s interconnected world, Fed decisions impact crypto portfolios. Therefore, use this event as a learning moment. Monitor Macro Trends: Keep an eye on key inflation reports and job data, as these directly influence Fed decisions. Assess Your Strategy: Consider how a potential period of lower rates aligns with your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Stay Diversified: While the rate cut may be bullish for crypto, avoid over-concentrating your portfolio based on a single macroeconomic event. In summary, the Fed’s expected 25-basis-point cut to the benchmark interest rate is a defining moment for the 2024 financial landscape. It reflects a cautious pivot by the central bank amid economic crosscurrents. For the astute cryptocurrency investor, this underscores the undeniable link between traditional finance and the digital asset space. Navigating this new environment requires paying close attention to the Fed’s language and the underlying economic data that will dictate the pace of any further changes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the benchmark interest rate? The benchmark interest rate, or federal funds rate, is the target interest rate set by the Federal Reserve for overnight lending between banks. It serves as the baseline for most other interest rates in the economy. Why does the Fed cut interest rates? The Fed typically cuts rates to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper. This can encourage business investment, consumer spending, and support the job market during potential slowdowns. How does a rate cut affect Bitcoin and Ethereum? A rate cut can be positive for cryptocurrencies by increasing market liquidity and potentially weakening the U.S. dollar. This often leads investors to seek higher returns in alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. What were the main reasons for dissent in the Fed vote? Some officials, like Presidents Schmid and Goolsbee, dissented because they wanted to hold rates steady, likely worried about inflation not being fully controlled. Governor Miran dissented because he wanted a larger, 50-point cut to more aggressively support the economy. Will there be more rate cuts this year? Future rate cuts depend entirely on incoming economic data, particularly on inflation and employment. The Fed has not pre-committed to a specific path and will make decisions meeting-by-meeting. Should I change my crypto investment strategy after this news? Do not make impulsive changes based on one event. Use this information to understand the macroeconomic backdrop. Consider how prolonged lower rates fit into your long-term strategy, but always prioritize research and diversification. Found this breakdown of the crucial Fed decision helpful?

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $91,733.36 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden movement has sent ripples through the trading community, prompting urgent analysis of the underlying causes and potential future trajectory. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding this dip is crucial for navigating the volatile landscape. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market corrections rarely happen in isolation. Therefore, several interconnected factors likely contributed to this Bitcoin price decline. First, broader macroeconomic sentiment often influences crypto assets. Rising bond yields or hawkish statements from central banks can trigger risk-off behavior, pulling capital from volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Second, on-chain data may reveal increased selling pressure from large holders, often called ‘whales’. Finally, technical analysis shows that BTC was testing a key resistance level, and failure to break through can lead to a swift retracement as automated sell orders are triggered. How Should Investors React to This Volatility? Watching the Bitcoin price swing can be unsettling. However, seasoned investors know that volatility presents both risk and opportunity. Here are three actionable perspectives to consider: For Long-Term Holders: Short-term price action is often noise. The fundamental thesis for Bitcoin—digital scarcity and a decentralized store of value—remains unchanged. Many view dips as potential accumulation zones. For Active Traders: This drop creates new technical levels to watch. Key support zones now become critical. A bounce from these levels could signal a buying opportunity, while a further breakdown might indicate a deeper correction. For Newcomers: This is a practical lesson in crypto market cycles. Prices can move rapidly in both directions. It underscores the importance of never investing more than you can afford to lose and considering dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to mitigate timing risk. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? This is the million-dollar question every trader is asking. The answer depends entirely on your timeframe and strategy. Historically, sharp corrections within a bull market have often been followed by strong recoveries. However, if the drop is driven by a major fundamental shift, it could be the start of a larger downtrend. To gauge this, monitor trading volume. A high-volume sell-off is more concerning than a low-volume dip. Also, watch for Bitcoin to reclaim the $92,000 level; holding above it could restore bullish sentiment, while consistent failure may lead to further tests of lower support. Key Takeaways and Moving Forward Today’s market action, with the Bitcoin price slipping below $92,000, serves as a powerful reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. While the immediate move is negative, it is a single data point in a much larger, long-term chart. Successful navigation of the crypto markets requires a blend of disciplined strategy, continuous education, and emotional resilience. By focusing on underlying fundamentals and sound risk management principles, investors can position themselves to weather short-term storms and capitalize on long-term trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price drop below $92,000? A1: The drop is likely due to a combination of factors including broader market risk-off sentiment, profit-taking by large holders after a rally, and the triggering of technical sell orders at a key resistance level. Q2: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A2: That depends on your investment goals. Long-term holders often advise against reacting to short-term volatility. If you are trading, having a pre-defined exit strategy based on support levels is crucial. Q3: Where is the next major support level for Bitcoin? A3: While markets are dynamic, analysts often watch previous consolidation zones. The areas around $90,000 and $88,000 could act as the next significant support if the price continues to decline. Q4: Does this mean the bull market is over? A4: Not necessarily. Bull markets are characterized by strong upward trends interspersed with sharp corrections. One drop does not define a market cycle; sustained breakdowns across multiple timeframes would be a more reliable indicator of a trend change. Q5: How can I protect my portfolio from such drops? A5> Diversification across asset classes, using stop-loss orders for speculative positions, and employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy for long-term buys can help manage risk during volatile periods. Q6: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price updates? A6> For reliable, real-time data and analysis, follow trusted market data aggregators and news platforms that provide transparent sourcing and context for price movements.

The latest Fed decision to cut interest rates has generated significant discussion, but according to JPMorgan’s top analyst, it could have been much worse. Bob Michele’s analysis provides crucial context for understanding what this means for investors and the broader economy. What Made This Fed Decision Different? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently lowered interest rates by 25 basis points. However, the voting pattern revealed deeper divisions than the headline number suggests. The nine-to-three vote indicates substantial disagreement among committee members about the appropriate path forward. Bob Michele, Chief Investment Officer at JPMorgan Asset Management, highlighted this important detail. He noted that the outcome avoided what many feared could be a worst-case scenario for financial markets. The split vote actually provides valuable information about the Fed’s internal debates. Why Wasn’t This the Worst-Case Scenario? Market participants often fear unanimous decisions that might signal impending policy mistakes. The dissenting votes in this Fed decision serve as a safety valve, showing that different perspectives are being considered. Michele pointed out that there could have been even more votes against the rate cut, which would have created different market dynamics. Consider these key aspects of the decision: Gradual approach : A 25-basis-point cut represents measured policy adjustment Transparent disagreement : The split vote reveals healthy debate within the Fed Market stability : The decision avoided extreme reactions that could have occurred with different outcomes What Does This Mean for Future Policy? The current Fed decision sets important precedents for future meetings. The visible disagreement among FOMC members suggests that future rate decisions will likely continue to involve vigorous debate. This transparency can actually benefit markets by providing clearer signals about potential policy directions. Moreover, the decision reflects the Fed’s attempt to balance multiple economic concerns. These include inflation management, employment goals, and financial market stability. The measured approach indicates cautious optimism rather than panic-driven policy changes. How Should Investors Interpret This Development? For cryptocurrency and traditional market participants alike, understanding central bank decisions remains crucial. The Fed’s actions influence global liquidity, risk appetite, and investment flows across all asset classes. Michele’s analysis suggests that while challenges exist, the current policy path avoids the most dangerous outcomes. Key takeaways for investors include: Monitor future FOMC meetings for voting patterns Watch for changes in the number of dissenting votes Consider how gradual rate adjustments affect different asset classes Remember that transparent debate often leads to better long-term outcomes Conclusion: A Measured Response in Uncertain Times The recent Fed decision represents what experienced analysts consider a best-case scenario given current economic conditions. While not perfect, it avoids the extreme outcomes that could have destabilized markets. Bob Michele’s perspective reminds us that central bank decisions involve complex trade-offs, and sometimes avoiding the worst outcome represents significant success. As markets continue to navigate economic uncertainty, this Fed decision provides a framework for understanding how policymakers balance competing priorities. The transparency of disagreement within the FOMC offers valuable insights for anticipating future moves. Frequently Asked Questions What was the main takeaway from JPMorgan’s analysis of the Fed decision? JPMorgan analyst Bob Michele emphasized that the Fed’s decision avoided worst-case scenarios for markets. The split vote (9-3) showed healthy debate, and the 25-basis-point cut represented a measured approach rather than a panic response. Why does a split Fed vote matter to investors? A split vote indicates that different economic perspectives are being considered within the Federal Reserve. This transparency helps markets understand potential future policy directions and reduces the risk of sudden, unexpected changes. How does the Fed decision affect cryptocurrency markets? Federal Reserve decisions influence global liquidity and risk appetite, which indirectly affects cryptocurrency markets. Lower interest rates typically increase liquidity in financial systems, potentially benefiting risk assets including cryptocurrencies. What would have constituted a worst-case scenario according to the analysis? A worst-case scenario might have included a larger rate cut that signaled panic about economic conditions, or a unanimous decision that suggested the Fed was ignoring important counterarguments within its own committee. How often does the Fed make interest rate decisions? The Federal Open Market Committee meets approximately every six weeks to discuss and decide on monetary policy, including potential changes to the federal funds rate. What should I watch for in future Fed meetings? Pay attention to voting patterns, the number of dissenting votes, changes in economic projections, and any modifications to the policy statement language. These elements provide clues about future policy directions. Found this analysis helpful?

The initiative identified what he termed ”zombie payments” ranging from $100 billion to $200 billion annually. His comments represent the most detailed financial accounting of the short-lived program since its conclusion. The revelations emerged during a podcast interview released Tuesday. Katie Miller, a former aide to the Trump administration, hosted the 53-minute conversation. The discussion covered multiple topics including immigration policy, artificial intelligence development, and Mars exploration plans. The episode appeared on X and accumulated over one million views within hours of publication. Musk led the Department of Government Efficiency during the early months of Donald Trump's current administration. He departed from the position in May. The initiative sought to identify and eliminate wasteful government spending through a systematic review of federal payments and programs. Origins and Structure of DOGE The Department of Government Efficiency began as an informal concept. Musk explained that the organization emerged from online discussions rather than traditional government planning. An internet user suggested the name, creating an acronym that matched a popular internet meme. ”Doge was a made-up name,” Musk stated during the interview. He noted the department essentially formed around crowdsourced ideas from the public. The unconventional approach reflected the administration's willingness to experiment with new government structures. Despite its informal origins, DOGE conducted substantial audits of federal spending. The team reviewed payment systems across multiple agencies. Their analysis focused on identifying payments that continued without proper justification or oversight. These ongoing disbursements earned the label ”zombie payments” due to their persistent nature despite lacking valid purpose. Resistance and Political Pushback Musk described significant obstacles during his tenure. Efforts to halt improper payments generated considerable opposition. He indicated that politically connected funding streams proved particularly difficult to address. ”We were somewhat successful,” Musk acknowledged. ”We stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense.” However, he emphasized that the challenges outweighed the accomplishments. Resistance from entrenched interests complicated attempts to implement recommended cuts. The pushback came from various sources within government. Programs facing elimination often had established constituencies. Stakeholders defended existing funding arrangements regardless of efficiency concerns. This dynamic created friction between DOGE recommendations and practical implementation. Musk expressed reluctance about repeating the experience.

According to Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal—often called the Fed’s unofficial spokesman—this division creates unprecedented uncertainty for the U.S. economy and, by extension, global financial markets including cryptocurrencies. The core debate pits inflation fears against labor market concerns, leaving investors guessing about the next move. Why Are Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Causing Internal Conflict? The Federal Reserve is in a policy bind not seen in decades. Officials are grappling with persistent inflationary pressures while simultaneously watching the labor market cool. This dual challenge forces a difficult choice: continue cutting rates to support jobs or pause to crush inflation. The current Federal Reserve rate cuts have failed to create consensus, revealing a fundamental split in priorities among decision-makers. Nick Timiraos highlights this unusual level of disagreement. Some officials prioritize returning inflation to the 2% target, fearing a repeat of the 1970s stagflation. Others focus on maintaining employment growth, worried that overtightening could trigger a recession. This internal debate means future Federal Reserve rate cuts are far from guaranteed. The Powell Factor: Who Decides the Next Move? With only three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings left in his current term, Chair Jerome Powell holds the deciding vote. His leadership will directly shape whether the Federal Reserve rate cuts continue or stop. Powell must navigate between competing factions while managing external economic shocks. Timiraos notes that Fed officials have signaled reduced appetite for further easing. However, the final decision rests heavily on Powell’s interpretation of incoming data. His approach will set the tone for monetary policy through 2025 and influence everything from Treasury yields to Bitcoin’s volatility. Historical Parallels: Are We Repeating the 1970s? The Fed’s current dilemma echoes the 1970s stagflation period. Back then, the central bank’s cycle of cutting and then hastily raising rates failed to control inflation, which became entrenched for years. Timiraos warns that today’s Fed must avoid the same mistake. Inflation Risk: Cutting rates too aggressively could let high inflation become permanent. Employment Risk: Keeping rates too high could unnecessarily damage the job market. Policy Error: The worst outcome would be reversing course after more Federal Reserve rate cuts , damaging credibility. This historical lesson adds pressure to get the next decision right. The stakes for the global economy are immense. What This Means for Investors and Markets The Fed’s internal conflict creates a fog of uncertainty for all asset classes. When central bank guidance is unclear, market volatility typically increases. For cryptocurrency traders, this means: Increased Correlation: Bitcoin may move more closely with traditional risk assets like stocks. Liquidity Watch: The direction of future Federal Reserve rate cuts influences dollar liquidity, a key crypto driver. Hedging Activity: Some investors may use crypto as a hedge against potential policy mistakes. The path of Federal Reserve rate cuts remains the single most important macroeconomic story for 2024. How this internal debate resolves will shape financial conditions for years. Conclusion: A Central Bank at a Crossroads The Federal Reserve faces a critical test of its unity and strategy. Three rate cuts have not settled internal divisions but instead highlighted a profound policy dilemma. Chair Powell’s final meetings will determine whether the Fed prioritizes inflation control or employment support. For markets, this uncertainty requires careful navigation and close monitoring of every FOMC statement and speech. The era of predictable central bank policy appears to be over. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Nick Timiraos called the Fed’s unofficial spokesman? A: Timiraos, a Wall Street Journal reporter, has a track record of accurately conveying the Fed’s internal thinking and policy shifts, often before official announcements. His sources and analysis are highly respected in financial circles. Q2: How do Federal Reserve rate cuts affect cryptocurrency prices? A: Rate cuts typically increase market liquidity and can weaken the U.S. dollar. This environment has historically been supportive for risk assets like Bitcoin, as investors seek alternatives to low-yielding traditional savings. However, the current uncertainty can also increase short-term volatility. Q3: What is the main disagreement inside the Fed? A: The core split is between officials who believe fighting inflation should be the absolute priority and those who think supporting the labor market is more urgent to prevent a recession. This debate centers on the timing and necessity of further rate cuts. Q4: When will we know the outcome of this internal debate? A: Clarity will likely come from the next few FOMC meetings (September, November, December) and the statements/press conferences that follow them. The economic data—especially inflation and jobs reports—will force the committee’s hand. Q5: What happens if the Fed makes a policy mistake? A: If the Fed cuts rates too much and inflation rebounds, they may have to reverse course aggressively, causing market turmoil. If they don’t cut enough and the economy slows sharply, a recession could follow. Both scenarios create volatility. Q6: How can investors protect themselves during this uncertainty? A: Diversification across asset classes, maintaining some cash for opportunities, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term Fed speculation is a prudent strategy. Staying informed on central bank communications is also key. Share this critical analysis with your network. The Federal Reserve’s decisions impact everyone from Wall Street to Main Street.

Paxful, a once-popular P2P exchange, has pleaded guilty to serious criminal charges for failing to stop illicit activity on its platform. This case highlights the critical importance of AML violations compliance in the crypto space and serves as a stark warning to other exchanges. What Did Paxful Do? Understanding the Guilty Plea According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Paxful admitted to willfully neglecting its legal duties. The company failed to implement a robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program, which is a fundamental requirement for financial services. This negligence created a playground for criminals. Prosecutors detailed that the platform processed a staggering $3 billion in transactions while its compliance framework was essentially non-existent. Therefore, the lack of basic “know-your-customer” (KYC) checks and transaction monitoring allowed high-risk users to operate freely. The consequences of these Paxful AML violations were severe and far-reaching, facilitating real-world harm. The Human Cost: What Illicit Activities Were Facilitated? This isn’t just a story about regulatory paperwork. The DOJ’s charges connect Paxful’s failures to tangible criminal enterprises. By turning a blind eye, the exchange allegedly enabled: Sex Trafficking: Providing a payment channel for this horrific trade. Fraud Schemes: Allowing scammers to move stolen funds anonymously. Sanctions Violations: Potentially processing transactions for entities barred from the U.S. financial system. This case moves beyond technical failures into the realm of moral and legal accountability. It shows how weak compliance can directly aid serious crimes. What’s the Penalty for Such Severe Paxful AML Violations? Facing three criminal charges, Paxful’s potential penalties were enormous. However, the court considered the company’s financial state. Prosecutors noted that Paxful had already ceased operations and cooperated with the investigation. As a result, the recommended fine was significantly reduced to $4 million. A sentencing hearing is set for February 2026, where a judge will make the final ruling. This reduced fine raises questions about deterrence but also reflects a pragmatic approach to a defunct entity. Key Takeaways for the Crypto Industry The Paxful saga is a textbook case of what not to do. For other exchanges and crypto businesses, the lessons are clear: Compliance is Non-Negotiable: Building a business first and worrying about rules later is a doomed strategy. AML Programs are a Shield: Effective systems protect the company, its users, and the public. Regulatory Scrutiny is Intensifying: The DOJ and other agencies are actively policing the crypto landscape. This event underscores a major shift. The “wild west” days of cryptocurrency are over. Sustainable growth now depends on operating within established legal frameworks. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for P2P Exchanges The guilty plea from Paxful marks a pivotal moment. It demonstrates that U.S. authorities will hold cryptocurrency platforms accountable for their role in the financial ecosystem, especially concerning AML violations . For users, it’s a reminder to choose platforms with strong compliance reputations. For the industry, it’s a call to prioritize integrity over unchecked growth. The message is unambiguous: compliance is the cornerstone of trust and longevity in the digital asset world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is Paxful guilty of? A: Paxful pleaded guilty to criminal charges for failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program, which allowed its platform to be used for sex trafficking, fraud, and sanctions violations. Q: How much is Paxful’s fine? A: Prosecutors have recommended a fine of $4 million, which was reduced from a potentially much higher amount after assessing the company’s poor financial condition. Q: Is Paxful still operating? A: No, Paxful ceased operations in 2023, prior to this guilty plea. The company is essentially defunct. Q: What does this mean for other crypto exchanges? A: This case sets a strong precedent. It signals that U.S. regulators will aggressively pursue exchanges that neglect AML and KYC obligations, treating such failures as serious criminal matters. Q: When is the sentencing? A: The formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 2026, where a federal judge will finalize the penalty. Q: Should I be worried if I used Paxful in the past? A: For ordinary users who conducted legitimate transactions, there is likely no cause for concern. The legal action targets the company’s systemic failures, not individual users.

In his latest remarks, Powell indicated that current economic data suggests the Fed’s outlook remains unchanged . This seemingly simple statement carries massive implications for cryptocurrency markets, from Bitcoin’s price action to altcoin volatility. Let’s break down what this really means for your digital asset portfolio. Why Does the Fed’s Unchanged Outlook Matter for Crypto? When Jerome Powell speaks, markets listen—and cryptocurrency markets are no exception. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy directly influences investor behavior, risk appetite, and capital flows. An unchanged outlook from the Fed suggests several key things for crypto investors: Interest rate stability : No immediate changes to borrowing costs Predictable liquidity conditions : The financial environment stays familiar Reduced policy uncertainty : Fewer surprises from central bankers Continued inflation monitoring : The Fed remains data-dependent This stability can actually benefit cryptocurrency markets by reducing sudden, policy-driven selloffs that often catch traders off guard. How Powell’s Statement Impacts Bitcoin and Altcoins Jerome Powell’s commitment to an unchanged outlook creates specific conditions for digital assets. First, Bitcoin often behaves as a risk-on asset during periods of monetary stability. When traditional markets aren’t facing interest rate shocks, investors feel more comfortable allocating to cryptocurrencies. Second, Powell’s data-dependent approach means the Fed will continue monitoring economic indicators. For crypto traders, this means paying attention to the same data points the Fed watches: Employment reports Consumer price index (CPI) data Gross domestic product (GDP) growth Consumer spending patterns These indicators now serve as indirect signals for potential crypto market movements. The Crypto Market’s Reaction to Fed Policy Signals Historically, cryptocurrency markets have shown specific patterns following Fed Powell announcements. When the central bank signals stability, we typically see: Initial consolidation as traders digest the information, followed by reduced volatility compared to surprise policy shifts. Institutional investors may increase crypto allocations when policy uncertainty decreases. Altcoins often show more pronounced reactions than Bitcoin due to their higher beta nature. Remember, while Powell suggests an unchanged outlook , cryptocurrency markets still face other pressures including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and adoption trends. The Fed’s stance is just one piece of the puzzle. What Should Crypto Investors Do Next? Given Powell’s current position, smart cryptocurrency investors should consider several actionable steps. First, maintain a balanced portfolio rather than making drastic changes based on one Fed statement. Second, use this period of policy clarity to research fundamentally strong projects that benefit from stable macroeconomic conditions. Third, set appropriate risk management parameters. Even with an unchanged outlook from the Fed , cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. Consider these strategies: Dollar-cost averaging into positions Setting stop-loss orders on speculative trades Diversifying across different crypto sectors Keeping some dry powder for unexpected opportunities Finally, continue monitoring economic data alongside blockchain metrics to make informed decisions. The Bottom Line: Navigating Crypto in a Stable Policy Environment Jerome Powell’s message about an unchanged outlook provides cryptocurrency investors with valuable clarity. While not eliminating all market risks, this stability reduces one major source of uncertainty. The Fed’s current position suggests we’re in a “watch and wait” period where economic data will drive future policy decisions—and by extension, market reactions. Successful crypto investing in this environment requires patience, discipline, and attention to both macroeconomic signals and blockchain fundamentals. Powell’s steady hand at the Fed means you can focus more on cryptocurrency-specific factors rather than constantly worrying about sudden policy shifts. Frequently Asked Questions Q: What exactly did Fed Chair Powell say about the economic outlook? A: Jerome Powell stated that current economic data suggests the Fed’s outlook remains unchanged, indicating stability in monetary policy for the near term. Q: How does the Fed’s unchanged outlook affect Bitcoin prices? A: Generally, policy stability reduces uncertainty, which can support Bitcoin prices by encouraging risk-taking and reducing sudden selloffs driven by fear of interest rate changes. Q: Should I change my cryptocurrency investment strategy based on Powell’s comments? A: While you should consider the Fed’s stance, avoid drastic strategy changes. Instead, incorporate this information into your existing risk management and portfolio allocation decisions. Q: What economic indicators should crypto investors watch now? A: Focus on employment data, inflation reports (CPI), GDP growth, and consumer spending—the same indicators the Fed monitors for policy decisions. Q: Could Powell’s outlook change suddenly? A: Yes, the Fed remains data-dependent. If economic indicators shift significantly, the outlook and corresponding policies could change, potentially affecting crypto markets. Q: How do altcoins react compared to Bitcoin during stable policy periods? A: Altcoins often show amplified reactions—both positive and negative—due to their typically higher volatility and sensitivity to market sentiment changes.

Analyst Calls Out Trading Desk For Triggering Crashes,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-bitcoin-price-down-again/,"Crypto analyst Bull Theory has explained why the Bitcoin price has been crashing recently. The analyst pointed out that Wall Street traders were responsible for the price declines, indicating that these trading desks were manipulating the market for their own benefit. Analyst Explains Why The Bitcoin Price Is Crashing In an X post, Bull Theory blamed Jane Street for the Bitcoin price’s constant crash at 10 a.m. ET when the U.S. market opens. The analyst pointed out that BTC erased 16 hours of gains in just 20 minutes after the U.S. market opened. This has notably been happening since early November, when the flagship crypto fell below $100,000. Meanwhile, a similar price action also played out in the second and third quarters of this year. Related Reading: Confirming The Bitcoin Price Direction: Analyst Reveals What You Should Look Out For Bull Theory noted that another analyst, Zerohedge, has claimed that Jane Street is most likely the entity responsible for this Bitcoin price crash. The analyst stated that the chart shows a pattern that is too consistent to ignore, with a clean wipeout within an hour of the market opening, followed by a slow recovery. He added that this is classic high-frequency execution and that it fits Jane Street’s profile. Bull Theory stated that Jane Street is one of the largest high-frequency trading firms in the world and that they have the speed and liquidity to move markets for a few minutes. The analyst claimed that their behavior is simple: dump BTC at the market open, push the Bitcoin price into liquidity pockets, and then re-enter at a lower price. By doing this, the analyst claimed that Jane Street has accumulated billions in BTC. The trading firm is said to hold $2.5 billion worth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which is its 5th-largest position. Bull Theory added that this means most of the dump in the Bitcoin price isn’t due to macro weakness but manipulation by this entity. He expects that BTC will continue its upward momentum once these big players are done buying. Bitcoin At Risk Of A Decline Post-FOMC Crypto analyst Ali Martinez indicated that the Bitcoin price was at risk of a significant decline following today’s FOMC meeting. He pointed out that BTC has consistently reacted negatively to FOMC meetings, with six out of seven meetings this year leading to corrections for the flagship crypto.

Ripple (XRP) has started gaining traction based on a continued drop in reserves among major trading platforms, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps getting momentum with its presale. Both of these tokens attract a different category of investors. However, this contrast has broadened the debate about which cryptocurrency to invest in now. The shrinking supply of XRP and explosive growth of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represent a contrasting strategy for any investor trying to identify a cryptocurrency for investment before a shift occurs in market trends. Ripple’s Supply Reduction Supports Price Interest Ripple has also shown constant strength around the $2.18 level as its supply within the market continues to reduce. This reduction in available supply continues to build a more stable zone of support for the cryptocurrency and has caught the attention of traders among current crypto news. Binance has shown one of the most dramatic reductions in exchange supply, cutting down its supply to around 2.7 billion from figures above 3 billion. Long-term holders have begun transferring XRP to offline wallets, cutting down the supply available for sale. ETF inflows exceeding $640 million have fueled this sentiment even further, pulling more XRP out of trading circulation. Institutional investors looking for assets with stable liquidity levels have contributed to more demand in the market, and with each inflow, the supply continues to decline. Traders are currently focusing on the $2.17-$2.20 region, viewing this as a strong level for possible stops before any potential rise towards the $2.60-$2.85 region. MUTM’s Presale Quick Progress Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to move along in presale with increasing momentum. The current position of Phase 6 stands at 98% completion. The current price stands constant at $0.035. This marks a 250% increase over the price of $0.01 observed in Phase 1. A total of $19,250,000 has been raised. This is alongside a total number of 18,400 holders. The current presale phase of 6 looks to be selling out rapidly. This serves as an impetus for those considering which cryptocurrency to buy today prior to a price reset. Following completion of the current allotment, phase 7 shall price at $0.04 with a nearly 20% increase. The launch price for this asset has been recorded as $0.06. This gives those who are currently invested a potential increase of 360%. Investors considering where to put their money in crypto are keeping a keen eye on this shrinking opportunity. The presence of a 24-hour leaderboard has also contributed to this heightened activity. This gives a prize of $500 for the best participant who completes any transaction in a cycle with a reset time of 00:00 UTC. Dual Lending Structure of MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been working on a dual lending mechanism that will be capable of catering to varying user requirements in its impending protocol. Its Peer-to-Contract system architecture will enable liquidity for prominent assets while enabling lenders to earn yield without manual intervention when borrowers interact with the protocol. Additionally, the Peer-to-Peer Market will facilitate loans for assets that have customized terms. This will help facilitate liquidity and give users a chance to choose a form of borrowing that best suits their risk preference. Halborn Security is conducting a thorough audit of smart contracts. The code will be formally reviewed before being launched. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also working towards the development of a stablecoin that is fully collateralized and capable of being used as a unit of account. This will bring stability to borrowers and liquidity to lenders. This stablecoin will be integrated with both layers of lending in a manner that will reduce exposure to volatility. The update for the V1 protocol will come with several elements such as liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. This update will be rolled out with the Sepolia testnet in Q4 of 2025. Why a MUTM investment exceeds XRP investment. A decreasing supply of XRP may be a good thing for a long-term interest, but when looking for something with easy early access and increasing uses, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears to be ahead of others when considering which cryptocurrency investment will be best before the new year. Investors looking for a long-term investment should look at MUTM before Phase 6 sells out.

According to their analysis, any future monetary easing now depends entirely on one factor – tangible weakness in the labor market. This shift represents a significant pivot in the central bank’s approach that could impact everything from mortgage rates to cryptocurrency valuations. What Changed in the Fed’s Rate Cut Strategy? Goldman Sachs analyst Kay Haigh recently made a striking declaration that has rippled through financial circles. The Federal Reserve’s recent Fed rate cuts were primarily preventative measures, but that phase has concluded. According to Haigh, the central bank has essentially used up its “insurance” cuts and now requires concrete economic justification for any further easing. This represents a fundamental shift in the Fed’s approach. Previously, the central bank could justify rate cuts based on potential risks or as precautionary measures. Now, the threshold has been raised significantly. The Fed needs to see actual economic deterioration, particularly in employment data, before considering additional Fed rate cuts . Why Does Labor Market Data Matter So Much Now? The labor market has become the critical battleground for monetary policy decisions. Here’s why employment data now holds the key to future Fed rate cuts : Employment as an economic indicator : Job numbers provide the clearest signal of economic health Wage pressure concerns : Strong employment can lead to wage inflation, which the Fed monitors closely Consumer spending impact : Employment levels directly affect consumer confidence and spending Political considerations : Labor market strength has significant political implications Haigh’s analysis suggests that only clear deterioration in these employment metrics would justify additional Fed rate cuts . This creates a higher bar for monetary easing than markets might have anticipated. Was the Last Rate Cut Just Political Theater? Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Goldman’s analysis concerns the motivation behind the most recent Fed rate cuts . Haigh suggested that based on the FOMC statement, the last rate reduction might have been designed to appease the hawkish faction within the committee. This interpretation reveals the complex internal dynamics at the Federal Reserve. The central bank must balance multiple perspectives: Hawkish members concerned about inflation Dovish members focused on economic growth Centrists seeking a balanced approach External pressures from markets and politicians If Haigh’s assessment is accurate, it means the Fed might have exhausted its ability to make consensus-driven preventative Fed rate cuts . Future decisions will require clearer economic justification that all factions can support. What Labor Market Weakness Would Trigger More Fed Rate Cuts? Understanding what constitutes sufficient “labor market weakness” is crucial for anticipating future Fed rate cuts . The Fed likely monitors several key indicators: Unemployment rate increases : Sustained upward movement beyond current levels Job creation slowdown : Monthly non-farm payrolls consistently below expectations Wage growth moderation : Reduction in wage pressure indicators Participation rate declines : Fewer people actively seeking employment Initial claims increases : Rising weekly unemployment insurance claims These metrics would need to show consistent deterioration rather than temporary fluctuations. The Fed typically looks for trends rather than single data points when making significant policy decisions like Fed rate cuts . How Should Investors Respond to This New Reality? The Goldman Sachs analysis creates a new framework for market participants. With preventative Fed rate cuts off the table, investors need to adjust their strategies accordingly. This means paying closer attention to employment data releases and understanding how they might influence Fed decisions. Market reactions to labor market reports will likely become more pronounced. Strong employment data could reduce expectations for future Fed rate cuts , potentially strengthening the dollar and affecting various asset classes. Conversely, weak employment numbers might increase rate cut expectations, with corresponding market impacts. This shift also affects longer-term planning. Businesses and investors can no longer count on the Fed providing “insurance” Fed rate cuts against potential economic weakness. They must prepare for a Fed that requires concrete evidence before taking action. The Bottom Line: A More Cautious Federal Reserve Goldman Sachs’ analysis paints a picture of a Federal Reserve that has become more cautious and data-dependent. The era of preventative Fed rate cuts appears to be over, replaced by a policy framework that demands clear economic justification, particularly from the labor market. This development has significant implications for financial markets, business planning, and economic forecasting. The bar for additional Fed rate cuts has been raised, and only tangible labor market weakness will clear it. As we move forward, employment data will command even greater attention from all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions What did Goldman Sachs say about future Fed rate cuts? Goldman Sachs analyst Kay Haigh stated that the Federal Reserve’s preventative rate cuts are over. Future rate cuts will require clear evidence of labor market weakness, specifically deterioration in employment data. Why is the labor market so important for Fed decisions now? The labor market serves as the most reliable indicator of economic health. Strong employment data suggests a robust economy that doesn’t need stimulus, while weakness could justify additional monetary easing through rate cuts. What kind of labor market data would trigger more rate cuts? The Fed would need to see consistent deterioration across multiple indicators, including rising unemployment, slowing job creation, moderating wage growth, and increasing unemployment claims over several months. Was the last Fed rate cut just political? According to Goldman’s analysis, the most recent rate cut may have been designed to appease hawkish committee members rather than being purely data-driven, suggesting internal Fed dynamics influenced the decision. How does this affect ordinary investors? Investors need to pay closer attention to employment data releases, as these will have greater impact on Fed decisions and market movements. The Fed is less likely to provide “insurance” cuts against potential economic weakness. What’s the main takeaway from this analysis? The Federal Reserve has raised the threshold for future rate cuts. They now require concrete evidence of economic weakness, particularly in the labor market, rather than acting preventatively based on potential risks. Found this analysis helpful?

According to the Strategy executive, the firm currently has no immediate plans to sell any of its 650,000 BTC soon. He emphasized that only dire circumstances could force a Bitcoin sell-off—a scenario he projects will not occur for at least 40 years. Strategy CEO Confirms 40-Year Bitcoin Hold In an interview with CNBC on December 6, Le addressed questions about Strategy’s approach to Bitcoin and the future of its massive BTC bet. When asked whether the firm would ever sell its BTC stash of 650,000 tokens ($60.29 billion), Le emphasized that they intended to hold onto their holdings for as long as possible. The Strategy CEO emphasized that selling would only occur under extreme market conditions , such as losing access to liquidity or US dollars, or if Bitcoin derivatives could no longer be traded. He noted that such a scenario is unlikely until 2065 and, even then, would be considered only in the event of a prolonged 40-year market downturn. In another interview earlier this month, Le stated that if there is a sustained 3-year down cycle in Bitcoin in which the mNAV of MSTR trades below 1x, MicroStrategy may have to sell BTC. This means the earliest the company could sell a portion of its massive holdings is in 2029. Moving on, the CNBC interview touched on Strategy’s role in public capital markets and whether the company has become a proxy for BTC. Le explained that their Bitcoin treasury strategy, which began in 2020, was designed to give investors access to BTC through public equities. He noted that while the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 slightly changed the landscape, Strategy remains a significant part of the crypto and BTC ecosystem. Growing FUD And Long-Term BTC Growth In the interview, Le revealed that Strategy had recently raised $1.44 billion in just over a week for its US dollar reserve, covering 21 months of dividends. The CEO explained that they raised substantial capital to address rising Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) about the company’s ability to meet dividend obligations . Le stressed that, despite the current market downturn, the company had no plans to sell its Bitcoin stash to cover dividends, reassuring investors that its long-term holding strategy remains intact . He supported his views with a historical review of BTC’s broader performance, emphasizing that the leading cryptocurrency has grown by an average of 45% per year over the past five years. When asked about his price outlook for Bitcoin, the Strategy CEO expressed confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future, predicting that BTC will likely continue to rise over the next 20 years. He acknowledged that after 20 years, the market could evolve and innovations might emerge, but for now, Bitcoin has a long runway.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CNBC|Fear Uncertainty and Doubt|fud|mNAV|mstr|Phong Le|Spot Bitcoin ETFs|Strategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-10 20:00:56

The latest Fed dot plot has just delivered its message: prepare for a patient, measured approach to interest rate reductions. The December projections suggest just one 25 basis point cut in 2026, followed by another in 2027. This isn’t the rapid pivot some traders hoped for, but it provides crucial clarity for long-term crypto investment strategies. Let’s decode what this really means for your portfolio. What Exactly Does the Fed Dot Plot Tell Us? The Fed dot plot might sound like technical jargon, but it’s actually a simple visual tool with powerful implications. Each “dot” represents where one Federal Reserve official believes interest rates should be at the end of specific future years. The December plot clusters around a clear narrative: policymakers see inflation cooling gradually, but they’re not rushing to slash rates. This projected path of one cut in 2026 and another in 2027 suggests several important realities: The battle against inflation is entering a new, prolonged phase Monetary policy will remain restrictive for years to come The era of near-zero rates isn’t returning anytime soon For crypto investors, this translates to continued headwinds for risk assets, but also more predictable market conditions than the volatility of recent years. Why Should Crypto Traders Care About Distant Rate Cuts? You might wonder why cuts scheduled for 2026 and 2027 matter today. The answer lies in market psychology and forward pricing. Cryptocurrency markets, like all financial markets, trade on expectations. When the Fed dot plot signals a specific trajectory, it sets the tone for: Borrowing costs for institutions trading crypto Risk appetite among traditional investors Dollar strength , which inversely affects Bitcoin and altcoins Moreover, this extended timeline gives crypto projects breathing room to develop fundamentals rather than relying on cheap money narratives. Projects with real utility and sustainable models will likely outperform during this period. How Does This Fed Dot Plot Compare to Market Expectations? Here’s where things get interesting. Before the December meeting, many traders anticipated more aggressive cuts starting in 2024 or 2025. The Fed dot plot essentially tells markets: “Be patient.” This creates a gap between what the Fed projects and what markets had priced in. Such gaps often lead to: Short-term volatility as positions adjust Reassessment of crypto valuation models Potential buying opportunities during corrections The projected 2026 and 2027 cuts now serve as anchor points. Any economic data suggesting faster or slower progress toward these cuts will trigger market movements. Crypto traders should watch employment reports and inflation data even more closely now. What Actionable Insights Can Crypto Investors Extract? Rather than just watching the Fed dot plot as spectators, savvy investors can use this information strategically. Consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging becomes more valuable in a predictable rate environment Staking and yield strategies should account for continued higher rates Portfolio rebalancing toward projects with strong fundamentals makes sense Liquidity management is crucial since borrowing costs remain elevated Remember, the Fed’s projections aren’t promises—they’re educated forecasts that will evolve with economic data. The dot plot provides a framework, not a fixed destiny. The Bottom Line for Your Crypto Strategy The December Fed dot plot delivers a clear message: the monetary policy normalization process will be gradual, extending through 2027. For cryptocurrency investors, this means adjusting expectations and strategies for a medium-term environment of moderately high interest rates. While this may limit explosive, liquidity-driven rallies, it creates space for organic growth based on adoption and innovation rather than speculative frenzy. The most successful crypto investors will be those who understand these macroeconomic currents and position their portfolios accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Fed dot plot? The Fed dot plot is a chart released quarterly that shows where each Federal Reserve official projects interest rates will be in coming years. Each dot represents one official’s view. Why are the 2026 and 2027 cuts important for crypto? These distant cuts matter because they set long-term expectations for borrowing costs and risk appetite, which fundamentally influence cryptocurrency valuations and institutional participation. Can the Fed dot plot change? Absolutely. The dot plot updates every three months and can shift significantly based on new economic data, making it crucial to monitor regularly. How should crypto investors react to this news? Investors should adjust their time horizons, focus on projects with strong fundamentals, and consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market based on rate expectations. Does this mean Bitcoin will struggle until 2026? Not necessarily. While higher rates present headwinds, Bitcoin has multiple value drivers including adoption, halving cycles, and institutional investment that can outweigh monetary policy effects. Where can I see the actual Fed dot plot? The Federal Reserve publishes the dot plot in its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, available on their official website alongside meeting minutes.

Institutional demand and deeper liquidity are quietly transforming the market. According to X Finance Bull, Ripple’s SVP recently explained an XRP liquidity feedback loop that most retail investors still do not fully understand. Institutions’ onboarding clients generates liquidity, which deepens XRP order books, attracts larger orders, increases XRP inventory, and ultimately feeds back into price. How Institutional Demand Drives the Liquidity Loop Real-world adoption of XRP is expanding through RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). Banks and payment providers use XRP instead of pre-funding foreign accounts. This system reduces capital requirements and speeds up settlement. As liquidity grows, institutions can handle larger orders efficiently. Larger orders then require more XRP holdings, reinforcing the feedback loop. $XRP Army, You need to see this! This is the first time Ripple publicly explained the XRP feedback loop institutions actually use! Ripple’s SVP just explained an XRP liquidity flywheel most retail still hasn’t processed: Institutional products → pull clients → clients… https://t.co/Iw7aSVOJVr pic.twitter.com/rXj1ELGIwS — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 10, 2025 Supply Dynamics and Market Implications XRP supply on exchanges is declining as institutional holdings migrate to long-term custody or cold wallets. This reduces available float and strengthens price responsiveness. The combination of rising demand and shrinking supply sets up favorable conditions for price appreciation. Market watchers describe the current sideways trading as a “calm before the storm.” XRPL Infrastructure Supports Institutional Growth The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is evolving to support institutional activity. Features like Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and tokenized real-world assets improve liquidity and efficiency. These infrastructure improvements enhance trading conditions, reduce slippage, and attract institutional-grade participants. Ripple is actively onboarding the entities that control meaningful XRP flows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Speculation to Utility Historically, XRP’s price moved based on speculative cycles. Now, structural demand is driven by real usage and institutional participation. The liquidity flywheel ensures that increased adoption directly impacts XRP value. Price movements begin reflecting fundamental utility rather than short-term market sentiment. Garlinghouse and Ripple executives emphasize that the token’s price is not broken — it is waiting for flows to scale from test to production. Preparing for the Next Phase For XRP holders, understanding this liquidity mechanism is critical. Institutional onboarding, combined with infrastructure improvements and supply constraints, could trigger significant market shifts. X Finance Bull highlights that XRP is transitioning from hype-driven speculation to a real-utility asset . Investors prepared for this structural change may benefit when liquidity flows intensify. In summary, XRP’s evolving feedback loop, supported by institutions, XRPL upgrades, and supply tightening, signals a potential turning point. This is a phase where usage drives value, not speculation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin Poised To Surge Toward $100,000? Kevin Hassett, the White House economic adviser and a leading candidate to become the next Fed chair, commented to the Wall Street Journal CEO Council that there is “plenty of room” for additional interest rate cuts. He stated, “If the data suggests that we could do it, then — like right now, I think there’s plenty of room to do it.” Hassett, who is President Donald Trump’s preferred choice for the Fed chair position after Jerome Powell’s tenure concludes, has been critical of Powell for being “too late” in lowering rates. Related Reading: Crypto Market Structure Talks: Senator Lummis Addresses Latest Legislation Plans While the last rate cut in October had minimal impact on the Bitcoin price, analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that the current rate cut could significantly benefit the cryptocurrency. He characterized it as a “great move” for Bitcoin and noted that a breakout above $92,000 might be indicative of future bullish momentum. Van de Poppe expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s ability to maintain the support level between $91,500 and $92,000, suggesting that if it does, there could be a pathway for Bitcoin to approach the $100,000 mark. Can BTC Avoid Historical 10% Decline? Market expert Ash Crypto pointed out that historically, each of the last four times the Fed slashed rates by 25 bps, Bitcoin experienced a 5% to 10% decline shortly thereafter. Despite this pattern, Ash noted that the current market setup differs from previous scenarios, suggesting that different dynamics could be at play.

Several positive factors underpinning this optimism include the conclusion of quantitative tightening (QT) after a three-year period.

Additionally, with this being the third rate cut, Ash asserted that there is potential for increased liquidity to flow back into the markets, which historically benefits risk assets like Bitcoin.

In the following lines, we will touch upon the latest developments and analyze the performance of its native token. The ETF Craze Nearly a month ago, Canary Capital became the first company to introduce a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States that has 100% exposure to the asset. Shortly after, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale followed suit. 21Shares was rumored to hop on the bandwagon last week, but its official start was delayed. Some X users revealed that the firm has submitted its fifth amendment to its S-1, bringing the product one step closer to a potential launch in the coming days. The spot ETFs have generated significant interest among investors. According to data provided by SoSoValue, the cumulative total net flow into these products has reached almost $950 million. Canary Capital’s fund comprises $371 million of the figure, whereas Grayscale’s GXRP ranks second with $213 million. RLUSD’s Progress Ripple launched its stablecoin, called RLUSD, nearly a year ago. It is pegged 1:1 to the American dollar and, over the past several months, has received support from numerous exchanges and even banking giants, including the oldest US bank, BNY Mellon. In November, Ripple disclosed that Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) had recognized the product as an accepted fiat-referenced token. This marks RLUSD’s expansion in the Middle East, since prior to that, it received similar backing from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). Meanwhile, the asset’s market capitalization has surged to almost $1.3 billion, making it the 84th-largest cryptocurrency. However, RLUSD remains an insignificant player in the stablecoin sector, which is dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. XRP Price Outlook Ripple’s native cryptocurrency currently trades at around $2.06, meaning a 5% decline on a weekly scale. And while the bulls hope for a short-term resurgence, the recent whale activity suggests a further downtrend might be on the way. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko As CryptoPotato reported , large investors offloaded more than 500 million XRP (worth over $1 billion) in the span of a single week. This development increases the available supply and could result in a price decline (assuming demand doesn’t keep pace). Additionally, it may cause panic and prompt smaller players to sell as well.

For investors, especially in the volatile cryptocurrency space, understanding this shift is crucial. This statement marks a potential turning point in the Fed’s aggressive fight against inflation, moving from forceful hikes to a more watchful stance. Let’s break down what this means for your portfolio and the broader economic landscape. What Does ‘Interest Rates Nearing Neutral Level’ Actually Mean? When Powell says interest rates are nearing a neutral level , he’s referring to a theoretical sweet spot. The neutral rate is a short-term interest rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth. Think of it as the economy’s cruising altitude. For over a year, the Fed has been aggressively raising rates to cool down inflation, effectively pressing the brakes. Now, Powell suggests we’re approaching a point where we can ease off the pedal and just steer. This is significant because it signals a shift in priority from pure inflation combat to a more balanced approach. The Fed is acknowledging that its previous rapid hikes are working their way through the system. Therefore, they can afford to pause, observe the data, and avoid tipping the economy into an unnecessary recession. Why Is This a Game-Changer for Markets? Powell’s remarks are being interpreted as a major dovish pivot. Markets hate uncertainty, and the prospect of an end to relentless rate hikes provides much-needed clarity. Here’s the immediate impact: Relief for Risk Assets: Higher interest rates make safe investments like bonds more attractive, pulling money away from riskier assets like stocks and crypto. A pause or slowdown in hikes can reverse this flow. Cheaper Borrowing: The cost of capital stabilizes, which is vital for business expansion and consumer spending. Dollar Pressure: Aggressive U.S. rate hikes strengthened the dollar. A neutral stance could weaken it, potentially boosting dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. In essence, the declaration that interest rates are nearing a neutral level removes a significant headwind that has pressured financial markets for months. How Does This Directly Affect Cryptocurrency? The cryptocurrency market is highly sensitive to macroeconomic policy. For the past two years, the Fed’s tightening cycle has been a constant shadow. Powell’s latest comments act like a beam of sunlight breaking through. With the threat of ever-higher rates diminishing, we may see: Improved Investor Sentiment: Crypto, as a high-growth, speculative asset class, thrives in a lower-rate environment. Confidence may return. Reduced Selling Pressure: Institutions and large holders who were de-risking due to high yields elsewhere may reconsider their crypto allocations. Focus on Fundamentals: With macro pressures easing, market attention can shift back to blockchain adoption, protocol development, and real-world utility. However, caution is still advised. The Fed is nearing neutral, not declaring victory. Inflation remains above target, and the “higher for longer” mantra still applies. The new phase is one of data-dependent patience. What’s the Fed’s Next Move? A ‘Wait and See’ Approach Powell explicitly stated the Fed is now in a position to “wait and observe.” This means future decisions will hinge on incoming economic reports—employment data, consumer spending, and, most importantly, inflation readings. The era of automatic, large hikes is likely over. Instead, expect smaller, less frequent adjustments or prolonged pauses. For traders, this means volatility may now be driven more by economic data releases than by Fed meeting anticipation. It’s a different, potentially more predictable, playing field. Conclusion: A Pivot Point for Prudent Investors Jerome Powell’s signal that interest rates are nearing a neutral level is a watershed moment. It marks the transition from an aggressive tightening cycle to a period of stabilization and assessment. For cryptocurrency investors, this reduces a major systemic risk and opens the door for a market recovery driven by sector-specific growth rather than macro fear. The key takeaway is optimism, tempered with vigilance. The storm of rapid rate hikes is passing, but the economic landscape has changed. Successful navigation will require focusing on assets with strong fundamentals and preparing for a new phase of monetary policy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the ‘neutral interest rate’? A1: The neutral interest rate is the theoretical federal funds rate at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth. It’s a balancing point for a healthy economy. Q2: Does this mean the Fed will cut rates soon? A2: Not necessarily. “Nearing neutral” suggests a pause, not an immediate reversal. Rate cuts would require clear signs of economic weakness or inflation falling decisively to the 2% target. Q3: How quickly do crypto markets react to such Fed statements? A3: Almost instantly. Crypto markets trade 24/7 and are highly liquid, meaning they often price in expectations from speeches like Powell’s within minutes or hours. Q4: Should I move all my investments into crypto now? A4: No. This is a positive macro development, but it doesn’t eliminate risk. Always maintain a diversified portfolio and invest based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Q5: What economic data should I watch now? A5: Key indicators include the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for inflation, monthly jobs reports, and retail sales data, as these will guide the Fed’s “wait and see” decisions.

For cryptocurrency investors and traders, understanding these monetary policy signals is essential, as they directly influence market liquidity and risk appetite. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell address provides critical insights into the economic landscape that shapes both traditional and digital asset markets. What Did Fed Chair Jerome Powell Announce Today? Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed journalists and the financial world after the Federal Open Market Committee made its latest interest rate decision. His remarks typically cover several key areas that market participants analyze closely. The tone and substance of these comments can trigger immediate reactions across global markets, including cryptocurrencies. During these conferences, Powell explains the committee’s thinking on: The current state of the U.S. economy Inflation projections and targets Employment data and labor market conditions Future guidance on monetary policy direction Why Crypto Investors Should Care About Powell’s Remarks You might wonder why a central banker’s words matter to cryptocurrency markets. The connection is stronger than many realize. When Fed Chair Jerome Powell signals tighter monetary policy, it typically means: Higher interest rates that make traditional investments more attractive Reduced liquidity in financial systems Increased risk aversion among institutional investors Conversely, when the Fed indicates a more accommodative stance, risk assets like cryptocurrencies often benefit from increased capital flows. The press conference gives traders clues about whether we’ll see a ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ environment in coming months. Key Takeaways From Today’s FOMC Press Conference While we await the full transcript and analysis, several elements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell ‘s presentation deserve attention. Market participants will be parsing his language for hints about future policy moves. Specifically, they’ll examine: The Fed’s assessment of recent inflation data Any changes to the ‘dot plot’ interest rate projections Comments about financial stability concerns Guidance on the balance sheet reduction program Each of these factors influences how institutional money flows between asset classes. For crypto markets that have become increasingly correlated with traditional risk assets, these signals are particularly valuable for positioning portfolios. How to Interpret Powell’s Message for Your Crypto Strategy Understanding the implications of Fed Chair Jerome Powell ‘s remarks requires looking beyond headlines. Here are actionable insights for cryptocurrency investors: Monitor bond yields – Rising yields often pressure growth-oriented assets Watch the dollar index – Dollar strength can create headwinds for crypto Assess risk sentiment – Powell’s tone affects overall market psychology Review your allocation – Adjust positions based on changing liquidity conditions Remember that markets often react to expectations rather than reality. The actual rate decision is frequently priced in beforehand, but Powell’s press conference can deliver surprises that move markets substantially. The Bottom Line: Powell’s Impact on Digital Assets The conclusion of Fed Chair Jerome Powell ‘s post-FOMC press conference marks a significant moment for all financial markets. For cryptocurrency participants, these events provide crucial context about the macroeconomic environment that shapes price action. While crypto operates on a global scale, U.S. monetary policy remains a dominant force influencing capital flows and investor behavior. Successful navigation of crypto markets requires understanding these fundamental drivers. Today’s remarks from the Fed chair add another piece to the puzzle of where both traditional and digital economies might head next. Stay informed, stay flexible, and remember that monetary policy changes create both challenges and opportunities in equal measure. Frequently Asked Questions What is the FOMC and why does it matter? The Federal Open Market Committee is the branch of the Federal Reserve that sets monetary policy, particularly interest rates. Their decisions influence borrowing costs, economic growth, and investment flows across all asset classes including cryptocurrencies. How quickly do crypto markets react to Fed announcements? Crypto markets typically react within minutes to Fed statements and Powell’s press conference remarks. However, the full implications often unfold over subsequent days as analysts digest the details and implications. Does Powell directly comment on cryptocurrencies? While not his primary focus, Powell has occasionally addressed cryptocurrency topics when asked during press conferences. His comments typically concern regulatory perspectives and financial stability considerations rather than investment advice. Why do rate decisions affect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Interest rate changes affect the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Higher rates make interest-bearing investments more attractive, potentially reducing capital flowing into cryptocurrencies. Should I change my crypto investments after FOMC meetings? Not necessarily immediately. While FOMC decisions are important, they’re just one factor in a complex market. Consider them within your overall investment strategy rather than as standalone trading signals. Where can I watch future Fed press conferences? The Federal Reserve typically streams press conferences live on their website and major financial news networks. Many cryptocurrency news platforms also provide real-time analysis and commentary during these events. Found this analysis helpful?

This Fed rate cut decision ripples through traditional markets and cryptocurrency valuations alike, creating opportunities and risks that demand your attention. What Exactly Did Trump Say About the Fed Rate Cut? Speaking at a White House roundtable, President Trump expressed clear dissatisfaction with the Federal Open Market Committee’s decision. He argued the central bank should have implemented a more substantial Fed rate cut to support rising markets. “When the market is rising,” Trump emphasized, “it should be supported to facilitate further gains.” This public pressure on monetary policy marks a significant moment for market observers. Why Does This Fed Rate Cut Matter to Crypto Investors? Monetary policy decisions create domino effects across all financial sectors. Here’s how this Fed rate cut impacts cryptocurrency markets: Lower borrowing costs often increase liquidity that can flow into risk assets like cryptocurrencies Reduced interest rates typically weaken the dollar, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s appeal as an alternative store of value Market sentiment around monetary easing can create favorable conditions for digital asset adoption Institutional investors may adjust portfolios based on changing yield environments The Bigger Picture: Monetary Policy in Unprecedented Times Trump’s comments highlight an ongoing tension between political leadership and central bank independence. The Federal Reserve traditionally operates without political interference, but recent administrations have increasingly commented on monetary policy. This particular Fed rate cut comes during complex economic conditions where traditional tools face new challenges. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this represents more than just interest rate mechanics. It signals how macroeconomic decisions increasingly influence digital asset valuations. When central banks adjust policy, cryptocurrency markets often react within hours or days. What Could a Larger Fed Rate Cut Have Achieved? Trump’s suggestion raises important questions about monetary strategy. A more aggressive Fed rate cut might have: Provided stronger stimulus to economic activity Further reduced borrowing costs for businesses and consumers Potentially weakened the dollar more significantly Increased inflationary pressures that could benefit hard assets However, the Federal Reserve must balance multiple objectives including price stability, employment goals, and financial system security. Their cautious approach reflects these complex considerations. Actionable Insights for Crypto Market Participants Understanding monetary policy developments gives you an edge in cryptocurrency investing. Monitor these key indicators following any Fed rate cut : Dollar index movements and their inverse relationship with Bitcoin Traditional market reactions to gauge broader risk appetite Institutional flow data into cryptocurrency products Macroeconomic data releases that might influence future Fed decisions Remember that cryptocurrency markets increasingly correlate with traditional finance during significant policy events. This integration means monetary policy decisions now directly impact your digital asset portfolio. Conclusion: Navigating the New Monetary Landscape Trump’s commentary on the Fed rate cut underscores how monetary policy has become front-page news affecting all investors. While the Federal Reserve maintained its independence with this decision, the public debate highlights growing recognition that interest rates influence everything from stock markets to cryptocurrency valuations. As digital assets mature, their sensitivity to these macroeconomic forces will only increase, making monetary literacy essential for successful investing. Frequently Asked Questions How do Fed rate cuts typically affect cryptocurrency prices? Fed rate cuts generally create favorable conditions for cryptocurrencies by increasing market liquidity and potentially weakening the dollar. However, the relationship isn’t always direct or immediate, as multiple factors influence crypto valuations. Why would President Trump want a larger rate cut? Trump suggested a larger cut could better support rising markets and facilitate further gains. Presidents often prefer accommodative monetary policy during their administrations to support economic growth and financial markets. Does the Federal Reserve consider cryptocurrency markets when making decisions? While not a primary consideration, the Fed increasingly monitors cryptocurrency markets as part of broader financial system stability assessments. Significant crypto market movements can influence overall risk sentiment. How quickly do cryptocurrency markets react to Fed announcements? Reactions typically occur within hours of announcements, though sometimes the full impact unfolds over several days as markets digest implications and secondary effects. Should cryptocurrency investors closely follow Fed decisions? Absolutely. Monetary policy decisions create macroeconomic conditions that significantly influence risk assets including cryptocurrencies. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable context for investment decisions. What other economic indicators should crypto investors watch? In addition to Fed decisions, monitor inflation data, employment reports, dollar strength, and traditional market indicators to understand the broader economic environment affecting cryptocurrencies.

Related Reading: The Current Bitcoin Price Pump Will End In A Crash – Here’s When To Start Selling While price movements remain within familiar ranges, the underlying conditions paint a more complex picture, one that traders are watching closely for signs of either exhaustion or a sharp reversal. Recent sessions have seen Solana drift between $128 and $145, with brief rebounds lifting it toward the upper end of this range. However, liquidity indicators suggest a deeper reset is taking shape. Analysts note that these conditions often precede turning points, though they can amplify volatility in the short term. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview SOL Liquidity Drops to Bear-Market Levels On-chain data shows Solana’s 30-day realized profit-to-loss ratio has stayed below 1 since mid-November. This pattern, more losses being realized than gains, typically marks a liquidity contraction similar to historical bear-market phases. Analysts at Altcoin Vector describe the current setup as a “full liquidity reset,” a process that typically takes several weeks to resolve. That backdrop aligns with observations from SynFutures, whose team cites realized losses, declining futures open interest, and fragmented liquidity pools as contributing factors. Market-makers have also pulled back, thinning order books even as realized volatility increases. The effect is a market highly sensitive to sharp moves, particularly around key liquidation clusters. A notable risk is emerging around the $129 level, where nearly $500 million in long positions would be liquidated if the price retests that zone. With $15.6 million in SOL contracts wiped out in the last 24 hours alone, the market remains vulnerable to cascades. Similarly, exchange balances continue to drop, and spot ETFs have brought in more than $17 million this week, signaling accumulation despite broader stress. Volatility Builds as Derivatives and Spot Activity Diverge Derivatives data reflect a cautious but engaged trading environment. Open interest has climbed back above $7.2 billion, rising in tandem with a rebound in daily volume. This type of build-up during a quiet price phase often signals positioning ahead of a larger move. Long-to-short ratios have shifted bullish in recent days, and funding rates remain positive, although traders are becoming increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic catalysts. Spot markets tell a different story. Liquidity is thin, and deep-cycle reset metrics point to selling exhaustion rather than active expansion. This divergence, characterized by high derivative activity against weakening spot liquidity, typically precedes volatility spikes. Key Solana Levels Ahead as Market Awaits a Cycle Turn Technically, Solana remains stuck between established boundaries. The $145 resistance zone has capped multiple attempts to break higher, while support around $135 and deeper levels near $129 hold significance for traders monitoring liquidation risk. Momentum indicators are stabilizing, and the MACD is edging toward a potential positive crossover. Analysts note that past liquidity resets have been followed by rapid upside moves once conditions improved; however, the timing remains uncertain.

This transition marks one of the strongest security pivots by a major exchange, signaling a broader industry conversation about balancing rapid withdrawals with the need to reduce attack surfaces. As digital asset markets continue to expand, Upbit’s response provides a real-time glimpse into how platforms balance operational liquidity against systemic cyber risks. Upbit Pushes Hot Wallet Usage Toward Zero Following its internal review and system overhaul, Upbit confirmed that it now stores approximately 99% of user assets in cold wallets, with hot wallet exposure reduced to about 1% and expected to decrease further. As of late October, the exchange held 98.33% of customer funds offline, a rate already well above the 80% minimum required under South Korea’s Virtual Asset User Protection Act. This shift follows a pattern of rising caution. The recent breach was Upbit’s second significant attack, occurring on November 27, mirroring a 2019 incident that saw more than 342,000 ETH drained from its systems. This year’s Solana-based attack resulted in withdrawals across 24 tokens within less than an hour, prompting an immediate shutdown of hot wallet operations and emergency transfers to cold storage. Upbit has pledged to fully reimburse affected users from corporate reserves. Domestic data suggests that the exchange already leads the market in cold storage usage, maintaining the lowest hot wallet ratio among local competitors, whose cold wallet shares range from 82% to 90%. Security Benchmark Sets Pressure on Global and Local Exchanges Upbit’s near-99% cold wallet ratio surpasses the standards of major global exchanges. Coinbase stores about 98% of its funds offline, while Kraken’s ratio sits between 95% and 97%. Several Asian exchanges, including OKX and Gate.io, maintain similar levels. With Upbit’s latest update, the platform now stands at the forefront of global cold storage practices. Industry observers note that the move aligns with broader regulatory momentum. South Korea’s Financial Services Commission is considering new rules that would require exchanges to compensate users for losses resulting from hacks, regardless of fault, similar to the standards imposed on banks. Liquidity Questions Linger in a Restricted Market While security is at the center of Upbit’s restructuring, analysts caution that running with minimal hot wallet reserves may slow withdrawals during periods of heightened market volatility. South Korea’s crypto market is largely closed to foreign participants, restricting arbitrage and creating conditions where delays can exacerbate price discrepancies, commonly known as the “ Kimchi premium .” During last month’s temporary withdrawal suspension, liquidity was effectively trapped, resulting in sharply widening price gaps between the Korean and global markets. Still, Upbit maintains that its rebuilt systems and predictive models will ensure sufficient liquidity under normal trading conditions.

The project’s funding journey began with incredible force, selling out its first phase in under two weeks and raising a rapid $500,000 . That powerful momentum has rolled directly into Phase 2, which has now blown past the $750,000 mark, with over 13 million tokens purchased by a growing community of investors. With the current stage already more than 80% sold out, analysts are forecasting that Phase 3 could begin as early as next week. A New Standard in Decentralized Trading At the core of the GeeFi ecosystem is its non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX), a platform designed to give users absolute control over their assets. Unlike centralized exchanges that hold user funds, GeeFi’s architecture ensures that traders maintain custody of their private keys, offering a secure and transparent trading environment. This model eliminates counterparty risk, providing a truly trustless platform where users can trade with confidence, knowing their funds are protected by the integrity of the blockchain itself. An Investment Structured for Massive Gains The financial architecture of the GeeFi presale is drawing significant attention from across the crypto space. In the current Phase 2, tokens are available for just $0.06 , a substantial discount from the confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 . This structure offers early investors a guaranteed 667% return the moment the token becomes publicly tradable. The long-term potential is even more impressive. With analysts projecting a future token price of $2, a strategic $1,600 investment today could skyrocket to $60,000 , representing an incredible 3,233% ROI . The market is responding with clear enthusiasm. Over 13 million tokens have been sold in Phase 2 alone, raising more than $750,000 and demonstrating undeniable investor demand. This powerful buying pressure has led experts to predict that the current phase will sell out far ahead of schedule. Adding to the excitement are persistent whispers of upcoming listings on major Tier-1 centralized exchanges, a development that often acts as a major catalyst for explosive price growth upon launch. Unlock Powerful Passive Income with Staking GeeFi amplifies its investment potential with a versatile and rewarding staking program managed directly through the GeeFi Wallet. The platform offers a range of options designed to suit different investment strategies. For those who prioritize liquidity, a no-lock staking plan provides a competitive 10% APR . For investors aiming for higher returns, fixed-term staking delivers 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an outstanding 55% APR for a twelve-month lock . The ecosystem also promotes community building through a referral program that gives users a 5% bonus on all contributions from their links. This Ground-Floor Opportunity Is Closing Fast In a market filled with hype, GeeFi is emerging as a project with genuine 100x potential, backed by strong fundamentals and real-world application. This presale offers a limited-time chance to invest in a high-utility ecosystem before it explodes onto the mainstream crypto scene. As Phase 2 races toward its sell-out conclusion and an imminent price increase for Phase 3 approaches, the window of opportunity is rapidly shrinking. The combination of guaranteed listing gains, high-yield staking, and tangible utility is creating immense FOMO, urging investors to act now before this rare opportunity is gone.

According to a Bloomberg report today, the lawsuits against both Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and Texas Instruments Inc. blame them for failing to keep their technology out of Russian-made weapons that have been used in the war against Ukraine. Both companies – along with a company owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. – reportedly looked the other way deliberately, even as third parties resold restricted chips to Russia to power drones and missiles in violation of US sanctions, according to one of the five suits, filed Wednesday in state court in Texas. Serious allegations against Intel, AMD The lawsuits cite five attacks that took place between 2023 and 2025 and claimed dozens of lives. These attacks allegedly involved Iranian-made drones with components associated with Intel and AMD, as well as Russian-made KH-101 cruise missiles and Iskander ballistic missiles, all weapons that utilize the resold chips. In the past, both companies claimed they fully complied with sanctions requirements and ceased business in Russia when the war broke out, with stringent policies put in place to monitor compliance. In congressional testimony last year, Shannon Thompson, the assistant general counsel at Texas Instruments, said the company “strongly opposes the use of our chips in Russian military equipment” and any such shipments “are illicit and unauthorized.” Despite such statements, it has become clear that long-standing sanctions and export controls have not been able to keep chips from AMD, Intel, Texas Instruments, and others out of the hands of Russia’s military companies, hence the lawsuits which were filed in Dallas by Mikal Watts, a veteran US mass-tort lawyer, on behalf of Ukrainian citizens. The US government is also reportedly aware that these chips are still getting into Russian hands and has repeatedly warned chipmakers that they need to do more to staunch this flow of chips. Last year, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal accused companies of “objectively and consciously failing to prevent Russia from benefiting from the use of their technology.” Wednesday’s suits have also identified Mansfield, Texas-based Mouser Electronics, a company Berkshire acquired in 2007 when it bought Mouser’s parent company TTI Inc., as a pain point in the whole issue. According to reports, the business is focused on selling and distributing semiconductor components and has been accused of facilitating the transfer of chips made by Intel, Texas Instruments, and others to shell companies controlled by Russian proxies. The cases were filed in Texas because the chip companies and Mouser are either based there or have substantial operations in the state. There’s also the fact that the war made leveling the accusations in the Ukrainian court system impossible. Despite the allegations, stocks of both Intel and AMD have shown resilience and a limited reaction to the news. Intel executives stay in the news The lawsuits against AMD and Intel are coming not long after the episode between Taiwanese authorities and one of Intel’s newest executives, Wei-Jen Lo. The officials were reportedly investigating whether Lo, who was formerly with TSMC, may have stolen sensitive technology related to advanced semiconductor processes. During the raid, prosecutors seized computers and other materials, and a court order froze some of Lo’s assets, including real estate, as part of the inquiry. TSMC has since launched legal action, accusing Lo of violating non-compete agreements and trade secrets regulations before his exit from the company. Lo joined Intel as vice president of research and development after retiring from Taiwan Semiconductor in July, where he held a senior role in corporate strategy and advanced node technology development.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $640.49. In 2031, AAVE will range between $864.66 to $1,040.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $201.60 Market cap $3.05B Trading volume (24-h) $410.08M Circulating supply 15.16M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $196.71 24-hour high $205.44 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.26% (High) 50-day SMA $199.64 14-Day RSI 57.92(Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $240.25 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE is pressing multi-day resistance at $206–$207 with improving but not explosive momentum. The short-term structure is bullish, but $204 must break cleanly for the upside continuation to continue. Key supports lie at $198, then $183 if momentum fades. Aave 1-day price chart AAVE’s 1-day chart for December 10 shows the price pressing against the upper Bollinger Band near $206–$207, while trading at $203.07, indicating upward pressure but also signaling that the asset is entering a supply zone where previous candles have stalled. The band width is modest, suggesting the trend isn’t overextended, though continuation requires a clean breakout above $207. Meanwhile, the RSI at 57.7 is bullish without being overheated and confirms improving demand, yet it lacks the strength normally seen during strong breakouts. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD momentum remains positive, with the MACD line above the signal line and widening slightly, but the slope is not aggressive enough to imply a decisive impulse. The price structure has held higher lows since late November, and the mid-Bollinger at $183 now acts as a firm support base. If AAVE stays above $195–$198 in the coming sessions, bulls may attempt a push toward $210–$215. Failure to hold that region would risk a pullback toward $183. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE has rebounded sharply after dipping toward $198 and is now challenging the $203–$204 resistance area, which aligns with recent rejection wicks. The Alligator indicator shows the green baseline curling upward ahead of the red and blue averages, signaling early-stage trend expansion, though the angle is still shallow and requires sustained closes above $204 to evolve into a stronger uptrend. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD on this timeframe is turning bullish as well, with a fresh crossover above the signal line and a rising histogram, albeit with moderate amplitude. Balance of Power at 0.72 reflects buyers regaining control after a brief lull but not yet displaying dominance typical of stronger upward surges. If AAVE can reclaim $204 decisively, the chart favors a continuation toward $208–$210. However, rejection here risks dropping the price back to $198–$196, where the Alligator’s support cluster sits. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $237.31 SELL SMA 5 $216.57 SELL SMA 10 $207.30 SELL SMA 21 $186.67 BUY SMA 50 $199.64 BUY SMA 100 $238.32 SELL SMA 200 $240.25 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $189.78 BUY EMA 5 $201.15 BUY EMA 10 $228.84 SELL EMA 21 $260.16 SELL EMA 50 $278.88 SELL EMA 100 $274.33 SELL EMA 200 $256.14 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is leaning bullish but still lacks the breakout conviction needed to rush past resistance. A close above $204 on the 4-hour and $207 on the 1-day would open a path toward $210–$215, while failures at these levels likely return the price to $198 or even $183 before any renewed attempt. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps.

Valued at approximately $388 million, this single transaction highlights the immense scale at which major players, or ‘whales,’ operate within the digital asset space. But what does such a massive movement of stablecoins truly signify for the broader market? What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Mean? When a sum this large moves, it’s rarely a simple withdrawal. A USDT transfer of nearly $400 million demands closer inspection. Typically, such movements can signal several potential activities by large-scale investors or institutions. The destination being an ‘unknown wallet’—a private address not directly linked to a known exchange—adds a layer of intrigue. This could indicate preparation for a major over-the-counter (OTC) trade, a strategic reallocation of assets, or even the movement of funds into cold storage for safekeeping. The sheer size immediately impacts liquidity on the OKX exchange and draws the market’s attention to potential upcoming volatility. Why Are Whale Transactions So Important to Watch? Transactions flagged by services like Whale Alert serve as a public ledger of whale activity. Monitoring these large USDT transfer events is crucial for several reasons: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large moves can foreshadow bullish or bearish trends. A withdrawal to a private wallet might suggest holding, while a deposit to an exchange could signal an intent to sell. Liquidity Signals: Removing $388M in USDT from an exchange reduces its available stablecoin liquidity, potentially affecting trading pairs and price stability. Network Health: It demonstrates the capacity and reliability of the Tron or Ethereum network (depending on the USDT standard used) to handle high-value settlements seamlessly. Ultimately, while one transaction doesn’t define a market, it provides a valuable data point in understanding the flow of capital. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Tether’s Stability? Tether (USDT) maintains its peg to the US dollar through reserves and market mechanisms. A single large USDT transfer between wallets does not directly affect this peg. The tokens are simply changing ownership addresses on the blockchain. However, the context matters. If this is part of a larger pattern of whales moving stablecoins off exchanges, it might reflect a cautious stance ahead of perceived market uncertainty. Conversely, it could be capital positioning for a significant investment. The stability of USDT relies more on the actions of Tether the company (its attestations and reserves) than on individual transactions, but whale behavior often mirrors institutional confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers So, what should you do with this information? First, don’t panic. Large transactions are a normal part of a maturing market. Use this event as a learning opportunity: Follow the Data: Use blockchain explorers to see if the receiving wallet has a history of activity. Does it typically send funds to other exchanges? Context is Key: Correlate this with other market news. Is there major regulatory news or a macroeconomic event that might explain capital movement? Avoid Reactionary Trades: Never make investment decisions based solely on one whale alert. It is one piece of a much larger puzzle. Staying informed through reliable trackers helps you understand the undercurrents shaping crypto markets. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The $388 million USDT transfer from OKX is a powerful reminder of the scale and transparency inherent in blockchain technology. While the ‘unknown wallet’ adds mystery, the transaction itself is a public testament to the movement of digital value. For savvy observers, it underscores the importance of monitoring whale activity as a barometer for deeper market trends, while also highlighting the robust, settlement-final nature of blockchain transactions. In the dynamic world of crypto, such events are not just news—they are live data points in the ongoing story of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in crypto? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ is a cryptocurrency address not publicly linked to a major exchange, custodian service, or known entity. It is typically a private, user-controlled wallet, making the owner’s identity anonymous. Q2: Does a large USDT transfer affect its price or peg? A: No, transferring USDT between wallets does not directly impact its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. The peg is managed by Tether’s reserve policies. The transfer only changes who holds the tokens on the blockchain. Q3: Why use USDT for such a large transaction? A: USDT is the most liquid and widely used stablecoin. Its value stability makes it ideal for moving large sums equivalent to fiat currency without the price volatility associated with assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum during the transfer window. Q4: How can I track transactions like this myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Tronscan or Etherscan for on-chain data, or follow social media accounts of tracking bots like Whale Alert, which automatically post large transactions. Q5: Is a transfer off an exchange typically bullish or bearish? A: It can be interpreted both ways. Moving to cold storage (a private wallet) can signal long-term holding (bullish). However, it could also be a step before converting to another asset or fiat. The subsequent destination of the funds provides more clarity. Q6: What network was this USDT transfer on? A: The alert from Whale Alert would specify if it was on the Tron (TRC-20) or Ethereum (ERC-20) network. Most large-scale USDT transfers use the Tron network due to significantly lower transaction fees.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $92,922.73. This move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting urgent questions about the stability of the recent rally and the factors driving this correction. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. However, understanding the triggers is crucial for informed decision-making. The drop below $93,000 appears linked to a combination of technical and macroeconomic pressures. Firstly, the $93,000 level had acted as a strong support zone; breaking through it triggered automated sell orders from leveraged traders. Secondly, broader market sentiment has been cautious due to recent statements from regulatory bodies and shifting expectations around interest rates. Is This a Major Correction or a Minor Dip? Context is everything when analyzing price movements. To gauge the severity, let’s look at key metrics: Percentage Drop: The decline from recent highs represents a single-digit percentage correction, which is relatively modest by crypto volatility standards. Trading Volume: Monitoring whether selling volume is rising or falling can indicate if the move is losing momentum. On-Chain Data: The behavior of long-term holders (HODLers) versus short-term speculators provides clues about underlying conviction. Therefore, while the Bitcoin price action is concerning, it does not yet signal a long-term trend reversal without further confirmation. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Volatility is the price of admission in the cryptocurrency market. For investors, these moments test strategy and emotional discipline. A reactive sell-off often locks in losses, while a calm assessment of fundamentals can reveal opportunities. The current Bitcoin price dip may represent a better entry point for those with a long-term view, assuming their risk tolerance and research support it. However, it also underscores the importance of never investing more than one can afford to lose and considering dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. What’s the Outlook for Bitcoin Now? The immediate future hinges on whether Bitcoin can reclaim the $93,000 level as support. If it fails, the next significant support zones become critical. Conversely, a swift recovery above this level would bolster bullish sentiment. Beyond technicals, the fundamental narrative for Bitcoin—as digital gold and a hedge against monetary inflation—remains unchanged for its proponents. Market participants will now watch for: Institutional buying activity at lower prices. Developments in Bitcoin ETF flows. Broader stock market correlation. The path of the Bitcoin price will likely be determined by which group asserts control: fearful sellers or confident accumulators. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Markets Today’s Bitcoin price movement below $93,000 is a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. While short-term price action can be unnerving, successful investing often requires looking beyond daily charts. The core technological value proposition of Bitcoin does not evaporate with a price dip. For disciplined investors, such periods of fear can create the very opportunities that are absent during times of greed. The key is to have a plan, stick to it, and ensure your portfolio is structured to withstand inevitable turbulence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $93,000? The drop was likely caused by a mix of technical selling after breaking a key support level and cautious broader market sentiment influenced by macroeconomic factors. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon, not solely on short-term price movements. Panic selling often leads to realized losses. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price floors is impossible. Analysts watch lower support levels, but the market’s direction will depend on buying and selling pressure in the coming days. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For some investors, a lower price may represent a buying opportunity, a strategy known as “buying the dip.” However, this carries risk, and it’s essential to conduct your own research (DYOR). Does this price drop affect Bitcoin’s long-term potential? Short-term volatility is typical and does not inherently change the long-term fundamental arguments for or against Bitcoin’s adoption and value. Where can I track the Bitcoin price reliably? Use reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators or major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase for real-time prices. Always cross-reference data from multiple sources. Found this analysis helpful?

Traders who once scanned polling averages and pundit columns increasingly check market odds first, because order flow reacts within minutes to new information and compresses competing narratives into a single number that moves with conviction. Media desks and professional bettors have folded these indicators into their workflow precisely because liquidity concentrates attention, while order books reveal when conviction is thin. Prices that shift before poll releases or commentary give forewarning that sentiment has just turned, and the speed advantage often appears during weekends, holidays, or late nights when traditional coverage slows. Prediction Market Liquidity and Signal Quality Liquidity and fee structures shape how useful these markets can be, because tighter spreads and deeper books reduce noise and let prices carry more information. Where order books fill quickly, small traders cannot shove prices around with shallow size, and that dynamic improves the odds that an observed move is a genuine shift rather than an echo of thin volume. Calibration against final outcomes remains the test that matters, so traders track how often pre-event odds sat near the realized probability. Misses still occur and sometimes cluster during polling errors, yet the markets tend to pull back toward neutrality faster once contradictory evidence appears, since stale views cost money when the other side steps in. The platforms that standardize wording, enforce clear resolution sources, and police ambiguous markets give participants more confidence that the edge will not evaporate at settlement. Regulation, Media Adoption, and the Next Test Policy treatment determines how far these markets can scale in the United States , and rulemaking over event contracts now sits at the center of that path. Against all odds. Polymarket’s U.S app is now being rolled out to those on the waitlist. We’re launching with sports — followed by markets on everything. pic.twitter.com/WOoVMszrqc — Polymarket (@Polymarket) December 3, 2025 Clearer distinctions between illegal gambling and permissible information markets would channel demand into supervised venues, enable stronger surveillance, and support broader participation without forcing activity offshore. Newsrooms and research shops now publish charts that track market odds alongside polling, because readers want to see what money thinks at the very moment a headline breaks. That feedback loop can turn prices into part of the story, yet it also raises the bar for verification, since a fast price move still needs context on who is trading, how much size hit the book, and whether liquidity conditions magnified the jump. Crypto rails changed the mechanics by removing banking friction for small stakes, enabling near-instant deposits, and keeping markets open through the night, which means odds now update during periods when legacy venues sit idle. The next test arrives during policy-heavy weeks when central-bank decisions, court rulings, or election filings hit in quick succession, because stacked catalysts expose whether markets digest information or simply amplify noise. If depth holds, spreads stay tight, and prices step rather than lurch, the signal strengthens, and more desks will treat these odds not as a sideshow but as a baseline input that earns a permanent slot on the dashboard.

Keith Self accused House leaders of breaking a promise to include anti-CBDC language in the NDAA,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-rep-self-criticizes-ndaa-deal-after-cbdc-clause-removed/,"CBDCs took the center stage in the United States House of Representatives. An essential fight broke out over digital currency policy after Rep. Keith Self (R-TX) accused House leadership of breaking a promise. They were supposed to include anti-CBDC language in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Rep. Self had filed an amendment titled “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State.” In an X post, he informed that his proposal will not advance and will not come to the House floor for a vote. The reported adjustment would have blocked the Federal Reserve from testing or issuing a CBDC. However, this also would have prohibited any Fed-backed digital asset “under any other name or label.” Self further wrote that Conservatives were assured this language would be included. “Instead, we’ve been handed a take-it-or-leave-it bill that breaks that promise. Without it, I’m inclined to leave it.” The amendment also included explicit protections for “open, permissionless and private” dollar-denominated systems. It can be a nod to crypto-friendly Republicans who argue CBDCs threaten financial freedom. Congress drops CBDC ban The NDAA is a 3,086-page package that authorizes next year’s defense budget. It has already run into backlash from hard-liners over Ukraine funding and other omissions. Meanwhile, the absence of a CBDC prohibition has become an unexpected flashpoint in the party’s internal debate over digital money and surveillance. Earlier, Self, in an interview, stated that leadership had indicated Rep. Tom Emmer’s anti-CBDC measure would be part of the final bill. After reviewing the text, he confirmed it wasn’t there. Other Republicans have echoed the criticism. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she supports crypto but “will not support any system that lets the government cut off Americans from their own money.” In an X post , she mentioned that back in July, she voted NO on the GENIUS Act because it contained a back door to a CBDC. Greene added that at that time, Johnson promised conservatives that he would put Tom Emmer’s bill, which closed the loophole. Rep. Warren Davidson warned that “CBDC inserts the government between you and your money.” He added that President Trump’s executive order banning federal agencies from pursuing a CBDC “is great, but we need and were promised a law.” In a fresh post, Davidson stated that Congress just reneged on the promise to ban Central Bank Digital Currency. In the meantime, the central banks are building it. He emphasised the need to ban CBDC. The Trump administration has moved quickly to reverse the Biden-era Fed’s limited CBDC research. However, one of Trump’s first crypto-related executive orders in January banned federal agencies from developing or promoting a CBDC. It cited risks to privacy, sovereignty, and financial stability. This all comes in when the global crypto market is in the middle of a recovery run after witnessing high sell-offs. The cumulative crypto market cap dipped by almost 2% in the last 24 hours to stand at $3.16 trillion. Bitcoin price dropped by 12% in the last 30 days.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is now trading at $91,995.67. This unexpected drop has sent ripples through the trading community, prompting urgent questions about the stability of the recent rally and the factors driving this volatility. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market analysts are pointing to a confluence of factors behind this sharp correction. Firstly, a wave of profit-taking likely hit the market after a sustained period of gains. When the Bitcoin price approaches significant psychological thresholds, traders often sell to lock in profits, creating downward pressure. Secondly, broader macroeconomic uncertainty, including shifting expectations around interest rates, can make investors more risk-averse, leading them to pull capital from volatile assets like cryptocurrency. Furthermore, on-chain data often reveals clues. A sudden increase in Bitcoin moving to exchanges can signal an intent to sell, while large sell orders on derivative platforms can trigger cascading liquidations. Therefore, this move below $92,000 isn’t an isolated event but a reaction to several market forces aligning. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For investors, the key question is how to interpret this Bitcoin price action. Volatility is a fundamental characteristic of crypto markets. Corrections of 10-20% are not uncommon, even within strong bullish trends. This dip could represent a healthy reset, shaking out over-leveraged positions and establishing a stronger foundation for the next leg up. However, it’s crucial to assess the context. Consider these points: Support Levels: Watch if the Bitcoin price finds support around $90,000 or $88,000. Holding these levels could indicate underlying strength. Trading Volume: Is the sell-off accompanied by high volume? High-volume drops can signify stronger conviction from sellers. Market Sentiment: Has the overall narrative shifted from greed to fear? Extreme fear can sometimes signal a contrarian buying opportunity. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Volatility Reacting emotionally to price swings is a common pitfall. Instead, a disciplined strategy is essential. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals—remains one of the most effective ways to build a position regardless of short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations. It removes the stress of trying to time the perfect entry point. Moreover, ensure your risk management is robust. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your capital from unexpected downturns. Diversification across different asset classes can also cushion your portfolio against crypto-specific volatility. Conclusion: Looking Beyond the Immediate Bitcoin Price Dip While the break below $92,000 is headline-worthy, savvy investors look at the bigger picture. The long-term adoption drivers for Bitcoin—such as its fixed supply, institutional acceptance, and potential as a digital store of value—remain unchanged by a single day’s price action. Short-term volatility often obscures these enduring trends. Therefore, focus on fundamentals, maintain a long-term perspective, and use strategic tools like DCA to navigate these inevitable market swings with confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How low could the Bitcoin price go after breaking $92,000? A: It’s impossible to predict precisely. Traders watch key support levels like $90,000 and $88,000. A break below these could see a test of lower supports, but a rebound is equally possible if buying pressure returns. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This depends on your investment goals and risk tolerance. Panic selling often locks in losses. Consider your original thesis for holding Bitcoin and whether the fundamental reasons have changed before making a decision. Q: Does this price drop mean the bull market is over? A> Not necessarily. Bull markets are typically punctuated by sharp corrections. This could be a healthy pullback that strengthens the market long-term by removing excess leverage. Q: What is the best strategy during high Bitcoin price volatility? A> Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is highly recommended. It involves investing a fixed amount regularly, which averages your purchase price over time and reduces the impact of volatility. Q: Where can I reliably track the live Bitcoin price? A> Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Binance, and Coinbase provide real-time price data and charts. Q: Are other cryptocurrencies affected when Bitcoin’s price falls? A> Yes, typically. Bitcoin is the market leader, and its price action often sets the tone for the broader crypto market, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Most altcoins tend to follow BTC’s trend.

This isn’t just another transaction—it’s a significant event that signals potential shifts in the digital asset landscape. But what does this massive mint actually mean for you as an investor or crypto enthusiast? What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC minted , we’re talking about creating new USDC stablecoin tokens. Unlike Bitcoin mining, minting stablecoins involves depositing equivalent U.S. dollars with regulated financial institutions. For every USDC token created, there should be one real dollar held in reserve. This process happens through the USDC Treasury, which acts as the central hub for creating and redeeming these stablecoins. The recent event where 250 million USDC was minted represents one of the larger single transactions we’ve seen recently, indicating substantial institutional or whale activity. Why Would Anyone Mint 250 Million USDC? You might wonder why someone would create such a massive amount of stablecoin. Several practical reasons drive this kind of activity: Institutional investment preparation: Large investors often mint USDC before making major crypto purchases Market making liquidity: Exchanges and trading firms need substantial stablecoin reserves DeFi protocol funding: Decentralized finance platforms require stablecoin liquidity pools Risk management: Traders might move into stablecoins during market uncertainty The timing of when USDC is minted can reveal market sentiment. Large mints often precede significant market movements, making them valuable indicators for observant traders. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? When 250 million USDC gets minted , it creates ripple effects throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This substantial injection of stablecoin liquidity can influence several market aspects. First, it increases the available capital for trading and investment across various crypto assets. Moreover, such large-scale minting events often signal institutional confidence in the crypto space. Financial institutions don’t typically move hundreds of millions without thorough analysis and strategic planning. Therefore, this USDC minted event suggests professional investors see opportunities worth pursuing. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For Next? After observing that 250 million USDC was minted , savvy investors should monitor several key indicators. Watch for where this capital gets deployed—whether it flows into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Track exchange inflows and DeFi protocol deposits to identify the destination of these funds. Additionally, consider these actionable insights: Monitor whale wallets: Large holders often telegraph their next moves through transaction patterns Watch exchange order books: Sudden large buy orders might indicate deployment of minted USDC Check DeFi statistics: Increased stablecoin deposits in lending protocols signal lending activity Follow institutional announcements: Companies often announce major crypto moves after preparing liquidity Remember that while USDC minted events provide valuable signals, they’re just one piece of the market puzzle. Always combine this information with broader market analysis before making investment decisions. The Bottom Line: Decoding the 250 Million USDC Mint The recent event where 250 million USDC was minted serves as a powerful market signal rather than just a routine transaction. This substantial creation of stablecoin liquidity indicates prepared capital waiting for deployment opportunities. For retail investors, it represents both a warning and an opportunity—a reminder that large players are active, and a hint that significant market movements may follow. Successful crypto investing requires understanding these institutional moves. When you see USDC minted on this scale, pay attention. The whales are moving, and their actions often create waves that smaller investors can ride to success. Frequently Asked Questions What does “minting USDC” actually mean? Minting USDC means creating new USDC stablecoin tokens. This process requires depositing equivalent U.S. dollars with regulated financial institutions that partner with Circle, the company behind USDC. For every new USDC token created, one dollar should be held in reserve. Who typically mints large amounts of USDC? Large USDC mints usually come from institutional investors, cryptocurrency exchanges, market makers, and major trading firms. These entities need substantial stablecoin liquidity for their operations, including trading, lending, and providing market depth. Does minting USDC affect its price stability? Properly executed USDC minting should not affect its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. The minting process is designed to maintain price stability by ensuring adequate dollar reserves for all circulating tokens. However, market demand and supply dynamics can create temporary minor deviations. How can I track USDC minting events? You can track USDC minting through blockchain explorers like Etherscan, or use monitoring services like Whale Alert that report large transactions. Many cryptocurrency news platforms also report significant minting events when they occur. What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? Minting creates new USDC tokens by depositing dollars with authorized institutions. Buying USDC involves purchasing existing tokens from exchanges or other holders. Minting increases the total supply, while buying simply transfers ownership of existing tokens. Should I be concerned about large USDC mints? Large USDC mints are normal market activities and not inherently concerning. They indicate liquidity preparation and institutional participation. However, you should always verify that proper reserves back these mints and monitor how the minted funds get deployed in the market. Found this analysis helpful?

This single transaction, worth a quarter of a billion dollars, is more than just a number on a screen—it’s a powerful signal from the heart of the stablecoin ecosystem. But what does it truly mean when such a vast amount of digital dollars is created out of thin air? Let’s dive into the implications of this major event. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s simplify the process. When we say USDC is minted , it means new USDC tokens are created and released into circulation. Circle, the company behind USDC, does this when a user deposits an equivalent amount of US dollars. For every 250 million USDC minted, $250 million in real-world cash is theoretically held in reserve. This process ensures the stablecoin maintains its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. Therefore, a mint of this scale typically indicates significant incoming capital or preparation for major market activity. Why Would Anyone Mint 250 Million USDC? A transaction this large is rarely random. It points to calculated moves by institutional players or large investors, often called “whales.” Here are the most likely reasons behind such a substantial mint: Institutional Demand: A large corporation or financial institution may be moving capital on-chain to facilitate payments, treasury management, or to enter the crypto markets. Exchange Liquidity: Centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance often mint large batches of USDC to ensure sufficient liquidity for expected high trading volumes, preventing slippage for users. DeFi Preparation: The capital could be earmarked for deployment into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to earn yield through lending, liquidity providing, or other strategies. Market Sentiment Indicator: Large mints can signal that big players are positioning themselves in stablecoins, possibly expecting volatility or seeking a safe harbor before making a future move into assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. The Ripple Effect: How a USDC Mint Impacts the Market So, what happens after 250 million USDC is minted ? The effects ripple through the ecosystem. Primarily, it increases the total supply of available stablecoin liquidity. This can have a calming effect on markets, as it provides more “dry powder” for trading. However, it also concentrates significant power. The entity controlling these funds can influence prices by making large buy or sell orders. For everyday investors, monitoring these mints offers a glimpse into the strategies of the market’s most influential participants. Is This a Bullish or Bearish Signal for Crypto? This is the million-dollar question—or in this case, the 250-million-dollar question. The mint itself is neutral; it’s simply capital entering the crypto sphere. The intent behind it defines the signal. If the USDC is minted to be immediately swapped for Bitcoin or Ethereum, it’s a bullish sign of buying pressure. If it sits idle in a wallet, it might indicate a cautious wait-and-see approach. Therefore, context from on-chain analysts tracking the fund’s movement after the mint is crucial to determine the true market sentiment. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors You don’t need to be a whale to learn from their moves. Here’s how you can use this information: Watch the Flow: Use tools like Etherscan to see where the newly minted USDC travels. Is it sent to an exchange? A DeFi protocol? Context is Key: Correlate the mint with broader market news. Is there a major ETF decision or macroeconomic announcement pending? Don’t FOMO: A large mint is not a direct buy signal. It’s one data point in a complex puzzle. Always conduct your own research and never invest based on a single transaction. In conclusion, the event of 250 million USDC minted is a monumental occurrence that underscores the growing scale and institutional depth of the cryptocurrency market. It acts as a transparent ledger of high-stakes capital movement, offering a unique window into the strategies that shape market dynamics. While not a crystal ball, understanding these events empowers you to be a more informed and strategic participant in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who has the authority to mint USDC? A1: Only Circle, through its USDC Treasury, can officially mint and burn USDC tokens. They do so based on verified dollar deposits from authorized partners and institutions. Q2: Does minting USDC create new money? A2: No, it does not create new fiat money. For every USDC minted, an equivalent US dollar should be held in reserve by Circle’s regulated financial partners, making it a fully-backed digital representation of existing money. Q3: How can I track large mints like this myself? A3: You can follow blockchain tracking bots like Whale Alert on social media (X/Twitter) or use blockchain explorers like Etherscan to monitor the USDC Treasury contract address for large transactions. Q4: What is the difference between minting and buying USDC? A4: Minting is the primary creation of new tokens by the issuer. Buying is the secondary acquisition of already-existing tokens from an exchange or another user. The 250 million USDC minted refers to the creation of new supply. Q5: Can a large USDC mint affect its price stability? A5: Typically, no. The minting and redemption mechanism is designed to keep USDC at $1.00. A large mint, if backed by proper reserves, should not impact the peg. However, market panic or reserve concerns could cause temporary de-pegging. Q6: Is this the largest USDC mint ever recorded? A6: While 250 million USDC is a significant sum, even larger mints (e.g., 500 million or 1 billion USDC) have occurred, especially during periods of peak market activity or institutional onboarding.

However, their latest earnings report reveals a sobering reality: a $9 million unrealized loss on their cryptocurrency holdings. This development raises crucial questions about corporate Bitcoin investments and their impact on traditional businesses. Let’s unpack what happened and why it matters for both crypto enthusiasts and investors. What Exactly Happened With GameStop’s Bitcoin Investment? GameStop’s third-quarter earnings report delivered surprising news about their cryptocurrency strategy. The video game retailer disclosed holding 4,710 Bitcoin while simultaneously reporting a $9 million unrealized loss on these digital assets. This GameStop Bitcoin loss occurred during a period of market volatility, highlighting the risks companies face when venturing into cryptocurrency investments. The company’s overall financial performance also disappointed investors. GameStop reported revenue of $821 million for the quarter, significantly below the consensus estimate of $980 million. Following the earnings announcement, the company’s stock price dropped by more than 4%, reflecting investor concerns about both traditional business performance and cryptocurrency exposure. Why Did GameStop Invest in Bitcoin Anyway? GameStop’s move into Bitcoin represents a growing trend among traditional companies seeking diversification and exposure to digital assets. Several factors likely influenced their decision: Diversification strategy : Companies often use Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional market fluctuations Future-proofing : Embracing emerging technologies and payment methods Brand positioning : Aligning with tech-savvy consumers and investors Potential returns : Historical Bitcoin performance attracted many institutional investors However, the recent GameStop Bitcoin loss demonstrates that cryptocurrency investments carry substantial volatility risks. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin’s price can swing dramatically within short periods, creating challenges for corporate treasury management. How Does This Impact Corporate Crypto Adoption? GameStop’s experience provides valuable lessons for other companies considering cryptocurrency investments. The $9 million GameStop Bitcoin loss serves as a cautionary tale about timing and risk management in digital asset investments. Key considerations for corporate investors include: Volatility management : Developing strategies to handle price fluctuations Accounting practices : Properly reporting unrealized gains and losses Investment timing : Strategic entry and exit points in volatile markets Shareholder communication : Transparent reporting of cryptocurrency exposure Despite the current loss, many experts believe corporate Bitcoin adoption will continue growing. However, companies may approach investments more cautiously following GameStop’s experience. What Can Investors Learn From This Situation? The GameStop Bitcoin loss offers several important insights for individual and institutional investors. First, it highlights the importance of understanding a company’s complete investment portfolio, including cryptocurrency holdings. Second, it demonstrates how digital asset volatility can impact traditional stock performance. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating companies with cryptocurrency exposure: Percentage of assets : How much of the company’s portfolio is in crypto Investment strategy : Long-term holding versus active trading approach Risk management : Protocols for handling market downturns Transparency : Quality and frequency of cryptocurrency reporting The Bigger Picture: Crypto in Traditional Business GameStop’s situation reflects broader trends in corporate cryptocurrency adoption. While the GameStop Bitcoin loss appears significant, it represents just one quarter in what many see as a long-term investment strategy. Other companies have experienced similar volatility while maintaining their commitment to digital assets. The key question becomes: Is this a temporary setback or a fundamental challenge to corporate crypto investment? Most analysts suggest it’s the former. Cryptocurrency markets naturally experience cycles, and short-term losses don’t necessarily invalidate long-term strategies. However, companies must develop robust frameworks for managing these inevitable fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin does GameStop currently own? GameStop holds 4,710 Bitcoin according to their Q3 2024 earnings report. The company has maintained this position despite the recent unrealized loss. What does ‘unrealized loss’ mean in cryptocurrency? An unrealized loss occurs when an asset’s current market value falls below its purchase price, but the asset hasn’t been sold. This represents a paper loss rather than an actual cash loss unless the position is closed. Will GameStop sell its Bitcoin holdings? GameStop hasn’t announced plans to sell its Bitcoin. The company appears to be treating it as a long-term investment despite current market conditions. How does Bitcoin volatility affect stock prices? Significant cryptocurrency losses can impact investor confidence and stock prices, as seen with GameStop’s 4% decline post-earnings. However, the effect varies based on the proportion of crypto holdings to overall assets. Are other companies experiencing similar Bitcoin losses? Yes, several companies with Bitcoin holdings have reported unrealized losses during market downturns. This is a common occurrence in volatile cryptocurrency markets. Should investors avoid companies with Bitcoin exposure? Not necessarily. Bitcoin exposure represents both risk and potential reward. Investors should evaluate each company’s overall strategy, risk management, and the proportion of crypto in their portfolio. Join the Conversation GameStop’s cryptocurrency journey highlights the complex relationship between traditional business and digital assets. What’s your take on corporate Bitcoin investments?

Fiscal second-quarter cloud sales climbed 34 percent to $7.98 billion, but the figure missed analyst forecasts. The slower payoff timing now sits at the center of market debate. This report marked the first major cloud test for the new leadership team running the company after a high-profile executive shift. Revenue from the infrastructure unit jumped 68 percent to $4.08 billion in the same period, yet that number also came in just under projections. Oracle said the remaining performance obligation reached $523 billion for the quarter that ended November 30. Analysts on the Wall Street trading floor had expected about $519 billion, showing demand stayed strong even as near-term revenue lagged today. Oracle’s bookings figure showed future work piling up, but the timing of when that money hits income remains uncertain. Investors question spending as data center build speeds up Oracle built its cloud push on its old database base and then chased bigger names in modern computing. The current expansion is tied tightly to a large data center build meant to support AI workloads for OpenAI . Major platform clients also include TikTok under ByteDance and Meta Platforms. These customers help explain the surge in infrastructure demand even as questions grow about the cost of keeping those sites running nonstop. Spending pressure showed up clearly in the quarter. Capital expenditures reached about $13 billion, up from $8.5 billion in the prior period. Back in September, the company projected full-year capital spending of $35 billion. Analysts had modeled only $8.25 billion for the latest quarter, which widened the gap between expectations and what was actually spent. The higher outlay reflects land, power, hardware, and network commitments tied to multiple new locations leased to expand computing capacity. These sites are meant to meet AI demand that has not yet fully turned into recognized sales on books. CEO Clay Magouyrk said , “Oracle is good at building and running high-performance and cost-efficient cloud data centers,” adding that automation lets more sites be built and operated at scale. The stock dropped five percent in extended trading after closing at $223.27 in New York. Shares are down about one-third since September 10, when excitement around the cloud unit pushed the company to a record high. This report was also the first since Safra Catz handed the chief executive role to Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia.

Dogecoin finds itself in a very interesting accumulation pattern despite its overall bearish trend. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to attract smart money investments with its fast-moving presale. Investors considering crypto to invest in and those trying to determine which cryptocurrency to buy have increasingly begun to focus on strategic investments. Now, both of these assets are right in the middle of this debate. Increasing whale action for Dogecoin and increasing investor engagement for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are pushing focus towards opportunities that may help form 2026 investments. Dogecoin Accumulation Momentum Contained By Market Conditions Dogecoin has been trying to establish a stabilization zone around $0.148 following a fresh withdrawal, though its current price remains below major moving averages which have tested bulls for several weeks. The 20-day EMA remains a strong barrier to any potential upside momentum. Despite this negative technical factor, a strong divergence has been observed via on-chain analysis. A total of 480 million DOGE was accumulated in the last 48 hours among big wallets with balances exceeding 1 million DOGE. Market observers regard this as a possible last squeeze before any firm turnaround may occur, although ongoing resistance posed by key EMAs remains a downturn catalyst. While weighing what cryptocurrency to buy now, a strong combination of intrinsic value and whale investor confidence has made DOGE a somewhat underrated asset in comparison with fast-growing new cryptos. MUTM’s Superb Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to move forward with a smooth presale process, increasing its strength among those considering the best cryptocurrency to invest in before the end of the year. The current 98% filled level for Phase 6 stands out as one of the most prominent presale talking points with a price of $0.035. This represents a 250% increase in price from where it stood in Phase 1 with a price of $0.01. A total of $19,250,000 has been raised. There are 18,400 holders. Phase 6 is filling up very quickly, which means that the time for claiming the tokens with this price level soon expires. After this stage closes, a new stage 7 will open for $0.04. This marks a nearly 20% increase prior to reaching a $0.06 launch price. Buyers who are getting in right now are looking at at least 500% profits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rolled out a new dashboard featuring the largest 50 holders, pulling in more attention from newcomers who want transparency regarding the distribution of buyers. This comes alongside other developments in testnet preparation. Buy & Distribute Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a mechanism called ‘Buy & Distribute,’ which boosts engagement with token participation. A portion of the fees accrued in the protocol is used to ‘Buy & Distribute’ more MUTM. This leads to a cycle where using the protocol leads directly to further demand for its token. This design ensures continued interaction with this system because when more activity occurs within the lending space, more token redistribution takes place. As the V1 testnet gets closer, this particular design feature should be apparent among other elements driving the economics of this protocol. Halborn Security is evaluating contracts for this lending system while submitting code for formal audits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also encouraged community engagement using its 24-hour leaderboard. This means that the daily leader in buying is rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus as long as a single transaction occurs in a cycle. This cycle resets daily at 00:00 UTC. This has ensured a constant level of presale engagement as potential investors compare and search for the best cryptocurrency to invest in during phase 6. Why Investors Are Choosing MUTM Dogecoin remains a target for accumulation purchases, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a more clearly refined entry point with well-established use cases and a better-defined price. Those considering crypto investments today will be wise to take a quick look at MUTM before finishing out the rest of phase 6.

Yet despite this breakout, overall sentiment remains clouded by fear, with many analysts still warning that the broader structure points toward a developing bear market. Traders now find themselves at a pivotal juncture: is this the beginning of a sustained recovery, or merely a temporary rally before further downside? Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Lowest Levels on Record: The Bullish Signal Most Traders Are Missing According to a new CryptoQuant report, one of the most revealing indicators right now is Ethereum’s funding rate behavior across major exchanges. Unlike the explosive funding spikes seen during the two major rallies earlier this year, the current move shows a remarkably restrained funding environment. During those earlier surges, funding rates climbed aggressively into overheated territory, signaling euphoric long leverage and speculative excess — conditions that closely preceded short-term market tops. This time, however, funding remains far more subdued. The absence of aggressive long positioning suggests that the current rally is not being driven by excessive leverage, which gives the move a different character compared to earlier spikes. Whether this signals healthier accumulation or simply a lack of conviction remains the core question as Ethereum approaches the next decisive phase. Muted Funding Rates Highlight a Cautious But Potentially Constructive Rally The CryptoQuant report highlights that, unlike previous explosive rallies, Ethereum’s current funding rates remain unusually low, even after its sharp recovery from the $2.8K region. This subdued funding environment signals that the derivatives market is not yet saturated with speculative long positions. Buyers are stepping in, but modest leverage drives this move compared to past phases dominated by aggressive traders. Consequently, spot accumulation drives the current advance more than overheated futures activity. This difference carries important implications. Without a surge in speculative demand, Ethereum may struggle to ignite the kind of full bullish continuation leg seen in earlier breakout cycles. Historically, strong uptrends have required funding rates to expand meaningfully as traders chase price, forcing shorts to cover and fueling upward momentum. That behavior has not yet emerged in the current structure. However, this muted landscape is not inherently bearish. Instead, it reflects a recovering market, not an overextended one. This leaves Ethereum with room to climb further — if demand strengthens. At the same time, the lack of leverage means the rally remains vulnerable; strong resistance rejections could quickly weaken momentum unless fresh buyers step in.

Testing Key Resistance as Momentum Builds Ethereum’s daily chart shows a notable shift in momentum as the price pushes toward $3,320, extending its rebound from the sub-$2,800 lows. This recovery phase has been steady rather than explosive, reflecting a market that is stabilizing but still facing key overhead challenges. The first major test is the 200-day moving average (red line), which ETH is now approaching after several weeks of trading below it. Historically, reclaiming this level has marked the transition from corrective phases into renewed bullish cycles, but a clean breakout is far from guaranteed. Related Reading: Smart Whales Align: Top Performers Go All-In On Ethereum Long Positions With Over $425M in Exposure The structure of the recent move highlights improving buyer confidence: ETH has formed a series of higher lows, indicating accumulation after the capitulation-like November drop. Although buyers are active, the relatively subdued volume profile suggests they lack broad-based conviction. A stronger influx of volume must flip the trend decisively bullish. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages remain above the current price and are both aligned downward, reinforcing that ETH is still technically in a broader downtrend. For momentum to extend, Ethereum must break above the $3,350–$3,400 resistance zone, where prior support turned into resistance.
