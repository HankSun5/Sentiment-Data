According to a report from Politico, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a key negotiator for the Republican side, expressed optimism that a new draft of the bill could be released this week. Lummis aims to have the bill ready for markup before Congress adjourns for the holiday break, stating, “Knock on wood, I hope to share a draft at the end of this week that reflects our best efforts to date.” Lummis Urges Swift Progress On Crypto Legislation During a panel discussion hosted by the Blockchain Association, Sen. Lummis emphasized the urgency of progressing with the legislation. She remarked that it might be advantageous for lawmakers to finalize a product and proceed with the markup next week, allowing everyone to take a break for the Christmas holidays. In related developments, Politico reported that Senate Banking Republicans submitted a proposal to their Democratic counterparts last week, suggesting over 30 amendments to a previous draft of the legislation.

Predictions Point To A $150,000 Rally In 2026 The three-page document, which comes from GOP senators on the Banking Committee, seeks to maintain certain elements of the original bill while incorporating adjustments acceptable to Democratic lawmakers. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and other Republicans are eager to finalize the markup next week, although some Democrats have expressed skepticism about this ambitious timeline. Following a meeting on Monday, Democrats sent a response to the GOP offer, but details of their feedback remain unclear. Concessions In GOP’s Proposal The GOP’s proposal outlines the aspects from a September crypto market structure framework that they agree to integrate into a bipartisan bill, hoping to reconcile differences with their Democratic colleagues. The proposal includes a two-column table delineating 38 concessions the Republicans are willing to make, in exchange for retaining or modifying 32 sections of the original Responsible Financial Innovation Act discussion draft.

Additionally, the proposal contains ethics provisions aimed at addressing scrutiny over the Trump family’s business connections in the crypto sector. However, Lummis noted a previous ethics proposal she negotiated with Sen. Ruben Gallego was rejected by the White House, and she plans to collaborate further with Democrats to revisit the issue. Other notable concessions from the Republicans include a section on consumer protection standards for digital assets, proposed language regarding bankruptcy, the establishment of a federal baseline for crypto ATMs, and risk management standards for digital asset intermediaries.

Saylor generated a buzz with his comments during his keynote at the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on December 8, 2025. Saylor’s tour across the Middle East puts the Bitcoin proponent in direct contact with large investors from wealthy petrodollar countries. Strategy’s stock is far from its historical highs as BTC slowly fights back from a collapse in BTC price to the $80,000 range. What did Saylor say at Bitcoin MENA? According to him, BTC is not just a simple investment, but should be regarded as the foundation for a new era of “digital capital” and yield-generating financial products. During his keynote in Abu Dhabi, he talked about Strategy and its accumulation strategy. He described the market as a “$200 trillion opportunity,” referring to the potential scale of global credit markets that could be unlocked via Bitcoin-backed banking, custody, and lending. He likened BTC to “digital gold,” acknowledging its current valuation level and highlighting bullish projections expected in 4 to 8 years, implying that if the Middle East moved now, it could become a global hub for BTC innovation. And that’s how the region could attract “trillions” in foreign capital seeking yield. The wealth funds in these areas collectively manage trillions in assets, much of which comes from oil revenues, and are traditionally invested in assets like U.S. Treasuries, real estate, and equities. However, Saylor wants them to pivot toward BTC to future-proof their economies amid the declining petrodollar system. “All the money will come to you,” he said. Critical MSCI decision looms for Strategy The firm is now navigating the most complex period in its storied history as a corporate Bitcoin treasury. In the past, the Tysons Corner-based firm operated with a distinct advantage that allowed its equity to trade at a significant premium to the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium was the engine of the company’s capital strategy and helped management raise billions in equity and convertible debt to acquire Bitcoin, effectively engaging in regulatory arbitrage that benefited mainly from the lack of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US market. While naysayers like Peter Schiff delight have rolled out the drums as Strategy fell on hard times recently, Saylor made a big statement with the firm’s latest BTC purchase of almost $1 billion on Monday, as Cryptopolitan reported . While the vanishing premium has stalled the company’s growth engine, the looming decision by MSCI Inc. has become a more immediate structural threat. The index provider is currently conducting a consultation on the classification of digital asset treasury (DAT) companies. A decision is expected on January 15, 2026, after the review period ending December 31. Should Strategy be reclassified as a DAT , it could be pushed out of flagship equity benchmarks, potentially triggering forced selling of between $2.8 billion and $8.8 billion by passive funds.

The answer carries immense weight, determining which regulator oversees a project and what rules it must follow. In a revealing interview, former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Paul Atkins provided crucial clarity, stating that a significant number of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are not securities . This perspective from a seasoned regulator cuts through the noise and offers a more nuanced view of crypto asset classification. What Did the Former SEC Commissioner Actually Say? Paul Atkins, who served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, spoke with Decrypt to share his expert analysis. He argued that many tokens sold during ICOs possess clear non-security characteristics. His core point is that tokens designed for specific utility within a network—like accessing a service, representing digital collectibles, or functioning as tools—should not fall under traditional securities laws. Therefore, he believes a blanket application of SEC rules to all ICOs is incorrect. Why Does It Matter If ICOs Are Not Securities? The distinction between a security and a non-security token is not just legal jargon; it’s the difference between two entirely different regulatory worlds. When the SEC classifies a token as a security, the project faces stringent registration, disclosure, and compliance requirements designed for traditional investments like stocks. This can stifle innovation and burden early-stage projects with immense cost and complexity. Atkins suggests that tokens with genuine utility should instead be overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates commodities like gold and oil. This framework could be more appropriate for digital assets that function as a medium of exchange or a consumable product within an ecosystem, rather than an investment contract. What Types of ICOs Might Avoid Security Classification? Based on Atkins’s comments and existing legal guidance like the Howey Test, several token models may legitimately argue they are not securities. Here are key examples: Utility Tokens: Tokens that grant access to a current or future software service, platform, or network function. The primary purpose is use, not investment. Digital Collectibles (NFTs): Unique tokens representing ownership of a digital or physical asset, such as art, music, or in-game items, where value is derived from scarcity and ownership rights. Payment & Exchange Tokens: Tokens designed primarily to be used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, similar to traditional currency. Governance Tokens: Tokens that provide holders with voting rights on protocol decisions, focusing on ecosystem participation rather than profit expectation from the efforts of others. What Are the Challenges for Crypto Projects? Despite this clarifying perspective, the path forward is not simple. The main challenge is the lack of clear, formal rules from regulators. Projects often operate in a gray area, unsure of how their token will be viewed. This regulatory uncertainty can deter serious developers and legitimate investors. Furthermore, the SEC’s current enforcement-focused approach has created a climate of fear, where the threat of action looms over even well-intentioned projects trying to build functional networks. Actionable Insights for Investors and Builders So, what can you do with this information? For investors, it underscores the importance of deep due diligence. Look beyond the hype and ask: What is this token’s actual utility? Is there a working product, or just a promise? Understanding the difference between a security token offering and a utility token sale is critical for assessing risk and regulatory exposure. For project founders, the message is to design with intention. If your goal is to create a functional network, structure your tokenomics to emphasize utility, access, and consumption from the very start. Document this purpose clearly. Proactive engagement with legal experts who understand the evolving ICOs are not securities argument is no longer optional—it’s essential for longevity. Conclusion: A Step Toward Sensible Crypto Regulation Paul Atkins’s comments are a vital contribution to the debate on crypto regulation. They highlight that a one-size-fits-all approach is ineffective and potentially harmful. Recognizing that many ICOs are not securities is the first step toward creating a regulatory environment that protects investors without crushing innovation. The future of cryptocurrency depends on this kind of nuanced understanding, where utility is distinguished from investment, and rules are fit for purpose. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean no ICOs are securities? A> No. Atkins stated that “many” ICOs are not securities, not “all.” Tokens that represent an investment contract where buyers expect profits primarily from the efforts of others are likely still securities under the Howey Test. Q: What is the Howey Test? A> It’s a legal test derived from a 1946 Supreme Court case used to determine if a transaction qualifies as an “investment contract” and is therefore a security. It examines if there is (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise (3) with an expectation of profits (4) derived from the efforts of others. Q: If a token isn’t a security, who regulates it? A> As Atkins suggested, the CFTC may have jurisdiction if the token is considered a commodity. Other aspects might fall under consumer protection laws, money transmission rules, or, in some cases, no specific financial regulator at all. Q: How can I tell if a token I’m interested in is a utility token or a security? A> Analyze its stated purpose. Is it used to power a network or app right now? Or is the main pitch about its future value and the development team’s work to increase that value? The latter leans toward a security. Q: Will the current SEC change its stance based on this? A> While insightful, this is the opinion of a former official. The current SEC leadership, under Chair Gary Gensler, has generally taken a broader view, suggesting most crypto tokens are securities. However, it adds weight to the ongoing legal and political debate. Join the Conversation Regulatory clarity is essential for the healthy growth of the crypto ecosystem.

Most analysts are expecting the Federal Reserve to cut rates, something which has increased positivity in the crypto market after a difficult couple of months. As for SHIB, it has experienced a 248% increase in its burn rate over the past 24 hours, as chain activity increases. This suggests that a recovery could be on the way, and when combined with some bullish chart patterns, the Shiba Inu price prediction is starting to look very good. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Market Thinks SHIB Is Dead – But This Chart Pattern Says a Monster Move Is Coming Soon As the Shibburn X account revealed today, Shiba Inu has burned 75.7 million SHIB tokens in the past week and 14.3 million SHIB tokens in the past 24 hours. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00000846 (1hr -0.61% ▼ | 24hr 0.42% ▲ ) Market Cap: $4,984,165,047 (0.43% ▲) Total Supply: 589,246,095,654,536 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 14,288,659 (248.18% ▲) Past 7 Days: 75,668,582 (-35.14% ▼) — Shibburn (@shibburn) December 9, 2025 This 24-hour figure is encouraging, indicating a growth in activity as we approach tomorrow’s FOMC rate decision. And if we look at SHIB’s price chart, we see that it may have begun a sustained recovery after weeks in a heavily oversold position. Its relative strength index (yellow) is about to rise above 50, having spent the previous three months below this level almost constantly. Source: TradingView Similarly, its MACD (orange, blue) is also on its way up and could turn positive in the next few days. This could signal a breakout, and if the Fed does provide a rate cut tomorrow, such a breakout could arrive quickly. As far as the longer term is concerned, Shiba Inu does have some things to look forward to, including the possible launch of a multi-crypto ETF from T. Rowe that classes SHIB as an eligible token . Such a launch could drive considerable interest in SHIB, although so far there’s no indication of how much of an allocation the meme coin would receive, if any. Otherwise, Shiba Inu has been having a problem attracting significant investment, with its price down by 71.5% in the past 12 months. Despite attempts to make itself fundamentally stronger and more valuable (e.g., by launching layer-two network Shibarium in 2023), the market seems to have lost interest, with shibariumscan.io recording only 2,635 transactions on Shibarium in the past 24 hours. Hopefully, upcoming upgrades can make layer two more attractive next year, boosting the Shiba Inu price over the longer term. Shibarium aiming for a privacy upgrade in 2026 says something bigger than just SHIB news. It shows where the entire industry is heading: 𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝘀, 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀.

What’s exciting about presale coins is that, if they generate enough momentum during their sales, they can often rally hard when they list for the first time. Accordingly, one of the most interesting presale tokens available right now is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that has raised just over $2.3 million. Upgrading Nodes is like leveling up in life. Suddenly everything feels easier. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/FHs8HwglBs — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 5, 2025 Its sale will end in just under 30 days, giving newcomers only a limited window in which to buy the token at what could end up being a steep discount. It has attracted lots of interest by virtue of its unique slant on mining, with its platform giving users the opportunity to grow and operate virtual mining rigs. Rather than needing expensive – and power-hungry – physical hardware, PEPENODE enables users to mine simply by spending PEPENODE tokens on virtual nodes. By purchasing more nodes and upgrading, users can earn more mining rewards, which PEPENODE will pay out in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. This system could make PEPENODE incredibly profitable and popular, with demand potentially surging for the PEPENODE token. Holders will also be able to stake the token for a regular income, making the coin doubly profitable. Latecomers to the sale can join it by going to the PEPENODE website , but should remember that it will end in 30 days. The token is currently selling for its final presale price of $0.0011873, although this could rise much higher once it goes live in the next few weeks.

Analysts believe this could push the Bitcoin price prediction beyond the current cycle high of $126,000.

Moreover, the Bitcoin hash ribbon indicator has now flashed green, historically signaling favorable entry points for market participants. The hash chart reveals the 30-day moving average of hashrate dropping below the 60-day MA, a pattern indicating miner capitulation that typically coincides with major price discounts and long-term accumulation opportunities. This comes as Bitcoin experienced a short squeeze that propelled the price through the $94,000 resistance level. Crypto analyst Trader Mayne notes Bitcoin is currently testing the yearly open around $93,000, with potential to extend gains toward $98,000 and subsequently $106,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $106K Next as MACD Flips Bullish The daily chart shows Bitcoin attempting to break free from a multi-week descending trendline after spending most of November in controlled decline. Price is now pushing above diagonal resistance with noticeably increased volume, indicating buyers are re-entering the market. The MACD has crossed bullish and is accelerating upward from deeply oversold levels, a configuration that typically precedes mid-term reversals rather than temporary bounces. Price is also reclaiming the daily pivot zone, suggesting momentum is shifting from defensive consolidation toward early recovery. Source: TradingView If this breakout holds, Bitcoin is positioned to retest major pivot levels around $98,000–$100,000, which will serve as the first significant barrier to trend reversal. A decisive close above that range would unlock movement toward $105,000–$110,000. However, failure to maintain support above the trendline would pull the price back toward the $85,000–$82,000 support band, where lower pivot levels align with the former breakdown zone. Bitcoin’s First Real Layer 2 Token $HYPER Could Skyrocket Next Bitcoin isn’t the only asset investors anticipate experiencing a supercycle in 2026 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is another project generating substantial attention as it develops the first genuine Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, utilizing Solana-based technology to deliver speed and scalability while preserving Bitcoin’s security model. Powered by a fast and scalable Solana-based Layer 2 infrastructure, the project has raised over $29M to enable developers to launch Bitcoin-native decentralized applications. This provides BTC holders with new opportunities to deploy their assets productively, using on-chain tools built specifically for the Bitcoin ecosystem. As leading wallets and exchanges integrate this scaling solution, demand for $HYPER is anticipated to go up very fast. To acquire $HYPER before the next price increase, visit the official Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your preferred wallet (such as Best Wallet).

Earlier in October, total market capitalization reached a record level of approximately $4.27 trillion. That momentum proved short-lived, as prices retreated sharply following widespread selling pressure days later. Since then, the global market has struggled to regain its earlier strength. After briefly recovering to around $3.9 trillion in mid-November, the market faced renewed resistance and reversed course once again. At present, the global crypto market stands at $3.22 trillion, reflecting a loss of more than $1 trillion from the early October peak. These developments have affected nearly all large-cap assets, including XRP. XRP’s Position Amid the Downturn XRP, currently ranked among the largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, has also experienced a substantial decline during this period. Over the past month, its market value has dropped by roughly $40 billion, leaving XRP with a market capitalization of around $137 billion. This decline has occurred alongside a broader downturn affecting the entire sector. Despite the reduction in value, XRP’s share of the total market has not decreased at the same pace. On October 6, the asset held approximately 4.28% of the market. As of now, its share stands at about 4.25%, representing only a slight change. This indicates that most major cryptocurrencies have been impacted in a similar manner, preserving their relative positions. Even with this stability in relative terms, XRP’s dominance remains below its yearly peak of 5.53%, recorded earlier in July. This suggests that the asset has experienced a gradual decline in comparative influence over the past several months, even before the most recent downturn. Evaluating a 15% Market Share Scenario Several analysts maintain that XRP could eventually regain some of its lost share, with a few expressing confidence that it could even surpass Ethereum’s current level of market dominance, which is near 11.9%. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Based on this sentiment, a hypothetical scenario was examined to determine the potential valuation of XRP if the asset reached 15% dominance within the current market environment. Historically, XRP has reached far higher dominance levels. In early 2017, the asset accounted for more than 31% of the total market, though this figure corresponded to a much smaller global market size at that time. If XRP were to secure 15% of today’s $3.22 trillion market, its capitalization would rise to roughly $483 billion. With an estimated circulating supply of 60 billion units, this valuation would imply a price near $8 per token . Compared to the current price of approximately $2.27, this would reflect an increase of more than 250%. Analyst Expectations and Outlook Predictions of a potential rise to the $8 range are not new within the XRP community. Some market analysts, including Dark Defender, have proposed that the asset could reach this level based on technical wave patterns. Others, such as Cobb, expressed confidence earlier in the year that XRP has the potential to approach or reach $8 under favorable market conditions. While such projections remain speculative, the analysis illustrates how a relative gain in market dominance, even without an expansion of the global crypto market, could significantly affect XRP’s valuation.

The company will also expand its three existing regions in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune. Microsoft is introducing Sovereign Public Cloud and Sovereign Private Cloud solutions that are designed to give Indian organizations more control over data compliance and operational sovereignty. Microsoft 365 Copilot will allow India’s data to be processed inside the country by the end of 2025, making India one of the top four global markets to receive this option. The company now plans to equip 20 million Indians with essential AI skills by 2030, up from its earlier goal of 10 million. Through its ADVANTA(I)GE India initiative, Microsoft has already trained 5.6 million people since January 2025. Its programs have enabled more than 125,000 individuals to secure jobs or start businesses. Microsoft announced plans to integrate advanced AI capabilities into two government platforms operated by the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The e-Shram and National Career Service platforms will use Azure OpenAI Service to provide multilingual access, AI-assisted job matching, and automated resume creation for more than 310 million informal workers. Microsoft employs over 22,000 people in India across cities, including Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Gurugram, and Noida. The company has operated in the country for more than three decades and continues to expand its presence to support growing demand for cloud services and AI tools. Why is India attracting massive tech investments? With approximately one billion internet users, India represents one of the largest potential customer bases for cloud services and AI applications. The nation can also boast of millions of software developers and engineers who can build and support AI infrastructure. The Indian government has introduced financial incentives aimed at attracting global chipmakers and major technology companies. Data centers are viewed as India’s best opportunity to participate in the AI boom, given that the country has limited chip manufacturing capabilities. Total data center capacity in India is expected to more than triple to about 4.5 gigawatts by 2030. In October 2025, Google announced a $15 billion investment to last over a period of five years to build an AI data center in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The AI data center is Google’s largest investment in India and one of its biggest AI infrastructure projects globally. The facility will feature gigawatt-scale data center operations and an international subsea cable gateway. Microsoft also announced plans to invest $10 billion in AI infrastructure in Portugal and $15 billion in the United Arab Emirates last month. On the same day as the India announcement, Microsoft revealed it would invest more than $5.4 billion in Canada over the next two years, expanding its Azure Local cloud offering and partnering with Canadian AI startup Cohere. Microsoft and other big U.S. cloud providers are expected to spend more than $400 billion on AI this year to build data centers needed to support services like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini.

Most major tokens have not escaped this decline, although Zcash has posted a 7% gain in the past 24 hours, while newcomer MemeCore has risen by 9%. Despite the wobble, the market could be in a prime position for an end-of-year rally, especially if the Fed does cut rates by another 0.25%. Assuming a surge in positivity, we’ve picked our best new meme coin to buy today, which is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new Ethereum-based token that’s aiming to innovate mining. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today Under 1 Cent – 9 December PEPENODE’s presale will end in 30 days, giving latecomers a limited window of opportunity in which to buy the token early. The sale has already raised $2.3 million , a sign that, even in a bearish market, it has generated considerable interest from investors. The PepeNode countdown has begun! Fire up your virtual mining rigs and get ready to upgrade some nodes. In 30 days the Presale will end! https://t.co/FaKIaBoHfa pic.twitter.com/a3m07joFrH — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 8, 2025 As noted above, its unique selling point is that it takes a unique approach to mining, enabling users to mine tokens without having to invest in expensive mining equipment and facilities. It will launch a virtual mining platform in which users can build and run their own virtual rigs, complete with virtual nodes that they can buy and sell. By buying more nodes using PEPENODE tokens, users will increase their mining rewards, which they can increase even further by upgrading nodes and combining them in novel ways. Because the PEPENODE token is necessary to build mining rigs, it could attract massive demand, pushing up its price over time. Demand will also come from the fact that holders can stake the token, earning themselves a passive income in the process. In fact, PEPENODE’s staking yield currently stands at 562% APY , and while this will decline in proportion to staking volumes, it remains a hugely competitive rate. PEPENODE Launches in 30 Days: How to Buy Before Listing These tokenomics and features make PEPENODE more than just another Pepe-themed meme token, which is why it’s our best meme coin to buy at the moment. Again, its sale will end in 30 days, at which point presale buyers will receive their tokens, in time for exchange listings. While the clock is ticking, investors can still join the sale by going to the official PEPENODE website . By connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), they can buy any amount of PEPENODE, using ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat. The coin is now selling at its final presale price of $0.0011873, and judging by its early successes, it could eclipse this price once it lists. Indeed, in 30 days, crypto may have reentered a bull market, giving PEPENODE the ideal platform for strong growth.

The designation allows firms licensed by the ADGM’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) to conduct regulated activities involving USDT on Aptos, Celo, Cosmos, Kaia, Near, Polkadot, Tezos, TON, and Tron blockchain networks. Extending USDT’s Regulated Footprint The move follows what the company described as ongoing engagement with the FSRA to demonstrate the resilience, transparency, and compliance elements of its operations. The latest approval expands on earlier ADGM recognition of USDT on Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, thereby broadening the regulatory coverage of the stablecoin across a wider range of blockchain networks. According to the official press release, the combined approvals create a multi-chain framework that lets ADGM-licensed firms support more networks while operating within one of the sector’s established regulatory jurisdictions. With this decision, USDT is now recognised in ADGM on nearly all major blockchains supported by the issuer. Tether said the multi-chain approval increases interoperability and allows USDT to be used as a settlement asset for trading and decentralized applications, while meeting AFRT requirements set by the FSRA. Following the development, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said “The UAE continues to set the global standard for digital asset regulation, and Tether is proud to contribute to this leadership. This milestone highlights Tether’s dedication to advancing financial inclusion and innovation on a global scale. Introducing USDT within ADGM’s regulated digital asset framework reinforces the role of stablecoins as essential components of today’s financial landscape. It also creates fresh opportunities for collaboration and growth throughout the Middle East. By extending recognition to USDT on several major blockchains, ADGM further strengthens Abu Dhabi’s position as a global hub for compliant digital finance.” In November, Tether expanded its presence in Bitcoin-backed finance through a strategic investment in Ledn, a lending platform that provides credit secured by BTC. Ledn offers products such as risk management tools, advanced custody, liquidation systems, and allows users to access loans without selling their digital assets. Tether said the investment aligns with its goal of supporting real-world credit markets and broadening access to both retail and institutional borrowers. Circle’s UAE Expansion Meanwhile, the latest approval for USDT in ADGM comes as rival stablecoin issuer Circle also strengthens its foothold in the UAE. Circle announced securing a Financial Services Permission license from the FSRA of Abu Dhabi Global Market, which will allow the company to operate as a Money Services Provider within the international financial center. Alongside the regulatory milestone, the fintech also said it has appointed Dr. Saeeda Jaffar as Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa. Dr. Jaffar, who joins from Visa where she served as Senior Vice President and Group Country Manager for the Gulf Cooperation Council, will oversee the company’s regional operations and lead efforts to advance partnerships with financial institutions and enterprises. The USDC issuer also stated that her focus will include supporting the adoption of digital dollars and on-chain payment solutions across the UAE and wider MEA markets.

The altcoin is growing in scarcity this market cycle, with adoption channels like staking, restaking, layer-2s, digital asset treasuries, and private wallets siphoning off exchange liquidity. These pipelines have created the tightest supply conditions to date. Exchanges now control just 8.7% of circulating Ethereum, the lowest share since Ethereum went live in 2015. Ethereum Exchange Supply. Source: Glassnode . Fresh exposure through U.S. TradFi products such as ETFs deepens the trend. Institutional-grade demand has driven aggressive accumulation under long-term holding strategies. With fewer tokens available, traders are watching for signs of a supply squeeze. Scarcity could trigger sharp upside volatility as demand collides with shrinking liquidity. Ethereum Price Prediction: Is ETH Ready To Surge? This scarcity could help fuel the breakout of a bullish head and shoulder pattern, now unfolding. The Ethereum price has confirmed a local bottom at $2,750 , forming higher lows in a fresh uptrend that solidifies the right shoulder. ETH USD 1-day chart, bullish head-and-shoulders pattern. Source: TradingView . Momentum indicators add validity to the trend. The RSI has made a decisive move above the 50 neutral line for the first time since the downtrend began in October, a telling sign of a bottom. The MACD follows suit, continuing to widen its lead above the signal line and demonstrating a lasting uptrend. A fully realised pattern breakout could see the neckline reclaimed around $5,500 , reclaiming past all-time highs and entering new price discovery in a 60% move . But as the bull market matures, scarcity only stands to increase, compounding the effects of mainstream adoption and use cases. The move could extend 200% to $10,000 .

The TRUMP memecoin, a digital asset inspired by the 45th U.S. President, has just announced plans to launch a President Trump-themed mobile game. This bold move blends political meme culture with the fast-growing play-to-earn gaming sector, offering a total of $1 million in TRUMP tokens to participants. But what does this mean for investors and gamers alike? Let’s dive into the details of this ambitious project. What is the TRUMP Memecoin Game All About? The official announcement came via the project’s X account, revealing a mobile game built around a presidential theme. The core incentive is powerful: a massive $1 million prize pool in TRUMP tokens, distributed to users who simply join a free waitlist before the launch. This strategy aims to create immediate buzz and user acquisition. The game will operate using OpenLoot technology, a platform known for facilitating blockchain-based in-game assets and economies. This suggests the game might integrate NFTs or other tradable digital items, adding a layer of true digital ownership for players. Why is This a Big Deal for the TRUMP Memecoin? This announcement represents a significant pivot from being a pure speculative asset to having a tangible utility. Memecoins often struggle with long-term viability, but providing a fun, engaging product can foster a stronger, more active community. Here are the key potential benefits: Utility Creation: The game gives the TRUMP memecoin a purpose beyond trading, potentially increasing its intrinsic value. Mass Adoption: Mobile gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry. A fun, free-to-play game could introduce countless new users to the TRUMP token effortlessly. Community Engagement: It transforms holders from passive investors into active players and promoters of the ecosystem. However, challenges exist. The success hinges entirely on the game’s quality and fun factor. A poorly executed game could damage the token’s reputation. Furthermore, the volatile nature of memecoins means the $1 million prize’s dollar value could fluctuate wildly. How Does OpenLoot Technology Power the Experience? The choice of OpenLoot is a critical technical detail. OpenLoot provides the infrastructure for Web3 gaming, allowing for: Seamless wallet integration for players. Secure management of in-game tokens and NFTs. A marketplace for players to buy, sell, or trade their earned assets. This means players might earn unique, tradeable digital items (like themed NFTs) while playing, which they can truly own and sell. It moves beyond simple point-scoring to a player-owned economy, a core philosophy of Web3 gaming. For the TRUMP memecoin, this technology is the engine that could drive real, sustainable engagement. Should You Join the TRUMP Memecoin Game Waitlist? Joining the waitlist is a no-risk, high-reward opportunity for anyone curious about crypto gaming or the TRUMP memecoin. It’s free and positions you for potential token rewards. For crypto enthusiasts, it’s a fascinating case study in how memecoins are evolving. For gamers, it could be a gateway into the world of earning digital assets through play. The actionable insight is simple: if the theme intrigues you, sign up. It costs nothing but could provide early access and a shot at the prize pool. In conclusion, the TRUMP memecoin’s foray into mobile gaming is a daring and innovative experiment. It seeks to solve the utility problem plaguing many meme-based cryptocurrencies by building an engaging product around its brand. While its ultimate success depends on execution and market reception, it undeniably sets a new precedent. It shows that the future of memecoins may not lie in speculation alone, but in building vibrant, interactive ecosystems that reward participation. This game could be the spark that transforms the TRUMP memecoin from a cultural token into a gaming powerhouse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to own TRUMP memecoin to play the game? A: Based on the announcement, no. The game is free-to-play, and joining the waitlist is the primary requirement to be eligible for the $1 million prize pool. Q: What is OpenLoot? A: OpenLoot is a Web3 gaming infrastructure platform. It handles the blockchain elements of the game, like digital wallets and NFT marketplaces, making it easy for players to manage their crypto assets earned in-game. Q: When will the TRUMP memecoin game launch? A: The announcement did not specify a precise launch date, only stating the game is “slated” to come. Interested users should follow the official TRUMP X account for updates. Q: Is the $1 million prize guaranteed in US dollars? A: No. The prize is $1 million worth of TRUMP tokens. The actual dollar value will depend on the market price of the TRUMP memecoin at the time of distribution. Q: What kind of mobile game will it be? A: Specific gameplay details haven’t been revealed yet. The theme is “President Trump-themed,” but the genre (strategy, runner, simulation, etc.) remains to be announced. Q: Is this an official product endorsed by Donald Trump? A> There is no indication this is an officially licensed product.

With technical indicators also flashing buy signals, the question now is whether this consistent inflow will fuel a breakout and shift the current Solana price prediction toward new highs. Last week, $20 million flowed to Solana ETFs despite the latest decline that the token has experienced. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) is currently the largest of these vehicles with assets under management of $660 million, followed by Grayscale’s Solana Trust ETF (GSOL), with nearly $160 million in assets. The staking rewards offered by the Solana blockchain make these vehicles quite attractive for passive investors, especially now that the token has hit an 8-month low at around $125. The odds that the downturn will continue are much lower than they were a couple of months ago. Hence, buying Solana at this level could offer both an attractive opportunity to generate passive income and capital gains if the token starts to recover after the upcoming FOMC meeting. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Needs a Bullish Breakout Above $160 to Start Recovering SOL rose near the $140 level yesterday, but the selling pressure is once again pushing the token back to the low 130s. Trading volumes remain relatively low at $4 billion, accounting for less than 6% of the asset’s circulating market cap. Historically, SOL needs trading volumes above $10 billion to get moving. Source: TradingView Thus far, SOL has found strong support at $130. However, volumes need to confirm that buying interest is picking up its pace before jumping to conclusions. Ideally, the price should break through the $160 level to reverse its downtrend and confirm a bullish outlook for the next few weeks. If that happens, the next stop will likely be $200 as SOL may commence a new uptrend as a result of this move. Top meme coins in the Solana ecosystem had their moment earlier this year, and now seems to be the time for crypto presales to shine. One of this cycle’s hidden gems could be Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a project that has raised $4 million by tapping into the same energy as Dogecoin’s early days. Maxi Doge Is Reviving Dogecoin’s Early Hype And $4 Million Says It’s Working Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has already raised $4 million by channeling the same breakout energy that fueled Dogecoin in its early days. More than just a meme coin, MAXI is creating a hub where holders can share early opportunities , trading setups, and alpha . By building a high-energy, community-driven ecosystem, MAXI is designed to thrive in the next crypto cycle. Through fun competitions like Maxi Ripped and Maxi Gains, traders will get the chance to earn rewards and bragging rights by sharing their best-yielding traders. In addition, the project plans to invest up to 25% of the presale’s proceeds in promising projects, using the returns to reinvest in Maxi Doge for marketing purposes. To buy $MAXI and join the pump, simply head to the official Maxi Doge website and link up your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

Since early October, the broader digital asset market has been affected by global economic uncertainty, including recent developments in Japan’s monetary policy. These conditions have contributed to XRP’s inability to maintain earlier support zones. The asset is currently trading near $2.14, which reflects a decline of roughly 30% over the past two months. November’s performance has also been weak, with the token showing additional losses that place it on course to record its third straight month of negative returns. The last time XRP experienced three consecutive monthly declines was during the aftermath of the FTX collapse in late 2022. Analyst Identifies Two Price Barriers Before Wave 3 Completion Even with the ongoing deterioration in market sentiment, several analysts note that XRP has shown resilience by remaining above the $2 mark. Among these analysts is Tara, a widely followed market observer who recently reviewed XRP’s technical structure and highlighted two major resistance areas that must be cleared before the asset can advance toward the upper boundary of its current Wave 3 formation. This is exactly what we want to see on #XRP My next target is $2.73 for Wave 3. What we're waiting for now is an impulse wave UP breaking past the 2 local resistances at $2.18 and $2.30. Once those levels break, #XRP will be able to reach W3. I have W4 and W5 measured but keep… pic.twitter.com/wdG0PQ1HOP — TARA (@PrecisionTrade3) December 8, 2025 Tara’s projection places the potential Wave 3 peak around $2.73. This figure represents an increase of approximately 32% from the present value and aligns with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level used in her analysis. The market last reached this price in early October, just before the sharp downturn that began on October 10. To move toward this projected target, Tara emphasizes that XRP must first break through its nearest resistance at $2.18, which aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement zone. Clearing this point would represent the first sign of a meaningful reversal. The second critical barrier lies at $2.30 , marked by a persistent horizontal resistance line that has repeatedly halted upward attempts. Tara argues that overcoming both levels would position XRP for a potential move toward the expected Wave 3 completion. Path Beyond Wave 3 and Future Projections According to Tara, preliminary targets for Waves 4 and 5 are already outlined, although she notes that adjustments may be necessary once the Wave 3 point is confirmed. She expects these developments to shape XRP’s performance throughout 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Her analysis also flags additional resistance near $2.80, another level that has historically limited progress upward. If XRP successfully surpasses this area after completing Wave 3, the market may see an attempt at $3 for the first time since early October. While resistance areas remain central to the immediate outlook, analysts are also monitoring key support zones. Tara points to $2.07 as an essential level that needs to be held to maintain the broader upward structure. XRP briefly dipped below this level, moving to $2.06 at the time of analysis, but has not yet confirmed a deeper breakdown. Another market participant, known as “Guy on the Earth,” identifies the $2 threshold as the primary support to watch. In his view, losing this level would introduce considerably more downside risk. Conversely, he suggests that reclaiming price action above $2.20 could create favorable conditions for a more substantial recovery. XRP’s path forward hinges on how it performs around the tight cluster of support and resistance levels that now define its short-term structure. Analysts like Tara maintain that the asset still has a viable setup for completing Wave 3 , but progress depends on clearing the hurdles at $2.18 and $2.30. At the same time, holding firm above $2.07, and especially above $2, remains essential for preserving the broader upward pattern.

Even as U.S. spot XRP ETFs approach the $1 billion AUM milestone, the asset continues to trade within a narrow band, leaving market participants to question whether the prolonged consolidation is setting the stage for a larger move. The disconnect between inflows and price has become one of the week’s most notable themes. Analysts note that while institutional capital continues to accumulate, XRP’s chart remains muted, indicating heavy profit-taking following November’s rally and lingering sell-side pressure across higher timeframes. ETF Momentum Builds as XRP Price Stalls The XRP price is hovering near $2.06, slipping slightly despite consecutive days of ETF inflows. Analysts highlight that large holders likely sold into strength, offsetting the fresh demand entering through regulated products. Even so, XRP ETFs have outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in terms of relative inflow strength, indicating that institutions are positioning themselves early. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse noted that XRP became one of the fastest-growing U.S. crypto ETFs of the year, arguing that broader access through traditional investment accounts is expanding the asset’s investor base. The market reaction remains mixed, with some traders viewing ETFs as a stabilising force, while others see them as limiting upside volatility. Regulatory and Structural Developments Add New Variables Beyond market flows, regulatory commentary added another layer of attention. Former SEC Chair Paul Atkins emphasized tokenization as a practical path forward, highlighting its benefits, including increased transparency and faster settlement. His remarks sparked debate within the XRP community, particularly among those who argue that the XRP Ledger is well-positioned for enterprise-grade tokenization systems. Meanwhile, Ripple’s recent $500 million equity round, structured with downside protection for Wall Street investors, reinforced how closely the company’s valuation is tied to its XRP holdings. Funds reportedly concluded that around 90% of Ripple’s net worth derives from its XRP treasury, underscoring the token’s central role in the firm’s long-term outlook. Technical Picture Shows Compression, Not Capitulation On the charts , XRP remains locked between the $2.07 support level and the $2.18 and $2.30 resistance levels. Analysts note weakening momentum indicators but stable underlying demand. If XRP breaks above these levels, a move toward Wave 3 targets near $2.73 becomes more likely, though failure to do so could trigger another retest of lower support. The XRP price continues to compress, supported by some of the strongest ETF inflows of the year, but constrained by steady selling and broader market caution. Whether this tension resolves upward or downward is the question traders will carry into the next week.

Twenty One Capital Moves 43,500 BTC Amid Major Losses As the token trades around $0.14, its price behavior reflects a broader phase of consolidation, characterized by tighter volatility and increasing on-chain engagement. With new real-world use cases emerging and traders watching for a breakout, DOGE’s long-term trajectory is becoming a point of renewed discussion. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Network Activity Strengthens as Dogecoin Price Holds Key Support Despite muted market reaction to Dogecoin’s 12th anniversary, activity on the network continues to rise. Daily active addresses reached over 67,000 earlier in December, marking the second-highest level in three months. This increase comes as DOGE repeatedly defended the $0.14 support, forming a tight compression range between $0.1406 and $0.1450. Short-term charts indicate multiple rebounds from the $0.14 level, accompanied by decreasing sell volume, an early sign of accumulation. Analysts identify $0.16 as the threshold that would shift DOGE from range-bound movement into a potential trend continuation. Failure to hold support, however, could expose deeper downside toward $0.081, an area highlighted by realized on-chain distribution clusters. Adoption Expands Beyond Market Narratives Recent developments show Dogecoin slowly expanding beyond its memecoin label. In Argentina, certain taxes can now be paid using DOGE, while Alternative Airlines has begun accepting the token for ticket purchases. These integrations, although still modest, indicate real-world traction that supports a longer-term use case narrative. Broader sentiment, however, remains closely tied to macroeconomic conditions. Analysts note that liquidity trends, regulatory developments, and institutional risk appetite continue to shape DOGE’s outlook. The launch of the first Dogecoin ETF in November drew little initial inflow, signaling that large investors remain cautious despite the token’s growing visibility. Long-Term Structure Points to Potential Upside From a structural standpoint, Dogecoin continues to follow a multi-year pattern that some analysts view as constructive. Long-term charts show price action moving within a large triangle formation dating back to 2021, with a cup-and-handle structure still intact on higher timeframes. Weekly RSI levels near 50 resemble conditions seen before DOGE’s 2021 rally, while MACD indicators approach bullish crossovers on both weekly and monthly charts. Forecasts place Dogecoin’s path toward $1 as a possibility later in the decade, with projections suggesting a climb toward that level by 2030. In the near term, the $0.145–$0.16 zone remains the defining barrier that could determine whether DOGE transitions into a stronger upward phase or remains confined to its current band.

This signals a crucial shift from preliminary discussions to actionable frameworks that could reshape the entire digital asset landscape. For investors and builders in the crypto space, understanding this accelerated timeline is now more important than ever. Why is the SEC Accelerating Cryptocurrency Policy Now? According to reports from The Block, Chairman Atkins stated that current regulatory efforts are merely the opening act. He emphasized that several key initiatives are in advanced preparation and will soon yield tangible results. This acceleration addresses years of industry calls for clarity and aims to bridge the gap between rapid technological innovation and existing financial regulations. The move suggests regulators now recognize the urgent need for a structured approach to digital assets. What Are the Key Pillars of the New Cryptocurrency Policy? The accelerated push will focus on three major projects designed to create a more coherent regulatory environment. Atkins highlighted these as foundational to the SEC’s strategy. Token Taxonomy: This initiative seeks to establish clear criteria to determine whether a digital token qualifies as a security. A definitive taxonomy would resolve the long-standing “Howey Test” debates that have created uncertainty for countless projects. Project Crypto: This is a dedicated effort to amend and update existing digital asset regulations. The goal is to tailor rules specifically for the unique properties of blockchain-based assets, moving beyond applying old securities laws to new technology. Innovation Exemption: Perhaps most anticipated, this would create a temporary safe harbor for cryptocurrency startups. It would allow companies to develop and test their networks without immediately facing the full burden of securities regulations, fostering responsible innovation. How Will Accelerated Policy Impact Crypto Markets? The move to fast-track cryptocurrency policy is a double-edged sword for the market. On one hand, clear rules reduce regulatory risk, which is a major barrier for institutional investment. Defined guidelines can legitimize the sector, potentially leading to increased capital inflow and more stable market growth. For developers, it means knowing the rules of the game before building, reducing the chance of costly legal battles down the line. However, acceleration also means change is coming quickly. Projects operating in gray areas may need to adapt their models rapidly. The specific details of the “token taxonomy” will be critical; a broad definition of a security could place significant compliance burdens on many existing tokens. The market’s reaction will likely hinge on the perceived fairness and practicality of the final rules. What Challenges Remain in Crypto Regulation? Despite the positive momentum, significant hurdles persist. The SEC must coordinate with other U.S. agencies like the CFTC, which views many cryptocurrencies as commodities. Achieving a unified, non-contradictory cryptocurrency policy across the government is a complex task. Furthermore, the global nature of blockchain technology means U.S. rules must be considered alongside international frameworks to avoid stifling domestic innovation. Another challenge is ensuring the rules are flexible enough to accommodate future technological advances without requiring constant revision. The SEC’s ability to balance investor protection with the permissionless ethos of crypto will be its ultimate test. A Turning Point for Digital Asset Regulation Chairman Atkins’s commitment marks a potential turning point. The shift from slow, reactive enforcement to proactive, accelerated cryptocurrency policy development is a welcome change for an industry starved for guidance. While the devil will be in the details, the stated focus on taxonomy, tailored rules, and innovation spaces provides a coherent blueprint. The coming year will be decisive, revealing whether this accelerated timeline delivers the clarity needed to unlock the next phase of crypto’s growth in the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did SEC Chair Paul Atkins actually say? He stated the SEC intends to accelerate its push for cryptocurrency policy in the coming year, moving beyond preliminary work to deliver tangible results from several key initiatives. What is the “token taxonomy” project? It’s an effort to create clear criteria for determining if a digital token is a security, aiming to resolve the major legal uncertainty that has plagued the crypto industry. How will an “innovation exemption” help crypto companies? It would provide a temporary safe harbor, allowing startups to develop and test their networks without immediately facing the full scope of securities regulations, encouraging experimentation. When can we expect to see these new policies? While no exact date is given, the “accelerated” timeline and mention of initiatives being prepared suggest proposed rules could emerge within 2025. Will this affect Bitcoin and Ethereum? Policies focused on token taxonomy could impact how all digital assets are classified. However, the SEC has previously suggested Bitcoin is a commodity, and Ethereum’s status may be clarified through this process. What should crypto investors do now?

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed four points to a reading of 26, officially moving the market out of ‘Extreme Fear’ and into the ‘Fear’ zone. This improvement in sentiment, while cautious, offers a revealing glimpse into the collective psychology of crypto investors. But what does this shift really mean for your portfolio? What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? According to data from Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index rose from 22 to 26 in a single day. This tool is a crucial barometer, measuring emotions and sentiment from a scale of 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). A move from 22 to 26 might seem small, but it represents a meaningful psychological threshold. It suggests that the pervasive panic that often leads to capitulation is receding, replaced by a more measured, though still nervous, outlook. How Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven composite. Understanding its components helps explain why sentiment is improving. The index analyzes six key market factors: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings. Reduced extreme volatility can calm fears. Market Volume (25%): Tracks trading activity. Sustained volume can indicate renewed interest. Social Media (15%): Gauges the buzz and conversation tone on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls community sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search volume for cryptocurrency terms. The recent rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicates positive movement across several of these metrics. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This Shift? Market sentiment is a powerful, often self-fulfilling, force. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a contrarian indicator for many seasoned traders. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes presented buying opportunities for long-term believers, while periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have signaled potential market tops. Therefore, a move away from extreme fear can be an early sign of stabilizing conditions. However, it is vital to remember that this is not a timing tool. A reading of 26 still firmly sits in ‘Fear’ territory, suggesting caution remains the dominant emotion. Navigating the Market with a Clear Head So, how should you respond to this change in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? First, use it as context, not a crystal ball. It confirms the market mood is thawing but is far from euphoric. Second, combine this sentiment data with fundamental analysis of the projects you believe in. Third, consider dollar-cost averaging as a strategy to navigate ongoing uncertainty without trying to predict the exact bottom. The index reminds us that emotions drive markets, and recognizing that can be your greatest advantage. In conclusion, the climb of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from 22 to 26 is a noteworthy development. It marks a psychological shift from the depths of despair to a state of wary apprehension. For the astute observer, this transition phase highlights the importance of disciplined investing over emotional reacting. While the road ahead may still be bumpy, this subtle improvement in sentiment is a reminder that market cycles are always in motion. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 26 mean? A: A score of 26 falls into the ‘Fear’ category. It indicates that overall market sentiment has improved from ‘Extreme Fear’ but investors are still predominantly cautious and nervous about price declines. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy/sell signal? A: Not by itself. It is best used as a contrarian sentiment indicator. Extreme values (near 0 or 100) can signal potential market turning points, but it should always be combined with other technical and fundamental analysis. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, typically once per day, based on the latest available data for its component metrics. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A: While it heavily weights Bitcoin-related data (like dominance and search volume), it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as many altcoins move in correlation with Bitcoin. Q: Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A: The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me, which provides the daily score, historical data, and a breakdown of its components.

Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis finds herself locked in difficult negotiations with the White House over a pivotal crypto bill . The core disagreement? A potentially explosive ethics clause that could prevent government officials from trading digital assets they oversee. This impasse highlights the complex challenge of creating clear rules for a rapidly evolving industry. Why is the Crypto Bill Ethics Clause So Controversial? According to reports from CoinDesk, negotiations have reached a critical impasse. Senator Lummis is championing a strict provision within the broader crypto bill that would block senior officials from personally profiting from the cryptocurrency sector they help regulate. The goal is clear: to prevent conflicts of interest and build public trust in the regulatory process. However, the White House reportedly views this proposal with significant skepticism, creating a major roadblock. The tension stems from the clause’s potential implications. Media reports suggest the disagreement is particularly thorny because it indirectly involves figures from the previous administration, including former President Donald Trump and his associates. This historical context adds a layer of political complexity to what is already a technically challenging legislative effort. What Are the Stakes for the Cryptocurrency Market? This isn’t just political theater. The outcome of this debate over the crypto bill carries real weight for investors and companies. Clear, fair regulation is widely seen as the missing piece needed for mainstream institutional adoption of digital assets. A strong ethics clause could signal a commitment to a transparent and stable regulatory environment. Conversely, a weakened or removed clause might raise concerns about insider advantages and regulatory capture. Market Confidence: Strong ethics rules can boost long-term investor confidence in a fairly regulated U.S. crypto market. Innovation vs. Protection: Legislators must balance fostering innovation with protecting consumers from potential abuses of power. Global Leadership: The U.S. risks falling behind other jurisdictions if it cannot pass coherent crypto legislation. Can This Impasse Be Resolved? Finding common ground will require compromise from both sides. Senator Lummis may need to adjust the scope or specifics of the ethics provision. Meanwhile, the White House might need to articulate clearer safeguards it would accept to achieve its policy goals. The path forward likely involves: Redrafting the clause to address specific administrative concerns. Seeking bipartisan support to increase the bill’s negotiating power. Clearly communicating how ethics rules benefit the entire ecosystem, not just target individuals. The deadlock over this crypto bill provision is a microcosm of the larger struggle to govern Web3 technologies with Web2-era political frameworks. The core question remains: can the U.S. political system craft rules that are both effective and equitable for a decentralized future? The Bottom Line for Crypto Investors While the political process grinds on, the market watches closely. Regulatory clarity reduces uncertainty, which is often a catalyst for growth. Therefore, any progress on the comprehensive crypto bill , ethics clause included, should be viewed as a positive long-term signal. However, investors should prepare for continued volatility as these high-level debates continue to influence market sentiment. The key takeaway is that the push for definitive U.S. cryptocurrency regulation is active, complex, and fraught with political challenges that extend far beyond technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main point of disagreement in the crypto bill? The central conflict is over an ethics clause proposed by Senator Lummis that would prevent senior government officials from trading or profiting from cryptocurrencies they regulate. The White House opposes this specific provision. Why does the White House oppose the ethics clause? While not stated explicitly in reports, the skepticism likely relates to the clause’s breadth, enforceability, and its perceived connection to officials from the previous administration, making it a politically sensitive issue. How would this crypto bill affect the average investor? A passed bill with clear rules, including strong ethics standards, could lead to a more stable and trustworthy market, potentially encouraging more institutional investment and consumer protection. Has Senator Lummis proposed crypto legislation before? Yes. Senator Lummis is a leading advocate in the Senate for comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation and has previously co-sponsored the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, aiming to create a full regulatory framework for digital assets. What happens if they can’t agree on the ethics clause? The entire bill could be delayed or fail. Alternatively, the ethics provision could be removed or heavily diluted to secure enough votes for passage, which would be a significant setback for its proponents. Is this the only cryptocurrency bill being discussed in Congress? No. Several bills addressing different aspects of crypto regulation, from stablecoins to market structure, are circulating in both the House and Senate. This bill is one of the most comprehensive efforts. Found this breakdown of the Washington crypto clash helpful? The debate over regulation affects everyone in the digital asset space.

GME's U.S. sales grew 12% y/y, outperforming key competitors and demonstrating resilience despite macro headwinds and divestiture of underperforming international segments. The collectibles division surged 50% y/y to $256.1 million, driving a favorable shift in sales mix and boosting GAAP gross margins to 33.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 7.8%, and YTD free cash flow reached $410 million, reflecting operational efficiency post-Canada exit. As we look to wrap up a very volatile 2025, I'm preparing for a downside in the stock market next year, which is encouraging me to look for more contrarian rebound investments to put in my portfolio in place of large-cap growth stocks. GameStop Corp. ( GME ) is looking increasingly appealing. Undoubtedly, GameStop's fall this year is tied to waning enthusiasm for Bitcoin (BTC-USD), into which GameStop has made a significant balance sheet/treasury investment. Yet we shouldn't let this smaller issue distract us from the real improvements in GameStop's core business as a specialty retailer, which is showing U.S. sales growth despite macro headwinds. Data by YCharts I last wrote a Buy article on GameStop in October, when the stock was trading around $23 per share. GameStop just released fresh Q3 results that showcased continued growth in the company's collectibles division, alongside substantial gains in adjusted EBITDA and operating margins amid the company's exit from unprofitable markets. I'm reiterating my Buy rating here, and think the post-earnings dip is a terrific time to buy into this stock at a modest price. Healthy sales trends and improving margins post-Canada exit Let's first address the positive signals coming from GameStop's latest earnings release . GameStop's revenue in Q3 declined -5% y/y to $821 million. GameStop Q3 results by market (GameStop Q3 earnings release) This decelerated versus 22% y/y sales growth in Q2, but we note one important factor: in May of this year, the company divested of its entire Canada segment, with an individual entrepreneur buying out all of GameStop's Canada stores and rebranding it as ""EB Games."" We note as well that alongside the Canada sale, the company in February 2025 also approved the sale of its France stores , which is driving the y/y declines in Europe. As such, the company faces a tough comp in Q3, which is its first quarter operating without the Canadian arm. And yet, we note that with the Canada segment operating at a negative -7% operating margin last quarter (its worst-performing market in terms of profitability), this sale has brought greater bottom line efficiency. Meanwhile, sales in the U.S. grew 12% y/y, which is a healthy indicator amid a more challenging macroeconomy. We note that Best Buy ( BBY ), which is one of GameStop's core rivals in gaming and electronics, reported just 2.4% U.S. comp sales growth in the same quarter (though it primarily faced headwinds from poorer-performing appliances, while entertainment sales grew double digits). Still, we find it reassuring that GameStop isn't afraid to shed off non-core, underperforming country segments and return its focus to a profitable, growing U.S. market. We note as well that the collectibles division is driving substantial growth for GameStop. Collectibles sales of $256.1 million grew 50% y/y to $256.1 million in revenue, or 31% of overall sales (inclusive of the tough prior-year comps in France and Canada). GameStop sales by product (GameStop Q3 earnings release) The shift in sales mix away from lower-margin hardware has helped GameStop boost its GAAP gross margins to 33.3% in Q3, from 29.9% in the year-ago quarter. Eliminating the burden of OPEX in Canada has also substantially helped overall profitability. As shown in the chart below, adjusted EBITDA jumped to a $64.4 million profit, or a 7.8% adjusted EBITDA margin, nine points improved from a -1.3% loss in the year-ago quarter. We note that the company's adjusted EBITDA this quarter adds back asset impairments, which represent the accounting loss from divesting the company's underperforming Canada and France segments. GameStop adjusted EBITDA (GameStop Q3 earnings release) Similarly, we note that YTD free cash flow of $410 million has returned to substantial profit, versus a -$29 million cash burn in the year-ago period: GameStop FCF (GameStop Q3 earnings release) Bitcoin losses So with these metrics—improving gross and operating margins, expanding cash flow, and double-digit U.S. sales growth despite a chillier macro environment—it's difficult to argue that GameStop's core business is thriving. That said, it's difficult to ignore the distraction that Bitcoin poses for GameStop investors, so we'll address that here. In the company's latest 10-Q filing , the company disclosed that it's holding 4,710 BTC, unchanged from the previous quarter. GameStop Bitcoin holdings (GameStop Q3 10-Q filing) The assets are marked to market each quarter, and on GameStop's latest balance sheet (shown below), these Bitcoin holdings are valued at $519.4 million, listed under its digital asset holdings. GameStop balance sheet (GameStop Q3 earnings release) This suggests that the market value for GameStop's Bitcoin holdings is around $110,270 (indeed where Bitcoin was trading at the beginning of November). Bitcoin prices have been extremely volatile over the past few weeks, and at the time of writing, BTC is hovering around $92,500. This means that there's ~$84 million of mark-to-market losses that haven't flowed through to the balance sheet yet. But in my view, focusing on these losses is a mistake. GameStop earned a roughly equivalent amount of adjusted EBITDA from operations. Moreover, Bitcoin holdings are just a small slice of GameStop's massive balance sheet, which has $8.83 billion in cash (offset against $4.16 billion in debt, which translates to $4.67 billion in net cash, or nearly ~10x the company's value of Bitcoin holdings). Valuation, risks, and key takeaways Now, we continue to remind investors that valuation is tricky for GameStop, given the moving parts on its balance sheet plus the lack of any Wall Street coverage and consensus estimates on the stock. Also, GameStop provides far less information than most companies, only issuing a press release with limited details in each quarter, without adding context via an earnings call or providing an outlook. Nevertheless, especially after the recent downside, I continue to see potential upside in the stock's multiples. At current post-earnings share prices near $22, GameStop trades at a $9.83 billion market cap. Netting off the $4.67 billion in aforementioned net cash, plus 4,710 BTC valued at current ~$92.5k market prices ($436 million in current Bitcoin value), gives us an enterprise value of $4.72 billion. Let's take Q3 - the company's first quarter excluding Canada and France - as a proxy for the company's profit potential after its reorganization and slimming down of international operations. In FY24, Q3 represented 16.3% of full-year sales (revenue grew by ~50% sequentially into Q4, the holiday quarter) across all geographies - unfortunately we can't exclude Canada or France here, since the company didn't report geo-level breakouts for each quarter last year. If similar seasonality holds throughout the next 12 months, GameStop's annual revenue would be ~$5.04 billion (down compared to $5.27 billion in FY24 and $5.93 billion in FY23, thanks to the company's elimination of markets). A 7.8% adjusted EBITDA margin against this revenue profile would imply ~$393 million in annual adjusted EBITDA. This would translate to a multiple of 12.0x EV/EBITDA. Of course, there are risks to the bull thesis here and to these projections. GameStop's sales growth right now is being held up by strong collectibles results, as well as by the recent release of the Nintendo Switch 2, which was long awaited after the initial 2017 release of the first generation of Nintendo's hit handheld console. Needless to say, trading cards are subject to fad cycles, and fervor could die down (especially as there may be a ""halo effect"" on Pokemon cards right now after the release of the new, highly anticipated Pokemon Z-A Legends title on Switch 2). Also, GameStop has had a choppy profitability history in the past, with adjusted EBITDA negative in the COVID years. We'll have to monitor closely to confirm that the company's current margin levels can be sustained. In the absence of guidance from the company or any helpful management commentary, GameStop is a bit of a wild card and a shot in the dark. That said, we like the fact that U.S. sales are growing and that balance sheet cash (plus Bitcoin holdings) represents a huge chunk of the company's outstanding market value.

Lummis made this statement while addressing the audience during the Blockchain Association Policy Summit held on Tuesday, December 9. At this time, the Senator shared that she anticipates the markup hearing for the Responsible Financial Innovation Act —the Banking Committee’s take on market structure—will occur before Congress takes a break for the holiday season. Senator Lummis hints at the finalization of the crypto market structure bill next week Following concerns raised about the delay in the bill , the senator acknowledged that it was gradually progressing, as drafts underwent several alterations every few days during talks between the two parties . For now, Lummis highlighted that her staff are worn out, referring to both Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s team and her team. Therefore, to effectively finalize a version of the bill, she suggested that it would be best to let the team work on it next week and then grant everyone a break for Christmas to recharge. “My goal is to share a draft at the end of this week that represents our best efforts so far and let the industry review it, along with Republicans and Democrats, before we go to markup next week,” the senator added. Notably, a markup hearing is a specific type of congressional event in which a congressional committee or subcommittee debates, amends, and ultimately votes on proposed legislation before it is sent to the full House or Senate for a floor vote. Although the banking committee had publicly shared the draft of the market structure bill in July this year, sources close to the situation mentioned that progress lagged following the approval of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act by the US House of Representatives. These sources attempted to explain that the delay took place due to the longest government shutdown that occurred in the United States, and some lawmakers’ opposition to specific DeFi parts of the bill. Several individuals anticipate that the crypto market structure bill will be beneficial to the market A report from a reliable source, dated Monday, December 8, indicated that bipartisan talks regarding market structure are progressing, with plans for a markup scheduled to take place in December this year. This report aligns with Lummis’s September remarks, in which she predicted that the bill would be implemented as law in 2026. However, even with this announcement, analysts raised concerns about whether the Republicans will abide by this timeline. They also highlighted that even if senators decided to move forward with a markup, issues such as political disagreements could possibly delay the bill’s voting process. To fully become a law, sources familiar with the situation mentioned that the bill still needs to go through both the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Banking Committee. Nonetheless, several individuals in the crypto industry back Congress’s move to push this legislation forward. According to them, this legislation would promote clarity and benefit the market. “More finance will shift on-chain under [SEC Chair Paul Atkins]’s leadership once Congress passes a market structure law,” stated Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal , on Wednesday, December 10. “Our leaders must agree on the final details of the bill without any delays.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-10 00:45:08

Those sorts of things would not fall, as we would define it, into the definition of a security.” Paul Atkins, a longtime advocate of lighter-touch financial regulation, has become one of the most market-friendly SEC chairs in recent years. His stance carries weight because previous SEC leadership took the opposite view, arguing that virtually all ICOs were securities. Atkins’ comments, therefore, signal a notable ideological shift at the top of the agency, one that could influence rulemaking debates across Washington and ongoing enforcement strategies. Atkins signals major shift in SEC’s crypto approach Atkins was pointing to a token taxonomy he established last month, in which he categorized the crypto industry into four general token types. Among the four categories, Atkins argued last month that three—network tokens, digital collectibles, and digital tools—should not be considered securities in and of themselves. On Tuesday, Atkins stated that ICOs involving those three token categories should likewise be treated as non‑security transactions and, as such, would fall outside SEC regulation. The only category of token the SEC chair said his agency should regulate, when it comes to ICOs, are tokenized securities—representations of securities already regulated by the SEC that trade on-chain. “ICOs transcend all four topics,” Atkins said. “Three of those areas are on the CFTC side, so we’ll let them worry about that, and we’ll focus on tokenized securities.” The development could mark a significant boon for companies seeking to raise capital by creating and selling tokens to investors and the public. Most ICOs could escape SEC oversight under new taxonomy ICOs were all the rage during the crypto boom of 2017—until the SEC, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office, poured cold water on the lucrative fundraising mechanism by suing numerous ICO issuers because they were selling illegally unregistered securities Atkins’ remarks on Tuesday imply the trend could regain popularity, with or without a crypto market structure bill . Under the SEC chair’s proposed taxonomy, the majority of crypto tokens would fall outside the agency’s regulatory scope. Instead, they would likely be overseen by the more lenient CFTC, along with numerous similarly structured ICOs, according to Atkins. Atkins’ strategy also recasts the old fight between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over jurisdiction. Because most tokens fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, an agency with a lighter enforcement footprint, the proposal may further weaken the SEC’s central role in crypto regulation. Some legal experts argue that the move reflects broader congressional efforts to empower the CFTC to lead the charge in regulating digital commodities within a regulatory environment more akin to how cryptocurrencies are being regulated in the UK and certain parts of Asia. Tokens that Atkins has indicated should not be classified as securities include those connected to decentralized blockchain networks, tokens tied to “internet memes, characters, current events, or trends,” and tokens that serve a practical purpose, such as tickets or memberships. Tokens that are associated with decentralized networks, internet culture, or practical utilities — say, tickets or memberships — could, therefore, be eligible for ICOs. Atkins noted in July that the SEC’s “Project Crypto” initiative could also support ICO activity through exemptions and safe harbors.

The cryptocurrency market just received a sobering signal. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has fallen to 18, dropping another point and moving further away from the critical threshold that defines an altcoin season. For investors watching market cycles, this number tells a compelling story about where capital is flowing right now. Let’s decode what this shift means for your portfolio. What is the Altcoin Season Index Telling Us? The Altcoin Season Index serves as the market’s pulse check. It currently sits at a mere 18, a clear indicator that Bitcoin is commanding the stage. This index is calculated by comparing the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins) against Bitcoin itself. A reading above 75 signals an altcoin season, where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Therefore, a score of 18 is a stark contrast, highlighting strong Bitcoin dominance. Why is Bitcoin Dominating the Market? Several factors are converging to fuel Bitcoin’s strength while the Altcoin Season Index languishes. First, macroeconomic uncertainty often drives investors toward perceived safe-haven assets within crypto, with Bitcoin being the primary beneficiary. Second, major institutional products like Spot Bitcoin ETFs are funneling significant capital directly into Bitcoin, not the broader altcoin market. Finally, the market cycle theory suggests periods of Bitcoin leadership typically precede altcoin rallies, making this a phase of accumulation and patience for altcoin investors. Key Implications for Crypto Investors Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making informed decisions. Here are the immediate takeaways: Risk Appetite is Low: A low index suggests a risk-off environment where capital retreats to the largest, most established asset. Timing Your Entry: For altcoin buyers, this period can be an opportunity to research and identify strong projects at relatively lower prices before a potential season shift. Portfolio Rebalancing: It may be a prudent time to review your allocation between Bitcoin and altcoins based on your risk tolerance. Historically, the index doesn’t stay at extreme lows forever. However, predicting the exact turn is challenging. The current trend emphasizes that we are firmly in a Bitcoin season. When Could the Altcoin Season Return? While the Altcoin Season Index is low, it’s not a permanent state. Market cycles rotate. A return to altcoin season typically requires a sustained period of Bitcoin stability or consolidation, allowing investor confidence and capital to trickle down into smaller-cap projects. Key triggers to watch include: Bitcoin establishing a strong, steady price floor. Increased development activity and positive news flow from major altcoin ecosystems. A general improvement in global liquidity and risk sentiment. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index weekly can provide an early, data-driven hint of this sentiment change. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Winter for Altcoins The Altcoin Season Index at 18 is a clear, quantitative message: patience is essential. Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. For the savvy investor, this isn’t a time for fear, but for strategic preparation. Use this phase to conduct thorough research, build watchlists, and plan your strategy for when the market dynamics eventually shift. Remember, the most successful investors understand cycles, not just prices. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does an Altcoin Season Index of 18 mean? An index value of 18 means only a small percentage (far less than 75%) of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, indicating strong Bitcoin dominance and a ‘Bitcoin season’. How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? The index is typically updated daily, providing a near real-time gauge of market performance trends between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is this low? Not necessarily. A low index indicates a market phase, not a verdict on every project. It’s a signal to reassess your portfolio’s risk and potentially rebalance, but panic selling is rarely a good strategy. Can the index predict future prices? No, it is a lagging indicator based on past 90-day performance. It describes the current market structure but does not forecast future price movements of individual assets. What is a good Altcoin Season Index score for buying altcoins? There’s no perfect score. However, a rising trend above 50 can signal increasing altcoin strength. Some investors use a crossing above 75 as a confirmation signal for altcoin season. Where can I check the Altcoin Season Index? The index is publicly available on CoinMarketCap’s website under their market data or research sections. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

With its current pricing at $0.035 and having registered a 250% increase in its presale fueled by overwhelming public interest, this project is gaining life at a rate unprecedented for any other fresh crypto presales today. Also the project has more than 18,400 participants and more than $19.25 million has been raised so far. Perhaps more remarkable than its presale performances is the DeFi-based platform for lending and borrowing being created by this project that offers much more than anyone can wish for today. The impending testnet on Sepolia for V1 is one such important milestone towards realizing this reality for all participants. For any investment that offers so much from today and for the coming future, Mutuum Finance is a DeFi crypto offering real utility and the best cheap crypto to buy now. Phase 6 Of MUTM Presale Approaches Sell-Out as Investor Demand Runs Hot Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently gaining substantial momentum as its presale continues to sell at Phase 6. Initially launched in Q1 2025 with a token price of $0.01 per token, the current presale stage at Phase 6 sees the token sold at $0.035 per token, a whopping rise of 250% prior to being listed on the exchange. With well over 95% of Phase 6 sold out, just a few tokens at $0.035 are left. Phase 7 kicks in with a steep rise in the token price by 20% to $0.04, nearing the estimated launch price of $0.06. So far, the presale has managed to raise over $19.25 million from more than 18,400 participants. From a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, no less than 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) has been allocated for presale alone. It is increasingly clear that Mutuum Finance is the best cheap crypto to buy now for investors seeking early-stage exposure. Enhanced Risk Management and Platform Security Mutuum Finance is integrating advanced risk management features within its protocol. The LTV ratios and liquidation levels are adjusted depending on the volatility levels of the assets; assets that are less volatile can be given higher LTV ratios than assets that are highly volatile. Reserve multipliers vary from 10% for less risky assets to 35% for highly risky assets. In relation to the above-mentioned aspects for timely and trusted pricing information, Mutuum Finance utilizes the services of the Chainlink oracle referencing token prices with highly traded coins such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback and aggregation oracle services and various in-chain feeds are utilized uniformly for obtaining real-time and accurate pricing information. These services essentially constitute the framework for the pricing and risk formulation and liquidation process for the protocol and therefore make the protocol run efficiently and be stable under varying circumstances within the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing incredible momentum for such a young project with more than 18,400 investors joining and $19.25 million raised during the presale. Phase 6 is almost sold out at $0.035 per token, while Phase 7 is set to increase the token price by 20% to $0.04 with a limited time window for entry. Scarcity, usability, and community support make MUTM the best cheap crypto to buy now and a leading DeFi crypto for investors seeking growth potential.

With ETF inflows slowing down, the price lacks the momentum to break through overhead resistance. The highly anticipated FOMC meeting is expected to provide the necessary catalyst to end the current consolidation and dictate Bitcoin’s next major directional move. BTC Compression Intensifies: Scaling Back Intraday Scalps According to a recent update from Lennaert Snyder, Bitcoin continues to tighten within a compression phase. The market has been trading in an increasingly narrow range, signaling that a larger move is approaching. Snyder noted that the scalp long and short setups from his previous analysis played out well. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Shows Shocking Similarities To 2012-2015, But What Happened Last Time? He explained that as compression increases, the reward-to-risk ratio naturally declines. While the trades were profitable, they still fell into the category of “C-setups,” meaning they lacked the cleaner momentum and clarity found at range boundaries. Snyder emphasized that the best trading opportunities always emerge at the edges of a range. With the current setup, his focus remains on the key resistance area around $94,000. A breakout above that level could offer long opportunities, while a failure there may open the door for shorts. On the downside, if price sweeps the lows and returns to the $87,400 support region, long entries are likely following signs of reversal. However, he added that if Bitcoin fails to show strength during this phase, he is not eager to take new long positions. A deeper retest of the $83,200 zone could become the next area of interest, though he expects any move toward that level to come with a liquidity sweep. Snyder also mentioned that he remains in shorts as a hedge, with scalp shorts still acceptable for traders who understand the increased risk at this stage. He concluded by highlighting the importance of the upcoming FOMC meeting, noting that the market is likely to stay muted until then. Upcoming FOMC Meeting Dictates Bitcoin’s Next Major Move Analyst Ted, in a recent update, revealed that BTC is currently in a state of consolidation around the $90,000 level. This tight range-bound movement suggests that while selling pressure is not dominant, buyers are also struggling to push the price higher aggressively. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Records 21% Crash In November Trading Volume – What This Means For Price Ted attributed the market’s current stagnation and its inability to break above major resistance levels to a slowdown in institutional investment. Specifically, he noted that recent ETF inflows have slowed down, removing a major source of directional buying pressure that typically drives breakouts. Furthermore, the analyst highlighted that a critical macroeconomic event is pending: the FOMC meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, and the market’s next significant directional move will be heavily dependent on the outcome.

Even more impressive, they plan to push this ratio above 99%. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a fortress-like commitment to protecting billions in digital wealth. For any crypto investor, understanding this shift is crucial for evaluating where to trust your assets. What Are Cold Wallets and Why Is Upbit’s 98% Ratio a Game-Changer? First, let’s break it down simply. A cold wallet is a method of storing cryptocurrency completely offline, disconnected from the internet. Think of it as a digital safe deposit box. In contrast, a ‘hot wallet’ is connected online for daily transactions but is more vulnerable to hackers. Upbit’s operator, Dunamu, reported that as of October’s end, over 98% of assets were in this ultra-secure, offline state. This ratio is exceptionally high, demonstrating a security-first philosophy that prioritizes asset protection over convenience. How Does Moving to 99% Cold Storage Make Upbit Safer? Upbit’s goal to reduce hot wallet assets to under 1% is a strategic masterstroke for risk management. Here’s what this ambitious target means for security: Dramatically Reduced Attack Surface: Hackers can only target what’s online. By keeping 99%+ offline, the amount of ‘stealable’ assets at any moment becomes minuscule. Enhanced User Confidence: This transparent metric acts as a powerful trust signal, showing users the exchange values security above all else. Industry Leadership: This move pressures other exchanges to follow suit, potentially raising security standards across the entire crypto landscape. Therefore, this isn’t just an internal policy update; it’s a public declaration of their security posture that benefits the entire ecosystem. What Are the Real-World Benefits for Crypto Investors? For the everyday trader or long-term holder, Upbit’s cold wallet strategy translates to tangible peace of mind. Major exchange hacks have historically resulted in catastrophic losses. By architecting their systems to hold virtually all assets in cold wallets , Upbit makes a successful large-scale breach nearly impossible. Your Bitcoin or Ethereum isn’t sitting in a server waiting to be plundered; it’s in deep freeze, accessible only through stringent, multi-layered internal controls. This operational model directly protects your investment. Could There Be Any Challenges with This Approach? While the security benefits are monumental, a near-total reliance on cold wallets introduces a different set of considerations. The primary trade-off is liquidity speed. Moving assets out of cold storage for withdrawals requires a manual or semi-manual process, which can be slower than purely automated hot wallet systems. However, for most users, a slight delay for vastly superior security is a welcome compromise. Upbit’s challenge is to streamline this process without compromising the integrity of their cold wallet vaults. Conclusion: A New Benchmark for Exchange Security Upbit’s plan to hold over 99% of assets in cold wallets is more than a technical goal; it’s a foundational shift in how crypto exchanges manage risk. It prioritizes unbreakable security over marginal convenience, setting a formidable benchmark that others will be measured against. For investors, it provides a clear, quantitative metric—the cold storage ratio—to assess an exchange’s commitment to safeguarding your funds. In the volatile world of crypto, this kind of proactive, transparent security is the ultimate asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a cold wallet in cryptocurrency? A cold wallet is a method of storing cryptocurrency private keys completely offline, making them inaccessible to online hackers. Common forms include hardware wallets (like USB devices) or paper wallets. Why is Upbit’s 98% cold wallet ratio significant? It is one of the highest publicly disclosed cold storage ratios for a major exchange. It indicates an extreme commitment to security, as it drastically limits the amount of assets vulnerable to an online attack at any given time. Does using cold wallets slow down withdrawals? It can introduce a slight processing delay, as moving assets from cold storage often requires manual security checks. However, this trade-off is widely accepted for the massive increase in fund security it provides. Are my funds completely safe if an exchange uses cold wallets? While cold storage greatly reduces the risk of a remote hack, no system is 100% foolproof. Security also depends on the exchange’s internal controls, employee practices, and insurance policies. Cold storage is a critical, best-practice layer of defense. How can I check an exchange’s cold wallet policy? Look for transparency reports or proof-of-reserves audits published by the exchange. Reputable platforms will openly communicate their storage practices and security protocols. What’s the difference between cold storage and a custodial wallet? Custodial wallet means the exchange holds your private keys for you (as Upbit does). Cold storage is the *method* (offline) they use to secure those keys. Upbit uses cold storage for its custodial wallets. Found this deep dive into crypto exchange security valuable?

In a move that has sent ripples through the crypto community, Ethena Labs has executed a colossal withdrawal of its native token. The firm pulled a jaw-dropping 1.59 billion ENA tokens, worth approximately $440 million, from Coinbase Prime. This single transaction, reported by Onchain Lens, highlights a pivotal moment for the project and raises critical questions for every investor watching the ENA token. What does this massive shift in assets mean for the market, and what signals is Ethena Labs sending? Why Did Ethena Labs Withdraw $440M in ENA? The sheer scale of this transaction demands attention. When a project like Ethena Labs withdraws such a significant portion of its token supply from a major custodian like Coinbase Prime, it’s rarely a routine event. This action typically points towards a strategic shift. The primary reasons could include preparing for a new phase of distribution, moving tokens to secure dedicated treasury wallets, or facilitating upcoming protocol integrations. Therefore, this move is a strong indicator of active, large-scale planning behind the scenes for the ENA ecosystem. Understanding the Immediate Impact on the ENA Token So, what happens when $440 million worth of tokens suddenly leave an exchange? The immediate mechanical effect is a reduction in the readily available supply of ENA on Coinbase Prime. This can influence market dynamics in a few key ways: Supply Shock Potential: A large withdrawal reduces sell-side pressure, which can, in theory, support the token’s price if demand remains steady or increases. Investor Sentiment: Such a confident move by the founding team can be interpreted as a long-term commitment, potentially boosting investor confidence in the ENA token. Market Speculation: The crypto market thrives on speculation. This event will undoubtedly lead to theories about upcoming announcements, partnerships, or staking rewards related to Ethena Labs. Decoding the Signal: What This Means for ENA Holders For current and prospective ENA holders, this isn’t just an on-chain footnote; it’s a communication. Major token movements by a core team are a form of signaling. By withdrawing this capital, Ethena Labs demonstrates operational control and a clear roadmap that requires direct access to these funds. It suggests the tokens are earmarked for specific, value-driving initiatives rather than being held in a general exchange account. Consequently, holders should watch for official communications from Ethena Labs regarding the use of these funds, as it will directly impact the token’s utility and value proposition. The Bigger Picture: Staking, Governance, and Ecosystem Growth This monumental withdrawal likely ties into the broader growth strategy for the Ethena ecosystem. The ENA token is central to several functions: Protocol Governance: Token holders can vote on key proposals shaping the project’s future. Staking Rewards: ENA can be staked to earn rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. Ecosystem Incentives: Tokens are often used to reward users, developers, and liquidity providers. Moving $440 million likely prepares Ethena Labs to aggressively fuel these areas, driving adoption and locking in value. This proactive management is a positive sign for the project’s health and ambition. Conclusion: A Strategic Pivot for Ethena Labs and ENA The withdrawal of $440 million in ENA from Coinbase Prime is far more than a large transaction. It is a strategic declaration from Ethena Labs. This move indicates preparation for significant ecosystem development, reduces immediate market liquidity, and reinforces the team’s long-term vision for the ENA token. For the astute observer, it underscores the importance of monitoring foundational actions, not just market prices, to understand a project’s trajectory. As the dust settles, all eyes will be on Ethena Labs to reveal the next chapter this capital is meant to write. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Ethena Labs withdrawing ENA mean they are selling it? A: Not necessarily. A withdrawal from an exchange custodian like Coinbase Prime typically means moving tokens to a private, controlled wallet. This is often for treasury management, staking, or ecosystem development, not an immediate sale. Q: How could this affect the price of the ENA token? A: By reducing the supply readily available on the market, it could decrease selling pressure. This often leads to bullish sentiment, but the ultimate price impact depends on broader market conditions and future announcements from Ethena Labs. Q: What is Coinbase Prime? A: Coinbase Prime is a specialized custodial and trading platform offered by Coinbase, designed for institutional investors and large-scale crypto transactions, offering enhanced security and services. Q: Should I buy ENA after this news? A: This news indicates active project development, which is a positive fundamental signal. However, investment decisions should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and understanding of the Ethena Labs project, not on a single event. Q: Where can I track transactions like this? A: On-chain analytics platforms and blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) allow anyone to view large wallet movements. News aggregators and crypto analytics firms often report on major transactions. Q: What is Onchain Lens? A: Onchain Lens refers to analytics platforms or observers that monitor and report significant blockchain transactions and activities, providing real-time insights into whale movements and project actions.
