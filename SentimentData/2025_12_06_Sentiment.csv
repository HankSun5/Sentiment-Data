This leaves the country as the last EU member without a national MiCA-style regime. According to a Bloomberg report, the vote was held in the lower house of parliament on Friday, falling short of the three-fifths majority required to overturn President Karol Nawrocki’s decision to reject the legislation. The outcome halts Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s push to place Poland’s crypto sector under tight regulatory control and forces the government to restart the legislative process from scratch. Tusk Flags Crypto as National Security Threat Amid Russia Sabotage Claims Tusk had framed the bill as a national security measure in the days leading up to the vote. Addressing parliament, he said the unregulated crypto market had become a conduit for money laundering and foreign interference, including activity linked to Russia and Belarus. He told lawmakers that Polish authorities had identified “several hundred” foreign entities operating in the domestic crypto market and warned that Russian intelligence and organized crime groups were exploiting digital assets for covert financing. Government officials have tied those concerns to recent security incidents. Last month, Warsaw blamed Russia for a blast on a key railway route used for supply traffic to Ukraine, an allegation Moscow dismissed. Polish security services have also cited cases of underground groups allegedly paid in cryptocurrencies to carry out sabotage activities inside the country. Russia is using cryptocurrencies to pay saboteurs carrying out hybrid attacks across the European Union, according to a Polish security official. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/MsOjIZjSfu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 The veto has deepened an already sharp political confrontation between Nawrocki, a nationalist conservative, and Tusk’s pro-European coalition. The president rejected the bill earlier this month , arguing that it went far beyond EU requirements and threatened civil liberties, property rights, and the stability of the state. Polish President Karol Nawrocki vetoed a sweeping crypto law, saying it threatens property rights and personal freedoms. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/BXYSh74MPF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2025 The blocked law would have implemented MiCA-style rules in Poland, introducing licensing for crypto-asset service providers, investor protection standards, stablecoin reserve requirements, market abuse bans, and strict anti-money laundering controls. It also proposed granting authorities the power to block crypto-related websites through administrative orders, a provision the president described as opaque and vulnerable to abuse. Political Tensions Rise After Poland Blocks Sweeping Crypto Oversight Bill Nawrocki also criticized the scale of the bill, which exceeded 100 pages, contrasting it with far shorter implementing laws in neighboring Czechia and Slovakia. He warned that heavy supervisory fees and added domestic restrictions would drive Polish crypto firms to register in other EU countries, costing Poland tax revenue and talent. His chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, said on Friday that the president is open to regulation as long as future proposals are not excessively restrictive. The failure to override the veto leaves crypto companies operating in Poland without a clear national legal framework ahead of the EU’s July 1, 2026, MiCA compliance deadline. The political dispute has increasingly drawn in industry players. Nawrocki has portrayed himself as a defender of the crypto sector and was endorsed before his election by Kristi Noem, a senior U.S. official, at a conference in southeast Poland sponsored by trading platform Zondacrypto. Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative who says crypto should be “born in freedom, not buried in red tape.” #poland #crypto https://t.co/BVJXhQBnrK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 The exchange later stated that it accepts no Russian clients and fully complies with anti-money laundering rules. Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski added another dimension to the dispute on Friday, saying on radio RMF FM that the crypto industry sponsors figures across the right wing of Polish politics, explaining the sharp resistance to tighter oversight. The veto follows months of turbulence around crypto regulation in Poland. In September, lawmakers had initially passed the bill , triggering strong backlash from industry leaders who warned that Poland’s version of MiCA amounted to overregulation . Zondacrypto’s chief executive at the time described it as a “step backwards” that risked criminalizing core blockchain development activity.

The model warns that all three cryptocurrencies could experience heightened turbulence over the coming weeks, with major moves possible in either direction. Below are Qwen3-MAX’s two-track predictions showing both the potential upside and the risks each asset may face throughout December. XRP (XRP): Alibaba AI Sees Either a Drop to $0.15 or a Run Toward $10 by Year-End In its pessimistic projection, Alibaba’s model suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could retreat from its current $2.06 level to around $0.15, a drop of roughly 93%, should bearish sentiment continue dominating the market. Source: Alibaba Such a correction would contrast sharply with XRP’s powerful performance earlier this year, when the token soared to a new seven-year high of $3.65 in July following Ripple’s pivotal legal win over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout most of 2025, XRP has hovered between $2 and $3. Its relative strength index (RSI) now sits at a neutral 37 and is downtrending as traders cash in on profits today from a brief price bounce yesterday. However, Alibaba’s bullish outlook paints a very different picture, one in which XRP surges 385% to touch $10 before New Year’s Eve, almost tripling its all-time high. The recent debut of nine U.S. spot XRP ETFs could fuel a wave of institutional interest this holiday season, echoing the early inflows seen when Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs first launched. More ETF approvals are anticipated in the coming months, increasing the probability that 2026 becomes a transformative year for XRP. Investors who accumulate now may find themselves well-positioned ahead of that shift. Cardano (ADA): Alibaba Predicts a Potential 2,274% Explosion in December Cardano ($ADA) remains one of the most academically rigorous and research-driven blockchain ecosystems. Launched by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, the network prioritizes peer-reviewed development, security, scalability, and long-term sustainability. With a market cap exceeding $15.6 billion and more than $189 million in TVL , Cardano continues to stand out among layer-1 networks thanks to its active development community and expanding suite of decentralized applications. According to Alibaba AI, ADA could surge to approximately $10 by early 2026, an extraordinary 2,274% climb from its current price at $0.4212 and more than triple its 2021 peak of $3.09. Analysts note that Cardano’s carefully paced upgrades and robust fundamentals could position it as a major winner in the next DeFi-centric bull cycle. Still, Alibaba’s bearish prediction warns that ADA could slip toward $0.10 if macro weakness worsens, representing a downside of just over 76% from today’s price. Dogecoin (DOGE): Alibaba AI Targets $2.50 in Moonshot Scenario and $0.02 in Potential Collapse Dogecoin ($DOGE) , initially created in 2013 as a parody of the crypto boom, now accounts for roughly $21.7 billion in market value, representing nearly half of the $45.8 billion meme-coin sector. The token formed several bullish chart setups in late summer and early autumn, but momentum has since cooled. In Alibaba’s more negative scenario, DOGE could sink to $0.02, a drop of about 86% from its current price of $0.1387. Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7316 came during the retail-driven mania of 2021, and its long-discussed $1 milestone remains elusive. Yet Alibaba’s bullish case suggests DOGE could actually rally 1,700% to $2.50, or 18x its current price. Meanwhile, real-world adoption continues to grow: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise, and payment platforms including PayPal and Revolut support DOGE transactions. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rapidly Emerging Meme Coin Overlooked by Alibaba’s Forecasts While Alibaba AI highlights the upside potential for major blue-chip cryptocurrencies, early-stage presale tokens potentially deliver far larger percentage gains. One fast-growing contender is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already brought in nearly $4.3 million as it positions itself as the next breakout Doge-themed meme coin. MAXI’s narrative follows Maxi Doge, a canine crypto bro and degen distant relative to the original Dogecoin. Maxi is obsessed with lifting weights, trading meme coins with 1,000x leverage, and cultivating a degen community across social media to help him usurp Dogecoin’s throne. As an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from Ethereum’s energy-efficient proof-of-stake network and its massive developer ecosystem, advantages that Dogecoin’s older Bitcoin-style proof-of-work consensus mechanism does not offer. The ongoing presale includes staking rewards of up to 72% APY, although yields decrease as more participants join in. MAXI is currently priced at $0.0002715 in its active presale phase, with automated price increases scheduled in upcoming rounds. Buyers can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

The tax authority HMRC has said that putting digital coins or stablecoins like USDC and USDT onto decentralised finance platforms won’t count as a taxable event at the moment of deposit. This means people who lend out their cryptocurrency, stake it, or borrow money against it won’t face capital gains charges just for placing their digital holdings onto these platforms. Stani Kulechov, who started the DeFi platform Aave , said the decision follows years of back-and-forth discussions with tax officials and brings much-needed answers to users. Tax bills will now only kick in when someone actually gets rid of their assets by selling them, swapping them for something else, or cashing out. Moving tokens in and out of DeFi protocols is being treated as having “no gain, no loss,” giving people clearer rules about what they’ll owe. What this means for crypto users “For users, this is significant,” Kulechov told Yahoo Finance Future Focus. “They now have more clarity over HMRC’s approach, and they can use DeFi lending protocols to borrow funds against their collateral without creating a taxable event or a disposal.” The tax authority made it clear that locking up cryptocurrency as collateral for a loan, or putting a single token into a lending or staking arrangement, wouldn’t trigger a tax charge when deposited under this “no gain, no loss” approach. The taxable moment generally gets pushed back until there’s an actual disposal, such as selling or exchanging the asset. Kulechov said this clarity might also push more professional investors to try crypto innovations. These bigger players have often stayed away from DeFi because they weren’t sure about the rules and taxes. “It simplifies the tax approach, which reduces the burden and allows for wider adoption by institutions, but also simplifies things for regular retail users,” he said. Kulechov pointed out that getting more people to use decentralised finance depends heavily on making it simpler. Up until now, DeFi has mostly attracted people who know their way around blockchain wallets and exchanges. Aave is trying to change that by building a consumer-friendly experience that works on mobile phones, letting users shift money from regular bank accounts into Aave without much hassle. The platform handles the complicated technical stuff behind the scenes. “Providing a seamless mobile experience is a really big opportunity for retail users,” he said. “It makes yield generation and lending accessible to a much wider audience.” Changes to traditional savings The new guidance arrives as traditional savings options in Britain are becoming less appealing. The government’s autumn budget decided to cut cash ISA allowances, which could push many savers to look for better returns elsewhere. Starting April 2027, the yearly cash ISA limit for people under 65 will drop from £20,000 to £12,000, giving people less room for tax-free cash savings. DeFi platforms like Aave, on the other hand, let users earn steady returns on their digital assets that don’t move with traditional markets, while still being able to put money in or take it out whenever they want. Kulechov said this mix is becoming more attractive to savers hunting for new financial options. “What DeFi really helps with is accessing yield and financial opportunities,” Kulechov said. “Aave has been battle-tested over the past five years and shows how decentralized finance as financial infrastructure can work effectively, mitigating single points of failure through smart contracts.” Get seen where it counts.

55403329,https://cryptonews.com/?p=460504,1764974100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55403329.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Today 5 December – XRP, Solana, PEPE",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-today-5-december-xrp-solana-pepe/,"Bitcoin is currently holding the fort above $91k after a prolonged downturn sent the world’s favourite crypto down to a seven-month low of $82,000 by November 21, not long after Bitcoin notched a new all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 on October 6. The wider crypto market jumped 6% yesterday, lifting total capitalization to about $3.24 trillion. Today, momentum has cooled with a near 2% drop to $3.18 trillion. Bulls remain optimistic that this pause is consolidation, not capitulation. Additionally, with crypto entering maturity, Bitcoin dominance is generally falling, indicating that the next substantial bull market may well be powered by altcoins. With that in mind, here’s why XRP, Solana, and Pepe are the best crypto to buy right now. XRP ($XRP): Transforming Global Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to dominate the international value-transfer niche thanks to its fast settlement speeds and minimal fees. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) serves as Ripple’s answer to slow, expensive legacy systems like SWIFT. Major institutions, including the UN Capital Development Fund and U.S. government agencies, have highlighted the XRPL’s utility, while Ripple’s expanding network of fintech partners has helped XRP secure its position as the third-largest non-stablecoin, now capitalizing over $124 billion. Ripple’s rollout of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, marks a strategic move to capture the next generation of global payments infrastructure. Every RLUSD transaction burns a small amount of XRP, gradually reducing supply and reinforcing XRP’s long-term value proposition. Following the resolution of its five-year legal battle with the SEC, XRP rallied to a July high of $3.65. Its current price near $2.09 represents a 43% retracement, but indicators suggest resilience. Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) sits at 36, indicating the token is likely to conclude today’s -2.8% selloff over the weekend and swing back into green. The recent introduction of nine U.S.-based XRP ETFs is expected to accelerate institutional inflows throughout the holiday season. Additional ETF approvals may follow, and if Congress successfully passes comprehensive crypto legislation before year-end, XRP could target $15 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): The Speed Leader Closing In on a Potential $1,200 Target Solana ($SOL) has cemented itself as a top-tier smart-contract network, prized for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees. With a market cap surpassing $76 billion and almost $9 billion in total value locked across its DeFi protocols, Solana remains Ethereum’s most formidable competitor. New Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise, launched late last month, could open the door to significant capital inflows, echoing earlier institutional waves that propelled Bitcoin and Ethereum to new heights. After dipping near $100 earlier this year, SOL now trades around $136, holding firm at a critical support zone. A bullish flag pattern has taken shape since mid-September, signaling a potential breakout. The next major resistance sits near $250; a decisive move above that level could propel SOL beyond its prior ATH of $293.31, with a 4x up to $1,200 emerging as an ambitious yet attainable stretch target if the festive season turns into a bull market. At the same time, Solana has become a leading hub for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, with giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton choosing the network to deploy tokenized financial products. Pepe (PEPE): The Internet’s Favorite Frog Prepares for a Potential Upswing Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly rose through the meme-token ranks, capitalizing on the global popularity of Matt Furie’s iconic character. Now boasting a market cap above $1.9 billion, PEPE enjoys an unmatched cultural presence, amplified when Elon Musk briefly switched his X profile picture to a Pepe meme, fueling speculation about his meme coin interests. Musk is publicly known to hold Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Currently priced near $0.000004554, PEPE sits roughly 84% below its late-2024 high of $0.00002803 after a quiet summer and subdued fourth quarter. Its RSI is now around 45, which indicates the token is neither overbought nor oversold and has plenty of headroom for further gains over the weekend. With the token hovering near its lowest valuation in nearly two years, PEPE offers traders a high-upside entry point ahead of the next major market run. Clearer U.S. regulatory guidance could revive risk appetite and fuel a meme coin gold rush, potentially giving PEPE the momentum to retest its all-time high before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 Built for 2026 and Beyond One emerging project generating buzz ahead of 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 solution wrapped in meme-culture branding. Despite its playful façade, HYPER targets real technical improvements with high-speed throughput, ultra-low fees, and smart-contract functionality. Developed using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge designed for seamless Bitcoin movement across multiple chains. The presale has already raised around $29 million, and prominent analyst Borch Crypto forecasts the token could surge up to 100× upon exchange listing. A recent Coinsult audit revealed zero contract vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. HYPER tokens power transaction fees, governance, and staking, with presale users able to earn up to 40% APY. With the project’s full platform release planned for 2026, both seasoned Bitcoin users and newcomers have the chance to position themselves early in what may evolve into a major enhancement of Bitcoin’s utility landscape.

According to an X post from the founder of the SlowMist Blockchain security firm, the user who was exploited was named “Babur,” and they had their wallets drained of about $27 million in total. Crypto holder loses funds to malware attack The blockchain security expert was able to trace some of the biggest transactions and surmised that the exploit was the result of scammers poisoning Babur’s computer after he clicked a malicious website link, which triggered an automatic download of an executable file. Of course, this wasn’t a typical phishing email. It was more insidious and likely disguised, but once executed, the malware scanned for critical crypto-related information, used keyloggers to glean passwords and private keys. After that, it automated the transfer of the data to the hacker. According to popular claims, such poisoning scams are currently mostly effective on computers on which private keys and sensitive data are stored, rather than iPhones. But since the investigation is still ongoing, everything remains speculation at this point. The founder, who goes by @evilcosuser on X, claims that real poisoning attacks are not as complex or advanced, reassuring everyone that there is no need to panic. Upbit hack headlined exploits in November The attack on Babur is one of the most recent attacks on the cryptocurrency industry. Last month on the 27th, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit reportedly had $30 million worth of assets stolen from its Solana wallet due to a security weakness, which led to the theft of Official Trump, USD Coin, BONK, and other tokens. And as in Babur’s case, the weakness enabled private key inference. All digital asset transactions were halted following the incident, which many suspect may have been conducted by the North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group. “This breach is a direct result of Upbit’s inadequate security management, and there is no room for excuses. Upbit, which prioritizes member protection, promises that no damage will occur to member assets,” said Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok, who reassured users that the private key vulnerability has since been fixed. Upbit intends to leverage its assets to convert customer losses due to the breach and has already commenced an extensive security system review and wallet system restructuring that has seen the exchange tear down its entire deposit address system and rebuild from scratch. According to the exchange, the purge is part of a broader hardening of its wallet infrastructure after the hack revealed lingering vulnerabilities. Now, all users — across every asset and every network — are required to generate new addresses before depositing again. The company said the decision was meant to eliminate any compromised keys or undiscovered vulnerabilities that remain in circulation. South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is monitoring the process as part of its ongoing inspection.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Fails To Shake Ripple CEO — He Still Calls For $180K According to the bank, the move would go beyond the derivative products that most Russian banks have offered so far. It is a clear shift toward opening traditional finance to digital assets, at least for now among wealthy clients. Client Eligibility And Timetable Reports have disclosed that VTB intends to begin with high-net-worth customers only. The bank set thresholds for its initial offering: clients with assets above $1.3 million or annual income over $649,000 would be eligible at first. Andrey Yatskov, who heads VTB’s brokerage arm, said there is “sharp demand” from clients for access to actual crypto, not just paper products tied to token prices. The bank has picked 2026 as the planned start year, but it made that clear the launch depends on regulators signing off. Real Crypto, Not Just Contracts Based on reports, the service would allow ownership of the underlying coins — not merely derivative contracts or token-linked notes. That is a significant distinction in Russia, where until recently banks were limited to offering exposure through derivative instruments. Allowing customers to hold coins directly would require legal and compliance work, from custody arrangements to anti-money-laundering controls. Those steps are on the critical path before any retail expansion can happen. Potential Market Signals VTB has also given investors a sense of how it views crypto as an asset class. The bank recommended a 7% allocation to crypto for some investor profiles, and its internal forecasts have mentioned medium-term Bitcoin price targets in the $200,000–$250,000 range under favorable conditions. If VTB moves forward, it could be the first major Russian bank to operate in this way — a signal that some parts of the financial sector see token ownership as something to be offered through mainstream channels. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets Regulatory Hurdles And Geopolitics The plan is not risk free. Russian regulation of crypto is still evolving, and any permit to offer direct trading will require approval from the relevant authorities. Sanctions and other geopolitical pressures could alter timelines or force changes to how the service is structured. Compliance teams will need to reconcile domestic rules with international restrictions that affect many big banks operating in or dealing with Russia. For now, the rollout remains conditional. VTB’s timeline, client criteria, and product design all hinge on legal clarifications and regulator consent. Market participants and clients will likely follow announcements from the Bank of Russia and other agencies to judge how soon broader access might come.

55405263,640848,1764975653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55405263.jpeg,Layoff Rumors And Metaverse Cuts Push Meta Shares Higher—Details,https://bitcoinist.com/layoff-rumors-and-metaverse-cuts-push-meta-shares-higher-details/,"Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back. Metaverse Budget Faces A Major Trim Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces. Reality Labs Has Been Losing Billions Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money. Investors Reward A Smaller Bet The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns. Layoffs Could Follow Early Next Year Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software. A Bigger Push Toward AI And Wearables At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie. What This Means For Users And Competitors For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business. Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.

Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week 2025, he dismissed the current bearish mood around crypto as temporary and completely out of sync with the fundamentals supporting the market. 2026 has the potential to be “the most bullish year in crypto yet,” with institutions paving the way for a $180,000 Bitcoin. BREAKING: RIPPLE $XRP CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE PREDICTS BITCOIN WILL HIT $180,000 BY THE END OF 2026. pic.twitter.com/uIRgKm7zIr — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) December 3, 2025 The pro-crypto regulatory shift in the U.S. has unlocked one-fifth of global GDP, with institutional-level demand only just being tapped into with the introduction of ETFs. And they have only just permeated the mainstream with traditional asset manager giants outside of digital-native firms playing “catch-up,” introducing their vast clientele. Garlinghouse rejects the idea that ETF demand has peaked, noting the few crypto offerings represent just 1–2% of all ETF assets, a tiny fraction that leaves enormous upside. XRP is a standout beneficiary with steps towards regulation, like the GENIUS stablecoin Act, paving the way for its infrastructure, like stablecoins, to become mainstream. Ripple’s stablecoin approvals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai reinforce that point; stablecoins are no longer experimental, they’re becoming embedded in real financial systems . XRP Price Prediction: How High Can XRP go in 2026? December is shaping a strong launchpad into 2026 with a strong confluence of support laying the groundwork for a 4-month descending channel breakout. The lower boundary of this consolidation is about to be retested, aligning with the level that has provided a firm bottom market throughout the bullish phase of the market cycle at $1.90. A strong technical setup for a launchpad, and momentum indicators could support it. XRP USD 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView . While its most recent attempt has ended in rejection, the RSI is now testing the 50 neutral line after weeks in deep oversold territory. Strength is building towards a bullish shift. While the MACD verges on a death cross below the signal line, it may prove short-lived as XRP nears the confluence zone. The key breakout threshold lies at $2.70, a former strong support level that recently flipped to resistance. Reclaiming this zone could confirm a breakout targeting an 80% upside move to $3.70 . And with further U.S. interest rate easing expected into and growing institutional involvement, the setup could extend much higher, eyeing $5 in the approach of past all-time highs for a 150% run.

Pepe Price Prediction: Lead Team Fails to Address the Threat – How Low Can PEPE Go? Meme coins have experienced big losses in 2025 as the market has shunned this entire category despite the May-October altseason. Source: TradingView The token has lost more than three-quarters of its value since the start of the year. This reflects the market’s lack of appetite for PEPE. The meme coin has temporarily found support at $0.0000040 following a robust jobs report in the United States. Although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a mild bullish divergence, the price still needs to climb above $0.0000055 to reverse its latest downtrend. PEPE may not hit zero after the news, as the website does not compromise the token’s smart contract. However, the lack of coordination from the lead team does favor a bearish outlook as Pepe’s community engagement seems weak. In contrast, a new c rypto presale inspired by the Pepe viral meme called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has managed to raise nearly $2.3 million to launch its fun mine-to-earn (M2E) game. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Meme Coin Mining Fun and Hardware-Free Crypto mining has commonly been associated with expensive hardware, complex algorithms, and so on. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that by introducing an M2E model that allows users to easily launch virtual mining servers . By buying $PEPENODE, players can launch as many mining rigs as they want to earn points and compete to make it to the leaderboard. Top miners receive airdrops of popular meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) from the project’s rewards pool. In addition, they can upgrade their setup to increase their output by investing additional $PEPENODE tokens. Up to 70% of the tokens used will be burned forever to reduce the circulating supply.

This technical weakness would supposedly allow node operators to have a say on what happens with users’ tokens. He clarified that the funds locked up in the L2 and delegated to third-party Hydra Heads (validators) are fully in control of the latter, not the owner. In theory, if Hydra Heads collude and introduce false transactions, they would be able to sign them without necessarily having access to the private keys of the original owner of the ADA tokens. “Every update requires signatures from all Hydra Head operators. Those signatures are made using the private keys of the operators, not the users,” YODA emphasized. He added: “If they collude, they can ALL sign a malicious snapshot that splits all the funds between them.” Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Finds Support at $0.40 But Bearish Trend Persists Aside from Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) has been one of the worst-performing top 10 tokens this year, with total losses now reaching 49%. Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the token has found support temporarily at $0.40. However, ADA has been on a strong downtrend and is not yet showing signs of a trend reversal.

A crucial on-chain metric is flashing a warning sign that seasoned investors watch closely. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno, buying pressure from a key investor cohort—addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC—has slowed significantly. This slowdown has broken a long-term upward trendline, suggesting a pivotal change in market dynamics. For anyone tracking the Bitcoin bear market potential, this data point is impossible to ignore. What Does the 100-1,000 BTC Wallet Data Reveal? Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, has pinpointed a concerning trend. The cohort of wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, which importantly includes addresses for Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries, is showing weakened demand. Their cumulative annual purchases have fallen sharply. Peak Purchase: 965,000 BTC at the all-time high. Current Purchase Level: 694,000 BTC. This represents a substantial drop. Moreno concludes that this decline in demand from such a significant player group is a strong indicator that the market may have entered a bear market phase. This isn’t just retail sentiment; it’s a signal from some of the market’s largest and most informed entities. Why is This Investor Cohort So Important? You might wonder why this specific group matters more than others. The answer lies in their profile and influence. Addresses in the 100-1,000 BTC range are typically not held by everyday retail investors. Instead, they represent: Institutional Capital: This includes Bitcoin ETF holdings and corporate treasury allocations (like those from MicroStrategy or Tesla). Sophisticated Whales: High-net-worth individuals or investment funds with a deep understanding of market cycles. Market Stability: Their consistent buying has historically provided a foundation of support during corrections. When these deep-pocketed investors slow their accumulation, it removes a major source of buy-side pressure. This can leave the market more vulnerable to downward moves, reinforcing the Bitcoin bear market thesis. How Does This Signal a Potential Bitcoin Bear Market? The technical breakdown of the long-term trendline is the critical chart pattern. Think of this trendline as a measure of consistent institutional faith. For months or even years, this group’s buying activity formed a reliable upward slope on the chart. The recent break below this line is a technical confirmation of the weakening fundamental data. Therefore, it’s not just that purchases are down. The pattern of support has been violated. This combination of factors—reduced buying volume from key players and a broken technical structure—creates a compelling argument for a shift in the market cycle. It suggests a period of consolidation or decline, a hallmark of a bear market , may be taking hold. What Should Investors Do With This Information? This analysis serves as a crucial data point, not a crystal ball. However, it provides actionable context for your strategy. First, understand that on-chain analytics like this offer a view into the actions of major holders, which often precede price movements. Second, this signal suggests increasing caution may be prudent. Consider reviewing your portfolio’s risk exposure and ensuring you have a plan for different market scenarios. Remember, a Bitcoin bear market phase, while challenging, also creates opportunities for long-term accumulation at lower price points for those who are prepared. Conclusion: A Vital Metric Demands Attention The slowdown in buying from 100-1,000 BTC wallets is a stark warning from the blockchain itself. When the market’s most substantial and presumably well-informed participants pull back, it’s a trend that demands respect. While no single indicator guarantees the future, this breakdown in institutional accumulation pressure is a powerful piece of evidence supporting the bear market entry thesis. Investors should monitor this and other on-chain metrics closely to navigate the potentially shifting tides ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this signal guarantee a Bitcoin price crash? A: No single metric guarantees future price action. This is a strong warning sign of weakening demand from a critical cohort, but it must be considered alongside other market factors like macroeconomic conditions and broader adoption trends. Q2: Who is Julio Moreno and why should I trust this analysis? A: Julio Moreno is a Senior Analyst at CryptoQuant, a leading provider of on-chain data and analytics for cryptocurrencies. His analysis is based on transparent, verifiable blockchain data rather than opinion. Q3: What other signs should I look for in a bear market? A: Other signs include sustained price trading below key moving averages (like the 200-day), negative funding rates in perpetual futures markets, and a general decline in market sentiment and trading volume. Q4: Can a bear market be a good thing for investors? A: For long-term, disciplined investors, bear markets can present opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices, a strategy often referred to as “dollar-cost averaging.” However, it requires a strong stomach for volatility. Q5: How long do Bitcoin bear markets typically last? A: Historically, Bitcoin bear markets have varied in length, often lasting several months to over a year. They are part of the natural market cycle. Q6: Do ETF flows still affect this wallet cohort? A> Yes, significantly. A large portion of the BTC in this 100-1,000 range is held by custodians for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Slowing purchases by this cohort directly reflects slowing net inflows into these ETFs.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are down by just under 2% in 24 hours, while XRP and Solana have suffered falls of around 4%. Yet the market’s total capitalization ($3.2 trillion) has risen by 5.5% since Tuesday and by 7% since November 23, as the mood warms after a period of AI-bubble-related fears. Now may therefore be a very good time to buy again, just as coins begin regaining strength, but before they rise too much. We’ve therefore picked the best altcoin to buy now, a new ERC-20 token called PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) that’s aiming to make mining much more accessible. Best Altcoin to Buy Now – 5 December PEPENODE’s approach to mining is simple: give users the ability to build their own virtual mining rigs, which they can run in order to earn rewards in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe (it will add other coins in the future). Upgrading Nodes is like leveling up in life. Suddenly everything feels easier. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/FHs8HwglBs — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 5, 2025 Users can build their rigs by spending PEPENODE tokens to buy more virtual nodes, which they can upgrade and combine in order to earn more mining rewards. The more nodes they have and the more they’ve upgraded them, the more rewarding PEPENODE’s mining system will be for users. This creates a huge incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, which users can also stake for a passive income, with its current APY at 570% . Demand for the new token could therefore be substantial, pushing its price up over time. What’s also attractive about PEPENODE’s mining system is its flexibility: users can make their mining rigs as large as they like, but they can also sell off their nodes if they wish to scale down. Such features help to explain why the coin is already proving so popular, with its presale having raised $2.27 million . This is a very positive figure for such a new token and offers some sign of its future potential. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It Ends Investors can tap into this future potential by going to the official PEPENODE website , where the coin is currently selling $0.0011778. This price will rise later today and will continue to rise until the sale enters its final phase, just before PEPENODE lists. Potential buyers should therefore act quickly, since the available signs suggest that PEPENODE has the potential to be one of 2026’s biggest new alts. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with allocations divided between node rewards, liquidity, development, marketing, and its treasury. Its unique mining system is the main reason why it’s our best altcoin to buy now, and its upcoming launch could coincide with a major market recovery and rally.

However, he believes they will come in too late. He expects their FOMO to set in once the asset reaches much higher levels. Weak Sentiment as XRP Struggles to Hold Support XRP has been dealing with a difficult period, moving lower along with the rest of the crypto market. Since October, the token has fallen by close to 30% and is trading near $2.06. Sellers have continued to push the price down , and the $2 level has become an important support that buyers are trying to keep in place. This decline has led to a more negative mood among many holders . Near the end of last month, a community researcher shared data showing that whales sold about $400 million worth of XRP in only two days. Most of these sales came from wallets that hold between 1 and 10 million XRP, suggesting that large holders were reducing their positions as the asset’s price struggled. Many will FOMO when #XRP hits $5.85 & then $10 shortly after. They will be the next group to deal with, like the ones FOMO’d at $3.66. Ohhh one one one. — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 3, 2025 The Price That Could Draw People Back Despite the current pressure on the market, Dark Defender has continued to hold a positive long-term view. He believes that many people who are leaving now will return, but only after the token rises to higher levels. He says this behavior change will likely begin once XRP reaches $5.85. He has previously predicted that XRP will reach $5.85 , and this level represents a climb of almost 184%. He has pointed to long-term chart signals that support the idea of a strong move once momentum shifts. He has also explained that XRP has held a long-term pattern that remains in place and could push the price toward this first major target.

Dark Defender has also said that XRP can reach $10 after it moves past $5.85. This would be a larger jump of about 385% from today’s price. He believes that if XRP reaches these higher levels, many investors who exited earlier will rush back, even though they would have missed the largest gains. He pointed out that this has occurred before. When XRP rose from around $0.5 to its all-time high of $3.66 in July , many people bought in only after a large part of the rally was already complete. Raoul Pal, who once advised investors to look for alternatives, later admitted he was wrong after XRP’s rally in late 2024. Although XRP is showing weakness in the short term, Dark Defender remains bullish. He believes interest will return once the token begins to rise.

Blockchain data reveals a dormant Bitcoin whale address, inactive for a staggering 14 years, suddenly transferred 1,000 BTC—worth approximately $89 million. This event isn’t just a large transaction; it’s a message from Bitcoin’s ancient past, prompting urgent questions about market impact and holder behavior. What Does a Dormant Bitcoin Whale Transfer Mean? When a dormant Bitcoin whale moves funds, analysts pay close attention. This specific address, beginning with “1Au1uZ,” received its Bitcoin in 2010, when the asset was worth mere cents. The holder watched silently through multiple bull and bear markets. Therefore, their decision to act now is highly significant. It could signal a change in long-term conviction, an estate planning move, or preparation for a major market shift. Why Are These 14-Year-Old Coins So Important? Coins from this era are legendary. They represent the earliest days of Bitcoin, held by pioneers who believed in the technology before it had monetary value. The sheer willpower to hold through 14 years of volatility is extraordinary. When such coins move, it often affects market sentiment. Here’s why: Supply Shock Potential: These coins were effectively removed from circulating supply. Their movement back into active wallets can increase sell-side pressure. Psychological Signal: If a holder with diamond hands for 14 years decides to move coins, some investors interpret it as a potential local market top. Technical Analysis: On-chain metrics track these movements closely, using them to gauge overall holder sentiment and predict potential volatility. What Could This Whale Do Next? The immediate destination of the 1,000 BTC was another address, not a known exchange. This suggests the holder is not selling directly at this moment. However, the possibilities are vast. The whale might be: Consolidating wallets for security or estate purposes. Preparing to use the Bitcoin as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Transferring ownership, perhaps to a next-generation custodian or a family member. Simply testing wallet functionality after more than a decade. Until the coins reach an exchange or are used in a visible transaction, their ultimate purpose remains a fascinating mystery. How Does This Impact the Broader Bitcoin Market? While $89 million is a large sum, it’s a fraction of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume. The direct price impact is often minimal. The real impact is psychological. News of a dormant Bitcoin whale awakening can create short-term FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) among retail traders. Conversely, it can also be viewed as a sign of an aging market where early adopters are finally taking profits, a natural evolution for any asset class. Ultimately, it underscores Bitcoin’s core narrative: the ability to store life-changing value securely over immense periods. Conclusion: A Testament to Bitcoin’s Promise The awakening of this dormant Bitcoin whale is a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency’s unique properties. An individual held a digital key securely for 14 years and unlocked $89 million. This event validates Bitcoin’s original promise as a sovereign store of value. While the market watches the next move, the story itself—of patience, belief, and newfound wealth—is the true headline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “dormant Bitcoin whale”? A: A dormant Bitcoin whale is a cryptocurrency address holding a large amount of Bitcoin (typically 1,000 BTC or more) that has not made any outgoing transactions for a very long time, often several years. Q2: Why is a 14-year dormancy period so significant? A: Bitcoin was launched in 2009. Coins from 2010 are among the oldest in existence, mined or purchased when Bitcoin had almost no monetary value. Holding them this long demonstrates extreme conviction. Q3: Does this mean the whale is selling their Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. The transfer was to another private address. Selling usually involves sending coins to a cryptocurrency exchange. This could be a preparatory step, but it is not a direct sale. Q4: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These tools monitor large wallet movements and exchange flows. Q5: Should I be worried about my Bitcoin investment when this happens? A: Single whale movements rarely dictate long-term market trends. Bitcoin’s price is influenced by macroeconomics, adoption, and institutional flows. View such events as interesting data points, not sell signals. Q6: What’s the largest dormant whale wallet ever seen? A: The famous Satoshi-era wallets, believed to belong to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, hold over 1 million BTC and have never moved. They represent the ultimate in dormancy. Did this story of a sleeping giant fascinate you?

55405398,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=873750,1764978303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55405398.jpeg,Strive challenges MSCI’s proposal to exclude companies whose Bitcoin holdings exceed 50% of total assets,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/strive-challenges-mscis-50-bitcoin-threshold/,"Strive, a structured-finance company listed on Nasdaq and one of the world’s largest public corporate holders of Bitcoin, is fighting MSCI’s proposal to exclude Bitcoin-heavy companies from major global equity benchmarks. The firm sent a letter this week to Henry Fernandez, MSCI’s CEO, stating that the proposed exclusion would violate the “long-established principle of index neutrality.” Strive said such benchmarks need to be based on the market for digital currency and not contain special rules around considerations when companies hold digital assets. Strive now has over 7,500 BTC. This makes it one of the largest public companies in the world to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The firm said its heritage provides it with a unique understanding of how Bitcoin-treasury companies operate, and why blanket exclusions would distort markets. Strive argues the 50% threshold is flawed Strive’s response emphasized matters of methodology and fairness. The 50% digital-asset threshold is unjustified, overbroad, and unworkable, according to the firm. It argued that the rule does not account for the broad category to which the Bitcoin treasury has become. Many are also companies that do more than hold Bitcoin. A few run companies with proven businesses in AI-driven data centre infrastructure, structured finance, and more general digital asset financial services. Additionally, others, particularly large miners such as Marathon Digital , Riot Platforms, Hut 8, and CleanSpark, have diversified beyond the mining sector. Today, they lease out surplus power, computing capacity, and data-centre space to cloud and hyperscale customers. Strive contends that these companies are bigger than their Bitcoin treasuries, and excluding them would result in the elimination of real economic activity from global benchmarks. The company also identified a technical challenge: accounting standards are vast. Under U.S. GAAP, digital assets must be recorded at fair value every quarter. Under IFRS, which is used by many countries, companies can carry digital assets at their cost. That means two companies with the same Bitcoin exposure could appear to be assuming different concentrations of the digital asset. Strive cautioned that the rule would lead to disparate and unfair treatment between companies based solely on where they report their financial statements. Strive presented an alternative that seemed far more sensible. Rather than rewriting broad-index eligibility criteria, MSCI could create add-ons in the form of optional “ex-digital-asset-treasury” index variants. Investors wishing to avoid Bitcoin-treasury companies could then opt for those versions, without compelling everyone else to suffer the same exclusion. MSCI already offers “ex-energy,” “ex-tobacco,” and other screened index versions along these lines. Index shift threatens billions in market flows The answer could hinge on how the market perceives the insights gained through their research. If MSCI goes with the 50% rule, the implications could be enormous. Strategy — the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin — would be excluded from indexes that track trillions of dollars in global assets. Analysts estimate passive outflows of up to $2.8 billion from MSCI-tracked funds alone. Given that other index providers may copy MSCI, the amount could increase to nearly USD 9 billion. Market observers note that the impact may already be reflected in Strategy’s volatile share price. Some analysts contend that being dropped from an index would not compel the firm to dispose of its Bitcoin. Still, it may reduce passive demand for the cryptocurrency from institutional investors tracking MSCI benchmarks. Strive has also experienced its own share of volatility since earlier this year, when it debuted its Bitcoin treasury play via a reverse merger adoption. Its stock price soared from about 60 cents to more than $13 after it announced the Strategy, then fell back below $1. MSCI is expected to publish its decision on January 15, 2021, before the February index review. The result is being closely monitored throughout the cryptocurrency, financial indexing, and institutional investment worlds.

Yoodli, an AI-powered communication training platform founded by former Google X engineer Varun Puri, has just achieved a staggering valuation milestone – tripling to over $300 million in just six months. This remarkable growth story isn’t about replacing humans with machines, but about using AI to enhance what makes us uniquely human: our ability to communicate effectively. What Makes Yoodli’s AI Communication Training So Revolutionary? The Seattle-based startup’s recent $40 million Series B funding round, led by WestBridge Capital with participation from Neotribe and Madrona, represents more than just financial success. It signals a growing recognition that AI can be a powerful tool for human development rather than a threat to human employment. Yoodli’s platform uses sophisticated AI to create simulated scenarios for sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions, providing users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills. The Vision Behind Yoodli: From Personal Struggle to Global Solution Varun Puri’s journey to founding Yoodli is deeply personal. After moving to the U.S. at age 18, he experienced firsthand how communication challenges could hold back talented professionals from countries like India. “I became aware of how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals,” Puri explained in an interview. This insight, combined with his experience at Google’s X division working on special projects for Sergey Brin, led him to co-found Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi in 2021. Initially focused on helping people overcome the fear of public speaking – a skill two out of three people struggle with according to internal data – Yoodli quickly evolved as users began using the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations. This organic shift pushed the company from consumer-focused training to enterprise solutions. How Yoodli’s Series B Funding Will Accelerate Growth The $40 million Series B funding represents a significant acceleration for Yoodli, coming just months after a $13.7 million Series A round in May. Puri noted that the startup hadn’t planned to raise more funding so soon but was compelled by unexpected investor interest. Several factors contributed to this investor enthusiasm: 900% growth in average recurring revenue over the last 12 months 50% increase in role-plays run on the platform between funding rounds Expansion of enterprise customer base including Google, Snowflake, and Databricks Strategic executive hires from Tableau, Salesforce, and Remitly Enterprise Adoption: Why Major Companies Choose Yoodli Yoodli’s transition to enterprise training has been remarkably successful. The platform now offers AI role-plays and experiential learning tools for go-to-market enablement, partner certification, and management coaching. Puri contrasts this approach with traditional corporate training methods: “In the old world, companies would train people using static, long-form content or passive videos that we’d all watch at 4x-5x speed, just to get the thing done. But that doesn’t actually mean you’ve learned it.” The platform’s enterprise adoption includes: Company Type Examples Use Case Technology Companies Google, Snowflake, Databricks Employee communication training Sales Organizations RingCentral, Sandler Sales Sales pitch practice and coaching Coaching Firms Franklin Covey, LHH Customized training frameworks The Technology Behind Yoodli’s AI Communication Training Yoodli’s platform stands out for its technical sophistication and flexibility. The system works with multiple large-language models, allowing users to choose between Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s GPT, or other models based on preference. This multi-model approach ensures optimal performance across different use cases and languages. Key technical features include: Support for major languages including Korean, Japanese, French, and multiple Indian languages Enterprise integration capabilities for embedding into existing software systems Web-based access without requiring mobile apps (a deliberate choice to streamline training) Customization options that allow companies to tailor the system to their specific methodologies Human-Centric AI: Yoodli’s Philosophy of Augmentation, Not Replacement Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Yoodli’s approach is its philosophical commitment to human-centric AI. “I philosophically believe that AI can get you from a zero to an eight or a zero to nine,” says Puri. “But the pure essence of who you are and how you show up, and your authenticity and vulnerability that a human gives you feedback on will always exist.” This philosophy manifests in several ways: The platform is designed to complement human coaches rather than replace them AI provides scalable practice opportunities while humans deliver personalized guidance The system focuses on measurable improvement while preserving individual communication style Market Differentiation and Competitive Advantages While Yoodli operates in a growing market for AI-based communication tools, Puri emphasizes several key differentiators. The startup focuses on deep customization and specific training verticals, allowing companies to tailor the system to their unique use cases and coaching methods. This vertical specialization, combined with enterprise-grade integration capabilities, has helped Yoodli secure and retain major corporate clients. The company’s leadership team has been strengthened with strategic hires including: Josh Vitello (former Tableau and Salesforce executive) as Chief Revenue Officer Andy Larson (former Remitly CFO) as Chief Financial Officer Padmashree Koneti (former Tableau CPO) as Chief Product Officer Future Growth Plans and Market Expansion With approximately 40 employees and fresh capital from WestBridge Capital and other investors, Yoodli is poised for significant expansion. The company plans to use the Series B funding to: Enhance AI coaching, analytics, and personalization tools Expand presence in enterprise learning and professional development markets Grow the team across product, AI research, and customer success functions Enter Asia-Pacific markets while deepening U.S. market penetration FAQs About Yoodli and AI Communication Training Who founded Yoodli? Yoodli was co-founded by Varun Puri , a former Google X engineer who worked on special projects for Sergey Brin , and Esha Joshi , a former Apple engineer. Which companies use Yoodli for training? Major companies using Yoodli include Google , Snowflake , Databricks , RingCentral , and coaching firms like Franklin Covey . Who led Yoodli’s Series B funding round? The $40 million Series B round was led by WestBridge Capital , with participation from Neotribe and Madrona. What makes Yoodli different from other AI training platforms? Yoodli focuses on human-centric AI that augments rather than replaces human coaches, offers deep customization for enterprise clients, and supports multiple large-language models including Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. Where is Yoodli headquartered? Yoodli is based in Seattle, Washington, and has approximately 40 employees. Conclusion: The Future of Human-Centric AI Development Yoodli’s remarkable valuation surge to over $300 million represents more than just financial success – it validates a crucial approach to artificial intelligence development. In a landscape often dominated by fears of automation and job displacement, Yoodli demonstrates that AI can be a powerful force for human enhancement rather than replacement. The startup’s focus on communication skills, one of the most fundamentally human capabilities, combined with its enterprise-grade technology and human-centric philosophy, positions it at the forefront of a new wave of AI applications designed to make us better at being human. As companies worldwide grapple with the challenges of remote work, global teams, and increasingly complex communication environments, tools like Yoodli offer a compelling solution.

The discussion featured Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver, who described a pattern he believes is unfolding quietly in elite financial circles. According to Claver, multiple family offices with substantial multi-generational wealth are now building meaningful positions in XRP, a trend he argues has been largely overlooked. Claver referenced an account relayed to him by a friend, involving a prominent family connected to a major U.S. food brand that was overheard during a private ride in Orlando discussing the size of their XRP holdings. While the anecdote was secondary in nature, he said it aligns closely with conversations he has held recently with several major family offices that are allocating capital to XRP at a faster pace than the general market realizes. Claver emphasized the contrast between the small size of most existing XRP wallets and the volume of assets controlled by these large private investors. He pointed out that although XRP has roughly 7 million wallets globally, a significant portion of them hold under 100 XRP. He argued that this level of concentration, combined with growing institutional participation , could create conditions for stronger price performance if broader adoption accelerates. Why Billionaires Are Looking at XRP In explaining the motivation behind these secretive allocations, Claver stated that extremely wealthy families are approaching crypto not as short-term speculation. He stressed that these groups have already accumulated their wealth and are focused on safeguarding it. Their interest, he said, is driven by strategies focused on preservation rather than aggressive risk-taking. He reiterated that these investors “aren’t rolling the dice”; instead, they are using digital assets as long-term hedges. Claver also highlighted that only about 38% of global family offices are even considering digital asset exposure at this stage. He believes the remainder are beginning to examine assets such as XRP in response to concerns arising from macroeconomic developments, including the reverse carry trade. As traditional financial institutions increasingly validate the digital asset sector, Claver maintains that large investors will eventually maintain at least some exposure, and he described the current moment as the early stage of that transition. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP ETFs Absorb Over 400 Million Tokens in Nine Days The same Good Evening Crypto segment also referenced recent remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who said the newly listed XRP ETFs remain “underappreciated.” The program noted that more than 400 million XRP have been absorbed by these ETFs through OTC channels and exchanges within their first 15 days of trading. The funds have seen inflows exceeding $887 million, with total assets reaching more than $906 million as of Wednesday. Despite this rapid accumulation, XRP’s market price has continued to struggle below what many investors describe as a firm resistance level near $2. Nonetheless, analysts appearing on the program suggested that ongoing institutional accumulation could eventually trigger a market separation from broader price trends if demand from ETFs continues to build. Ripple’s Global Positioning Strengthens the Thesis Host Abs expanded on why affluent families may be turning their attention to XRP at this moment. He pointed to Ripple’s established relationships with governments, central banks, and major institutions, describing XRP as one of the few digital assets positioned for large-scale financial integration. Claver added that XRP’s enterprise-grade functionality sets it apart in an evolving global financial system. The host also suggested that the confirmation of interest from major American family lineages signals a possible shift toward early-stage mainstream recognition. In closing, Claver restated a principle he believes applies in the current environment: “You should only have to get rich once.” He argued that many of these families view XRP as one of the strategic components that can support long-term stability.

55407314,640808,1764979252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55407314.jpeg,"Top Dogecoin Wallets Begin Rapid Accumulation As Price Struggles, Is A Surge Coming?",https://bitcoinist.com/top-dogecoin-wallets-accumulation/,"Dogecoin has spent the past few days rebounding after a downturn to the mid-$0.13s, and its on-chain activity is beginning to tell an interesting bullish story. Data from Santiment shows a quiet accumulation trend of hundreds of millions of DOGE tokens taking place among some of the asset’s larger holders, even as the price continues to struggle for momentum. This change in wallet behavior is unfolding at a time when Dogecoin’s recent performance offers very little excitement for bullish traders, making the quiet accumulation all the more notable. Dogecoin Whales Accumulation: What the Numbers Show The data from Santiment highlights a quick climb in holdings among Dogecoin addresses holding between 1 million DOGE to 100 million DOGE tokens. Particularly, the data shows that the collective holding of this cohort has grown from 27.79 billion on December 3 to 28.34 billion DOGE at the time of writing. That equates to an increase of about 550 million DOGE in roughly 48 hours, a meaningful inflow even for a large-cap crypto like Dogecoin. This trend shows that these mid-size and large holders view current prices as favorable entry points. Broad accumulation by this “whale tier” often precedes consolidation phases or, in some cases, precedes upward moves, especially if retail sentiment is weak and fewer coins are being sold into the market. Interestingly, this accumulation, which kicked off after Dogecoin fell to the mid-$0.13 range on December 3, contributed to a rebound at this level that contributed to the meme coin reaching an intraday high of $0.1504 in the past 24 hours. Is A Surge Coming For Dogecoin? Accumulation by larger wallets can reshape market conditions in subtle but meaningful ways. First, it reduces the circulating supply available to typical retail traders, which can tighten availability and potentially support price stability or upward pressure. Second, it reflects conviction. Large holders are showing confidence in DOGE’s long-term value, even when price action is not yet bullish. Furthermore, this recent buying represents the first clear shift in sentiment among whale cohor s after weeks of steady distribution. Santiment’s data shows that these wallets had been decreasing their balances since mid-October, and the trend coincided with a drop in large transactions that pushed activity to a two-month low. While accumulation may set the stage for a rally, there are still structural challenges that Dogecoin must face. T echnical analysis suggests that $0.138 is a critical level for confirming whether a firm bottom has formed. Sustained trading above that zone in the coming weeks would strengthen the case that the worst of the downturn is over. At the same time, crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus outlined a possible upside target in the $0.70 to $0.75 region as the peak of the current cycle. This price target aligns with other technical projections for the meme coin.",Dogecoin|Bitcoinsensus|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|meme coin|Santiment,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 00:00:52

Dogecoin Has A Large Supply Cluster Present At $0.20 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where resistance lies for Dogecoin based on Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). The CBD is an indicator that tells us about the amount of DOGE supply that was last acquired at the various price levels that the memecoin has visited in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the recent CBD heatmap for Dogecoin. As is visible in the graph, the Dogecoin CBD has flagged the zone around $0.20 as one where investors did some heavy buying. More specifically, over 11.7 billion tokens have their cost basis at this level. Considering that DOGE is trading notably under the mark right now, all this supply would naturally be in the red. The asset rising to this level could cause a strong reaction from the investors, as these tokens will get back to their break-even. Generally, holders in loss can be desperate for the price to reach back to their cost basis. Once the asset does rise to their acquisition level, some of these investors choose to sell, fearing that the rebound is only temporary. This can make large cost basis levels above the asset’s price potential zones of resistance. Between the current price and $0.20, there aren’t any other regions in the CBD that are as dense with supply. Based on this, Martinez has noted, “$0.20 is the key resistance for Dogecoin.” It now remains to be seen whether DOGE will retest this level anytime soon. In some other news, the memecoin has seen a spike in network activity recently, as the analyst has pointed out in another X post. In the chart, the indicator shown is the Number of Active Addresses, which measures, as its name suggests, the daily number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the Dogecoin network. It would appear that this indicator has registered a surge recently, with a peak 71,589 addresses making transfers on the blockchain. This is the largest spike that the metric has observed since September.

This announcement creates immediate buzz and signals potential new avenues for traders and investors. But what does this roadmap addition truly mean for you? Let’s explore the implications. What Is the Coinbase Listing Roadmap and Why Does It Matter? First, let’s clarify the process. The Coinbase listing roadmap is a public, forward-looking document the exchange uses to signal which assets it is actively exploring for potential future listing. It is not a guarantee of listing, but a strong indicator of interest. This transparency is a key part of Coinbase’s effort to build trust and manage market expectations. When a token appears on this roadmap, it often leads to increased visibility and trading interest in that asset across other platforms. Who Are IMU and SENT? A Closer Look at the Newcomers Understanding the projects behind the tokens is crucial. While specific details about IMU and SENT will require your own research (always DYOR—Do Your Own Research), their inclusion on the Coinbase listing roadmap suggests they have passed initial technical and compliance reviews. IMU (imu) : This token likely represents a project in the decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, or infrastructure space. Its presence on the roadmap indicates Coinbase sees growing ecosystem relevance. SENT (sent) : This asset is often associated with decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) or data oracle services. Its consideration points to Coinbase’s interest in expanding beyond pure currency tokens. The key takeaway? Coinbase is continuously scouting for innovative projects that add value to the broader crypto ecosystem. How Does This Benefit Crypto Investors? For the average investor, a Coinbase listing roadmap update is more than just news—it’s a strategic signal. Here’s why it matters for your portfolio: Early Awareness : The roadmap gives you a heads-up on assets Coinbase is seriously considering, allowing for earlier research. Validation : Earning a spot on the roadmap acts as a layer of validation for a project, as Coinbase’s compliance checks are rigorous. Liquidity & Access : If listed, these tokens gain access to Coinbase’s massive user base, typically boosting liquidity and stability. However, remember this is not financial advice. Roadmap inclusion does not equal a successful investment. Market volatility remains high, and prices can react unpredictably to listing news. What Are the Next Steps After a Roadmap Announcement? So, Coinbase added IMU and SENT to its Coinbase listing roadmap . What happens now? The journey from roadmap to live trading involves several stages: Further Evaluation : Coinbase engineers conduct deep technical reviews of the asset’s blockchain. Legal & Compliance Review : Teams ensure the asset meets regulatory standards. Integration : The asset is integrated into Coinbase’s trading systems. Final Announcement : Coinbase will make a separate, official announcement if and when IMU and SENT are approved for trading. This process underscores the importance of the roadmap as a planning tool for both the exchange and the community. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for a Growing Ecosystem The addition of IMU and SENT to the Coinbase listing roadmap is a significant development. It highlights Coinbase’s ongoing mission to diversify its offerings and support the growth of the crypto space. For investors, it serves as a valuable research prompt and a reminder of the dynamic nature of this market. By paying attention to these roadmap updates, you can stay informed about potential new trends and opportunities shaping the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does being on the Coinbase listing roadmap guarantee a listing? A: No. The roadmap indicates exploration and interest, but it is not a guarantee. Final listing depends on successful completion of technical, security, and legal reviews. Q: When will IMU and SENT start trading on Coinbase? A: There is no set timeline. Coinbase will make a separate announcement if and when the assets are approved for trading. The roadmap only signals the evaluation phase. Q: Should I buy IMU or SENT now because of this news?

This is no longer a distant dream. Plume, a blockchain built for regulatory-compliant real-world assets (RWA), has just announced a pivotal move to bring its institutional-grade real-world asset yields to the Solana network. This integration bridges a crucial gap, offering crypto natives a trusted gateway to yields backed by real economy assets. What Are Real-World Asset Yields on Solana? Simply put, real-world asset yields are returns generated from tangible, off-chain investments like government bonds, corporate credit, or receivables. Traditionally, these are accessed through banks or brokers. Plume’s initiative tokenizes these assets, allowing them to be held and traded on-chain. By bringing this to Solana, users can now tap into these yields with the speed and low cost the network is famous for. This is a significant step for decentralized finance (DeFi), moving beyond purely crypto-native yields to include those from the broader global economy. Which Vaults Are Coming to Solana? Plume isn’t starting small. The project is onboarding five established “Nest” vaults to the Solana ecosystem, each backed by major traditional finance names. This provides immediate credibility and a diverse range of yield sources. Here are the vaults making the leap: nBASIS & nALPHA: Backed by assets from Hamilton Lane and BlackOpal, focusing on institutional private credit. nTBILL: Collateralized by short-term U.S. Treasury bills, offering a government-backed yield option. nWISDOM & nOPAL: Featuring assets from WisdomTree and Securitize, providing access to a basket of institutional investment strategies. Each vault represents a different slice of the real-world economy, from private equity to secure government debt, all now accessible with a Solana wallet. How Can You Maximize These Real-World Asset Yields? Accessing the yield is just the beginning. The Solana DeFi ecosystem is poised to amplify the utility of these tokenized RWAs. Notably, the Solana-based protocol Loopscale has plans to launch a feature that will let users employ leverage using their Nest vault tokens. This means you could potentially use your nTBILL tokens as collateral to borrow and amplify your position, seeking greater returns. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage increases risk alongside potential reward. This native integration showcases how Solana’s composability can create new financial primitives around real-world asset yields . Why Does This Matter for the Future of Crypto? This move is more than just another protocol launch. It represents a maturation of the crypto space. By offering compliant, tangible yields, projects like Plume address a major criticism of DeFi: the lack of sustainable, non-inflationary income streams. For Solana, it strengthens the network’s value proposition as a home for serious financial innovation beyond speculation. For the average user, it provides a compelling reason to hold assets on-chain, knowing they can generate steady real-world asset yields from a diversified portfolio. This bridges the gap between TradFi reliability and DeFi efficiency. Conclusion: A New Era for On-Chain Finance The arrival of Plume’s RWA vaults on Solana is a landmark event. It signals a shift towards a more robust, diversified, and sustainable financial ecosystem built on blockchain technology. Users gain access to institutional-grade yield sources with the permissionless access of crypto. While navigating regulatory compliance remains key, this partnership paves the way for a future where the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur, all powered by the pursuit of genuine real-world asset yields . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly are real-world assets (RWAs) in crypto? A: RWAs are tangible, off-chain assets like real estate, bonds, or commodities that are tokenized (represented as digital tokens) on a blockchain. This allows them to be traded, owned fractionally, and integrated into DeFi applications. Q: How do I access Plume’s yields on Solana? A: You will need a Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom). Once the vaults are live, you can visit Plume’s or a supported partner’s interface to deposit into the specific Nest vault (nTBILL, nALPHA, etc.) of your choice. Q: Are these yields safer than typical DeFi yields? A: They are backed by different underlying assets. While no investment is risk-free, yields from government bonds (like nTBILL) are generally considered lower risk than yields from untested crypto farming pools, as they are backed by sovereign entities. Always do your own research. Q: What is the role of Loopscale? A: Loopscale is a Solana protocol planning to allow users to use their Nest vault tokens as collateral to take out loans. This “leverage” feature lets users potentially increase their exposure and returns, but it also significantly increases risk. Q: Is my investment in these vaults liquid? A: Liquidity will depend on the specific vault and the secondary markets that develop for their tokens. The involvement of major firms suggests efforts will be made to ensure reasonable liquidity, but it may not be as instant as trading major cryptocurrencies. Q: Why is Solana a good network for this? A: Solana offers high transaction throughput and very low fees, which is essential for making small, frequent yield payments economically viable and for ensuring a smooth user experience when managing positions.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plummeted five points to a score of 23, officially re-entering the “Extreme Fear” territory. This sudden shift signals rising anxiety among investors and can often precede significant price volatility. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and is extreme fear always a bad sign? Let’s break down the data and uncover the opportunities hidden within the panic. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial barometer for investor emotion. Created by Alternative.me, it compiles multiple data points into a single, easy-to-understand number. A score of 0 represents maximum fear, while 100 signals extreme greed. The current reading of 23 is a clear warning sign that negative sentiment is dominating the market. This drop didn’t happen in a vacuum; it reflects a combination of recent price swings, social media chatter, and search trends all pointing toward caution. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t just a guess. It’s a data-driven formula designed to capture the market’s pulse. Understanding its components helps you see beyond the headline number. The calculation is based on six key factors: Volatility (25%): Recent price swings, especially sharp downturns, increase the fear score. Market Volume (25%): High trading volume during sell-offs amplifies fear signals. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of mentions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls and community sentiment checks. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s market share rises, it often indicates a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like “Bitcoin crash” or “crypto bear market.” Therefore, the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score synthesizes all these real-time signals into one digestible metric. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Extreme Fear? It’s natural to feel nervous when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes red. However, seasoned investors often view extreme fear through a different lens. Historically, prolonged periods of fear have created some of the best long-term buying opportunities. When everyone is selling in panic, asset prices can disconnect from their fundamental value. This doesn’t mean you should blindly buy the dip, but it’s a signal to start paying closer attention. The key is to have a plan and not let emotion dictate your actions. Actionable Insights for Trading in a Fearful Market Navigating a market governed by fear requires discipline. Here are practical steps to consider: Review Your Strategy: Does your plan account for high volatility? Stick to it. Practice Risk Management: This is not the time for high leverage. Ensure your positions are sized appropriately. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Use the quiet time to research projects you believe in. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Spreading purchases over time can reduce the impact of buying at a peak. Remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. It tells you what the crowd is feeling, not what will happen next. The Bottom Line on Today’s Market Sentiment The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 23 is a significant shift in market psychology. It confirms that the current environment is risk-averse and emotionally charged. While this presents challenges, it also separates impulsive traders from strategic investors. By understanding the metrics behind the fear, you can make informed decisions rather than reactive ones. Market cycles always turn, and sentiment indicators are often most useful at their extremes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 23 mean? A: A score of 23 falls into the “Extreme Fear” zone (0-25). It indicates that current market data and sentiment are overwhelmingly negative and fearful. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a good predictor of price? A: It is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. However, sustained extreme fear has often coincided with market bottoms, while extreme greed has marked tops. Q: How often is the index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market emotion. Q: Should I sell when the index shows extreme fear? A: Not necessarily. Selling during extreme fear often means selling at a low. Many investors use it as a contrarian indicator to look for potential entry points, always within their risk tolerance. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin dominance is a component, the index aims to measure sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market.

According to data from Onchain-Lenz, these digital vaults, untouched since the early days of Bitcoin, transferred a colossal 2,000 BTC—worth approximately $178.29 million—to a new address. This event is not just a transaction; it’s a piece of blockchain history coming to life, prompting urgent questions about market impact and the motives behind this monumental shift. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Whale Movement Mean? When Bitcoin whale addresses of this vintage stir, the entire market pays attention. These specific addresses received their Bitcoin in 2013, a time when the network was in its infancy and the price was a fraction of today’s value. The sheer scale of this transfer, moving nearly $180 million in a single action, represents a significant potential supply shock. Analysts are now scrambling to interpret the signal. Is this a strategic sell-off, a portfolio reorganization, or simply the movement of assets to a more secure modern wallet? The intent behind the move from these specific Bitcoin whale addresses will dictate its short-term impact on liquidity and price sentiment. Why Are Dormant Coins So Significant? The movement of long-dormant coins is a rare and powerful on-chain metric. Think of these Bitcoin whale addresses as digital time capsules. Their inactivity for over a decade suggests the holders are original, patient investors—often called “HODLers.” Their decision to act now can be interpreted in several ways: Market Timing: The holder may believe a market top is near and is preparing to realize historic gains. Estate Planning: After 13 years, this could involve transferring wealth to heirs or a trust. Security Upgrade: Moving funds from an older, potentially vulnerable wallet to a new, more secure address. Institutional Action: The coins could be moving to a custody solution for a fund or corporate treasury. Each scenario carries different implications for whether these Bitcoins will hit the open market or simply change hands privately. How Could This Affect the Bitcoin Price? The immediate fear with any large movement from Bitcoin whale addresses is a sell-off that pressures the price. However, a transfer does not equal a sale. The key is tracking the destination address. If the 2,000 BTC moves to a known exchange deposit wallet, it strongly signals an impending sale, which could create downward pressure. Conversely, if it goes to another private, cold storage address, the market impact may be neutral or even positive, as it demonstrates continued long-term holding by a major player. This event serves as a crucial reminder of the power held within a few key Bitcoin whale addresses and their ability to influence market psychology. What Can Everyday Investors Learn From This? While most of us aren’t moving nine-figure sums, there are actionable insights from this whale activity. First, it highlights the incredible long-term value creation possible with Bitcoin. Second, it underscores the importance of secure, future-proof storage solutions. Finally, it teaches us to monitor on-chain data not for day-trading signals, but for understanding the behavior of the market’s most influential participants. Watching these Bitcoin whale addresses provides context, not a crystal ball. In conclusion, the awakening of these two dormant giants is a fascinating chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story. It connects the crypto present directly to its pioneering past. Whether this leads to market volatility or simply becomes a footnote, it reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value that can be preserved across decades. The movement from these historic Bitcoin whale addresses is a powerful testament to the asset’s resilience and the patience of its earliest believers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a “Bitcoin whale”? A: A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of Bitcoin that their transactions can potentially influence the market price. There’s no official threshold, but addresses holding thousands of BTC are universally considered whales. Q2: Why were these addresses dormant for 13 years? A: The holders likely acquired Bitcoin very early (around 2013) and chose a “HODL” strategy, meaning they bought and held through multiple market cycles without selling, possibly believing in its long-term potential as a digital gold. Q3: Does moving coins mean they are selling? A: Not necessarily. A transfer between private wallets is just a change of storage address. The key indicator of a sale is if the coins are sent to a deposit address at a cryptocurrency exchange. Q4: How can I track whale activity myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or Etherscan for Ethereum, or dedicated on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode or IntoTheBlock, which often highlight large and unusual transactions. Q5: Should I be worried about whale sales? A: While large sales can cause short-term price dips, Bitcoin’s market is now more liquid and institutionalized than ever. Whale movements are one factor among many, including macroeconomic trends and adoption rates. Q6: What’s the largest Bitcoin whale transaction ever recorded? A: Some of the largest involve transfers between wallets controlled by exchanges or institutional custodians. Single movements of tens of thousands of BTC have occurred, often related to internal reorganizations rather than individual sales.

In a market note published on Dec. 5, CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, said the latest solvency concerns “look misplaced,” pointing to Tether’s most recent attestation, which shows a headline surplus of assets over liabilities. Butterfill argued the numbers do not, at present, indicate a systemic vulnerability for USDT. The recent pushback follows Hayes’ recent warning that as Tether increases its exposure to Bitcoin and gold, it will also make it increasingly likely that a steep pullback in these assets could undermine its cushion on equity. He sai d a roughly 30% decline in those assets could, in theory, wipe out Tether’s equity buffer and render USDT “theoretically insolvent.” That argument quickly spread across crypto news sites and social media feeds. Butterfill replied with a short assessment of the data. The most recent attestation by Tether shows $181 billion in reserves and approximately $174.45 billion in liabilities, resulting in a surplus of nearly $6.55 billion. The study note also noted Tether’s abnormally strong profitability this year, with a year-to-date profit of more than $10 billion, and found that the available data at present does not imply a systemic weakness. CoinShares says Tether’s profits and surplus reserves blunt volatility risks CoinShares acknowledged that there are risks associated with stablecoins and should not be overlooked, but still stated that the current Tether data have not shown signs of systemic vulnerability. “Tether is still one of the most profitable companies in the sector, generating $10 billion in the first three quarters of the year — an unusually high figure on a per-employee basis ,” CoinShares’ head of research wrote. Tether’s Q3 disclosures — confirmed in an attestation it issued and widely reported by industry press — break down substantial portions of its reserves as large holdings of U.S. Treasuries (roughly $135 billion), along with approximately $12.9 billion of gold and $9.9 billion of Bitcoin. Those gold and Bitcoin positions are exactly the ones Hayes named as potential sources of volatility; CoinShares recognised the exposure, but added that the headline reserve — liability gap and strong profitability mitigate near-solvency risk. Tether counters solvency fears as critics target high-risk assets Although speculation about Tether’s financial health is hardly new — media outlets have been tracking its reserves and asset backing for years — the latest flurry of solvency concerns appears to have arisen thanks to Arthur Hayes. Last week, the BitMEX co-founder said it was “in the early innings of running a massive interest-rate trade,” claiming a 30% drop in its Bitcoin and gold holdings would “wipe out their equity” and leave its USDt stablecoin technically “insolvent.” Both assets make up a substantial portion of Tether’s reserves, with the firm increasing its gold exposure in recent years. Tether is facing criticism from more than just Hayes. CEO Paolo Ardoino recently pushed back on S&P Global’s downgrade of USDt’s ability to defend its US dollar peg, dismissing the move as “Tether FUD” — shorthand for fear, uncertainty, and doubt — and citing the company’s third-quarter attestation report in its defense. S&P Global downgraded the stablecoin due to stability concerns, citing its exposure to “higher-risk” assets, including gold, loans, and Bitcoin. According to CoinMarketCap, Tether’s USDt remains the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with $185.5 billion in circulation and a market share of nearly 59%.

This pivotal development could unlock a new wave of mainstream investment into the SUI token, directly bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative Sui blockchain. What Does Grayscale’s Sui ETF Filing Mean? Grayscale’s submission of an S-1 registration statement for a Sui ETF is a formal request to create a publicly traded fund. Therefore, if approved, investors could buy and sell shares of this ETF on traditional stock exchanges, gaining exposure to SUI’s price without managing private wallets or crypto exchanges. This process mirrors the path taken by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, marking a significant maturity milestone for the Sui network. Why Is This a Game-Changer for SUI? The filing is more than just paperwork; it’s a powerful endorsement. Grayscale, a titan in digital asset management, sees long-term value in Sui. Consequently, a Sui ETF would provide several key benefits: Accessibility: Opens SUI investment to retirement accounts and traditional brokers. Legitimacy: Enhances regulatory clarity and institutional trust in the asset. Liquidity: Potentially increases trading volume and market stability for SUI. However, the journey is just beginning. The SEC’s review will be thorough, focusing on market manipulation concerns and custody solutions. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the Sui ETF? Approval is not guaranteed. The SEC has historically been cautious with crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. Key hurdles include: Regulatory Scrutiny: How will the SEC classify SUI? Is it a security or a commodity? Market Surveillance: The SEC requires a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size. Custody: Providing proof of secure, compliant asset storage is paramount. Grayscale’s experience and resources give this Sui ETF proposal a strong foundation, but patience will be essential. How Does This Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs paved the way. Now, the race is on for the next generation of single-asset crypto funds. A Sui ETF would place SUI in an elite category alongside Ethereum, signaling its perceived importance in the smart contract platform arena. This move could pressure other asset managers to file for similar products, creating a competitive and innovative landscape. What Should Investors Do Now? For now, this is a development to watch closely. The filing is a profoundly bullish long-term signal for the Sui ecosystem. Investors should: Research the Sui Network: Understand its technology and use cases beyond the ETF news. Monitor SEC Announcements: The review process will provide critical updates. Assess Personal Strategy: Determine how a potential Sui ETF fits into a diversified portfolio. In summary, Grayscale’s Sui ETF filing is a landmark moment of validation. It represents a crucial bridge being built between Sui’s cutting-edge technology and the vast pools of traditional capital. While regulatory hurdles remain, this step forward illuminates a clear path toward mainstream financial integration for SUI, potentially reshaping its market trajectory for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Sui ETF? A Sui ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) would be an investment fund traded on stock exchanges. Its value would be tied to the price of the SUI cryptocurrency, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly buying or storing the token. Has the Sui ETF been approved? No. Grayscale has only filed the initial registration paperwork (Form S-1) with the SEC. Approval is not guaranteed and will likely take several months, if it happens at all. Why is Grayscale filing for a Sui ETF important? It signals serious institutional interest and could pave the way for easier, regulated investment in SUI for a much wider audience, including through retirement and brokerage accounts. What is the difference between Grayscale’s Sui Trust and a Sui ETF? Grayscale’s existing Sui Trust (if it exists) is a private, closed-end fund often trading at a premium or discount to the asset’s value. An ETF is more efficient, typically trades closer to the net asset value, and offers creation/redemption mechanisms to keep prices in line. How long does the SEC ETF approval process take? The timeline is unpredictable. It can range from several months to over a year, depending on the political climate, regulatory concerns, and the completeness of the application. Can I invest in the Sui ETF now? Not yet. You cannot invest until the SEC declares the registration statement “effective” and the ETF launches on a national stock exchange like NYSE Arca or Nasdaq.

Solana (SOL) remains to be one of the hardest-hitting altcoins in the marketplace, recognized for speed, scalability, and heightened liquidity, although the latest developments in this project have left investors wondering whether it still has what it takes to top past explosive growth milestones. In light of this prevailing uncertainty, many investors are naturally gravitating toward those assets that have higher asymmetry ratios and are at the early stages of development and showing real-world use and rapid adoption. And in this developing scenario, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the latest and hottest digital currency at just only $0.035, has naturally topped the list of the current best cryptos to invest in due to its nearly sold-out presale Phase 6, over 18,300 holders, and its upcoming V1 launch. Solana Remains at Crucial Levels as Market Participants Look for Breakout Points Solana (SOL) remains at the doorstep of a strong level of support in what has obviously been a period of consolidation, and traders are eagerly observing whether or not it anticipates breakout action that will allow it to finally push on towards the $200 to $280 level and beyond, particularly when taken in the context of strong levels of volatility that continue to be such an important defining factor for this asset class at this point in time. In an era in which investors are attempting to survey every possible opportunity on the market, this change in direction is naturally of much interest in relation to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which remains a brand-new addition to the world of cryptocurrencies at this point in time. Mutuum Finance Presale Speeds Up Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at just $0.01 per token. Since then, it has continuously increased in value to the current level of $0.035, showing a 250% appreciation in token value prior to launch. Each of the preceding stages sold out rapidly, showing steady and rising enthusiasm for this project amongst the international crypto community at large. Currently, Stage 6 is nearing completion and is amongst the most exciting stages of the presales. Investors are well aware that after the end of this phase of the presale, the token values are soon about to approach the expected launch price of $0.06, making this the ideal moment to acquire MUTM at just less than $0.04. Having raised in excess of $19.15 million thus far, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself at the top of the list for the very best crypto to invest in and amongst the top picks for emerging crypto sites of 2025. Effective Security Framework and Risk Management System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is based on the Loan-to-Value (LTV) model that balances risk on the asset side via collateralization, transfer, and liquidation functions. MUTM also employs a reserve factor and market condition buffer for extra protection in case of unexpected changes in the market. High-risk assets are carefully handled in a way that prioritizes the safety of both MUTM and the users. Protocol Mechanics and Interest Rate Model MUTM protocol uses interest rates that fluctuate in accordance with the market rates and liquidity. If liquidity is high in the market, the rates for borrowing are lowered to attract borrowing. However, when liquidity in the market is low, the rates are raised to ensure solvency and promote additional deposits. In this case, for those borrowing in order to create stability, fixed-rate borrowing also exists, and this rate is normally higher compared to those that are variable and can only be accessed in highly liquid collateral. Mutuum Finance uses strong risk management methods for protecting the system. Some of the important features are: Efficient liquidation systems for under-collateralized positions Over-collateralization of loans for protecting the lenders and the protocol Cascading Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios to control exposure Liquidity ceilings together with reserve factors for solvency in case of difficult markets Liquidation fees and risk buffers for covering losses and ensuring stability In this manner, several forces align together in order to create an enduring and secure borrowing and lending marketplace that can resist and overcome extreme changes in the markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has garnered over $19.15 million in funding with 18,300+ investors in its presale phase and the token is up 250% from 0.01 to 0.035. In the midst of Solana network consolidation, this makes for very promising early investment potential and genuine DeFi applications. Lock in those investments now before the end of phase 6 when values are expected to get to $0.06 at launch. Participate in the presale today and gain access to this emerging crypto asset and enjoy the best crypto to invest options in the current market. Mutuum Finance is undoubtedly the best crypto investment for those looking for potential growth and genuine applications.

55407316,640822,1764982826,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55407316.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Company Is About To List on The New York Stock Exchange,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-company-nyse/,"On 3rd December, official filings and press releases announced Twenty One Capital’s upcoming debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), positioning the company as one of the largest Bitcoin treasury firms ever to enter public markets. The listing brings a dedicated Bitcoin balance sheet into Wall Street’s core ecosystem, signaling a structural shift in how institutional investors can gain long-term BTC exposure. A Bitcoin Treasury Giant Steps Onto The NYSE Stage Twenty One Capital’s NYSE entry is anchored by its business combination with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) , the SPAC serving as the public-market vehicle for the transaction. CEP shareholders have already approved the merger, and the deal is expected to close around December 8. Once completed, the combined entity will operate as Twenty One Capital, Inc. and begin trading on December 9 under the ticker XXI. The original announcement, released through official press channels and SEC-related filings, emphasized CEP’s central role in enabling the listing and establishing the company’s public-market structure. CEO Jack Mallers also highlighted the milestone on X, noting the company’s readiness for its debut. According to this press announcement, Twenty One Capital will debut with an estimated 43,500 BTC , a reserve valued near $4 billion at recent market levels. This immediately places it among the top corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally . Unlike companies that hold Bitcoin as a secondary reserve, Twenty One is specifically engineered around a Bitcoin-native model. The firm intends to report “Bitcoin-per-share,” providing investors a transparent look at how much BTC each equity unit represents. It also pledges full, on-chain proof-of-reserves, positioning itself as a high-transparency asset custodian at launch. This model effectively transforms Twenty One into a regulated balance-sheet wrapper for Bitcoin . It lowers operational friction for institutional allocators who want direct BTC exposure without the complexities of crypto custody, self-storage, or exchange-based acquisition. By listing on the NYSE rather than relying on ETFs or derivatives, Twenty One creates a regulated public equity vehicle that holds, safeguards, and transparently tracks Bitcoin for institutional and retail investors alike. Wall Street’s New On-Ramp To Institutional BTC Exposure The market impact of Twenty One’s listing reflects the accelerating integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial architecture. The company’s backers—including Tether-linked entities, Bitfinex-aligned interests , SoftBank-connected capital, and Cantor’s public-markets network—provide a cross-sector foundation aimed at bridging crypto-native philosophies with institutional liquidity channels. Under this structure, Twenty One aims to become a long-term institutional treasury vessel —a regulated balance sheet that accumulates BTC and gives investors an equity-linked way to participate in Bitcoin’s upside without engaging directly with crypto custody or trading infrastructure. As the NYSE debut approaches, Twenty One Capital embodies a pivot point where BTC’s role in capital markets shifts from speculative asset to institutional treasury instrument. If XXI attracts sustained flow, it could set a new blueprint for how corporate entities engage with Bitcoin—anchoring Wall Street’s next phase of digital-asset adoption.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 01:00:26

He pointed to weakening selling pressure and growing underlying activity as reasons for cautious optimism. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets Market Sentiment May Be Near A Turning Point According to Lee, mood on the street turned darker after October, with many investors showing fatigue after steady losses. He said the current selling looks closer to exhaustion than to the start of another major decline. Trading desks have cut back. Volume has thinned. Sentiment is low. Lee argued that often, when pessimism peaks, conditions for a reversal begin to form. Bitcoin Drawdowns Are Not Uncommon Based on reports, Bitcoin has fallen about 36% from its all-time high in the recent retreat. That size of drop has happened in prior cycles, including 2017 and 2021, and has been followed by rallies that reached new records. “Crypto prices likely bottomed. The best years of growth are still ahead: there is 200x adoption to come.” – Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine pic.twitter.com/fPWbWdaosO — Binance (@binance) December 4, 2025 Lee pointed to long-term returns for bitcoin and ether compared with some traditional assets over the last decade, saying crypto’s gains were larger. He used that history to support the idea that patient holders have been rewarded after past stress. Tokenization Could Be A Major Story In 2026 Lee also presented tokenization as a key theme for the future. He said large institutions are preparing to move more financial products on-chain and that, if real estate joins the shift, close to a quadrillion dollars in assets could eventually be tokenized. Stablecoins were cited as an early example of why tokenized instruments can attract demand. He suggested that a broader institutional push could add steady interest to the market over time. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Was Highlighted As A Signal Reports have disclosed that BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF has become one of the firm’s top fee-earning products, a fact Lee used to show growing involvement from legacy finance. That kind of institutional participation, he argued, points to deeper engagement from big players who were previously on the sidelines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Fails To Shake Ripple CEO — He Still Calls For $180K Adoption Gap Suggests Large Upside According to Lee, only 4.4 million bitcoin wallets hold more than $10,000 in BTC, while nearly 900 million people globally have more than $10,000 in retirement savings. He said that gap shows how early the market still is and argued that if just a fraction of those savers put money into bitcoin, adoption could expand by as much as 200 times. The figure is speculative, he acknowledged, but he used it to show the potential scale for future demand. What This Means For Investors Now Lee questioned whether the old four-year cycle should be used as a strict guide. He suggested recent moves were driven more by de-leveraging and structural shifts than by the halving rhythm that shaped earlier cycles.

In a move sending shockwaves through both traditional finance and digital asset circles, global index provider MSCI is reportedly considering a policy that could see companies with substantial crypto holdings booted from its influential benchmarks. This proposal strikes at the heart of a growing trend: public companies using their balance sheets to bet big on Bitcoin and other digital assets. What is MSCI Proposing for Companies with Major Crypto Holdings? According to a report from The Block, MSCI is weighing a new rule that would exclude companies from its indexes if their digital asset holdings exceed 50% of their total assets. Index providers like MSCI create the benchmarks that guide trillions of dollars in institutional investment through funds like ETFs. Therefore, inclusion or exclusion from these indexes is a major deal for a company’s visibility and investor appeal. This threshold is not arbitrary. It directly targets a specific class of firm that has emerged in recent years: the corporate Bitcoin whale. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business intelligence company that has transformed itself into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle. With over 650,000 BTC on its books, its crypto holdings far surpass the proposed 50% limit, making it a prime candidate for removal if the policy is enacted. Why is This MSCI Crypto Policy So Controversial? The reaction from the crypto-invested community was swift and pointed. Strive, a Nasdaq-listed asset manager that also holds Bitcoin, sent a strongly-worded letter to MSCI CEO Henry Fernandez. Their core argument challenges the very premise of the rule. Undermining Market Neutrality: Strive contends that setting an arbitrary cap on crypto holdings violates the principle of market neutrality that index providers are supposed to uphold. An index should reflect the market, not judge a company’s strategy. Picking Winners and Losers: The firm argues that evaluating a company’s financial strategy should be left to investors and market mechanisms, not an index committee. By setting this limit, MSCI would be making a value judgment on the legitimacy of holding digital assets. A Slippery Slope: Critics ask: if 50% for crypto, what about other asset classes? Should companies be excluded for holding too much gold, real estate, or treasury bonds? The policy sets a concerning precedent for active management of index constituents. What Are the Real-World Implications of Excluding Crypto Holdings? If implemented, the fallout would extend beyond just a few companies getting a demerit. The consequences could reshape investment flows and corporate strategy. First, companies like MicroStrategy could face immediate selling pressure from index funds and ETFs that track MSCI benchmarks. These funds are mandated to mirror the index, forcing them to sell any excluded stock. This creates a potential liquidity event unrelated to the company’s performance or Bitcoin’s price. Second, it sends a chilling signal to other public companies considering adding Bitcoin to their treasury. The threat of index exclusion adds a new layer of reputational and financial risk. Why would a CFO risk their company’s place in a major index for a volatile asset class that the index provider seemingly disapproves of? Finally, it highlights the growing tension between the innovative, disruptive world of cryptocurrency and the established, rules-based world of institutional finance. As crypto holdings move from the fringe to the mainstream, traditional systems are grappling with how to categorize and regulate them. The Bottom Line: A Pivotal Moment for Institutional Crypto MSCI’s consideration is more than a minor rule change; it’s a litmus test for digital assets in traditional finance. Will major institutions adapt their frameworks to accommodate this new asset class, or will they erect barriers to maintain the status quo? The debate over crypto holdings in corporate treasuries is now moving from boardrooms to index committee rooms. The outcome will influence whether cryptocurrency remains a parallel investment universe or becomes fully integrated into the global financial system. For investors, the key takeaway is to watch this space closely. Index provider policies are a powerful, behind-the-scenes force that can significantly impact asset prices and market structure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is MSCI? A: MSCI Inc. is a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community. They create and maintain stock market indexes that are used as benchmarks for trillions of dollars in investment funds. Q: Which company is most at risk from this proposed MSCI rule? A: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is the most prominent example. The company’s Bitcoin holdings represent a vast majority of its total assets, far exceeding the proposed 50% threshold, making it a likely candidate for exclusion. Q: Why does index inclusion matter so much? A: Inclusion in a major index like those from MSCI guarantees automatic buying from passive index funds and ETFs that track it. This provides consistent demand, liquidity, and prestige. Exclusion triggers forced selling from those same funds. Q: Has MSCI made a final decision? A> No. As of this reporting, MSCI is only “considering” the proposal. It has not been implemented as official policy. The strong pushback from firms like Strive may influence the final outcome. Q: Does this affect Bitcoin ETFs like the spot Bitcoin ETF? A> Not directly. This proposal concerns companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet (like MicroStrategy), not funds that hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset (like a Bitcoin ETF). However, it reflects a broader institutional scrutiny of crypto exposure. Found this analysis of MSCI’s potential crypto crackdown insightful?

Under the new ruling, any agreement that designates Google Search , or its AI-powered services, as the default choice on smartphones, tablets, or browsers can no longer be locked in for a period of multiple years. Instead, such deals must be renewed annually, allowing device makers and other platform operators to reconsider and potentially choose rivals. Based in Washington, Judge Mehta had earlier consulted the US Justice Department on this ruling before implementing the decision. After careful consideration, the department agreed to conduct this annual review. Notably, this is a primary change that the search giant is required to embrace among other suggested changes. The judge arrived at this decision after it was confirmed that the tech firm illegally controlled online search. Judge Mehta’s ruling opens the door for AI rivals Following Judge Mehta’s recent decision, the tech industry expressed excitement about a potential positive change in the ecosystem. This is because the yearly renegotiation will grant rivals, particularly those in the expanding generative AI market, the opportunity to compete for crucial positions. Interestingly, the judge’s final decision has not interfered with Google’s operations. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the tech giant is still allowed to offer its products to Apple Inc., which are useful in the firm’s popular iPhone. It is still permitted to pay other electronics firms, such as Samsung Electronics Co., for default placement. However, even with this freedom in place, Mehta still insisted that these contracts needed to be renewed annually. The federal judge issued this reminder after noting that both Google and the US government had demonstrated their ability to comply with the one-year restriction on default contracts. Therefore, this situation prompted him to conclude that “the court holds that a strict termination requirement after one year would best serve the purpose of the injunctive relief.” The ruling triggered heated debates among individuals. Considering the intense nature of the situation, reporters attempted to reach out to Google and the Justice Department for comments on the topic under discussion to ease this controversy. Nonetheless, they declined to respond. On the other hand, several analysts weighed in on the matter. They acknowledged that Google’s case was a lengthy legal battle. To support this claim, reports highlighted that Mehta ruled that the tech giant was guilty of illegally monopolizing online search and search advertising markets in August 2024, following a 10-week trial. Afterwards, he held a second trial in spring 2025, purposefully to examine the Justice Department’s request for the tech company to sell off its popular web browser, Chrome. Google plans to appeal Mehta’s initial ruling Regarding the Justice Department’s request, sources with knowledge of the situation mentioned that Mehta rejected that request for Google to sell off its popular web browser, Chrome. He argued that the best approach to this case was for the search giant to share specific data connected to its search results with rivals. The federal judge arrived at this decision in September 2025. This ruling provided more details on earlier released reports regarding when the tech firm is required to share its data and to whom it must share the information. Meanwhile, according to Mehta’s September ruling, Google was not allowed to pay firms to use its Search, Chrome web browser, or Google Play Store exclusively. However, he did not decide to prohibit all payments. Additionally, it is worth noting that this ruling incorporated parts of suggestions from both Google and the Justice Department, which led the judge to consider issuing a second ruling to clarify certain technical terms from the initial decision. Although Google promised to adhere to the judge’s decision, it made clear its intention to appeal Mehta’s original ruling, which implied that its contracts with firms such as Apple and Samsung, under which its search engine is set as the default, break US antitrust laws. After this announcement was made public, analysts noted that there is a high likelihood that the Justice Department may also think about appealing Mehta’s remedy decision.

Tom Lee Revives Bullish Call For 2026",https://bitcoinist.com/62000-ethereum-tom-lee-revives-bullish-call-2026/,"Tom Lee has reiterated one of the most aggressive Ethereum targets in the market, telling attendees at Binance Blockchain Week on 4 December that ETH could eventually trade at $62,000 as it becomes the core infrastructure for tokenized finance. “Okay, so let me explain to you why Ethereum, now that we’ve talked about crypto, is the future of finance,” Lee said on stage. He framed 2025 as Ethereum’s “ 1971 moment ,” drawing a direct analogy to when the US dollar left the gold standard and triggered a wave of financial innovation. Lee’s Thesis For Ethereum “In 1971, the dollar went off the gold standard. And in 1971, it galvanized Wall Street to create financial products to make sure the dollar would be the reserve currency,” Lee argued. “Well, in 2025, we’re tokenizing everything . So it’s not just the dollar that’s getting tokenized, but it’s stocks, bonds, real estate.” In his view, this shift positions ETH as the primary settlement and execution layer for tokenized assets. “Wall Street is, again, going to take advantage of that and create products onto a smart contract platform. And where they’re building this is on Ethereum,” he said. Lee pointed to current real-world asset experiments as early evidence, noting that “the majority of this, the vast majority, is being built on Ethereum,” and adding that “Ethereum has won the smart contract war.” Lee also stressed that ETH’s market behavior has not yet reflected that structural role. “As you know, ETH has been range bound for five years, as I’ve shaded here. But it’s begun to break out,” he told the audience, explaining why he “got very involved with Ethereum by turning Bitmine into an ETH treasury company , because we saw this breakout coming.” The core of his valuation case is expressed through the ETH/BTC ratio. Lee expects Bitcoin to move sharply higher in the near term: “I think Bitcoin is going to get to $250,000 within a few months.” From there, he derives two key ETH scenarios. First, if the ETH/BTC price relationship simply reverts to its historical mean, he sees substantial upside. “If ETH price ratio to Bitcoin gets back to its eight year average, that’s $12,000 for Ethereum,” he said. Second, in a more aggressive case where ETH appreciates to a quarter of Bitcoin’s price, his long-standing $62,000 target emerges: “If it gets to 0.25 relative to Bitcoin, that’s $62,000.” TOM LEE CALLS FOR $62,000 $ETH “I think Ethereum’s going to become the future of finance, the payment rails of the future and if it gets to .25 relative to Bitcoin that’s $62,000. Ethereum at $3,000 is grossly undervalued.” pic.twitter.com/VydvLou9IE — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) December 4, 2025 Lee links these ratios directly to the tokenization narrative. “If 2026 is about tokenization, that means Ether’s utility value should be rising. Therefore, you should watch this ratio,” he told the crowd, arguing that valuation should track growing demand for ETH blockspace and its role as “the payment rails of the future.” He concluded with a pointed assessment of current levels: “I think Ethereum at $3,000, of course, is grossly undervalued.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,128.",Ethereum|BitMine|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Tom Lee,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 02:00:10

Bitcoin Price Recovery At Risk? Market expert Rekt Fencer recently shared insights on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, suggesting that the Bitcoin price might be forming what he calls a “massive bull trap.” This term refers to a deceptive bullish signal in which the price briefly surpasses a resistance level, in this case, the $90,000 mark, only to reverse into a decline. Such movements can entrap investors who bought in during the peak, leading to significant losses. Related Reading: XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6 Fencer pointed out a troubling pattern reminiscent of early 2022 when Bitcoin reclaimed its 50-week moving average (MA)—currently positioned above $102,300—before experiencing a severe decline of roughly 60%, plummeting below $20,000 by June of that year. He indicated that the recent price recovery following major drops to $84,000 should not be interpreted as a signal of near-term success, especially since the Bitcoin price is currently trading under the 50-week MA. If historical trends repeat, this could mean that Bitcoin might see a significant drop, potentially reaching around $36,200, which could potentially represent the low point of the bearish cycle for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, there are analysts who retain a bullish outlook. BTC Bottom In Sight? Market researcher and analyst Miles Deutscher expressed a confident sentiment, stating he believes there is a 91.5% likelihood that the Bitcoin price has hit its bottom, based on his analysis of key developments. He noted that recent weeks have been dominated by negative news stories, including concerns surrounding Tether (USDT) and the implications of China’s actions on crypto, which he asserts often mark local price bottoms. Moreover, Deutscher pointed out a shift in market flows from predominantly bearish to bullish. He explained that the trading environment has recently seen a resurgence in buying momentum, with large investors, or “OG whales,” ceasing their selling. This change has been reflected in the order books, indicating a possible stabilization in market sentiment.

The potential appointment of a new Federal Reserve chair known for dovish policies, coupled with the official end of quantitative tightening (QT), could further influence market dynamics in favor of buyers. Deutscher concluded by emphasizing that given the extreme levels of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market, combined with improvements in trading flows, he believes that the odds favor the notion that the Bitcoin price has indeed reached its bottom.

That’s the stark future billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary paints for the crypto market. In a recent statement, the ‘Shark Tank’ star delivered a sobering verdict: the vast majority of altcoins will fail. He argues that only Bitcoin and Ethereum possess the foundational strength to endure the coming market consolidation. This prediction forces every investor to ask a critical question about their portfolio’s future. Why Does Kevin O’Leary Believe Most Altcoins Will Fail? Kevin O’Leary’s perspective isn’t based on short-term price swings. Instead, he looks at long-term viability through the lens of institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. He views the current crypto landscape as overcrowded. Many projects, he suggests, lack a clear, sustainable use case beyond speculation. Therefore, as regulations tighten and the market matures, a brutal natural selection will occur. Projects without real utility, strong development teams, and clear governance are the most likely to disappear. This process means a significant number of altcoins will fail, consolidating value into the proven leaders. The Survivors: What Makes Bitcoin and Ethereum Different? If the prediction that most altcoins will fail comes true, what saves the top two? The answer lies in their established roles and network effects. Bitcoin (BTC): It operates as digital gold—a decentralized store of value. Its first-mover advantage, unmatched security, and brand recognition make it the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum (ETH): It functions as a global settlement layer and the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). Its massive developer community and continuous upgrades solidify its position. Both have something most altcoins lack: widespread institutional acceptance and a clear narrative that regulators are beginning to understand. This distinction is crucial for their survival. What Are the Implications for Crypto Investors? O’Leary’s warning that most altcoins will fail is a call for strategic thinking. For investors, this means shifting focus from pure speculation to fundamental analysis. It’s no longer just about finding the next ‘moonshot.’ The potential for massive losses in the altcoin space is real. However, this doesn’t mean all altcoins are doomed. A small subset with robust technology and solving real-world problems may thrive. The key takeaway is to prioritize quality over quantity and understand that high risk accompanies high reward in this segment. How Should You Navigate This Predicted Shakeout? Facing a future where most altcoins will fail requires a disciplined approach. First, conduct thorough research on any project beyond the top two. Look for active development, a tangible product, and a strong community. Second, consider portfolio allocation. Many experts advise having a core position in Bitcoin and Ethereum before exploring higher-risk altcoins. Finally, stay informed on regulatory developments, as these will be the primary catalyst for the predicted consolidation. Being proactive is your best defense against the coming volatility. Conclusion: A Future of Quality Over Quantity Kevin O’Leary’s prediction that most altcoins will fail paints a challenging but clarifying picture of the crypto future. It signals a move from a wild, experimental phase to a more mature market focused on utility and stability. While this may seem daunting, it ultimately benefits the long-term health of the industry by weeding out weak projects. For savvy investors, this era presents an opportunity to build a resilient portfolio anchored by Bitcoin and Ethereum, with careful, selective bets on the most promising altcoin innovations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Kevin O’Leary think all altcoins will go to zero? A> Not necessarily all, but he believes the vast majority (most altcoins) will fail and disappear, leaving only a handful of survivors. Q: What are the main reasons altcoins might fail? A> Primary reasons include lack of real-world use case, poor tokenomics, weak development teams, inability to scale, and increased regulatory pressure. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins based on this prediction? A> Not as a blanket rule. Use this prediction as a prompt to rigorously re-evaluate each altcoin you hold based on its fundamentals and long-term prospects. Q: Are there any altcoins that could survive besides Bitcoin and Ethereum? A> Yes, O’Leary’s view focuses on the majority. Some altcoins with strong fundamentals, like Solana or Cardano, could potentially survive, but the field will be much narrower. Q: How long does O’Leary think this shakeout will take?

However, a leading industry analyst is pushing back, suggesting the panic is largely unfounded. According to James Butterfill, Head of Research at digital asset manager CoinShares, the data tells a story of strength, not weakness. Let’s dive into why the latest Tether liquidity concerns might be more noise than signal. Are Tether Liquidity Concerns Justified? Recent commentary from figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sparked anxiety. Hayes suggested a significant drop in Tether’s asset values could erase its equity. This analysis naturally raised Tether liquidity concerns among investors. However, Butterfill provides a crucial counterpoint grounded in current financials. He argues the company’s robust reserve position and massive profitability create a substantial buffer against market volatility. The Numbers Behind the Stability Butterfill’s report, cited by Cointelegraph, presents compelling figures. These numbers are key to understanding the real picture behind the Tether liquidity concerns . Reserve Surplus: Tether holds $181.4 billion in reserves against $174.4 billion in liabilities. Capital Buffer: This creates a comfortable surplus of $6.8 billion. Record Profitability: Critically, Tether generated over $10 billion in net profit in just the first nine months of this year. This profitability is a powerful tool. It allows Tether to continuously reinforce its equity cushion, directly addressing the core of the liquidity concerns. What Do the Experts Really Say? Butterfill acknowledges that risks exist in the stablecoin sector. No financial instrument is entirely without risk. However, he makes a vital distinction. The current data, in his view, does not indicate a systemic risk to the broader crypto market. Therefore, while prudent caution is wise, outright fear may be premature. The debate highlights the importance of distinguishing between theoretical vulnerabilities and actual, present-tense financial health. Should Investors Be Worried About Tether? For everyday users and investors, the takeaway is nuanced. The persistent Tether liquidity concerns serve as a healthy reminder to understand the assets you use. However, the evidence suggests Tether’s position is currently secure. The company’s ability to generate enormous profits provides a dynamic defense mechanism not always present in traditional finance. This financial engine helps mitigate the very risks critics highlight. In conclusion, the narrative of impending doom for Tether appears exaggerated. The firm’s substantial reserve surplus and staggering profitability paint a picture of an entity with significant financial resilience. While monitoring stablecoin issuers remains essential, the current wave of Tether liquidity concerns seems disproportionate to the published facts. The market may benefit more from focusing on this concrete data than on speculative worst-case scenarios. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the main Tether liquidity concerns? The primary concern is whether Tether holds enough high-quality, liquid assets to back every USDT token in circulation, especially if many users redeem at once or if its reserve assets lose value. What did CoinShares’ research head say about Tether? James Butterfill stated that concerns are “somewhat exaggerated,” pointing to Tether’s $6.8 billion surplus capital and over $10 billion in profit this year as signs of strength. How much profit did Tether make recently? Tether generated more than $10 billion in net profit during the first three quarters of this year alone, a key factor in bolstering its financial position. Could a market crash wipe out Tether’s equity? Analyst Arthur Hayes suggested a 30% decline in Tether’s gold and Bitcoin holdings could erase its equity. However, Butterfill’s analysis implies current profits and reserves provide a significant buffer against such shocks. Is my USDT safe? Based on the latest published figures from a leading analyst, Tether appears to have a strong financial cushion. However, as with any cryptocurrency, understanding the risks and not holding more than you can afford to lose is always prudent. Why is Tether’s profitability important? High profitability allows Tether to continuously add to its equity (owner’s capital), which acts as a shock absorber against losses in its reserve assets, directly addressing liquidity concerns.

Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency’s structure remains intact, but warned that it must bounce quickly or risk retesting the November lows. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Record 13-Day Streak As SOL Funds See Largest Outflows Since Launch Bitcoin Retests $88,000 After Rejection On Friday, Bitcoin lost the recently reclaimed $90,000 level, falling to a key support area before stabilizing. The flagship crypto has been attempting to recover from the November market correction, which sent its price to a seven-month low of $80,600. Since reaching its local lows two weeks ago, the cryptocurrency has traded within a macro re-accumulation range, between $82,000 and $93,500, attempting to break out of this zone on Wednesday, when it reached a multi-week high of $94,150. However, as the first week of December approaches its end, BTC has lost the upper area of its local range again, falling below its monthly open and tapping the $88,000 support. Amid the drop, Analyst Ted Pillows noted that BTC has been struggling to reclaim the $94,000 resistance, adding that price “wants to go lower here before another breakout attempt.” Therefore, he suggested that a bounce back from the $88,000-$89,000 support zone is likely. Altcoin Sherpa affirmed that the ongoing retest would confirm whether the recent bounce was “just lower highs and price is going lower or if we actually have any juice to bounce to like 100k or something.” The analyst outlined two potential outcomes. In the first scenario, the flagship crypto would retrace to the $87,000-$89,000 area and bounce above the $93,000-$94,000 resistance levels. In the second scenario, Bitcoin would continue to move sideways below the local resistance before eventually sliding to the November lows and potentially lower levels. Per the analysis, the leading cryptocurrency must bottom quickly, or it will risk the second outcome. BTC Shows Shallowing Pullback Tendency Analyst Rekt Capital also pointed out that Bitcoin continues to face rejection from the range high resistance. However, he considers that investors should not worry as long as the pullback isn’t as big as the previous ones. If “the rejection is shallower than the previous two, then this resistance will continue to weaken until eventually breached,” he explained, adding that “as long as this weakening continues, BTC should be able to finally breach this resistance over time & try to challenge the multi-week Downtrend above.” Earlier this week, the analyst affirmed that BTC’s consolidation structure will remain intact as long as Bitcoin closes the week above the range lows. He also noted that its Macro Downtrend, which “has been dictating resistance throughout this phase of the cycle,” remains the dominant structural barrier and the level to break. Related Reading: Solana Eyes Major Resistance After $140 Reclaim, But Analyst Questions SOL’s Strength As the price stabilized between the $88,500-$89,350 area, the analyst added that today’s retracement “continues to be a shallower pullback than the previous two,” which keeps the range “‘retrace shallowing’ tendency” intact. He noted that Bitcoin could technically drop into the ascending two-week support trendline, or tap the $86,000 level and still perform a shallower correction than the recent 10% drop. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,400, a 2.9% decline in the daily timeframe.

55410458,641049,1764990041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55410458.jpeg,Key Updates On The US Crypto Market Structure Bill: What You Need To Know,https://bitcoinist.com/key-updates-on-the-us-crypto-market-structure-bill/,"The anticipated crypto market structure bill, or namely the CLARITY Act, designed to provide essential regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States, is approaching critical dates in the Senate. However, it faces significant complexities related to stablecoin yield, conflicts of interest, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Senate Divided On Crypto Market Structure Bill Legal expert and Chief Legal Officer of Variant Jake Chervinsky, reports that the Senate is divided into two committees: Banking, which is handling the securities law aspect, and Agriculture, responsible for the commodities law portion. Both committees have published drafts of their work this fall, with the next step being markup, a process where hearings will be held to vote on amendments before sending the bill to the Senate floor for a full vote. However, both committees are cautious and are unlikely to proceed with markup until they resolve ongoing disputes. Among these, three significant issues stand out. The first major concern involves stablecoin yield . In the GENIUS Act, banks lobbied for a prohibition on interest payments, meaning stablecoin issuers cannot offer holders any form of interest or yield. While the current prohibition prevents direct yield payments to holders, it does not address non-yield rewards or yield provided by third parties. Banks consider this gap a “loophole” and are advocating for broader restrictions to be included in the market structure bill. Conflicts Of Interest And DeFi Regulations Stall Progress The second issue revolves around conflicts of interest. Some Democratic senators have indicated they would not support the market structure legislation unless it includes provisions that restrict the President’s family from conducting business in the crypto space. The third and perhaps most crucial issue pertains to DeFi. It is important to note that market structure legislation primarily addresses centralized platforms that exercise custody over user funds and transactions. Chervinsky believes the bill should primarily focus on protecting DeFi, but t raditional finance (TradFi) stakeholders have been pushing Congress to categorize virtually all entities in the crypto sector—developers, validators, and others—as intermediaries. The expert emphasized that the success of any market structure bill hinges on ensuring robust protections for developers since the viability of the crypto industry relies on their contributions. Given the intricate nature of these issues and the swiftly approaching holiday break, Chervinsky noted that it is possible that discussions about market structure could extend into January. Senate Markup Set For December 17-18 Market analyst MartyParty provided another update on December 4, indicating that the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Structure Bill is gaining significant momentum in Congress, with a markup session in the Senate Banking Committee tentatively scheduled for December 17-18, just before the holiday recess If successfully passed, he states that the bill could establish clearer pathways for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and mitigate “debanking” risks, paving the way for compliant exchanges and potentially stimulating market volumes following the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approvals for spot crypto trading. This “regulatory convergence” is seen as a catalyst that could drive liquidity and energize the next bull market, reinforcing President Trump’s vision for the US to emerge as the “crypto capital of the world.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|CLARITY Act|crypto|crypto market structure|crypto market structure bill|crypto news|crypto regulation|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|Digital Asset Market Clarity Act|Senate Market structure bill,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 03:00:41

Over the past day, a wave of crypto futures liquidations swept through major exchanges, with one clear, dominant victim: traders betting on higher prices. This event provides a crucial snapshot of current market sentiment and the inherent risks of leveraged trading. What Do Recent Crypto Futures Liquidations Reveal? Data from the last 24 hours paints a stark picture. The perpetual futures market, where most retail leverage is employed, saw massive forced position closures. The overwhelming majority of these crypto futures liquidations were long positions, meaning traders who borrowed funds to amplify bullish bets were caught off-guard by a price dip. This pattern signals a sudden shift in short-term momentum and potential over-leverage on the buy side. A Breakdown of the Damage: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Let’s examine the numbers, which highlight the scale of this event. The liquidations were not isolated to one asset but formed a clear trend across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC): Total liquidations hit $147 million. A staggering 88.9% of this volume, approximately $130.7 million, came from long positions being forcibly closed. Ethereum (ETH): Saw $98.68 million in liquidations. Here, 82.81% (about $81.7 million) were longs. Solana (SOL): Recorded $21.78 million in liquidations, with longs constituting 88.59% of the total. This data confirms a market-wide phenomenon where bullish traders faced significant losses. Why Are Long Positions So Vulnerable to Liquidations? Understanding why longs dominated this round of crypto futures liquidations requires a look at market psychology and mechanics. First, after periods of price appreciation, bullish sentiment often peaks, encouraging traders to use high leverage to maximize gains. When the market reverses unexpectedly, even a small downward move can trigger margin calls on these highly leveraged long positions. Essentially, the crowd was leaning too far in one direction. Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This event is more than just a statistic; it’s a learning opportunity. For anyone involved in futures trading, these crypto futures liquidations underscore critical lessons. Risk Management is Paramount: Always use stop-loss orders and avoid excessive leverage, especially during periods of high volatility. Sentiment is a Contrarian Indicator: Extreme bullishness can often precede a shakeout. Watching liquidation heatmaps can provide early warning signs. Volatility is the Constant: The crypto market can change direction rapidly. Never trade with capital you cannot afford to lose. Conclusion: Navigating the Futures Landscape The recent dominance of long positions in crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s dual nature: offering high reward potential alongside substantial risk. While liquidations can induce short-term panic, they also help reset over-leveraged markets, potentially creating healthier foundations for future moves. The key for traders is to learn from these events, prioritize capital preservation, and maintain a disciplined strategy regardless of market euphoria or fear. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto futures liquidations? A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because they no longer have enough collateral (margin) to maintain it, usually due to an adverse price move. Why were mostly long positions liquidated? It indicates that a sudden price drop triggered margin calls for a large number of traders who were using leverage to bet on prices going up. The market was overcrowded with bullish bets. Are large liquidations bad for the market? They cause short-term pain for leveraged traders and can increase volatility. However, they can also flush out excessive leverage, which may reduce systemic risk and lead to a more stable price discovery. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set prudent stop-loss orders, constantly monitor your margin ratio, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Do liquidations signal a market bottom or top? Not definitively. While massive long liquidations can sometimes mark a short-term bottom (a “capitulation” event), they are best used as one data point among many, not a standalone signal. Where can I track liquidation data? Several analytics websites like Coinglass and Bybt provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and charts for major cryptocurrencies.

The bank, Monet Bank, formerly one of the federally chartered banks owned by billionaire backer Andy Beal, has repositioned itself to serve cryptocurrency firms and digital-asset businesses, according to a recent regulatory approval from the Texas Department of Banking. This move is part of the community bank’s goal to transform into a modern bank, focusing on digital finance and cutting-edge digital solutions rather than conventional consumer banking. The announcement was made public after the Texas-based bank shared its website, highlighting that “Monet aims to be the top financial institution for digital assets, offering creative and modern solutions for the digital economy.” Financial institutions shift their focus towards the crypto ecosystem Following U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Beal decided to explore the crypto ecosystem. This decision reflects a growing trend among financial institutions that are adopting and accepting cryptocurrencies in their operations. The Texas lender began operating in 1988. At this time, it was operating as Beal Savings Bank. Earlier this year, it adopted a new name and started referring to itself as XD Bank. Two months later, it changed its name again to Monet Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation monitors this state-chartered bank, with reports from federal records also indicating that the bank operates six branches. Notably, Monet Bank is viewed as a very small community bank because it has less than $6 billion in assets and a little more than $1 billion in capital, according to state records . However, even with this challenge in place, the financial institution still pushed forward its goal of exploring the crypto industry. The news on the Texas bank’s shift towards digital assets was made public on Friday, December 5, by the Information. Sources close to the matter noted that this decision places the bank among a growing number of banks that are seeking to serve the crypto market. Meanwhile, as financial institutions express growing interest in the crypto space, reports dated October this year mentioned that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted Erebor Bank, a new tech-based company supported by Peter Thiel from Founders Fund, a conditional charter. Moreover, former firm leaders from Signature Bank introduced a narrow bank with a Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution charter known as N3XT earlier this week. They claimed that this new financial institution would streamline the payment process using a private blockchain. This change marks a broader shift in how federal bank regulators approach cryptocurrency. Trump’s pro-crypto stance encourages exposure to the crypto world Since Trump assumed the presidency of the United States, several bans related to the cryptocurrency sector have been lifted to support this rapidly growing industry. Some of these bans have been lifted, including previous warnings issued to banks regarding the exercise of caution with crypto. The president’s administration has also established new guidelines to assist the crypto Industry gain improved access to banking services. To further support the crypto ecosystem, Travis Hill, the acting chair of the FDIC, submitted a proposal notifying the relevant authorities that his agency intends to propose new regulations governing the crypto industry, specifically those related to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act . The proposal was submitted during a hearing earlier this week. In the meantime, when reporters reached out to Beal’s company to comment on their progress in exploring the crypto industry, a request was sent to a media contact at Beal Bank, but the firm declined to respond.

ETH's technicals are mixed: it held $2600 support shows an RSI breakout but faces resistance at $4100 after a bearish death cross. The ETF's low 0.15% expense ratio and strong liquidity make it attractive for taxable accounts, though high volatility warrants small position sizing. I plan to re-enter ETH next week after a tax-loss sale, as early bullish indicators suggest the crypto market's correction may be ending. Ether has disappointed investors in 2025, particularly those who climbed aboard over the summer, when the cryptocurrency soared to near $5000. That’s also when Tom Lee of Fundstrat argued for much higher ether prices, which investors could gain exposure to through this Digital Asset Treasury Fund Bitmine Immersion (BMNR). I had a buy rating on the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) back in August . That turned out to be a lousy call, with ether falling below what I deemed “critical support” at the $4100 level. From there, the token plunged to near $2600... a support spot I detailed just a few weeks ago . So, I’m keeping with a buy rating on ETH. In fact, after taking a tax loss in November on my ether position, I plan to buy back in next week. My trade was selling an ETH ETF and buying the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). Catching my eye right now is a relative chart of ether to bitcoin. Ether shows relative strength for the first time since August, and I see that as a telltale sign that the entire cryptocurrency market’s bearish run lately may, in fact, be over. ETH -6% YTD Stockcharts.com According to the issuer , ETH is solely and passively invested in ether. Its investment objective is to reflect the value of ether held by the Fund, less expenses and other liabilities. Ether is a digital asset that is created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Ethereum Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. The Ethereum Network allows people to exchange tokens of value, called ether, which are recorded on a public transaction ledger known as a blockchain. ETH is a small ETF with $2.3 billion in assets under management as of December 4, 2025. That’s down from $2.9 billion at the time of my previous analysis. The annual expense ratio is low at just 15 basis points, while there is no yield . Low cost and no distributions make ETH ideal for taxable brokerage accounts (not IRAs or HSAs). Share-price momentum has turned dreadful, now featuring a weak D- ETF Grade by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. For perspective, it was an A+ just three months ago. But risk happens fast in the crypto space, and with a high historical standard deviation, ETH scores very poorly on risk metrics . Hence, my ether ETF stake will be only about a 0.5% portfolio weight (IBIT is 1.5% of my overall net worth). Finally, on liquidity , ETHA is highly tradable. Its average daily volume is north of 6 million shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is tight at just two basis points, per Grayscale. So, key to my bullish thesis is relative price action between ether and bitcoin. I see a breakout underway, in which the often more speculative ether is jumping to multi-week highs versus bitcoin. The months-long correction with both coins may be over. And I’m putting my money where my writing is—I'll buy ETH early next week once my 30-day wash-sale period is over. ETHUSD vs BTCUSD: Breakout Stockcharts.com I encourage readers to check out my BMNR article from last month . I make the case that while Tom Lee’s product has its appeals, I’d rather own ether outright through a low-cost ETF. Tom Lee's Bold Ether Call BMNR Seasonally, there are tailwinds. Historically, gains have been strong from December through May, while volatility has been the theme from June through November. I like to say that seasonality is secondary to price, but this is a bullish factor to consider. ETHUSD: Bullish December-May Trends Barchart Finally, ether’s technical situation is mixed. Notice in the chart below that the token held key support at the $2600 mark, while a bearish death cross indeed occurred (it’s something I called out would be likely to happen in my BMNR article). But take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart—it is just now breaking out of a downtrend. They say that momentum tends to turn before price, so this could be a bullish harbinger for ETH price action to come. Still, there remains a significant amount of volume by price up to the $4100 mark, and that level is major long-term resistance following the bearish false breakout in August. For now, technicals are not outright strong, but there are bullish early indicators. ETHUSD: RSI Breakout, Death Cross a Risk, $2600 Support Held Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on ETH. I plan to buy the ETF next week, as its relative strength to IBIT is at fresh multi-week highs, while ether itself has held long-term support. Bullish calendar trends are also underway.",ETH-USD|ETHA|ETH,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-06 03:56:00

Why The Four-Year Cycle May Be Ending In a recent post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, the Bull Theory analysts noted that the concept of Bitcoin adhering to a neat four-year cycle is weakening. They highlighted that significant price movements over the last decade weren’t solely driven by Halving events; rather, they were influenced by shifts in global liquidity. The analysts pointed to the current landscape of stablecoin liquidity, which remains high despite recent downturns, indicating that larger investors are still engaged in the market, poised to invest when appropriate macroeconomic conditions arise. Related Reading: XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6 In the US, Treasury policies are emerging as pivotal catalysts. The recent buybacks are notable, but the analysts emphasize that the larger narrative lies in the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance, which is currently around $940 billion—almost $90 billion above its normal range. This surplus cash is likely to flow back into the financial system, enhancing financing conditions and adding liquidity that typically gravitates toward risk assets. Globally, the trends appear even more promising. China has been injecting liquidity for several months, while Japan recently announced a stimulus package worth approximately $135 billion, alongside efforts to simplify cryptocurrency regulations. Canada is also moving toward easing its monetary policy, and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has officially halted its quantitative tightening (QT) measures—a historical precursor to some form of liquidity expansion. Political And Monetary Factors Align To Create Bullish Condition The analysts explained that when major economies adopt expansive monetary policies simultaneously, risk assets like Bitcoin tend to respond more rapidly than traditional stocks or broader markets. Additionally, potential policy tools, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption—implemented in 2020 to allow banks more flexibility in expanding their balance sheets—could return, resulting in increased credit creation and overall market liquidity. There is also a political dimension to consider. President Trump has discussed potential tax reforms, including abolishing income tax and distributing $2,000 tariff dividends. Furthermore, the likelihood of a new Federal Reserve chair who supports liquidity assistance and is constructive toward cryptocurrency could bolster conditions for economic growth. Extended Bitcoin Uptrend Historically, whenever the Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (ISM PMI) surpasses 55, it has been followed by periods of altcoin season. The probability of this occurring in 2026 appears high, according to the Bull Theory. Related Reading: Trend Reversal Puts Dogecoin On A Path To $0.188 The convergence of rising stablecoin liquidity, the Treasury’s injection of cash back into markets, global quantitative easing, the cessation of QT in the US, potential bank-lending relief, pro-market policy shifts in 2026, and major players entering the crypto sector suggests a very different scenario than the old four-year halving model. The analysts concluded that if liquidity expands concurrently across the US, Japan, China, Canada, and other significant economies, Bitcoin is unlikely to move counter to that trend. Therefore, rather than experiencing a sharp rally followed by a prolonged bear market, the current environment indicates a more extended and broader uptrend that could span through 2026 and into 2027.

In October 2025, officials bought 53 tons of gold , a level that analysts say is the highest monthly demand seen this year. These moves reflect growing concern about inflation, weaker currencies and rising geopolitical risk. Central Bank Buying Surges According to data cited by financial outlets, 2025 is on track to be the fourth-highest year this century for institutional gold accumulation when measured net year-to-date through October. Analysts at Deutsche Bank put gold’s share of central-bank reserves at about 24%, a level not seen since the 1990s. Those figures help explain why governments that once moved away from bullion are returning to it now. Bitcoin Enters The Conversation Some banks and market researchers are now asking whether Bitcoin could play a similar role for national treasuries. Based on reports from major financial firms, Deutsche Bank projects that Bitcoin could appear on central-bank balance sheets by 2030 as a complementary reserve asset. Central banks are ramping up gold purchases: Global central banks purchased +53 tonnes of gold in October, the most since November 2024. This marks a +194% jump compared to July, and the 3rd-straight monthly acceleration. In the first 10 months of the year, central banks have… pic.twitter.com/7pZWyEjjvf — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 4, 2025 Bitcoin’s market profile has changed: liquidity has risen, and price swings have been less extreme during recent months even though volatility remains higher than older reserve assets. Bitcoin also reached a record above $123,500 in recent trading, a price point that has captured wide attention. A Few Banks Are Testing The Idea A small number of central banks are now at least studying the idea more seriously. The Czech National Bank, for example, has discussed the possibility of a “test allocation” to learn how crypto might behave inside a reserve mix. Those conversations tend to focus on custody, accounting rules and how to report gains or losses, rather than immediate buying. On Gold & Bitcoin: Why Officials Are Cautious Risk is the main reason most central banks have not moved faster. Bitcoin still shows larger price swings than standard reserve assets, and global rules for how to hold and audit crypto are not uniform. Based on expert commentary, regulators and auditors would need clear guidance before many central banks felt comfortable adding crypto to official reserves. What This Could Mean For Markets If even a handful of national banks were to allocate a small share of reserves to Bitcoin, demand could rise sharply and change how markets view the asset. A modest sovereign allocation would not replace gold or the US dollar, but it could give Bitcoin a stronger role as a hedge for countries facing currency weakness or rising inflation. At the same time, such a move would push more work into custody and compliance services, which would have to scale up quickly. Gold buying by central banks is already significant — 53 tons in one month and about 24% of reserves in gold for some — and that Bitcoin is being discussed as a possible next step for some policymakers. The path from discussion to adoption is uncertain, and many technical and legal questions remain. Still, the debate has moved from theory to test runs and official reports, making this one of the more closely watched trends in global finance this year.

During an interview on Friday, Le said: We’re very much are a part of the crypto ecosystem and Bitcoin ecosystem. Which is why we decided a couple of weeks ago to start raising capital and putting US dollars on our balance sheet to get rid of this FUD. Phong Lee At the beginning of the week, Strategy announced the $1.44 billion US dollar reserve, funded through a stock sale. Le explains that the reserve had been raised in just over a week and will fund dividends on preferred stock and interest payments on outstanding debt over a period of at least 12 months, with plans to extend coverage to 24 months gradually. Le noted that this dual-reserve strategy provides them the flexibility to navigate volatile market conditions without having to liquidate Bitcoin. Phong Le says new reserve neutralizes dividend FUD and strengthens market confidence The creation of the USD reserve comes amid concerns that Strategy may be unable to continue servicing its debts and dividend payment obligations if the stock price falls too far. “And it’s really this FUD,” Le said on Friday. The move represents a strategic shift from the company’s previous approach, which primarily relied on issuing debt or shares to acquire more Bitcoin. Le emphasized that they wouldn’t have an issue paying their dividends, and they weren’t likely to have to sell their Bitcoin . Still, he noted that FUD was spread that the company would fail to meet its dividend obligations, which cause d people to pile into a short Bitcoin bet . He said that the short time frame used for the $1.44 billion – 21 months’ worth of dividend obligations was intended to show people that they are still able to raise money in a Bitcoin downcycle. Last week, Le said that Strategy would only consider selling Bitcoin if its stock fell below net asset value and the company no longer had access to fresh capital. The company also launched a “BTC Credit” dashboard, which claims it currently has enough assets to service dividends for more than 70 years. As of now, Strategy holds over 650,000 BTC , purchased at an average price of $87,000 per coin. The creation of the USD reserve ensures that the company can avoid selling Bitcoin during short-term downturns, allowing it to stay aligned with its long-term crypto-focused strategy. Corporate BTC treasuries take a bigger role as miner pressures and volatility rise The timing of the reserve also matches with mounting pressure on Bitcoin miners, whose production costs have risen following recent halvings. As miners come under increasing pressure with tighter margins and higher break-even prices, analysts say corporate holders such as Strategy are increasingly contributing to the stability of the markets. Strategy’s moves, along with its enormous BTC treasury, pretty much make it one of the market’s biggest long-term claimants. As miners cut supply and short-term volatility gathers momentum, institutional balance sheets—rather than mining output—are also increasingly determining investor confidence. A group of market watchers also argues that Strategy’s reserve represents a maturing phase for Bitcoin as a corporate asset, signalling the movement away from speculative accumulation towards structured financial management. The miners’ and overall production costs of Bitcoin are often discussed on a much smaller scale than those of other cryptocurrencies; however, Strategy’s balance sheet strength and proactive risk management now play a significant role in market confidence, according to industry analysts. The reserve suggests that even during adverse cycles of the crypto market, corporate holders can minimize liquidity risk.

Do Kwon Seeks Reduced Sentence Of Five Years Bloomberg reported that in a court filing late Thursday, US prosecutors described the Terraform Labs co-founder’s fraudulent actions as “colossal in scope.” They emphasized that his “misleading statements to customers” triggered a domino effect of crises across the crypto landscape, culminating in the downfall of notable entities such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX . This comes amid a regulatory environment that has grown increasingly lenient under the Trump administration. In late October, President Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who had been convicted for failing to uphold proper anti-money laundering measures. In a recent court filing, Terraform Labs co-founder expressed a desire for a reduced sentence of five years. His legal team asserted that he has already “suffered substantially” for his actions, noting that he has spent nearly three years in detention conditions described as “brutal” in Montenegro. Kwon’s lawyers argued that a five-year prison term would be sufficient and that the prosecutors’ recommendation of 12 years is “far greater than necessary” for justice to be served. Potential For Sentence Transfer For Terraform Labs Co-Founder Initially, Kwon pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment that charged him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. However, he changed his plea in August to guilty for conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. During this change, Terraform Labs’ leader acknowledged that his actions included making “false and misleading statements” regarding the restoration of TerraUSD’s peg in 2021, admitting, “What I did was wrong.” As part of his plea agreement, Kwon has consented to forfeit $19.3 million and some properties. Prosecutors have chosen not to demand restitution for the millions of investors who collectively lost $40 billion, citing that calculating individual losses would be too complicated. Kwon faces charges in both the US and his native South Korea, where prosecutors are also pursuing a lengthy prison sentence potentially reaching up to 40 years. He was arrested in Montenegro in 2023 while using a fake passport, and following a protracted legal battle, he was extradited to the United States in January after spending nearly two years in a Balkan jail. US prosecutors have indicated they would support Kwon’s opportunity to serve the second half of his sentence in South Korea, provided he adheres to the terms of his plea deal and qualifies for a transfer program. Kwon is scheduled for sentencing by US District Judge Paul Engelmayer on December 11. When writing, Terraform Labs’ native token Luna Classic (LUNC) saw a 75% increase in response to Do Kwon’s probable sentence, trading at $0.000050 and placing it at the helm of the market’s top performers on Friday.

Tether, which issues the market-leading USDT stablecoin, has faced repeated scrutiny over the composition and transparency of its reserve holdings. Hayes reignited the debate by arguing that the company is increasingly exposed to volatile positions that could undermine its ability to maintain a 1:1 dollar peg. Hayes Says Decline in Bitcoin and Gold Could “Wipe Out” Equity Buffer In recent commentary, Hayes said Tether is “in the early innings of running a massive interest-rate trade.” He warned that a 30% decline in the value of the company’s Bitcoin and gold holdings could eliminate its equity cushion. Tether has significantly expanded its exposure to gold over the past several years, alongside an increase in Bitcoin holdings. Hayes argued that while Tether currently earns substantial income from interest-bearing assets, this strategy increases vulnerability if markets turn sharply lower. He concluded that in a severe downturn, USDT could become “technically insolvent.” CoinShares Research Head Pushes Back James Butterfill, head of research at digital-asset firm CoinShares, disputed Hayes’s analysis in a market update issued on Dec. 5. He said concerns about Tether’s solvency “look misplaced,” pointing to the company’s latest attestation covering the third quarter of 2025. According to that report, Tether held $181 billion in total reserves against approximately $174.45 billion in liabilities. This left a surplus of nearly $6.8 billion. Butterfill argued that the data show no immediate systemic risk, although he emphasised that stablecoin issuers should always be monitored cautiously due to their role in broader market liquidity. Ongoing Debate Over Reserve Quality Tether remains one of the cryptocurrency sector’s most profitable companies. It generated an estimated $10 billion in profit during the first three quarters of 2025 — an unusually high figure considering its relatively small workforce. However, the firm continues to face criticism regarding the composition of its reserves. S&P Global recently downgraded USDT’s ability to defend its dollar peg , citing exposure to “higher-risk” assets such as gold, loans and Bitcoin. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissed the downgrade as “Tether FUD,” arguing that the company’s financial statements show its position remains strong. He pointed to the firm’s attestation as evidence of adequate liquidity and responsible asset management. Market Position Remains Dominant Despite recurring concerns, USDT continues to be the largest stablecoin in the world. The token has approximately $185.5 billion in circulation. It also controls nearly 59% of the global stablecoin market. Tether maintains a substantial allocation to U.S. Treasuries — estimated at more than $130 billion — which remains its most stable reserve component. However, the increasing share of Bitcoin and gold exposes the company to greater price swings, keeping the debate alive among analysts and regulators. The long-running dispute over Tether’s reserve practices is unlikely to subside soon, particularly as stablecoins continue to serve as a key pillar of global cryptocurrency trading.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-12-06 05:09:30

ChatGPT With Pi Network Price Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pi-rebound-in-the-week-ahead-chatgpt-with-pi-network-price-predictions/,"Pi Network’s native token has proven in recent months to defy the overall market trend. For example, it actually posted some gains during November when BTC, ETH, XRP, and other larger-cap altcoins dropped by double digits. In contrast, the overall market started to recover at the start of December, with bitcoin climbing past $94,000 and ETH surging beyond $3,200 at one point. PI, though, lagged and couldn’t produce similar increases. Just the opposite, it’s actually down by 12% in the past week and now sits inches above $0.22. Consequently, we asked ChatGPT about its take on the matter and whether the following week will be more positive for PI. Pi Network’s PI Price on CoinGecko Technical Side OpenAI’s solution offered some grim perspective for the PI bulls. It noted that the overall trading volumes have declined lately, which, coupled with the asset drop from $0.28 to $0.225 as of now, shows that the trend structure has turned bearish for the short-term, but it “has not broken the macro support.” Despite the ongoing decline, Pi Network’s token remains well above the October all-time low of $0.172. It needs to rebound from the first crucial support at $0.21-$0.22, which would mean that “the broader recovery structure remains intact.” If it breaks below it, though, then it can test the October lows once again. Should it bounce, PI’s first main obstacle is situated at $0.24-$0.25, which seems like a tall task given the overall trend in the past week. In fact, ChatGPT warned that PI is likely to stay below that level as long as there’s no major update coming to shake things up a bit. Most Likely Scenario After categorizing a breakout past $0.25 as the least probable scenario, ChatGPT outlined that a bear case – meaning a drop below $0.20 – is also quite unlikely, unless the overall market structure doesn’t collapse. If the market conditions remain identical, it believes PI will trade sideways in the following week with a lower boundary of $0.22 and an upper one at $0.24. “PI’s weekly decline does not necessarily signal a trend reversal. The token remains structurally stable above $0.21, but momentum has shifted in favor of caution. The next week will be critical — holding support could set the stage for a rebound, while a breakdown risks extending the correction toward $0.20,” concluded the AI platform.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-next-leg-up-will-be-massive-heres-why/,"Community analyst Arthur recently outlined why he believes XRP may be nearing a major turning point. His assessment focuses on what is already functioning within the ecosystem, what institutions now have access to, and how broader economic conditions align with these developments. He presented a clear argument that the groundwork for a stronger valuation is in place, even though the price remains stable around $2. XRP next leg up will be MASSIVE – Ripple Prime is live, serving U.S. institutions – XRP Ledger ecosystem exploding (DeFi, Firelight, EURØP, tokenization…) – ETFs breaking records – Macro setup screaming for a rate cut and QE – Institutional rails, custody, liquidity,… — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 4, 2025 Institutional Access and Ripple Prime Arthur pointed to Ripple Prime now being live and serving U.S. institutions. He described it as a key step that gives professional firms direct access to liquidity and infrastructure designed for large-scale financial operations. He noted that Ripple’s broader push to build the financial rails used by institutions is advancing, with custody solutions, liquidity pathways, and operational tools already functioning. In his view, these elements form the structural base that will matter when markets reassess the asset’s value. Growth Across the XRP Ledger Ecosystem Arthur highlighted growth across the XRP Ledger, emphasizing active sectors such as DeFi, Firelight, tokenization projects , and the development of EURØP. He described the ecosystem as expanding in real time, supported by tangible on-chain activity rather than speculation. Despite this expansion, XRP continues to trade between roughly $2.10 and $2.20. Arthur argued that the price does not yet reflect the level of development underway. Macro Conditions and ETF Performance Beyond ecosystem progress, Arthur pointed to macroeconomic factors that may eventually support higher valuations. His view is that expectations for rate cuts and possible quantitative easing could create a favorable environment for digital assets. He also noted that ETFs continue to post strong results , reinforcing the role of institutional products in providing access to the asset class. Taken together, he believes these conditions strengthen the case for a future market adjustment. Community Reactions and Diverging Views The commentary drew different responses from the community. X user BD InTheHouse agreed with Arthur’s position, stating that most of the required elements are already in place, including regulatory clarity, institutional partnerships, cross-border payment deployments, and the recognition that XRP is not classified as a security. Meanwhile, user @cube5542 expressed skepticism, pointing out that similar claims have been made in the past without material price changes. He noted that repeated optimism makes it difficult to stay enthusiastic. Arthur’s position is that the next move for XRP will not be a brief surge but a broader repricing based on institutional infrastructure, ecosystem growth, and macro conditions. He maintains that these elements are already active and that the market has yet to recognize their impact fully.

On December 5th, these popular investment vehicles recorded a total net inflow of $54.8 million, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. This resurgence in spot Bitcoin ETFs activity provides a crucial snapshot of institutional and retail confidence in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Drove the Return to Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows? Data from Farside Investors reveals a fascinating story beneath the headline number. The return to positive flows for spot Bitcoin ETFs wasn’t a uniform rally. Surprisingly, the giant BlackRock’s IBIT fund experienced a net outflow of $32.5 million on the same day. This indicates that the inflows were driven by strategic moves into other funds, showcasing a dynamic and competitive landscape. So, where did the money go? A handful of funds captured investor attention: Ark Invest’s ARKB led the charge with a substantial $42.8 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely, attracting $27.3 million. Other gainers included VanEck’s HODL ($11.4M), Bitwise’s BITB ($4.9M), and WisdomTree’s BTCW ($900,000). Is This a True Recovery for Bitcoin ETFs? While the daily figure is encouraging, context is key. Despite this single-day gain, the broader picture for the week of December 1-5 remained negative, with the category posting a cumulative net outflow. This creates a compelling narrative of a market in flux. The daily inflow acts as a counter-punch, but the weekly outflow suggests underlying caution or profit-taking was still at play. This pattern highlights the inherent volatility and sensitivity of spot Bitcoin ETFs to market micro-movements, news cycles, and broader macroeconomic indicators. For investors, it underscores the importance of looking beyond daily headlines to understand longer-term trends. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Strategy? The activity in spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a high-profile barometer for institutional interest. A return to inflows, even a modest one, can be interpreted as a sign of resilience. It shows that dedicated capital is waiting on the sidelines, ready to buy during perceived dips or periods of stability. However, the mixed signals—daily inflow versus weekly outflow—advise against over-optimism. It’s a reminder that the crypto market, especially through the lens of regulated products like ETFs, is maturing but remains subject to swift sentiment changes. Therefore, a balanced, long-term perspective is often more valuable than reacting to every daily data point. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope in a Volatile Arena The $54.8 million inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 5th is a noteworthy development. It broke a short streak of outflows and demonstrated that demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure persists. The fact that inflows occurred despite a pullback from the largest fund adds a layer of complexity, revealing a diverse and active investor base. Ultimately, this event reinforces the role of spot Bitcoin ETFs as a critical bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Their daily flows will continue to be a metric watched closely by everyone from seasoned traders to casual observers, offering transparent insights into the evolving story of cryptocurrency adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? A: Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrency directly. Q: Why did BlackRock’s IBIT have outflows while others had inflows? A> This is common in competitive markets. Investors may rebalance portfolios, take profits from one fund to invest in another they perceive as having better potential, or respond to specific fund metrics like expense ratios. It shows healthy market differentiation. Q: Are net inflows always good for Bitcoin’s price? A> Generally, yes. Net inflows mean more money is being used to buy the underlying Bitcoin held by the ETFs, which can create upward price pressure. However, many other factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. Q: Should I invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF based on one day of inflows? A> No. Daily flow data is just one piece of information. Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and a long-term strategy, not short-term fluctuations. Q: Where can I find this flow data? A> Data is aggregated by firms like Farside Investors and widely reported by financial and crypto news outlets. Many investment platforms also provide summaries of ETF activities. Q: Do these ETFs make Bitcoin a more stable investment? A> They provide a more accessible and regulated way to invest, which can attract more institutional capital over time. However, Bitcoin itself remains a volatile asset, and the ETFs reflect that volatility. Found this breakdown of the latest spot Bitcoin ETFs movement helpful?

55414249,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=233578,1764999011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japan’s Crucial Rate Hike Threatens Bitcoin Liquidity and Global Risk Assets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-rate-hike-bitcoin-liquidity/,"BitcoinWorld Japan’s Crucial Rate Hike Threatens Bitcoin Liquidity and Global Risk Assets Global cryptocurrency investors are facing a pivotal moment as Japan’s central bank prepares for a historic policy shift. An expected interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan could significantly tighten the liquidity that has recently fueled Bitcoin’s recovery and other risk assets worldwide. This potential Japan rate hike Bitcoin liquidity squeeze stems from the unwinding of a decades-old trading strategy, creating new challenges for market participants. How Could a Japan Rate Hike Squeeze Bitcoin Liquidity? The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is anticipated to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at its December policy meeting. This would mark the highest level since 1995, ending an era of ultra-low rates that has persisted for years. The direct mechanism affecting Bitcoin liquidity involves what traders call the “yen carry trade.” For years, investors borrowed Japanese yen at near-zero rates to invest in higher-yielding assets globally, including: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Emerging market stocks High-yield bonds Other speculative assets This massive flow of cheap Japanese capital created abundant liquidity in risk markets. However, a Japan rate hike makes borrowing yen more expensive, potentially forcing investors to unwind these positions and repatriate funds. What Is the Yen Carry Trade and Why Does It Matter? Imagine borrowing money at 0% interest and investing it elsewhere for potentially higher returns. That’s essentially the yen carry trade in simple terms. This strategy has been extraordinarily profitable because Japan maintained the world’s lowest interest rates while other economies offered better yields. The Japan rate hike changes this calculus dramatically. As borrowing costs rise in Japan, the trade becomes less attractive. More importantly, a stronger yen typically coincides with what traders call “risk-off” sentiment—when investors become cautious and pull money from volatile assets. This creates a double-whammy for Bitcoin liquidity : Cheap funding dries up as yen borrowing costs increase Risk aversion leads to selling pressure on speculative assets How Does This Timing Affect Global Markets? The situation becomes particularly intriguing because markets face conflicting central bank policies. While Japan prepares to raise rates, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates next year. This policy divergence could create unusual market dynamics. Investors who positioned themselves for continued easy money from Japan now face a reckoning. The potential Japan rate hike Bitcoin liquidity impact comes just as cryptocurrency markets showed signs of recovery. This tightening of financial conditions could therefore test the resilience of recent gains. Market analysts note that while traders already anticipate the BOJ’s move, the actual implementation often triggers position adjustments that can be more dramatic than expected. The unwinding of carry trades tends to happen quickly once momentum shifts. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? Navigating this changing landscape requires attention to specific indicators. First, monitor the yen’s strength against major currencies like the U.S. dollar. A rapidly appreciating yen often signals carry trade unwinding is underway. Second, watch for volatility spikes in cryptocurrency markets, particularly during Asian trading hours. The Japan rate hike could create disproportionate effects during Tokyo market sessions. Finally, consider these practical steps: Review portfolio allocations to risk assets Monitor liquidity indicators like trading volumes and bid-ask spreads Prepare for increased volatility around the December BOJ meeting Diversify funding sources if using leverage Conclusion: A New Era for Global Liquidity The potential Japan rate hike Bitcoin liquidity connection highlights how interconnected global financial markets have become. What happens in Tokyo boardrooms now directly affects cryptocurrency traders worldwide. While markets have anticipated this shift, the actual unwinding of the yen carry trade could create unexpected turbulence. Successful navigation of this environment requires understanding these global linkages rather than focusing solely on cryptocurrency-specific news. The era of unlimited cheap Japanese money appears to be ending, potentially ushering in a new chapter for risk asset investing where fundamentals matter more than abundant liquidity. Frequently Asked Questions What is the yen carry trade? The yen carry trade involves borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. This strategy has provided cheap funding for risk assets globally for decades. How exactly would a Japan rate hike affect Bitcoin? A rate hike makes borrowing yen more expensive, potentially forcing investors to sell Bitcoin and other risk assets to repay their yen loans. This selling pressure could reduce liquidity and create downward price pressure. When is the Bank of Japan expected to raise rates? Most analysts anticipate a rate hike at the BOJ’s December policy meeting, though the exact timing could shift based on economic data and market conditions. Could other cryptocurrencies be affected too? Yes, all risk assets that benefited from cheap yen funding could face pressure. This includes other cryptocurrencies, emerging market stocks, and high-yield bonds. How long might these effects last? The initial adjustment period could last several weeks as positions are unwound. However, the longer-term impact depends on whether this marks the beginning of a sustained tightening cycle in Japan. What should I do with my crypto investments? Consider reviewing your risk exposure, ensuring adequate diversification, and preparing for potentially higher volatility around the BOJ decision date. Avoid panic selling but be cautious about adding leverage. Found this analysis helpful?

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.0000449 Market Capitalization $432.59M Trading Volume $43.6M Circulating Supply 9.657T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.00004781 24-hour Low $0.00004426 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.78% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.00006022 14-Day RSI 37.99 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.00008290 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: • FLOKI is sliding toward lower support on both charts, with still-bearish momentum. • The RSI near 37 hints at seller fatigue, but not enough for a reversal yet. • Recovery starts only with a break back above $0.0000465 – $0.0000480. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily chart for December 6, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000448, sitting just above the lower Bollinger Band at $0.0000429, which currently acts as the last technical cushion before a potential volatility expansion to the downside. The mid-band at $0.0000481 remains the immediate upside barrier; until the price reclaims this level, bullish momentum is unlikely to return. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD displays a slowly widening bearish histogram, with the signal line maintaining its downward slope, confirming weakening momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Meanwhile, RSI sits around 37, placing FLOKI in a mildly oversold but not aggressively discounted territory, enough to slow the decline but not enough to force a rebound on its own. Candlesticks from the past three sessions show diminishing body sizes, suggesting seller exhaustion; yet, the lack of a real bullish response keeps the near-term tone defensive. A daily close below $0.0000430 would expose $0.0000410, while a bounce above $0.0000480 would indicate the start of a recovery phase. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI is stuck below the Alligator’s teeth and lips (approx. $0.0000466–$0.0000469), revealing that the trend remains firmly bearish in the shorter timeframe. The price, hovering flat around $0.0000448, without any impulsive buying, reflects indecision and a lack of bullish strength. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 4-hour MACD is more notably negative than the daily, with a growing red histogram and moving averages diverging downward. This confirms active short-term selling pressure. The PVT line also shows a dip, signaling weakening volume-backed demand during this decline. For buyers to gain any traction on this timeframe, FLOKI must first reclaim $0.0000460–$0.0000470. Failure to do so keeps the lower support zone at $0.0000440–$0.0000430 at risk of breaking.

If $0.0000430 holds, the market may attempt a short-term rebound; if it breaks, expect a deeper slide. Bulls need a clear reclaim of $0.0000465–$0.0000480 to flip momentum back upward. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Fresh data reveals these funds experienced a significant net outflow of $75.2 million on December 5th. This marks the second day in a row of withdrawals, pushing the entire week’s cumulative flow into negative territory. For anyone tracking the institutional adoption of Ethereum, this trend demands a closer look. What Do the US Spot ETH ETF Outflows Really Mean? According to reliable data from Farside Investors, the story on December 5th was remarkably singular. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was the only fund with recorded activity, and it was solely responsible for the entire $75.2 million exit. All other US spot ETH ETFs reported zero net change in their flows for the day. This concentration suggests the movement may be driven by specific institutional strategies rather than a broad retail sell-off. Why Are Investors Pulling Money from ETH ETFs? While daily flows can be volatile, two consecutive days of outflows for the US spot ETH ETFs raise questions. Several factors could be influencing this trend: Profit-Taking: Early investors may be locking in gains after the initial launch and subsequent price movements. Market Sentiment: Broader cryptocurrency market conditions or Ethereum-specific news can impact ETF flows. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutions often adjust their holdings at month or quarter-end, which can lead to temporary outflows. Liquidity and Familiarity: As newer products, these ETFs are still building their track record and investor base compared to more established offerings. It’s crucial to remember that the landscape for US spot ETH ETFs is still very young. Short-term flows are a useful pulse check, but they don’t necessarily predict long-term success or failure. A Closer Look at the Weekly Picture for ETH ETFs The data from Farside Investors confirms that the outflows on December 4th and 5th were enough to drag the total flow for the week of December 1-5 into the red. This weekly negative cumulative flow is a key metric for analysts. It indicates that, for this specific period, more capital left the US spot ETH ETFs than entered them. However, one week does not make a trend. The coming weeks will be critical to watch for stabilization or a reversal. What’s Next for US Spot Ethereum ETFs? So, should investors be worried about this outflow? Not necessarily. All new financial products experience growing pains. The true test for US spot ETH ETFs will be their ability to gather assets over the next several quarters and through different market cycles. Their long-term viability hinges on continued institutional interest and the overall performance and utility of the Ethereum network itself. In conclusion, the recent $75.2 million outflow from US spot ETH ETFs is a notable data point that highlights current market caution. It underscores that while the launch was a landmark event, the journey toward deep, sustained institutional adoption is just beginning. Observing flow trends, alongside Ethereum’s network developments, will provide the clearest picture of this asset class’s future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which US spot ETH ETF had the outflow on December 5th? A: The entire $75.2 million net outflow came from BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). All other spot Ethereum ETFs reported no net flows for that day. Q: Does this mean Ethereum ETFs are failing? A> No, it’s too early to draw that conclusion. New investment products often see volatile flows initially. This could be short-term profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing by early investors. Q: Where can I find data on ETF flows? A> The data cited in this article comes from Farside Investors, a firm that tracks daily flows for exchange-traded products. Financial news websites and the ETF issuers themselves also report this information. Q: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A> In theory, a spot ETF issuer must sell the underlying asset (ETH) to meet redemption requests, which could create selling pressure. However, the market is complex, and many other factors simultaneously influence ETH’s price. Q: Should I sell my Ethereum ETF shares because of this news? A> This article provides information, not financial advice. Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and research, not on short-term flow data alone. Q: Are Bitcoin spot ETFs seeing similar outflows? A> Flow patterns for Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs can differ based on unique investor perceptions and market dynamics for each asset. It’s important to check the specific data for each product. Found this analysis of the US spot ETH ETF outflows helpful?

According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, an address linked to mining giant Bitmain executed another massive Bitmain ETH purchase , acquiring 22,676 Ethereum worth approximately $68.7 million. This follows an even larger transaction the previous day, creating a powerful narrative about institutional confidence in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. What Does This Massive Bitmain ETH Purchase Mean? When a major player like Bitmain makes consecutive large-scale purchases, the market pays attention. The recent Bitmain ETH purchase represents more than just another transaction—it signals institutional belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Bitmain, known primarily for Bitcoin mining hardware, expanding its Ethereum holdings suggests a strategic diversification that could influence other institutional investors. Let’s break down the numbers clearly: First purchase : 41,946 ETH worth $130.78 million Second purchase : 22,676 ETH worth $68.67 million Total accumulation : 64,622 ETH worth approximately $199.45 million Why Is Bitmain Betting Big on Ethereum? The timing of this Bitmain ETH purchase raises important questions about market strategy. Several factors could explain this aggressive accumulation: First, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has reduced its energy consumption dramatically, making it more attractive to environmentally conscious investors. Second, the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications built on Ethereum creates fundamental value beyond simple speculation. Finally, institutional adoption of Ethereum for various financial products continues to expand. Consider these key benefits that might have influenced Bitmain’s decision: Diversification strategy beyond Bitcoin mining operations Positioning for Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and improvements Institutional trend alignment with growing crypto adoption Long-term value storage in a proven blockchain platform How Does This Bitmain ETH Purchase Affect Market Sentiment? Major purchases by known entities create ripple effects throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This substantial Bitmain ETH purchase serves as a powerful vote of confidence that could influence retail and institutional investors alike. When industry leaders demonstrate conviction through significant capital allocation, it often signals to others that the asset has strong fundamentals. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. While this development is certainly noteworthy, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on any single entity’s actions. What Can We Learn From This Institutional Move? The consecutive Bitmain ETH purchase transactions offer valuable insights for market observers. First, they demonstrate that major industry players are actively accumulating Ethereum during what some consider consolidation periods. Second, they highlight the importance of blockchain analytics in understanding market dynamics. Finally, they remind us that institutional adoption of cryptocurrency continues to progress steadily. For individual investors, the key takeaway isn’t necessarily to mimic Bitmain’s actions but to understand the strategic thinking behind them. Large-scale accumulation by established companies often reflects extensive research and long-term planning rather than short-term speculation. Conclusion: A Significant Signal in Evolving Markets The recent Bitmain ETH purchase totaling nearly $200 million represents more than just another cryptocurrency transaction. It signals growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s infrastructure and future potential. As the blockchain space continues to mature, moves by established companies like Bitmain provide valuable indicators of where smart money is flowing. While no single development guarantees future price movements, the scale and timing of these purchases deserve attention from anyone interested in cryptocurrency markets. They reflect a broader trend of institutional adoption that continues to shape the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions Q1: Who is Bitmain and why is their purchase significant? A1: Bitmain is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of cryptocurrency mining hardware. Their substantial Ethereum purchases signal institutional confidence that can influence market sentiment and potentially encourage other large investors. Q2: How was this Bitmain ETH purchase identified? A2: Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported the transactions by tracking wallet addresses associated with Bitmain. These addresses are identified through patterns, transaction histories, and sometimes public disclosures. Q3: Does this mean Ethereum’s price will definitely increase? A3: While large purchases can create positive sentiment, cryptocurrency prices depend on numerous factors. No single transaction guarantees price movement, though institutional accumulation often indicates long-term confidence. Q4: Should individual investors follow Bitmain’s lead? A4: Investment decisions should align with individual financial goals and risk tolerance. While observing institutional moves provides valuable market insight, copying them directly may not suit every investor’s strategy. Q5: What makes Ethereum attractive to institutional investors? A5: Ethereum offers a robust smart contract platform, growing decentralized finance ecosystem, and ongoing technical improvements. Its transition to proof-of-stake has also addressed previous environmental concerns. Q6: Are there risks to such large-scale accumulation? A6: Like any investment, cryptocurrency carries risks including volatility, regulatory changes, and technological challenges. Even institutional moves involve calculated risks based on their research and strategic outlook. Found this analysis of the significant Bitmain ETH purchase insightful?

By contributing its technology, ecosystem experience, and institutional partnerships, Polytrade will help architect, build, and scale Integra’s Asset-Specific Layer 1, designed for the global real-estate market. Since 2021, Polytrade has operated at the forefront of real-world asset tokenization. The company has built one of the most active RWA ecosystems in the industry, integrating issuers, liquidity providers, secondary market participants, global distributors, and enterprise partners. This on-ground experience revealed a structural gap: traditional blockchains were not designed to support the data, compliance, valuation, settlement, and identity layers that institutional real-estate markets require. Over the past five years, Polytrade’s institutional division has worked across banks, funds, and enterprises on private-chain and regulated RWA deployments. This work includes long-standing engagements with international partners, payment networks, enterprises, and tokenization companies across multiple jurisdictions, including Mastercard. The insight gained from these projects shaped Polytrade’s conviction that RWAs needed a chain engineered around the realities of regulated assets. Integra provides this foundation. As a purpose-built chain for real estate, Integra introduces a vertically integrated environment where asset information, ownership records, compliance proofs, data feeds, liquidity flows, and market applications are natively embedded. This architecture aligns directly with the requirements of issuers, institutional capital, regulators, and global RWA participants. As per the whitepaper released on 28th November, Integra is building a full-stack Asset Specific L1, whereby the Foundation will build the blockchain, but also native applications and a native stablecoin. The consortium of anchors also includes leading real estate asset managers such as Nitya Capital, builders such as BNW Developments, and other technology companies such as Digishares. Having these asset managers and tokenization leaders allows Integra to seed a flourishing business from the start. Given its ambition with a native stablecoin as well as native DApps, Integra stands to capture value not just by gas or transaction fees as other L1s do, but also by yield on the stablecoin and native DApps fees. By bringing on-chain the movement of hundreds of millions in rents, exits, and sales from just its consortium members, Integra is well-positioned to become a new, value-generating L1, potentially sparking the growth of Asset-Specific L1s. By joining the Consortium, Polytrade will lead technical development across the chain and its core infrastructure, support ecosystem expansion, and contribute to onboarding institutional partners and asset flows. With a pre-existing distribution network and a tested RWA marketplace, Polytrade brings an operational advantage that accelerates Integra’s path to adoption. As a gesture to its long-standing community, Polytrade confirmed that $TRADE holders will receive an allocation of Integra’s native token, $IRL. Final allocation details will be shared once the Foundation concludes its allocation process. Commenting on the announcement, the Polytrade team noted that this next chapter represents the natural extension of the company’s mission: to bridge traditional assets with blockchain environments purpose-built to support them. Polytrade will continue to operate its marketplace and institutional services under the broader Integra umbrella while contributing engineering leadership, ecosystem development, and industry expertise to the chain. The company emphasized that this partnership reflects a long-term ambition to transform how real-estate markets operate globally, with Integra serving as the dedicated infrastructure for that transformation.

This, amid market fluctuations and heightened volatility in the broader crypto market, impacting the exchange’s stock performance. Bernstein Forecasts New Bullish Phase For Coinbase Despite these challenges, analysts at Bernstein hold an optimistic outlook on Coinbase’s stock price, suggesting a potential new bullish phase that could propel COIN to surpass previous all-time highs and reach levels above $500. Bernstein maintains a price target of $510 on Coinbase, underlining the exchange’s shift from a trading-centric platform to what analysts dub an emerging “everything exchange.” Related Reading: XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6 Analysts led by Gautam Chhugani highlighted the delicate market conditions, citing crypto price fluctuations influencing listed crypto-exposed equities. However, Bernstein distinguishes the current market environment from past crypto downturns, noting that speculative excess primarily affects what they refer to as “MSTR copycats,” referencing Strategy’s (previously MicroStrategy) stock performance. Central to Bernstein’s bullish thesis is Coinbase’s strategic diversification away from volatile spot trading revenue. They assert that exchange is evolving into a comprehensive financial platform. The analysts emphasize that clearer regulatory guidelines in the US could drive a revaluation of these business lines, bridging the gap with offshore competitors benefiting from faster token listings and fundraising fees. Coinbase’s foray into token issuance through a launchpad-style model, exemplified by Monad’s (MON) recent listing, demonstrates growing market interest. Bernstein notes that these launches, directly influencing trading activity, can stimulate a cycle of issuance, listing, and heightened trading volume. Confident Ratings For COIN Looking ahead, one of the exchange’s most notable catalysts is the upcoming product showcase on December 17, anticipated to unveil developments in tokenized equities, prediction markets, and other tools expanding the exchange’s offerings beyond spot crypto trading. The integration with Deribit is also expected to further bolster Coinbase’s derivatives expansion, positioning the exchange closer to platforms like Robinhood as both entities diversify their product offerings.

Top Analyst Assigns 91.5% Probability On the consumer front, the exchange’s Base app, focusing on wallet services, payments, and social features, acts as a centralized access point for the broader token markets, reaffirming the analysts’ bullish predictions. Bernstein’s reaffirmed “Buy” rating on Coinbase with a massive $510 price target underscores the firm’s confidence in COIN’s growth trajectory. Monness Crespi’s recent upgrade from “Neutral” to “Buy” with a $375 target further adds to the bullish sentiment surrounding the stock’s valuation amid falling prices.

Rather than treating 2026 as a distant projection, he argues that Brad Garlinghouse has effectively confirmed it as a target during his detailed panel appearance at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai. The conversation, paired with visible institutional involvement, forms the basis of Squire’s interpretation that the shift toward 2026 is already in motion. THE MESSAGE THEY DIDN’T WANT TO HEAR. Brad Garlinghouse isn’t predicting 2026. He’s confirming it. BlackRock, Vanguard, ETFs, clarity, utility. The move is already underway. pic.twitter.com/k5gqXwn0zN — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 4, 2025 Market Conditions and Institutional Momentum In the video shared with Squire’s post, Brad Garlinghouse responded to questions about why the market has seen a bearish phase. He noted that crypto still moves through familiar cycles and that current uncertainty reflects a broader risk-off period. Despite this, he emphasized that many macro factors are now supporting the sector. He pointed to the United States—representing a large share of the global economy—as a region that has moved from a hostile posture toward a clearer regulatory direction. According to him, institutions are still adjusting to this new environment, but their presence at major events indicates they are positioning for what lies ahead. Garlinghouse referenced the appearance of Franklin Templeton, BlackRock , and the recent shift by Vanguard , which had previously refused to engage with digital assets. He described Vanguard’s reversal as a strong sign that institutional participation is broadening rather than retreating, a point that aligns with the message Squire conveyed. ETF Growth and Long-Term Expectations When asked whether ETF developments were exaggerated, Garlinghouse said they were not. He explained that ETFs were blocked for years due to regulatory issues, and only recent clarity allowed them to emerge. He stated that hundreds of millions of dollars have already flowed into XRP ETFs within a short period, describing this as demand that had been unable to enter the market earlier. Garlinghouse added that crypto ETFs currently make up only a small portion of the overall ETF market, and he expects that share to grow well beyond current levels by 2026. His comments reinforced his view that institutional inflows have begun and will continue to expand. Utility, Stablecoins, and Real-World Adoption Garlinghouse also addressed the role of stablecoins, explaining that many users remained in stable assets during risk-off periods due to trust and convenience. He highlighted that Ripple’s stablecoin has surpassed a billion dollars in market cap and has been approved in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. He said these developments show that practical applications, including payments and collateral use, are becoming more prominent.

This interest, he explained, is rising because the regulatory environment is improving. Regulatory Progress and the 2026 Target On U.S. regulation, Garlinghouse said recent developments, including the Genius Act and the ongoing work on the Clarity Act , are drawing more institutions into the sector. He expects additional progress in the first half of next year. He ended his remarks by projecting that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of 2026. Squire’s post frames all these points as confirmation that institutional forces, regulatory stability, and real utility are aligning for the years ahead. In his view, the shift toward 2026 is not merely expected—it has already begun. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
