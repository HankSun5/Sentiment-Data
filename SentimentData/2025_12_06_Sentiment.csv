This leaves the country as the last EU member without a national MiCA-style regime. According to a Bloomberg report, the vote was held in the lower house of parliament on Friday, falling short of the three-fifths majority required to overturn President Karol Nawrocki’s decision to reject the legislation. The outcome halts Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s push to place Poland’s crypto sector under tight regulatory control and forces the government to restart the legislative process from scratch. Tusk Flags Crypto as National Security Threat Amid Russia Sabotage Claims Tusk had framed the bill as a national security measure in the days leading up to the vote. Addressing parliament, he said the unregulated crypto market had become a conduit for money laundering and foreign interference, including activity linked to Russia and Belarus. He told lawmakers that Polish authorities had identified “several hundred” foreign entities operating in the domestic crypto market and warned that Russian intelligence and organized crime groups were exploiting digital assets for covert financing. Government officials have tied those concerns to recent security incidents. Last month, Warsaw blamed Russia for a blast on a key railway route used for supply traffic to Ukraine, an allegation Moscow dismissed. Polish security services have also cited cases of underground groups allegedly paid in cryptocurrencies to carry out sabotage activities inside the country. Russia is using cryptocurrencies to pay saboteurs carrying out hybrid attacks across the European Union, according to a Polish security official. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/MsOjIZjSfu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 The veto has deepened an already sharp political confrontation between Nawrocki, a nationalist conservative, and Tusk’s pro-European coalition. The president rejected the bill earlier this month , arguing that it went far beyond EU requirements and threatened civil liberties, property rights, and the stability of the state. Polish President Karol Nawrocki vetoed a sweeping crypto law, saying it threatens property rights and personal freedoms. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/BXYSh74MPF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2025 The blocked law would have implemented MiCA-style rules in Poland, introducing licensing for crypto-asset service providers, investor protection standards, stablecoin reserve requirements, market abuse bans, and strict anti-money laundering controls. It also proposed granting authorities the power to block crypto-related websites through administrative orders, a provision the president described as opaque and vulnerable to abuse. Political Tensions Rise After Poland Blocks Sweeping Crypto Oversight Bill Nawrocki also criticized the scale of the bill, which exceeded 100 pages, contrasting it with far shorter implementing laws in neighboring Czechia and Slovakia. He warned that heavy supervisory fees and added domestic restrictions would drive Polish crypto firms to register in other EU countries, costing Poland tax revenue and talent. His chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, said on Friday that the president is open to regulation as long as future proposals are not excessively restrictive. The failure to override the veto leaves crypto companies operating in Poland without a clear national legal framework ahead of the EU’s July 1, 2026, MiCA compliance deadline. The political dispute has increasingly drawn in industry players. Nawrocki has portrayed himself as a defender of the crypto sector and was endorsed before his election by Kristi Noem, a senior U.S. official, at a conference in southeast Poland sponsored by trading platform Zondacrypto. Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative who says crypto should be “born in freedom, not buried in red tape.” #poland #crypto https://t.co/BVJXhQBnrK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 The exchange later stated that it accepts no Russian clients and fully complies with anti-money laundering rules. Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski added another dimension to the dispute on Friday, saying on radio RMF FM that the crypto industry sponsors figures across the right wing of Polish politics, explaining the sharp resistance to tighter oversight. The veto follows months of turbulence around crypto regulation in Poland. In September, lawmakers had initially passed the bill , triggering strong backlash from industry leaders who warned that Poland’s version of MiCA amounted to overregulation . Zondacrypto’s chief executive at the time described it as a “step backwards” that risked criminalizing core blockchain development activity.

The model warns that all three cryptocurrencies could experience heightened turbulence over the coming weeks, with major moves possible in either direction. Below are Qwen3-MAX’s two-track predictions showing both the potential upside and the risks each asset may face throughout December. XRP (XRP): Alibaba AI Sees Either a Drop to $0.15 or a Run Toward $10 by Year-End In its pessimistic projection, Alibaba’s model suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could retreat from its current $2.06 level to around $0.15, a drop of roughly 93%, should bearish sentiment continue dominating the market. Source: Alibaba Such a correction would contrast sharply with XRP’s powerful performance earlier this year, when the token soared to a new seven-year high of $3.65 in July following Ripple’s pivotal legal win over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout most of 2025, XRP has hovered between $2 and $3. Its relative strength index (RSI) now sits at a neutral 37 and is downtrending as traders cash in on profits today from a brief price bounce yesterday. However, Alibaba’s bullish outlook paints a very different picture, one in which XRP surges 385% to touch $10 before New Year’s Eve, almost tripling its all-time high. The recent debut of nine U.S. spot XRP ETFs could fuel a wave of institutional interest this holiday season, echoing the early inflows seen when Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs first launched. More ETF approvals are anticipated in the coming months, increasing the probability that 2026 becomes a transformative year for XRP. Investors who accumulate now may find themselves well-positioned ahead of that shift. Cardano (ADA): Alibaba Predicts a Potential 2,274% Explosion in December Cardano ($ADA) remains one of the most academically rigorous and research-driven blockchain ecosystems. Launched by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, the network prioritizes peer-reviewed development, security, scalability, and long-term sustainability. With a market cap exceeding $15.6 billion and more than $189 million in TVL , Cardano continues to stand out among layer-1 networks thanks to its active development community and expanding suite of decentralized applications. According to Alibaba AI, ADA could surge to approximately $10 by early 2026, an extraordinary 2,274% climb from its current price at $0.4212 and more than triple its 2021 peak of $3.09. Analysts note that Cardano’s carefully paced upgrades and robust fundamentals could position it as a major winner in the next DeFi-centric bull cycle. Still, Alibaba’s bearish prediction warns that ADA could slip toward $0.10 if macro weakness worsens, representing a downside of just over 76% from today’s price. Dogecoin (DOGE): Alibaba AI Targets $2.50 in Moonshot Scenario and $0.02 in Potential Collapse Dogecoin ($DOGE) , initially created in 2013 as a parody of the crypto boom, now accounts for roughly $21.7 billion in market value, representing nearly half of the $45.8 billion meme-coin sector. The token formed several bullish chart setups in late summer and early autumn, but momentum has since cooled. In Alibaba’s more negative scenario, DOGE could sink to $0.02, a drop of about 86% from its current price of $0.1387. Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7316 came during the retail-driven mania of 2021, and its long-discussed $1 milestone remains elusive. Yet Alibaba’s bullish case suggests DOGE could actually rally 1,700% to $2.50, or 18x its current price. Meanwhile, real-world adoption continues to grow: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise, and payment platforms including PayPal and Revolut support DOGE transactions. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rapidly Emerging Meme Coin Overlooked by Alibaba’s Forecasts While Alibaba AI highlights the upside potential for major blue-chip cryptocurrencies, early-stage presale tokens potentially deliver far larger percentage gains. One fast-growing contender is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already brought in nearly $4.3 million as it positions itself as the next breakout Doge-themed meme coin. MAXI’s narrative follows Maxi Doge, a canine crypto bro and degen distant relative to the original Dogecoin. Maxi is obsessed with lifting weights, trading meme coins with 1,000x leverage, and cultivating a degen community across social media to help him usurp Dogecoin’s throne. As an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from Ethereum’s energy-efficient proof-of-stake network and its massive developer ecosystem, advantages that Dogecoin’s older Bitcoin-style proof-of-work consensus mechanism does not offer. The ongoing presale includes staking rewards of up to 72% APY, although yields decrease as more participants join in. MAXI is currently priced at $0.0002715 in its active presale phase, with automated price increases scheduled in upcoming rounds. Buyers can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

The tax authority HMRC has said that putting digital coins or stablecoins like USDC and USDT onto decentralised finance platforms won’t count as a taxable event at the moment of deposit. This means people who lend out their cryptocurrency, stake it, or borrow money against it won’t face capital gains charges just for placing their digital holdings onto these platforms. Stani Kulechov, who started the DeFi platform Aave , said the decision follows years of back-and-forth discussions with tax officials and brings much-needed answers to users. Tax bills will now only kick in when someone actually gets rid of their assets by selling them, swapping them for something else, or cashing out. Moving tokens in and out of DeFi protocols is being treated as having “no gain, no loss,” giving people clearer rules about what they’ll owe. What this means for crypto users “For users, this is significant,” Kulechov told Yahoo Finance Future Focus. “They now have more clarity over HMRC’s approach, and they can use DeFi lending protocols to borrow funds against their collateral without creating a taxable event or a disposal.” The tax authority made it clear that locking up cryptocurrency as collateral for a loan, or putting a single token into a lending or staking arrangement, wouldn’t trigger a tax charge when deposited under this “no gain, no loss” approach. The taxable moment generally gets pushed back until there’s an actual disposal, such as selling or exchanging the asset. Kulechov said this clarity might also push more professional investors to try crypto innovations. These bigger players have often stayed away from DeFi because they weren’t sure about the rules and taxes. “It simplifies the tax approach, which reduces the burden and allows for wider adoption by institutions, but also simplifies things for regular retail users,” he said. Kulechov pointed out that getting more people to use decentralised finance depends heavily on making it simpler. Up until now, DeFi has mostly attracted people who know their way around blockchain wallets and exchanges. Aave is trying to change that by building a consumer-friendly experience that works on mobile phones, letting users shift money from regular bank accounts into Aave without much hassle. The platform handles the complicated technical stuff behind the scenes. “Providing a seamless mobile experience is a really big opportunity for retail users,” he said. “It makes yield generation and lending accessible to a much wider audience.” Changes to traditional savings The new guidance arrives as traditional savings options in Britain are becoming less appealing. The government’s autumn budget decided to cut cash ISA allowances, which could push many savers to look for better returns elsewhere. Starting April 2027, the yearly cash ISA limit for people under 65 will drop from £20,000 to £12,000, giving people less room for tax-free cash savings. DeFi platforms like Aave, on the other hand, let users earn steady returns on their digital assets that don’t move with traditional markets, while still being able to put money in or take it out whenever they want. Kulechov said this mix is becoming more attractive to savers hunting for new financial options. “What DeFi really helps with is accessing yield and financial opportunities,” Kulechov said. “Aave has been battle-tested over the past five years and shows how decentralized finance as financial infrastructure can work effectively, mitigating single points of failure through smart contracts.” Get seen where it counts.

55403329,https://cryptonews.com/?p=460504,1764974100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55403329.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Today 5 December – XRP, Solana, PEPE",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-today-5-december-xrp-solana-pepe/,"Bitcoin is currently holding the fort above $91k after a prolonged downturn sent the world’s favourite crypto down to a seven-month low of $82,000 by November 21, not long after Bitcoin notched a new all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 on October 6. The wider crypto market jumped 6% yesterday, lifting total capitalization to about $3.24 trillion. Today, momentum has cooled with a near 2% drop to $3.18 trillion. Bulls remain optimistic that this pause is consolidation, not capitulation. Additionally, with crypto entering maturity, Bitcoin dominance is generally falling, indicating that the next substantial bull market may well be powered by altcoins. With that in mind, here’s why XRP, Solana, and Pepe are the best crypto to buy right now. XRP ($XRP): Transforming Global Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to dominate the international value-transfer niche thanks to its fast settlement speeds and minimal fees. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) serves as Ripple’s answer to slow, expensive legacy systems like SWIFT. Major institutions, including the UN Capital Development Fund and U.S. government agencies, have highlighted the XRPL’s utility, while Ripple’s expanding network of fintech partners has helped XRP secure its position as the third-largest non-stablecoin, now capitalizing over $124 billion. Ripple’s rollout of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, marks a strategic move to capture the next generation of global payments infrastructure. Every RLUSD transaction burns a small amount of XRP, gradually reducing supply and reinforcing XRP’s long-term value proposition. Following the resolution of its five-year legal battle with the SEC, XRP rallied to a July high of $3.65. Its current price near $2.09 represents a 43% retracement, but indicators suggest resilience. Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) sits at 36, indicating the token is likely to conclude today’s -2.8% selloff over the weekend and swing back into green. The recent introduction of nine U.S.-based XRP ETFs is expected to accelerate institutional inflows throughout the holiday season. Additional ETF approvals may follow, and if Congress successfully passes comprehensive crypto legislation before year-end, XRP could target $15 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): The Speed Leader Closing In on a Potential $1,200 Target Solana ($SOL) has cemented itself as a top-tier smart-contract network, prized for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees. With a market cap surpassing $76 billion and almost $9 billion in total value locked across its DeFi protocols, Solana remains Ethereum’s most formidable competitor. New Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise, launched late last month, could open the door to significant capital inflows, echoing earlier institutional waves that propelled Bitcoin and Ethereum to new heights. After dipping near $100 earlier this year, SOL now trades around $136, holding firm at a critical support zone. A bullish flag pattern has taken shape since mid-September, signaling a potential breakout. The next major resistance sits near $250; a decisive move above that level could propel SOL beyond its prior ATH of $293.31, with a 4x up to $1,200 emerging as an ambitious yet attainable stretch target if the festive season turns into a bull market. At the same time, Solana has become a leading hub for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, with giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton choosing the network to deploy tokenized financial products. Pepe (PEPE): The Internet’s Favorite Frog Prepares for a Potential Upswing Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly rose through the meme-token ranks, capitalizing on the global popularity of Matt Furie’s iconic character. Now boasting a market cap above $1.9 billion, PEPE enjoys an unmatched cultural presence, amplified when Elon Musk briefly switched his X profile picture to a Pepe meme, fueling speculation about his meme coin interests. Musk is publicly known to hold Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Currently priced near $0.000004554, PEPE sits roughly 84% below its late-2024 high of $0.00002803 after a quiet summer and subdued fourth quarter. Its RSI is now around 45, which indicates the token is neither overbought nor oversold and has plenty of headroom for further gains over the weekend. With the token hovering near its lowest valuation in nearly two years, PEPE offers traders a high-upside entry point ahead of the next major market run. Clearer U.S. regulatory guidance could revive risk appetite and fuel a meme coin gold rush, potentially giving PEPE the momentum to retest its all-time high before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 Built for 2026 and Beyond One emerging project generating buzz ahead of 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 solution wrapped in meme-culture branding. Despite its playful façade, HYPER targets real technical improvements with high-speed throughput, ultra-low fees, and smart-contract functionality. Developed using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge designed for seamless Bitcoin movement across multiple chains. The presale has already raised around $29 million, and prominent analyst Borch Crypto forecasts the token could surge up to 100× upon exchange listing. A recent Coinsult audit revealed zero contract vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. HYPER tokens power transaction fees, governance, and staking, with presale users able to earn up to 40% APY. With the project’s full platform release planned for 2026, both seasoned Bitcoin users and newcomers have the chance to position themselves early in what may evolve into a major enhancement of Bitcoin’s utility landscape.

According to an X post from the founder of the SlowMist Blockchain security firm, the user who was exploited was named “Babur,” and they had their wallets drained of about $27 million in total. Crypto holder loses funds to malware attack The blockchain security expert was able to trace some of the biggest transactions and surmised that the exploit was the result of scammers poisoning Babur’s computer after he clicked a malicious website link, which triggered an automatic download of an executable file. Of course, this wasn’t a typical phishing email. It was more insidious and likely disguised, but once executed, the malware scanned for critical crypto-related information, used keyloggers to glean passwords and private keys. After that, it automated the transfer of the data to the hacker. According to popular claims, such poisoning scams are currently mostly effective on computers on which private keys and sensitive data are stored, rather than iPhones. But since the investigation is still ongoing, everything remains speculation at this point. The founder, who goes by @evilcosuser on X, claims that real poisoning attacks are not as complex or advanced, reassuring everyone that there is no need to panic. Upbit hack headlined exploits in November The attack on Babur is one of the most recent attacks on the cryptocurrency industry. Last month on the 27th, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit reportedly had $30 million worth of assets stolen from its Solana wallet due to a security weakness, which led to the theft of Official Trump, USD Coin, BONK, and other tokens. And as in Babur’s case, the weakness enabled private key inference. All digital asset transactions were halted following the incident, which many suspect may have been conducted by the North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group. “This breach is a direct result of Upbit’s inadequate security management, and there is no room for excuses. Upbit, which prioritizes member protection, promises that no damage will occur to member assets,” said Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok, who reassured users that the private key vulnerability has since been fixed. Upbit intends to leverage its assets to convert customer losses due to the breach and has already commenced an extensive security system review and wallet system restructuring that has seen the exchange tear down its entire deposit address system and rebuild from scratch. According to the exchange, the purge is part of a broader hardening of its wallet infrastructure after the hack revealed lingering vulnerabilities. Now, all users — across every asset and every network — are required to generate new addresses before depositing again. The company said the decision was meant to eliminate any compromised keys or undiscovered vulnerabilities that remain in circulation. South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is monitoring the process as part of its ongoing inspection.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Fails To Shake Ripple CEO — He Still Calls For $180K According to the bank, the move would go beyond the derivative products that most Russian banks have offered so far. It is a clear shift toward opening traditional finance to digital assets, at least for now among wealthy clients. Client Eligibility And Timetable Reports have disclosed that VTB intends to begin with high-net-worth customers only. The bank set thresholds for its initial offering: clients with assets above $1.3 million or annual income over $649,000 would be eligible at first. Andrey Yatskov, who heads VTB’s brokerage arm, said there is “sharp demand” from clients for access to actual crypto, not just paper products tied to token prices. The bank has picked 2026 as the planned start year, but it made that clear the launch depends on regulators signing off. Real Crypto, Not Just Contracts Based on reports, the service would allow ownership of the underlying coins — not merely derivative contracts or token-linked notes. That is a significant distinction in Russia, where until recently banks were limited to offering exposure through derivative instruments. Allowing customers to hold coins directly would require legal and compliance work, from custody arrangements to anti-money-laundering controls. Those steps are on the critical path before any retail expansion can happen. Potential Market Signals VTB has also given investors a sense of how it views crypto as an asset class. The bank recommended a 7% allocation to crypto for some investor profiles, and its internal forecasts have mentioned medium-term Bitcoin price targets in the $200,000–$250,000 range under favorable conditions. If VTB moves forward, it could be the first major Russian bank to operate in this way — a signal that some parts of the financial sector see token ownership as something to be offered through mainstream channels. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets Regulatory Hurdles And Geopolitics The plan is not risk free. Russian regulation of crypto is still evolving, and any permit to offer direct trading will require approval from the relevant authorities. Sanctions and other geopolitical pressures could alter timelines or force changes to how the service is structured. Compliance teams will need to reconcile domestic rules with international restrictions that affect many big banks operating in or dealing with Russia. For now, the rollout remains conditional. VTB’s timeline, client criteria, and product design all hinge on legal clarifications and regulator consent. Market participants and clients will likely follow announcements from the Bank of Russia and other agencies to judge how soon broader access might come.

55405263,640848,1764975653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55405263.jpeg,Layoff Rumors And Metaverse Cuts Push Meta Shares Higher—Details,https://bitcoinist.com/layoff-rumors-and-metaverse-cuts-push-meta-shares-higher-details/,"Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back. Metaverse Budget Faces A Major Trim Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces. Reality Labs Has Been Losing Billions Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money. Investors Reward A Smaller Bet The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns. Layoffs Could Follow Early Next Year Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software. A Bigger Push Toward AI And Wearables At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie. What This Means For Users And Competitors For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business. Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.

Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week 2025, he dismissed the current bearish mood around crypto as temporary and completely out of sync with the fundamentals supporting the market. 2026 has the potential to be “the most bullish year in crypto yet,” with institutions paving the way for a $180,000 Bitcoin. BREAKING: RIPPLE $XRP CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE PREDICTS BITCOIN WILL HIT $180,000 BY THE END OF 2026. pic.twitter.com/uIRgKm7zIr — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) December 3, 2025 The pro-crypto regulatory shift in the U.S. has unlocked one-fifth of global GDP, with institutional-level demand only just being tapped into with the introduction of ETFs. And they have only just permeated the mainstream with traditional asset manager giants outside of digital-native firms playing “catch-up,” introducing their vast clientele. Garlinghouse rejects the idea that ETF demand has peaked, noting the few crypto offerings represent just 1–2% of all ETF assets, a tiny fraction that leaves enormous upside. XRP is a standout beneficiary with steps towards regulation, like the GENIUS stablecoin Act, paving the way for its infrastructure, like stablecoins, to become mainstream. Ripple’s stablecoin approvals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai reinforce that point; stablecoins are no longer experimental, they’re becoming embedded in real financial systems . XRP Price Prediction: How High Can XRP go in 2026? December is shaping a strong launchpad into 2026 with a strong confluence of support laying the groundwork for a 4-month descending channel breakout. The lower boundary of this consolidation is about to be retested, aligning with the level that has provided a firm bottom market throughout the bullish phase of the market cycle at $1.90. A strong technical setup for a launchpad, and momentum indicators could support it. XRP USD 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView . While its most recent attempt has ended in rejection, the RSI is now testing the 50 neutral line after weeks in deep oversold territory. Strength is building towards a bullish shift. While the MACD verges on a death cross below the signal line, it may prove short-lived as XRP nears the confluence zone. The key breakout threshold lies at $2.70, a former strong support level that recently flipped to resistance. Reclaiming this zone could confirm a breakout targeting an 80% upside move to $3.70 . And with further U.S. interest rate easing expected into and growing institutional involvement, the setup could extend much higher, eyeing $5 in the approach of past all-time highs for a 150% run.

Pepe Price Prediction: Lead Team Fails to Address the Threat – How Low Can PEPE Go? Meme coins have experienced big losses in 2025 as the market has shunned this entire category despite the May-October altseason. Source: TradingView The token has lost more than three-quarters of its value since the start of the year. This reflects the market’s lack of appetite for PEPE. The meme coin has temporarily found support at $0.0000040 following a robust jobs report in the United States. Although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a mild bullish divergence, the price still needs to climb above $0.0000055 to reverse its latest downtrend. PEPE may not hit zero after the news, as the website does not compromise the token’s smart contract. However, the lack of coordination from the lead team does favor a bearish outlook as Pepe’s community engagement seems weak. In contrast, a new c rypto presale inspired by the Pepe viral meme called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has managed to raise nearly $2.3 million to launch its fun mine-to-earn (M2E) game. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Meme Coin Mining Fun and Hardware-Free Crypto mining has commonly been associated with expensive hardware, complex algorithms, and so on. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that by introducing an M2E model that allows users to easily launch virtual mining servers . By buying $PEPENODE, players can launch as many mining rigs as they want to earn points and compete to make it to the leaderboard. Top miners receive airdrops of popular meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) from the project’s rewards pool. In addition, they can upgrade their setup to increase their output by investing additional $PEPENODE tokens. Up to 70% of the tokens used will be burned forever to reduce the circulating supply.

This technical weakness would supposedly allow node operators to have a say on what happens with users’ tokens. He clarified that the funds locked up in the L2 and delegated to third-party Hydra Heads (validators) are fully in control of the latter, not the owner. In theory, if Hydra Heads collude and introduce false transactions, they would be able to sign them without necessarily having access to the private keys of the original owner of the ADA tokens. “Every update requires signatures from all Hydra Head operators. Those signatures are made using the private keys of the operators, not the users,” YODA emphasized. He added: “If they collude, they can ALL sign a malicious snapshot that splits all the funds between them.” Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Finds Support at $0.40 But Bearish Trend Persists Aside from Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) has been one of the worst-performing top 10 tokens this year, with total losses now reaching 49%. Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the token has found support temporarily at $0.40. However, ADA has been on a strong downtrend and is not yet showing signs of a trend reversal.

A crucial on-chain metric is flashing a warning sign that seasoned investors watch closely. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno, buying pressure from a key investor cohort—addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC—has slowed significantly. This slowdown has broken a long-term upward trendline, suggesting a pivotal change in market dynamics. For anyone tracking the Bitcoin bear market potential, this data point is impossible to ignore. What Does the 100-1,000 BTC Wallet Data Reveal? Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, has pinpointed a concerning trend. The cohort of wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, which importantly includes addresses for Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries, is showing weakened demand. Their cumulative annual purchases have fallen sharply. Peak Purchase: 965,000 BTC at the all-time high. Current Purchase Level: 694,000 BTC. This represents a substantial drop. Moreno concludes that this decline in demand from such a significant player group is a strong indicator that the market may have entered a bear market phase. This isn’t just retail sentiment; it’s a signal from some of the market’s largest and most informed entities. Why is This Investor Cohort So Important? You might wonder why this specific group matters more than others. The answer lies in their profile and influence. Addresses in the 100-1,000 BTC range are typically not held by everyday retail investors. Instead, they represent: Institutional Capital: This includes Bitcoin ETF holdings and corporate treasury allocations (like those from MicroStrategy or Tesla). Sophisticated Whales: High-net-worth individuals or investment funds with a deep understanding of market cycles. Market Stability: Their consistent buying has historically provided a foundation of support during corrections. When these deep-pocketed investors slow their accumulation, it removes a major source of buy-side pressure. This can leave the market more vulnerable to downward moves, reinforcing the Bitcoin bear market thesis. How Does This Signal a Potential Bitcoin Bear Market? The technical breakdown of the long-term trendline is the critical chart pattern. Think of this trendline as a measure of consistent institutional faith. For months or even years, this group’s buying activity formed a reliable upward slope on the chart. The recent break below this line is a technical confirmation of the weakening fundamental data. Therefore, it’s not just that purchases are down. The pattern of support has been violated. This combination of factors—reduced buying volume from key players and a broken technical structure—creates a compelling argument for a shift in the market cycle. It suggests a period of consolidation or decline, a hallmark of a bear market , may be taking hold. What Should Investors Do With This Information? This analysis serves as a crucial data point, not a crystal ball. However, it provides actionable context for your strategy. First, understand that on-chain analytics like this offer a view into the actions of major holders, which often precede price movements. Second, this signal suggests increasing caution may be prudent. Consider reviewing your portfolio’s risk exposure and ensuring you have a plan for different market scenarios. Remember, a Bitcoin bear market phase, while challenging, also creates opportunities for long-term accumulation at lower price points for those who are prepared. Conclusion: A Vital Metric Demands Attention The slowdown in buying from 100-1,000 BTC wallets is a stark warning from the blockchain itself. When the market’s most substantial and presumably well-informed participants pull back, it’s a trend that demands respect. While no single indicator guarantees the future, this breakdown in institutional accumulation pressure is a powerful piece of evidence supporting the bear market entry thesis. Investors should monitor this and other on-chain metrics closely to navigate the potentially shifting tides ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this signal guarantee a Bitcoin price crash? A: No single metric guarantees future price action. This is a strong warning sign of weakening demand from a critical cohort, but it must be considered alongside other market factors like macroeconomic conditions and broader adoption trends. Q2: Who is Julio Moreno and why should I trust this analysis? A: Julio Moreno is a Senior Analyst at CryptoQuant, a leading provider of on-chain data and analytics for cryptocurrencies. His analysis is based on transparent, verifiable blockchain data rather than opinion. Q3: What other signs should I look for in a bear market? A: Other signs include sustained price trading below key moving averages (like the 200-day), negative funding rates in perpetual futures markets, and a general decline in market sentiment and trading volume. Q4: Can a bear market be a good thing for investors? A: For long-term, disciplined investors, bear markets can present opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices, a strategy often referred to as “dollar-cost averaging.” However, it requires a strong stomach for volatility. Q5: How long do Bitcoin bear markets typically last? A: Historically, Bitcoin bear markets have varied in length, often lasting several months to over a year. They are part of the natural market cycle. Q6: Do ETF flows still affect this wallet cohort? A> Yes, significantly. A large portion of the BTC in this 100-1,000 range is held by custodians for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Slowing purchases by this cohort directly reflects slowing net inflows into these ETFs.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are down by just under 2% in 24 hours, while XRP and Solana have suffered falls of around 4%. Yet the market’s total capitalization ($3.2 trillion) has risen by 5.5% since Tuesday and by 7% since November 23, as the mood warms after a period of AI-bubble-related fears. Now may therefore be a very good time to buy again, just as coins begin regaining strength, but before they rise too much. We’ve therefore picked the best altcoin to buy now, a new ERC-20 token called PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) that’s aiming to make mining much more accessible. Best Altcoin to Buy Now – 5 December PEPENODE’s approach to mining is simple: give users the ability to build their own virtual mining rigs, which they can run in order to earn rewards in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe (it will add other coins in the future). Upgrading Nodes is like leveling up in life. Suddenly everything feels easier. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/FHs8HwglBs — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 5, 2025 Users can build their rigs by spending PEPENODE tokens to buy more virtual nodes, which they can upgrade and combine in order to earn more mining rewards. The more nodes they have and the more they’ve upgraded them, the more rewarding PEPENODE’s mining system will be for users. This creates a huge incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, which users can also stake for a passive income, with its current APY at 570% . Demand for the new token could therefore be substantial, pushing its price up over time. What’s also attractive about PEPENODE’s mining system is its flexibility: users can make their mining rigs as large as they like, but they can also sell off their nodes if they wish to scale down. Such features help to explain why the coin is already proving so popular, with its presale having raised $2.27 million . This is a very positive figure for such a new token and offers some sign of its future potential. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It Ends Investors can tap into this future potential by going to the official PEPENODE website , where the coin is currently selling $0.0011778. This price will rise later today and will continue to rise until the sale enters its final phase, just before PEPENODE lists. Potential buyers should therefore act quickly, since the available signs suggest that PEPENODE has the potential to be one of 2026’s biggest new alts. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with allocations divided between node rewards, liquidity, development, marketing, and its treasury. Its unique mining system is the main reason why it’s our best altcoin to buy now, and its upcoming launch could coincide with a major market recovery and rally.

However, he believes they will come in too late. He expects their FOMO to set in once the asset reaches much higher levels. Weak Sentiment as XRP Struggles to Hold Support XRP has been dealing with a difficult period, moving lower along with the rest of the crypto market. Since October, the token has fallen by close to 30% and is trading near $2.06. Sellers have continued to push the price down , and the $2 level has become an important support that buyers are trying to keep in place. This decline has led to a more negative mood among many holders . Near the end of last month, a community researcher shared data showing that whales sold about $400 million worth of XRP in only two days. Most of these sales came from wallets that hold between 1 and 10 million XRP, suggesting that large holders were reducing their positions as the asset’s price struggled. Many will FOMO when #XRP hits $5.85 & then $10 shortly after. They will be the next group to deal with, like the ones FOMO’d at $3.66. Ohhh one one one. — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 3, 2025 The Price That Could Draw People Back Despite the current pressure on the market, Dark Defender has continued to hold a positive long-term view. He believes that many people who are leaving now will return, but only after the token rises to higher levels. He says this behavior change will likely begin once XRP reaches $5.85. He has previously predicted that XRP will reach $5.85 , and this level represents a climb of almost 184%. He has pointed to long-term chart signals that support the idea of a strong move once momentum shifts. He has also explained that XRP has held a long-term pattern that remains in place and could push the price toward this first major target.

Dark Defender has also said that XRP can reach $10 after it moves past $5.85. This would be a larger jump of about 385% from today’s price. He believes that if XRP reaches these higher levels, many investors who exited earlier will rush back, even though they would have missed the largest gains. He pointed out that this has occurred before. When XRP rose from around $0.5 to its all-time high of $3.66 in July , many people bought in only after a large part of the rally was already complete. Raoul Pal, who once advised investors to look for alternatives, later admitted he was wrong after XRP’s rally in late 2024. Although XRP is showing weakness in the short term, Dark Defender remains bullish. He believes interest will return once the token begins to rise.

Blockchain data reveals a dormant Bitcoin whale address, inactive for a staggering 14 years, suddenly transferred 1,000 BTC—worth approximately $89 million. This event isn’t just a large transaction; it’s a message from Bitcoin’s ancient past, prompting urgent questions about market impact and holder behavior. What Does a Dormant Bitcoin Whale Transfer Mean? When a dormant Bitcoin whale moves funds, analysts pay close attention. This specific address, beginning with “1Au1uZ,” received its Bitcoin in 2010, when the asset was worth mere cents. The holder watched silently through multiple bull and bear markets. Therefore, their decision to act now is highly significant. It could signal a change in long-term conviction, an estate planning move, or preparation for a major market shift. Why Are These 14-Year-Old Coins So Important? Coins from this era are legendary. They represent the earliest days of Bitcoin, held by pioneers who believed in the technology before it had monetary value. The sheer willpower to hold through 14 years of volatility is extraordinary. When such coins move, it often affects market sentiment. Here’s why: Supply Shock Potential: These coins were effectively removed from circulating supply. Their movement back into active wallets can increase sell-side pressure. Psychological Signal: If a holder with diamond hands for 14 years decides to move coins, some investors interpret it as a potential local market top. Technical Analysis: On-chain metrics track these movements closely, using them to gauge overall holder sentiment and predict potential volatility. What Could This Whale Do Next? The immediate destination of the 1,000 BTC was another address, not a known exchange. This suggests the holder is not selling directly at this moment. However, the possibilities are vast. The whale might be: Consolidating wallets for security or estate purposes. Preparing to use the Bitcoin as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Transferring ownership, perhaps to a next-generation custodian or a family member. Simply testing wallet functionality after more than a decade. Until the coins reach an exchange or are used in a visible transaction, their ultimate purpose remains a fascinating mystery. How Does This Impact the Broader Bitcoin Market? While $89 million is a large sum, it’s a fraction of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume. The direct price impact is often minimal. The real impact is psychological. News of a dormant Bitcoin whale awakening can create short-term FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) among retail traders. Conversely, it can also be viewed as a sign of an aging market where early adopters are finally taking profits, a natural evolution for any asset class. Ultimately, it underscores Bitcoin’s core narrative: the ability to store life-changing value securely over immense periods. Conclusion: A Testament to Bitcoin’s Promise The awakening of this dormant Bitcoin whale is a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency’s unique properties. An individual held a digital key securely for 14 years and unlocked $89 million. This event validates Bitcoin’s original promise as a sovereign store of value. While the market watches the next move, the story itself—of patience, belief, and newfound wealth—is the true headline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “dormant Bitcoin whale”? A: A dormant Bitcoin whale is a cryptocurrency address holding a large amount of Bitcoin (typically 1,000 BTC or more) that has not made any outgoing transactions for a very long time, often several years. Q2: Why is a 14-year dormancy period so significant? A: Bitcoin was launched in 2009. Coins from 2010 are among the oldest in existence, mined or purchased when Bitcoin had almost no monetary value. Holding them this long demonstrates extreme conviction. Q3: Does this mean the whale is selling their Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. The transfer was to another private address. Selling usually involves sending coins to a cryptocurrency exchange. This could be a preparatory step, but it is not a direct sale. Q4: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These tools monitor large wallet movements and exchange flows. Q5: Should I be worried about my Bitcoin investment when this happens? A: Single whale movements rarely dictate long-term market trends. Bitcoin’s price is influenced by macroeconomics, adoption, and institutional flows. View such events as interesting data points, not sell signals. Q6: What’s the largest dormant whale wallet ever seen? A: The famous Satoshi-era wallets, believed to belong to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, hold over 1 million BTC and have never moved. They represent the ultimate in dormancy. Did this story of a sleeping giant fascinate you?

55405398,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=873750,1764978303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55405398.jpeg,Strive challenges MSCI’s proposal to exclude companies whose Bitcoin holdings exceed 50% of total assets,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/strive-challenges-mscis-50-bitcoin-threshold/,"Strive, a structured-finance company listed on Nasdaq and one of the world’s largest public corporate holders of Bitcoin, is fighting MSCI’s proposal to exclude Bitcoin-heavy companies from major global equity benchmarks. The firm sent a letter this week to Henry Fernandez, MSCI’s CEO, stating that the proposed exclusion would violate the “long-established principle of index neutrality.” Strive said such benchmarks need to be based on the market for digital currency and not contain special rules around considerations when companies hold digital assets. Strive now has over 7,500 BTC. This makes it one of the largest public companies in the world to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The firm said its heritage provides it with a unique understanding of how Bitcoin-treasury companies operate, and why blanket exclusions would distort markets. Strive argues the 50% threshold is flawed Strive’s response emphasized matters of methodology and fairness. The 50% digital-asset threshold is unjustified, overbroad, and unworkable, according to the firm. It argued that the rule does not account for the broad category to which the Bitcoin treasury has become. Many are also companies that do more than hold Bitcoin. A few run companies with proven businesses in AI-driven data centre infrastructure, structured finance, and more general digital asset financial services. Additionally, others, particularly large miners such as Marathon Digital , Riot Platforms, Hut 8, and CleanSpark, have diversified beyond the mining sector. Today, they lease out surplus power, computing capacity, and data-centre space to cloud and hyperscale customers. Strive contends that these companies are bigger than their Bitcoin treasuries, and excluding them would result in the elimination of real economic activity from global benchmarks. The company also identified a technical challenge: accounting standards are vast. Under U.S. GAAP, digital assets must be recorded at fair value every quarter. Under IFRS, which is used by many countries, companies can carry digital assets at their cost. That means two companies with the same Bitcoin exposure could appear to be assuming different concentrations of the digital asset. Strive cautioned that the rule would lead to disparate and unfair treatment between companies based solely on where they report their financial statements. Strive presented an alternative that seemed far more sensible. Rather than rewriting broad-index eligibility criteria, MSCI could create add-ons in the form of optional “ex-digital-asset-treasury” index variants. Investors wishing to avoid Bitcoin-treasury companies could then opt for those versions, without compelling everyone else to suffer the same exclusion. MSCI already offers “ex-energy,” “ex-tobacco,” and other screened index versions along these lines. Index shift threatens billions in market flows The answer could hinge on how the market perceives the insights gained through their research. If MSCI goes with the 50% rule, the implications could be enormous. Strategy — the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin — would be excluded from indexes that track trillions of dollars in global assets. Analysts estimate passive outflows of up to $2.8 billion from MSCI-tracked funds alone. Given that other index providers may copy MSCI, the amount could increase to nearly USD 9 billion. Market observers note that the impact may already be reflected in Strategy’s volatile share price. Some analysts contend that being dropped from an index would not compel the firm to dispose of its Bitcoin. Still, it may reduce passive demand for the cryptocurrency from institutional investors tracking MSCI benchmarks. Strive has also experienced its own share of volatility since earlier this year, when it debuted its Bitcoin treasury play via a reverse merger adoption. Its stock price soared from about 60 cents to more than $13 after it announced the Strategy, then fell back below $1. MSCI is expected to publish its decision on January 15, 2021, before the February index review. The result is being closely monitored throughout the cryptocurrency, financial indexing, and institutional investment worlds.

Yoodli, an AI-powered communication training platform founded by former Google X engineer Varun Puri, has just achieved a staggering valuation milestone – tripling to over $300 million in just six months. This remarkable growth story isn’t about replacing humans with machines, but about using AI to enhance what makes us uniquely human: our ability to communicate effectively. What Makes Yoodli’s AI Communication Training So Revolutionary? The Seattle-based startup’s recent $40 million Series B funding round, led by WestBridge Capital with participation from Neotribe and Madrona, represents more than just financial success. It signals a growing recognition that AI can be a powerful tool for human development rather than a threat to human employment. Yoodli’s platform uses sophisticated AI to create simulated scenarios for sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions, providing users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills. The Vision Behind Yoodli: From Personal Struggle to Global Solution Varun Puri’s journey to founding Yoodli is deeply personal. After moving to the U.S. at age 18, he experienced firsthand how communication challenges could hold back talented professionals from countries like India. “I became aware of how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals,” Puri explained in an interview. This insight, combined with his experience at Google’s X division working on special projects for Sergey Brin, led him to co-found Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi in 2021. Initially focused on helping people overcome the fear of public speaking – a skill two out of three people struggle with according to internal data – Yoodli quickly evolved as users began using the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations. This organic shift pushed the company from consumer-focused training to enterprise solutions. How Yoodli’s Series B Funding Will Accelerate Growth The $40 million Series B funding represents a significant acceleration for Yoodli, coming just months after a $13.7 million Series A round in May. Puri noted that the startup hadn’t planned to raise more funding so soon but was compelled by unexpected investor interest. Several factors contributed to this investor enthusiasm: 900% growth in average recurring revenue over the last 12 months 50% increase in role-plays run on the platform between funding rounds Expansion of enterprise customer base including Google, Snowflake, and Databricks Strategic executive hires from Tableau, Salesforce, and Remitly Enterprise Adoption: Why Major Companies Choose Yoodli Yoodli’s transition to enterprise training has been remarkably successful. The platform now offers AI role-plays and experiential learning tools for go-to-market enablement, partner certification, and management coaching. Puri contrasts this approach with traditional corporate training methods: “In the old world, companies would train people using static, long-form content or passive videos that we’d all watch at 4x-5x speed, just to get the thing done. But that doesn’t actually mean you’ve learned it.” The platform’s enterprise adoption includes: Company Type Examples Use Case Technology Companies Google, Snowflake, Databricks Employee communication training Sales Organizations RingCentral, Sandler Sales Sales pitch practice and coaching Coaching Firms Franklin Covey, LHH Customized training frameworks The Technology Behind Yoodli’s AI Communication Training Yoodli’s platform stands out for its technical sophistication and flexibility. The system works with multiple large-language models, allowing users to choose between Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s GPT, or other models based on preference. This multi-model approach ensures optimal performance across different use cases and languages. Key technical features include: Support for major languages including Korean, Japanese, French, and multiple Indian languages Enterprise integration capabilities for embedding into existing software systems Web-based access without requiring mobile apps (a deliberate choice to streamline training) Customization options that allow companies to tailor the system to their specific methodologies Human-Centric AI: Yoodli’s Philosophy of Augmentation, Not Replacement Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Yoodli’s approach is its philosophical commitment to human-centric AI. “I philosophically believe that AI can get you from a zero to an eight or a zero to nine,” says Puri. “But the pure essence of who you are and how you show up, and your authenticity and vulnerability that a human gives you feedback on will always exist.” This philosophy manifests in several ways: The platform is designed to complement human coaches rather than replace them AI provides scalable practice opportunities while humans deliver personalized guidance The system focuses on measurable improvement while preserving individual communication style Market Differentiation and Competitive Advantages While Yoodli operates in a growing market for AI-based communication tools, Puri emphasizes several key differentiators. The startup focuses on deep customization and specific training verticals, allowing companies to tailor the system to their unique use cases and coaching methods. This vertical specialization, combined with enterprise-grade integration capabilities, has helped Yoodli secure and retain major corporate clients. The company’s leadership team has been strengthened with strategic hires including: Josh Vitello (former Tableau and Salesforce executive) as Chief Revenue Officer Andy Larson (former Remitly CFO) as Chief Financial Officer Padmashree Koneti (former Tableau CPO) as Chief Product Officer Future Growth Plans and Market Expansion With approximately 40 employees and fresh capital from WestBridge Capital and other investors, Yoodli is poised for significant expansion. The company plans to use the Series B funding to: Enhance AI coaching, analytics, and personalization tools Expand presence in enterprise learning and professional development markets Grow the team across product, AI research, and customer success functions Enter Asia-Pacific markets while deepening U.S. market penetration FAQs About Yoodli and AI Communication Training Who founded Yoodli? Yoodli was co-founded by Varun Puri , a former Google X engineer who worked on special projects for Sergey Brin , and Esha Joshi , a former Apple engineer. Which companies use Yoodli for training? Major companies using Yoodli include Google , Snowflake , Databricks , RingCentral , and coaching firms like Franklin Covey . Who led Yoodli’s Series B funding round? The $40 million Series B round was led by WestBridge Capital , with participation from Neotribe and Madrona. What makes Yoodli different from other AI training platforms? Yoodli focuses on human-centric AI that augments rather than replaces human coaches, offers deep customization for enterprise clients, and supports multiple large-language models including Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. Where is Yoodli headquartered? Yoodli is based in Seattle, Washington, and has approximately 40 employees. Conclusion: The Future of Human-Centric AI Development Yoodli’s remarkable valuation surge to over $300 million represents more than just financial success – it validates a crucial approach to artificial intelligence development. In a landscape often dominated by fears of automation and job displacement, Yoodli demonstrates that AI can be a powerful force for human enhancement rather than replacement. The startup’s focus on communication skills, one of the most fundamentally human capabilities, combined with its enterprise-grade technology and human-centric philosophy, positions it at the forefront of a new wave of AI applications designed to make us better at being human. As companies worldwide grapple with the challenges of remote work, global teams, and increasingly complex communication environments, tools like Yoodli offer a compelling solution.

The discussion featured Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver, who described a pattern he believes is unfolding quietly in elite financial circles. According to Claver, multiple family offices with substantial multi-generational wealth are now building meaningful positions in XRP, a trend he argues has been largely overlooked. Claver referenced an account relayed to him by a friend, involving a prominent family connected to a major U.S. food brand that was overheard during a private ride in Orlando discussing the size of their XRP holdings. While the anecdote was secondary in nature, he said it aligns closely with conversations he has held recently with several major family offices that are allocating capital to XRP at a faster pace than the general market realizes. Claver emphasized the contrast between the small size of most existing XRP wallets and the volume of assets controlled by these large private investors. He pointed out that although XRP has roughly 7 million wallets globally, a significant portion of them hold under 100 XRP. He argued that this level of concentration, combined with growing institutional participation , could create conditions for stronger price performance if broader adoption accelerates. Why Billionaires Are Looking at XRP In explaining the motivation behind these secretive allocations, Claver stated that extremely wealthy families are approaching crypto not as short-term speculation. He stressed that these groups have already accumulated their wealth and are focused on safeguarding it. Their interest, he said, is driven by strategies focused on preservation rather than aggressive risk-taking. He reiterated that these investors “aren’t rolling the dice”; instead, they are using digital assets as long-term hedges. Claver also highlighted that only about 38% of global family offices are even considering digital asset exposure at this stage. He believes the remainder are beginning to examine assets such as XRP in response to concerns arising from macroeconomic developments, including the reverse carry trade. As traditional financial institutions increasingly validate the digital asset sector, Claver maintains that large investors will eventually maintain at least some exposure, and he described the current moment as the early stage of that transition. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP ETFs Absorb Over 400 Million Tokens in Nine Days The same Good Evening Crypto segment also referenced recent remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who said the newly listed XRP ETFs remain “underappreciated.” The program noted that more than 400 million XRP have been absorbed by these ETFs through OTC channels and exchanges within their first 15 days of trading. The funds have seen inflows exceeding $887 million, with total assets reaching more than $906 million as of Wednesday. Despite this rapid accumulation, XRP’s market price has continued to struggle below what many investors describe as a firm resistance level near $2. Nonetheless, analysts appearing on the program suggested that ongoing institutional accumulation could eventually trigger a market separation from broader price trends if demand from ETFs continues to build. Ripple’s Global Positioning Strengthens the Thesis Host Abs expanded on why affluent families may be turning their attention to XRP at this moment. He pointed to Ripple’s established relationships with governments, central banks, and major institutions, describing XRP as one of the few digital assets positioned for large-scale financial integration. Claver added that XRP’s enterprise-grade functionality sets it apart in an evolving global financial system. The host also suggested that the confirmation of interest from major American family lineages signals a possible shift toward early-stage mainstream recognition. In closing, Claver restated a principle he believes applies in the current environment: “You should only have to get rich once.” He argued that many of these families view XRP as one of the strategic components that can support long-term stability.

55407314,640808,1764979252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55407314.jpeg,"Top Dogecoin Wallets Begin Rapid Accumulation As Price Struggles, Is A Surge Coming?",https://bitcoinist.com/top-dogecoin-wallets-accumulation/,"Dogecoin has spent the past few days rebounding after a downturn to the mid-$0.13s, and its on-chain activity is beginning to tell an interesting bullish story. Data from Santiment shows a quiet accumulation trend of hundreds of millions of DOGE tokens taking place among some of the asset’s larger holders, even as the price continues to struggle for momentum. This change in wallet behavior is unfolding at a time when Dogecoin’s recent performance offers very little excitement for bullish traders, making the quiet accumulation all the more notable. Dogecoin Whales Accumulation: What the Numbers Show The data from Santiment highlights a quick climb in holdings among Dogecoin addresses holding between 1 million DOGE to 100 million DOGE tokens. Particularly, the data shows that the collective holding of this cohort has grown from 27.79 billion on December 3 to 28.34 billion DOGE at the time of writing. That equates to an increase of about 550 million DOGE in roughly 48 hours, a meaningful inflow even for a large-cap crypto like Dogecoin. This trend shows that these mid-size and large holders view current prices as favorable entry points. Broad accumulation by this “whale tier” often precedes consolidation phases or, in some cases, precedes upward moves, especially if retail sentiment is weak and fewer coins are being sold into the market. Interestingly, this accumulation, which kicked off after Dogecoin fell to the mid-$0.13 range on December 3, contributed to a rebound at this level that contributed to the meme coin reaching an intraday high of $0.1504 in the past 24 hours. Is A Surge Coming For Dogecoin? Accumulation by larger wallets can reshape market conditions in subtle but meaningful ways. First, it reduces the circulating supply available to typical retail traders, which can tighten availability and potentially support price stability or upward pressure. Second, it reflects conviction. Large holders are showing confidence in DOGE’s long-term value, even when price action is not yet bullish. Furthermore, this recent buying represents the first clear shift in sentiment among whale cohor s after weeks of steady distribution. Santiment’s data shows that these wallets had been decreasing their balances since mid-October, and the trend coincided with a drop in large transactions that pushed activity to a two-month low. While accumulation may set the stage for a rally, there are still structural challenges that Dogecoin must face. T echnical analysis suggests that $0.138 is a critical level for confirming whether a firm bottom has formed. Sustained trading above that zone in the coming weeks would strengthen the case that the worst of the downturn is over. At the same time, crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus outlined a possible upside target in the $0.70 to $0.75 region as the peak of the current cycle. This price target aligns with other technical projections for the meme coin.",Dogecoin|Bitcoinsensus|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|meme coin|Santiment,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 00:00:52

Dogecoin Has A Large Supply Cluster Present At $0.20 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where resistance lies for Dogecoin based on Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). The CBD is an indicator that tells us about the amount of DOGE supply that was last acquired at the various price levels that the memecoin has visited in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the recent CBD heatmap for Dogecoin. As is visible in the graph, the Dogecoin CBD has flagged the zone around $0.20 as one where investors did some heavy buying. More specifically, over 11.7 billion tokens have their cost basis at this level. Considering that DOGE is trading notably under the mark right now, all this supply would naturally be in the red. The asset rising to this level could cause a strong reaction from the investors, as these tokens will get back to their break-even. Generally, holders in loss can be desperate for the price to reach back to their cost basis. Once the asset does rise to their acquisition level, some of these investors choose to sell, fearing that the rebound is only temporary. This can make large cost basis levels above the asset’s price potential zones of resistance. Between the current price and $0.20, there aren’t any other regions in the CBD that are as dense with supply. Based on this, Martinez has noted, “$0.20 is the key resistance for Dogecoin.” It now remains to be seen whether DOGE will retest this level anytime soon. In some other news, the memecoin has seen a spike in network activity recently, as the analyst has pointed out in another X post. In the chart, the indicator shown is the Number of Active Addresses, which measures, as its name suggests, the daily number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the Dogecoin network. It would appear that this indicator has registered a surge recently, with a peak 71,589 addresses making transfers on the blockchain. This is the largest spike that the metric has observed since September.

This announcement creates immediate buzz and signals potential new avenues for traders and investors. But what does this roadmap addition truly mean for you? Let’s explore the implications. What Is the Coinbase Listing Roadmap and Why Does It Matter? First, let’s clarify the process. The Coinbase listing roadmap is a public, forward-looking document the exchange uses to signal which assets it is actively exploring for potential future listing. It is not a guarantee of listing, but a strong indicator of interest. This transparency is a key part of Coinbase’s effort to build trust and manage market expectations. When a token appears on this roadmap, it often leads to increased visibility and trading interest in that asset across other platforms. Who Are IMU and SENT? A Closer Look at the Newcomers Understanding the projects behind the tokens is crucial. While specific details about IMU and SENT will require your own research (always DYOR—Do Your Own Research), their inclusion on the Coinbase listing roadmap suggests they have passed initial technical and compliance reviews. IMU (imu) : This token likely represents a project in the decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, or infrastructure space. Its presence on the roadmap indicates Coinbase sees growing ecosystem relevance. SENT (sent) : This asset is often associated with decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) or data oracle services. Its consideration points to Coinbase’s interest in expanding beyond pure currency tokens. The key takeaway? Coinbase is continuously scouting for innovative projects that add value to the broader crypto ecosystem. How Does This Benefit Crypto Investors? For the average investor, a Coinbase listing roadmap update is more than just news—it’s a strategic signal. Here’s why it matters for your portfolio: Early Awareness : The roadmap gives you a heads-up on assets Coinbase is seriously considering, allowing for earlier research. Validation : Earning a spot on the roadmap acts as a layer of validation for a project, as Coinbase’s compliance checks are rigorous. Liquidity & Access : If listed, these tokens gain access to Coinbase’s massive user base, typically boosting liquidity and stability. However, remember this is not financial advice. Roadmap inclusion does not equal a successful investment. Market volatility remains high, and prices can react unpredictably to listing news. What Are the Next Steps After a Roadmap Announcement? So, Coinbase added IMU and SENT to its Coinbase listing roadmap . What happens now? The journey from roadmap to live trading involves several stages: Further Evaluation : Coinbase engineers conduct deep technical reviews of the asset’s blockchain. Legal & Compliance Review : Teams ensure the asset meets regulatory standards. Integration : The asset is integrated into Coinbase’s trading systems. Final Announcement : Coinbase will make a separate, official announcement if and when IMU and SENT are approved for trading. This process underscores the importance of the roadmap as a planning tool for both the exchange and the community. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for a Growing Ecosystem The addition of IMU and SENT to the Coinbase listing roadmap is a significant development. It highlights Coinbase’s ongoing mission to diversify its offerings and support the growth of the crypto space. For investors, it serves as a valuable research prompt and a reminder of the dynamic nature of this market. By paying attention to these roadmap updates, you can stay informed about potential new trends and opportunities shaping the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does being on the Coinbase listing roadmap guarantee a listing? A: No. The roadmap indicates exploration and interest, but it is not a guarantee. Final listing depends on successful completion of technical, security, and legal reviews. Q: When will IMU and SENT start trading on Coinbase? A: There is no set timeline. Coinbase will make a separate announcement if and when the assets are approved for trading. The roadmap only signals the evaluation phase. Q: Should I buy IMU or SENT now because of this news?

This is no longer a distant dream. Plume, a blockchain built for regulatory-compliant real-world assets (RWA), has just announced a pivotal move to bring its institutional-grade real-world asset yields to the Solana network. This integration bridges a crucial gap, offering crypto natives a trusted gateway to yields backed by real economy assets. What Are Real-World Asset Yields on Solana? Simply put, real-world asset yields are returns generated from tangible, off-chain investments like government bonds, corporate credit, or receivables. Traditionally, these are accessed through banks or brokers. Plume’s initiative tokenizes these assets, allowing them to be held and traded on-chain. By bringing this to Solana, users can now tap into these yields with the speed and low cost the network is famous for. This is a significant step for decentralized finance (DeFi), moving beyond purely crypto-native yields to include those from the broader global economy. Which Vaults Are Coming to Solana? Plume isn’t starting small. The project is onboarding five established “Nest” vaults to the Solana ecosystem, each backed by major traditional finance names. This provides immediate credibility and a diverse range of yield sources. Here are the vaults making the leap: nBASIS & nALPHA: Backed by assets from Hamilton Lane and BlackOpal, focusing on institutional private credit. nTBILL: Collateralized by short-term U.S. Treasury bills, offering a government-backed yield option. nWISDOM & nOPAL: Featuring assets from WisdomTree and Securitize, providing access to a basket of institutional investment strategies. Each vault represents a different slice of the real-world economy, from private equity to secure government debt, all now accessible with a Solana wallet. How Can You Maximize These Real-World Asset Yields? Accessing the yield is just the beginning. The Solana DeFi ecosystem is poised to amplify the utility of these tokenized RWAs. Notably, the Solana-based protocol Loopscale has plans to launch a feature that will let users employ leverage using their Nest vault tokens. This means you could potentially use your nTBILL tokens as collateral to borrow and amplify your position, seeking greater returns. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage increases risk alongside potential reward. This native integration showcases how Solana’s composability can create new financial primitives around real-world asset yields . Why Does This Matter for the Future of Crypto? This move is more than just another protocol launch. It represents a maturation of the crypto space. By offering compliant, tangible yields, projects like Plume address a major criticism of DeFi: the lack of sustainable, non-inflationary income streams. For Solana, it strengthens the network’s value proposition as a home for serious financial innovation beyond speculation. For the average user, it provides a compelling reason to hold assets on-chain, knowing they can generate steady real-world asset yields from a diversified portfolio. This bridges the gap between TradFi reliability and DeFi efficiency. Conclusion: A New Era for On-Chain Finance The arrival of Plume’s RWA vaults on Solana is a landmark event. It signals a shift towards a more robust, diversified, and sustainable financial ecosystem built on blockchain technology. Users gain access to institutional-grade yield sources with the permissionless access of crypto. While navigating regulatory compliance remains key, this partnership paves the way for a future where the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur, all powered by the pursuit of genuine real-world asset yields . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly are real-world assets (RWAs) in crypto? A: RWAs are tangible, off-chain assets like real estate, bonds, or commodities that are tokenized (represented as digital tokens) on a blockchain. This allows them to be traded, owned fractionally, and integrated into DeFi applications. Q: How do I access Plume’s yields on Solana? A: You will need a Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom). Once the vaults are live, you can visit Plume’s or a supported partner’s interface to deposit into the specific Nest vault (nTBILL, nALPHA, etc.) of your choice. Q: Are these yields safer than typical DeFi yields? A: They are backed by different underlying assets. While no investment is risk-free, yields from government bonds (like nTBILL) are generally considered lower risk than yields from untested crypto farming pools, as they are backed by sovereign entities. Always do your own research. Q: What is the role of Loopscale? A: Loopscale is a Solana protocol planning to allow users to use their Nest vault tokens as collateral to take out loans. This “leverage” feature lets users potentially increase their exposure and returns, but it also significantly increases risk. Q: Is my investment in these vaults liquid? A: Liquidity will depend on the specific vault and the secondary markets that develop for their tokens. The involvement of major firms suggests efforts will be made to ensure reasonable liquidity, but it may not be as instant as trading major cryptocurrencies. Q: Why is Solana a good network for this? A: Solana offers high transaction throughput and very low fees, which is essential for making small, frequent yield payments economically viable and for ensuring a smooth user experience when managing positions.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plummeted five points to a score of 23, officially re-entering the “Extreme Fear” territory. This sudden shift signals rising anxiety among investors and can often precede significant price volatility. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and is extreme fear always a bad sign? Let’s break down the data and uncover the opportunities hidden within the panic. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial barometer for investor emotion. Created by Alternative.me, it compiles multiple data points into a single, easy-to-understand number. A score of 0 represents maximum fear, while 100 signals extreme greed. The current reading of 23 is a clear warning sign that negative sentiment is dominating the market. This drop didn’t happen in a vacuum; it reflects a combination of recent price swings, social media chatter, and search trends all pointing toward caution. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t just a guess. It’s a data-driven formula designed to capture the market’s pulse. Understanding its components helps you see beyond the headline number. The calculation is based on six key factors: Volatility (25%): Recent price swings, especially sharp downturns, increase the fear score. Market Volume (25%): High trading volume during sell-offs amplifies fear signals. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of mentions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls and community sentiment checks. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s market share rises, it often indicates a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like “Bitcoin crash” or “crypto bear market.” Therefore, the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score synthesizes all these real-time signals into one digestible metric. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Extreme Fear? It’s natural to feel nervous when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes red. However, seasoned investors often view extreme fear through a different lens. Historically, prolonged periods of fear have created some of the best long-term buying opportunities. When everyone is selling in panic, asset prices can disconnect from their fundamental value. This doesn’t mean you should blindly buy the dip, but it’s a signal to start paying closer attention. The key is to have a plan and not let emotion dictate your actions. Actionable Insights for Trading in a Fearful Market Navigating a market governed by fear requires discipline. Here are practical steps to consider: Review Your Strategy: Does your plan account for high volatility? Stick to it. Practice Risk Management: This is not the time for high leverage. Ensure your positions are sized appropriately. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Use the quiet time to research projects you believe in. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Spreading purchases over time can reduce the impact of buying at a peak. Remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. It tells you what the crowd is feeling, not what will happen next. The Bottom Line on Today’s Market Sentiment The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 23 is a significant shift in market psychology. It confirms that the current environment is risk-averse and emotionally charged. While this presents challenges, it also separates impulsive traders from strategic investors. By understanding the metrics behind the fear, you can make informed decisions rather than reactive ones. Market cycles always turn, and sentiment indicators are often most useful at their extremes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 23 mean? A: A score of 23 falls into the “Extreme Fear” zone (0-25). It indicates that current market data and sentiment are overwhelmingly negative and fearful. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a good predictor of price? A: It is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. However, sustained extreme fear has often coincided with market bottoms, while extreme greed has marked tops. Q: How often is the index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market emotion. Q: Should I sell when the index shows extreme fear? A: Not necessarily. Selling during extreme fear often means selling at a low. Many investors use it as a contrarian indicator to look for potential entry points, always within their risk tolerance. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin dominance is a component, the index aims to measure sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market.

According to data from Onchain-Lenz, these digital vaults, untouched since the early days of Bitcoin, transferred a colossal 2,000 BTC—worth approximately $178.29 million—to a new address. This event is not just a transaction; it’s a piece of blockchain history coming to life, prompting urgent questions about market impact and the motives behind this monumental shift. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Whale Movement Mean? When Bitcoin whale addresses of this vintage stir, the entire market pays attention. These specific addresses received their Bitcoin in 2013, a time when the network was in its infancy and the price was a fraction of today’s value. The sheer scale of this transfer, moving nearly $180 million in a single action, represents a significant potential supply shock. Analysts are now scrambling to interpret the signal. Is this a strategic sell-off, a portfolio reorganization, or simply the movement of assets to a more secure modern wallet? The intent behind the move from these specific Bitcoin whale addresses will dictate its short-term impact on liquidity and price sentiment. Why Are Dormant Coins So Significant? The movement of long-dormant coins is a rare and powerful on-chain metric. Think of these Bitcoin whale addresses as digital time capsules. Their inactivity for over a decade suggests the holders are original, patient investors—often called “HODLers.” Their decision to act now can be interpreted in several ways: Market Timing: The holder may believe a market top is near and is preparing to realize historic gains. Estate Planning: After 13 years, this could involve transferring wealth to heirs or a trust. Security Upgrade: Moving funds from an older, potentially vulnerable wallet to a new, more secure address. Institutional Action: The coins could be moving to a custody solution for a fund or corporate treasury. Each scenario carries different implications for whether these Bitcoins will hit the open market or simply change hands privately. How Could This Affect the Bitcoin Price? The immediate fear with any large movement from Bitcoin whale addresses is a sell-off that pressures the price. However, a transfer does not equal a sale. The key is tracking the destination address. If the 2,000 BTC moves to a known exchange deposit wallet, it strongly signals an impending sale, which could create downward pressure. Conversely, if it goes to another private, cold storage address, the market impact may be neutral or even positive, as it demonstrates continued long-term holding by a major player. This event serves as a crucial reminder of the power held within a few key Bitcoin whale addresses and their ability to influence market psychology. What Can Everyday Investors Learn From This? While most of us aren’t moving nine-figure sums, there are actionable insights from this whale activity. First, it highlights the incredible long-term value creation possible with Bitcoin. Second, it underscores the importance of secure, future-proof storage solutions. Finally, it teaches us to monitor on-chain data not for day-trading signals, but for understanding the behavior of the market’s most influential participants. Watching these Bitcoin whale addresses provides context, not a crystal ball. In conclusion, the awakening of these two dormant giants is a fascinating chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story. It connects the crypto present directly to its pioneering past. Whether this leads to market volatility or simply becomes a footnote, it reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value that can be preserved across decades. The movement from these historic Bitcoin whale addresses is a powerful testament to the asset’s resilience and the patience of its earliest believers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a “Bitcoin whale”? A: A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of Bitcoin that their transactions can potentially influence the market price. There’s no official threshold, but addresses holding thousands of BTC are universally considered whales. Q2: Why were these addresses dormant for 13 years? A: The holders likely acquired Bitcoin very early (around 2013) and chose a “HODL” strategy, meaning they bought and held through multiple market cycles without selling, possibly believing in its long-term potential as a digital gold. Q3: Does moving coins mean they are selling? A: Not necessarily. A transfer between private wallets is just a change of storage address. The key indicator of a sale is if the coins are sent to a deposit address at a cryptocurrency exchange. Q4: How can I track whale activity myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or Etherscan for Ethereum, or dedicated on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode or IntoTheBlock, which often highlight large and unusual transactions. Q5: Should I be worried about whale sales? A: While large sales can cause short-term price dips, Bitcoin’s market is now more liquid and institutionalized than ever. Whale movements are one factor among many, including macroeconomic trends and adoption rates. Q6: What’s the largest Bitcoin whale transaction ever recorded? A: Some of the largest involve transfers between wallets controlled by exchanges or institutional custodians. Single movements of tens of thousands of BTC have occurred, often related to internal reorganizations rather than individual sales.

In a market note published on Dec. 5, CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, said the latest solvency concerns “look misplaced,” pointing to Tether’s most recent attestation, which shows a headline surplus of assets over liabilities. Butterfill argued the numbers do not, at present, indicate a systemic vulnerability for USDT. The recent pushback follows Hayes’ recent warning that as Tether increases its exposure to Bitcoin and gold, it will also make it increasingly likely that a steep pullback in these assets could undermine its cushion on equity. He sai d a roughly 30% decline in those assets could, in theory, wipe out Tether’s equity buffer and render USDT “theoretically insolvent.” That argument quickly spread across crypto news sites and social media feeds. Butterfill replied with a short assessment of the data. The most recent attestation by Tether shows $181 billion in reserves and approximately $174.45 billion in liabilities, resulting in a surplus of nearly $6.55 billion. The study note also noted Tether’s abnormally strong profitability this year, with a year-to-date profit of more than $10 billion, and found that the available data at present does not imply a systemic weakness. CoinShares says Tether’s profits and surplus reserves blunt volatility risks CoinShares acknowledged that there are risks associated with stablecoins and should not be overlooked, but still stated that the current Tether data have not shown signs of systemic vulnerability. “Tether is still one of the most profitable companies in the sector, generating $10 billion in the first three quarters of the year — an unusually high figure on a per-employee basis ,” CoinShares’ head of research wrote. Tether’s Q3 disclosures — confirmed in an attestation it issued and widely reported by industry press — break down substantial portions of its reserves as large holdings of U.S. Treasuries (roughly $135 billion), along with approximately $12.9 billion of gold and $9.9 billion of Bitcoin. Those gold and Bitcoin positions are exactly the ones Hayes named as potential sources of volatility; CoinShares recognised the exposure, but added that the headline reserve — liability gap and strong profitability mitigate near-solvency risk. Tether counters solvency fears as critics target high-risk assets Although speculation about Tether’s financial health is hardly new — media outlets have been tracking its reserves and asset backing for years — the latest flurry of solvency concerns appears to have arisen thanks to Arthur Hayes. Last week, the BitMEX co-founder said it was “in the early innings of running a massive interest-rate trade,” claiming a 30% drop in its Bitcoin and gold holdings would “wipe out their equity” and leave its USDt stablecoin technically “insolvent.” Both assets make up a substantial portion of Tether’s reserves, with the firm increasing its gold exposure in recent years. Tether is facing criticism from more than just Hayes. CEO Paolo Ardoino recently pushed back on S&P Global’s downgrade of USDt’s ability to defend its US dollar peg, dismissing the move as “Tether FUD” — shorthand for fear, uncertainty, and doubt — and citing the company’s third-quarter attestation report in its defense. S&P Global downgraded the stablecoin due to stability concerns, citing its exposure to “higher-risk” assets, including gold, loans, and Bitcoin. According to CoinMarketCap, Tether’s USDt remains the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with $185.5 billion in circulation and a market share of nearly 59%.

This pivotal development could unlock a new wave of mainstream investment into the SUI token, directly bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative Sui blockchain. What Does Grayscale’s Sui ETF Filing Mean? Grayscale’s submission of an S-1 registration statement for a Sui ETF is a formal request to create a publicly traded fund. Therefore, if approved, investors could buy and sell shares of this ETF on traditional stock exchanges, gaining exposure to SUI’s price without managing private wallets or crypto exchanges. This process mirrors the path taken by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, marking a significant maturity milestone for the Sui network. Why Is This a Game-Changer for SUI? The filing is more than just paperwork; it’s a powerful endorsement. Grayscale, a titan in digital asset management, sees long-term value in Sui. Consequently, a Sui ETF would provide several key benefits: Accessibility: Opens SUI investment to retirement accounts and traditional brokers. Legitimacy: Enhances regulatory clarity and institutional trust in the asset. Liquidity: Potentially increases trading volume and market stability for SUI. However, the journey is just beginning. The SEC’s review will be thorough, focusing on market manipulation concerns and custody solutions. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the Sui ETF? Approval is not guaranteed. The SEC has historically been cautious with crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. Key hurdles include: Regulatory Scrutiny: How will the SEC classify SUI? Is it a security or a commodity? Market Surveillance: The SEC requires a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size. Custody: Providing proof of secure, compliant asset storage is paramount. Grayscale’s experience and resources give this Sui ETF proposal a strong foundation, but patience will be essential. How Does This Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs paved the way. Now, the race is on for the next generation of single-asset crypto funds. A Sui ETF would place SUI in an elite category alongside Ethereum, signaling its perceived importance in the smart contract platform arena. This move could pressure other asset managers to file for similar products, creating a competitive and innovative landscape. What Should Investors Do Now? For now, this is a development to watch closely. The filing is a profoundly bullish long-term signal for the Sui ecosystem. Investors should: Research the Sui Network: Understand its technology and use cases beyond the ETF news. Monitor SEC Announcements: The review process will provide critical updates. Assess Personal Strategy: Determine how a potential Sui ETF fits into a diversified portfolio. In summary, Grayscale’s Sui ETF filing is a landmark moment of validation. It represents a crucial bridge being built between Sui’s cutting-edge technology and the vast pools of traditional capital. While regulatory hurdles remain, this step forward illuminates a clear path toward mainstream financial integration for SUI, potentially reshaping its market trajectory for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Sui ETF? A Sui ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) would be an investment fund traded on stock exchanges. Its value would be tied to the price of the SUI cryptocurrency, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly buying or storing the token. Has the Sui ETF been approved? No. Grayscale has only filed the initial registration paperwork (Form S-1) with the SEC. Approval is not guaranteed and will likely take several months, if it happens at all. Why is Grayscale filing for a Sui ETF important? It signals serious institutional interest and could pave the way for easier, regulated investment in SUI for a much wider audience, including through retirement and brokerage accounts. What is the difference between Grayscale’s Sui Trust and a Sui ETF? Grayscale’s existing Sui Trust (if it exists) is a private, closed-end fund often trading at a premium or discount to the asset’s value. An ETF is more efficient, typically trades closer to the net asset value, and offers creation/redemption mechanisms to keep prices in line. How long does the SEC ETF approval process take? The timeline is unpredictable. It can range from several months to over a year, depending on the political climate, regulatory concerns, and the completeness of the application. Can I invest in the Sui ETF now? Not yet. You cannot invest until the SEC declares the registration statement “effective” and the ETF launches on a national stock exchange like NYSE Arca or Nasdaq.

Solana (SOL) remains to be one of the hardest-hitting altcoins in the marketplace, recognized for speed, scalability, and heightened liquidity, although the latest developments in this project have left investors wondering whether it still has what it takes to top past explosive growth milestones. In light of this prevailing uncertainty, many investors are naturally gravitating toward those assets that have higher asymmetry ratios and are at the early stages of development and showing real-world use and rapid adoption. And in this developing scenario, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the latest and hottest digital currency at just only $0.035, has naturally topped the list of the current best cryptos to invest in due to its nearly sold-out presale Phase 6, over 18,300 holders, and its upcoming V1 launch. Solana Remains at Crucial Levels as Market Participants Look for Breakout Points Solana (SOL) remains at the doorstep of a strong level of support in what has obviously been a period of consolidation, and traders are eagerly observing whether or not it anticipates breakout action that will allow it to finally push on towards the $200 to $280 level and beyond, particularly when taken in the context of strong levels of volatility that continue to be such an important defining factor for this asset class at this point in time. In an era in which investors are attempting to survey every possible opportunity on the market, this change in direction is naturally of much interest in relation to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which remains a brand-new addition to the world of cryptocurrencies at this point in time. Mutuum Finance Presale Speeds Up Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at just $0.01 per token. Since then, it has continuously increased in value to the current level of $0.035, showing a 250% appreciation in token value prior to launch. Each of the preceding stages sold out rapidly, showing steady and rising enthusiasm for this project amongst the international crypto community at large. Currently, Stage 6 is nearing completion and is amongst the most exciting stages of the presales. Investors are well aware that after the end of this phase of the presale, the token values are soon about to approach the expected launch price of $0.06, making this the ideal moment to acquire MUTM at just less than $0.04. Having raised in excess of $19.15 million thus far, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself at the top of the list for the very best crypto to invest in and amongst the top picks for emerging crypto sites of 2025. Effective Security Framework and Risk Management System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is based on the Loan-to-Value (LTV) model that balances risk on the asset side via collateralization, transfer, and liquidation functions. MUTM also employs a reserve factor and market condition buffer for extra protection in case of unexpected changes in the market. High-risk assets are carefully handled in a way that prioritizes the safety of both MUTM and the users. Protocol Mechanics and Interest Rate Model MUTM protocol uses interest rates that fluctuate in accordance with the market rates and liquidity. If liquidity is high in the market, the rates for borrowing are lowered to attract borrowing. However, when liquidity in the market is low, the rates are raised to ensure solvency and promote additional deposits. In this case, for those borrowing in order to create stability, fixed-rate borrowing also exists, and this rate is normally higher compared to those that are variable and can only be accessed in highly liquid collateral. Mutuum Finance uses strong risk management methods for protecting the system. Some of the important features are: Efficient liquidation systems for under-collateralized positions Over-collateralization of loans for protecting the lenders and the protocol Cascading Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios to control exposure Liquidity ceilings together with reserve factors for solvency in case of difficult markets Liquidation fees and risk buffers for covering losses and ensuring stability In this manner, several forces align together in order to create an enduring and secure borrowing and lending marketplace that can resist and overcome extreme changes in the markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has garnered over $19.15 million in funding with 18,300+ investors in its presale phase and the token is up 250% from 0.01 to 0.035. In the midst of Solana network consolidation, this makes for very promising early investment potential and genuine DeFi applications. Lock in those investments now before the end of phase 6 when values are expected to get to $0.06 at launch. Participate in the presale today and gain access to this emerging crypto asset and enjoy the best crypto to invest options in the current market. Mutuum Finance is undoubtedly the best crypto investment for those looking for potential growth and genuine applications.

55407316,640822,1764982826,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55407316.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Company Is About To List on The New York Stock Exchange,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-company-nyse/,"On 3rd December, official filings and press releases announced Twenty One Capital’s upcoming debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), positioning the company as one of the largest Bitcoin treasury firms ever to enter public markets. The listing brings a dedicated Bitcoin balance sheet into Wall Street’s core ecosystem, signaling a structural shift in how institutional investors can gain long-term BTC exposure. A Bitcoin Treasury Giant Steps Onto The NYSE Stage Twenty One Capital’s NYSE entry is anchored by its business combination with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) , the SPAC serving as the public-market vehicle for the transaction. CEP shareholders have already approved the merger, and the deal is expected to close around December 8. Once completed, the combined entity will operate as Twenty One Capital, Inc. and begin trading on December 9 under the ticker XXI. The original announcement, released through official press channels and SEC-related filings, emphasized CEP’s central role in enabling the listing and establishing the company’s public-market structure. CEO Jack Mallers also highlighted the milestone on X, noting the company’s readiness for its debut. According to this press announcement, Twenty One Capital will debut with an estimated 43,500 BTC , a reserve valued near $4 billion at recent market levels. This immediately places it among the top corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally . Unlike companies that hold Bitcoin as a secondary reserve, Twenty One is specifically engineered around a Bitcoin-native model. The firm intends to report “Bitcoin-per-share,” providing investors a transparent look at how much BTC each equity unit represents. It also pledges full, on-chain proof-of-reserves, positioning itself as a high-transparency asset custodian at launch. This model effectively transforms Twenty One into a regulated balance-sheet wrapper for Bitcoin . It lowers operational friction for institutional allocators who want direct BTC exposure without the complexities of crypto custody, self-storage, or exchange-based acquisition. By listing on the NYSE rather than relying on ETFs or derivatives, Twenty One creates a regulated public equity vehicle that holds, safeguards, and transparently tracks Bitcoin for institutional and retail investors alike. Wall Street’s New On-Ramp To Institutional BTC Exposure The market impact of Twenty One’s listing reflects the accelerating integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial architecture. The company’s backers—including Tether-linked entities, Bitfinex-aligned interests , SoftBank-connected capital, and Cantor’s public-markets network—provide a cross-sector foundation aimed at bridging crypto-native philosophies with institutional liquidity channels. Under this structure, Twenty One aims to become a long-term institutional treasury vessel —a regulated balance sheet that accumulates BTC and gives investors an equity-linked way to participate in Bitcoin’s upside without engaging directly with crypto custody or trading infrastructure. As the NYSE debut approaches, Twenty One Capital embodies a pivot point where BTC’s role in capital markets shifts from speculative asset to institutional treasury instrument. If XXI attracts sustained flow, it could set a new blueprint for how corporate entities engage with Bitcoin—anchoring Wall Street’s next phase of digital-asset adoption.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 01:00:26

He pointed to weakening selling pressure and growing underlying activity as reasons for cautious optimism. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets Market Sentiment May Be Near A Turning Point According to Lee, mood on the street turned darker after October, with many investors showing fatigue after steady losses. He said the current selling looks closer to exhaustion than to the start of another major decline. Trading desks have cut back. Volume has thinned. Sentiment is low. Lee argued that often, when pessimism peaks, conditions for a reversal begin to form. Bitcoin Drawdowns Are Not Uncommon Based on reports, Bitcoin has fallen about 36% from its all-time high in the recent retreat. That size of drop has happened in prior cycles, including 2017 and 2021, and has been followed by rallies that reached new records. “Crypto prices likely bottomed. The best years of growth are still ahead: there is 200x adoption to come.” – Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine pic.twitter.com/fPWbWdaosO — Binance (@binance) December 4, 2025 Lee pointed to long-term returns for bitcoin and ether compared with some traditional assets over the last decade, saying crypto’s gains were larger. He used that history to support the idea that patient holders have been rewarded after past stress. Tokenization Could Be A Major Story In 2026 Lee also presented tokenization as a key theme for the future. He said large institutions are preparing to move more financial products on-chain and that, if real estate joins the shift, close to a quadrillion dollars in assets could eventually be tokenized. Stablecoins were cited as an early example of why tokenized instruments can attract demand. He suggested that a broader institutional push could add steady interest to the market over time. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Was Highlighted As A Signal Reports have disclosed that BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF has become one of the firm’s top fee-earning products, a fact Lee used to show growing involvement from legacy finance. That kind of institutional participation, he argued, points to deeper engagement from big players who were previously on the sidelines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Fails To Shake Ripple CEO — He Still Calls For $180K Adoption Gap Suggests Large Upside According to Lee, only 4.4 million bitcoin wallets hold more than $10,000 in BTC, while nearly 900 million people globally have more than $10,000 in retirement savings. He said that gap shows how early the market still is and argued that if just a fraction of those savers put money into bitcoin, adoption could expand by as much as 200 times. The figure is speculative, he acknowledged, but he used it to show the potential scale for future demand. What This Means For Investors Now Lee questioned whether the old four-year cycle should be used as a strict guide. He suggested recent moves were driven more by de-leveraging and structural shifts than by the halving rhythm that shaped earlier cycles.

In a move sending shockwaves through both traditional finance and digital asset circles, global index provider MSCI is reportedly considering a policy that could see companies with substantial crypto holdings booted from its influential benchmarks. This proposal strikes at the heart of a growing trend: public companies using their balance sheets to bet big on Bitcoin and other digital assets. What is MSCI Proposing for Companies with Major Crypto Holdings? According to a report from The Block, MSCI is weighing a new rule that would exclude companies from its indexes if their digital asset holdings exceed 50% of their total assets. Index providers like MSCI create the benchmarks that guide trillions of dollars in institutional investment through funds like ETFs. Therefore, inclusion or exclusion from these indexes is a major deal for a company’s visibility and investor appeal. This threshold is not arbitrary. It directly targets a specific class of firm that has emerged in recent years: the corporate Bitcoin whale. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business intelligence company that has transformed itself into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle. With over 650,000 BTC on its books, its crypto holdings far surpass the proposed 50% limit, making it a prime candidate for removal if the policy is enacted. Why is This MSCI Crypto Policy So Controversial? The reaction from the crypto-invested community was swift and pointed. Strive, a Nasdaq-listed asset manager that also holds Bitcoin, sent a strongly-worded letter to MSCI CEO Henry Fernandez. Their core argument challenges the very premise of the rule. Undermining Market Neutrality: Strive contends that setting an arbitrary cap on crypto holdings violates the principle of market neutrality that index providers are supposed to uphold. An index should reflect the market, not judge a company’s strategy. Picking Winners and Losers: The firm argues that evaluating a company’s financial strategy should be left to investors and market mechanisms, not an index committee. By setting this limit, MSCI would be making a value judgment on the legitimacy of holding digital assets. A Slippery Slope: Critics ask: if 50% for crypto, what about other asset classes? Should companies be excluded for holding too much gold, real estate, or treasury bonds? The policy sets a concerning precedent for active management of index constituents. What Are the Real-World Implications of Excluding Crypto Holdings? If implemented, the fallout would extend beyond just a few companies getting a demerit. The consequences could reshape investment flows and corporate strategy. First, companies like MicroStrategy could face immediate selling pressure from index funds and ETFs that track MSCI benchmarks. These funds are mandated to mirror the index, forcing them to sell any excluded stock. This creates a potential liquidity event unrelated to the company’s performance or Bitcoin’s price. Second, it sends a chilling signal to other public companies considering adding Bitcoin to their treasury. The threat of index exclusion adds a new layer of reputational and financial risk. Why would a CFO risk their company’s place in a major index for a volatile asset class that the index provider seemingly disapproves of? Finally, it highlights the growing tension between the innovative, disruptive world of cryptocurrency and the established, rules-based world of institutional finance. As crypto holdings move from the fringe to the mainstream, traditional systems are grappling with how to categorize and regulate them. The Bottom Line: A Pivotal Moment for Institutional Crypto MSCI’s consideration is more than a minor rule change; it’s a litmus test for digital assets in traditional finance. Will major institutions adapt their frameworks to accommodate this new asset class, or will they erect barriers to maintain the status quo? The debate over crypto holdings in corporate treasuries is now moving from boardrooms to index committee rooms. The outcome will influence whether cryptocurrency remains a parallel investment universe or becomes fully integrated into the global financial system. For investors, the key takeaway is to watch this space closely. Index provider policies are a powerful, behind-the-scenes force that can significantly impact asset prices and market structure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is MSCI? A: MSCI Inc. is a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community. They create and maintain stock market indexes that are used as benchmarks for trillions of dollars in investment funds. Q: Which company is most at risk from this proposed MSCI rule? A: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is the most prominent example. The company’s Bitcoin holdings represent a vast majority of its total assets, far exceeding the proposed 50% threshold, making it a likely candidate for exclusion. Q: Why does index inclusion matter so much? A: Inclusion in a major index like those from MSCI guarantees automatic buying from passive index funds and ETFs that track it. This provides consistent demand, liquidity, and prestige. Exclusion triggers forced selling from those same funds. Q: Has MSCI made a final decision? A> No. As of this reporting, MSCI is only “considering” the proposal. It has not been implemented as official policy. The strong pushback from firms like Strive may influence the final outcome. Q: Does this affect Bitcoin ETFs like the spot Bitcoin ETF? A> Not directly. This proposal concerns companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet (like MicroStrategy), not funds that hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset (like a Bitcoin ETF). However, it reflects a broader institutional scrutiny of crypto exposure. Found this analysis of MSCI’s potential crypto crackdown insightful?

Under the new ruling, any agreement that designates Google Search , or its AI-powered services, as the default choice on smartphones, tablets, or browsers can no longer be locked in for a period of multiple years. Instead, such deals must be renewed annually, allowing device makers and other platform operators to reconsider and potentially choose rivals. Based in Washington, Judge Mehta had earlier consulted the US Justice Department on this ruling before implementing the decision. After careful consideration, the department agreed to conduct this annual review. Notably, this is a primary change that the search giant is required to embrace among other suggested changes. The judge arrived at this decision after it was confirmed that the tech firm illegally controlled online search. Judge Mehta’s ruling opens the door for AI rivals Following Judge Mehta’s recent decision, the tech industry expressed excitement about a potential positive change in the ecosystem. This is because the yearly renegotiation will grant rivals, particularly those in the expanding generative AI market, the opportunity to compete for crucial positions. Interestingly, the judge’s final decision has not interfered with Google’s operations. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the tech giant is still allowed to offer its products to Apple Inc., which are useful in the firm’s popular iPhone. It is still permitted to pay other electronics firms, such as Samsung Electronics Co., for default placement. However, even with this freedom in place, Mehta still insisted that these contracts needed to be renewed annually. The federal judge issued this reminder after noting that both Google and the US government had demonstrated their ability to comply with the one-year restriction on default contracts. Therefore, this situation prompted him to conclude that “the court holds that a strict termination requirement after one year would best serve the purpose of the injunctive relief.” The ruling triggered heated debates among individuals. Considering the intense nature of the situation, reporters attempted to reach out to Google and the Justice Department for comments on the topic under discussion to ease this controversy. Nonetheless, they declined to respond. On the other hand, several analysts weighed in on the matter. They acknowledged that Google’s case was a lengthy legal battle. To support this claim, reports highlighted that Mehta ruled that the tech giant was guilty of illegally monopolizing online search and search advertising markets in August 2024, following a 10-week trial. Afterwards, he held a second trial in spring 2025, purposefully to examine the Justice Department’s request for the tech company to sell off its popular web browser, Chrome. Google plans to appeal Mehta’s initial ruling Regarding the Justice Department’s request, sources with knowledge of the situation mentioned that Mehta rejected that request for Google to sell off its popular web browser, Chrome. He argued that the best approach to this case was for the search giant to share specific data connected to its search results with rivals. The federal judge arrived at this decision in September 2025. This ruling provided more details on earlier released reports regarding when the tech firm is required to share its data and to whom it must share the information. Meanwhile, according to Mehta’s September ruling, Google was not allowed to pay firms to use its Search, Chrome web browser, or Google Play Store exclusively. However, he did not decide to prohibit all payments. Additionally, it is worth noting that this ruling incorporated parts of suggestions from both Google and the Justice Department, which led the judge to consider issuing a second ruling to clarify certain technical terms from the initial decision. Although Google promised to adhere to the judge’s decision, it made clear its intention to appeal Mehta’s original ruling, which implied that its contracts with firms such as Apple and Samsung, under which its search engine is set as the default, break US antitrust laws. After this announcement was made public, analysts noted that there is a high likelihood that the Justice Department may also think about appealing Mehta’s remedy decision.

Tom Lee Revives Bullish Call For 2026",https://bitcoinist.com/62000-ethereum-tom-lee-revives-bullish-call-2026/,"Tom Lee has reiterated one of the most aggressive Ethereum targets in the market, telling attendees at Binance Blockchain Week on 4 December that ETH could eventually trade at $62,000 as it becomes the core infrastructure for tokenized finance. “Okay, so let me explain to you why Ethereum, now that we’ve talked about crypto, is the future of finance,” Lee said on stage. He framed 2025 as Ethereum’s “ 1971 moment ,” drawing a direct analogy to when the US dollar left the gold standard and triggered a wave of financial innovation. Lee’s Thesis For Ethereum “In 1971, the dollar went off the gold standard. And in 1971, it galvanized Wall Street to create financial products to make sure the dollar would be the reserve currency,” Lee argued. “Well, in 2025, we’re tokenizing everything . So it’s not just the dollar that’s getting tokenized, but it’s stocks, bonds, real estate.” In his view, this shift positions ETH as the primary settlement and execution layer for tokenized assets. “Wall Street is, again, going to take advantage of that and create products onto a smart contract platform. And where they’re building this is on Ethereum,” he said. Lee pointed to current real-world asset experiments as early evidence, noting that “the majority of this, the vast majority, is being built on Ethereum,” and adding that “Ethereum has won the smart contract war.” Lee also stressed that ETH’s market behavior has not yet reflected that structural role. “As you know, ETH has been range bound for five years, as I’ve shaded here. But it’s begun to break out,” he told the audience, explaining why he “got very involved with Ethereum by turning Bitmine into an ETH treasury company , because we saw this breakout coming.” The core of his valuation case is expressed through the ETH/BTC ratio. Lee expects Bitcoin to move sharply higher in the near term: “I think Bitcoin is going to get to $250,000 within a few months.” From there, he derives two key ETH scenarios. First, if the ETH/BTC price relationship simply reverts to its historical mean, he sees substantial upside. “If ETH price ratio to Bitcoin gets back to its eight year average, that’s $12,000 for Ethereum,” he said. Second, in a more aggressive case where ETH appreciates to a quarter of Bitcoin’s price, his long-standing $62,000 target emerges: “If it gets to 0.25 relative to Bitcoin, that’s $62,000.” TOM LEE CALLS FOR $62,000 $ETH “I think Ethereum’s going to become the future of finance, the payment rails of the future and if it gets to .25 relative to Bitcoin that’s $62,000. Ethereum at $3,000 is grossly undervalued.” pic.twitter.com/VydvLou9IE — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) December 4, 2025 Lee links these ratios directly to the tokenization narrative. “If 2026 is about tokenization, that means Ether’s utility value should be rising. Therefore, you should watch this ratio,” he told the crowd, arguing that valuation should track growing demand for ETH blockspace and its role as “the payment rails of the future.” He concluded with a pointed assessment of current levels: “I think Ethereum at $3,000, of course, is grossly undervalued.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,128.",Ethereum|BitMine|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Tom Lee,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 02:00:10

Bitcoin Price Recovery At Risk? Market expert Rekt Fencer recently shared insights on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, suggesting that the Bitcoin price might be forming what he calls a “massive bull trap.” This term refers to a deceptive bullish signal in which the price briefly surpasses a resistance level, in this case, the $90,000 mark, only to reverse into a decline. Such movements can entrap investors who bought in during the peak, leading to significant losses. Related Reading: XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6 Fencer pointed out a troubling pattern reminiscent of early 2022 when Bitcoin reclaimed its 50-week moving average (MA)—currently positioned above $102,300—before experiencing a severe decline of roughly 60%, plummeting below $20,000 by June of that year. He indicated that the recent price recovery following major drops to $84,000 should not be interpreted as a signal of near-term success, especially since the Bitcoin price is currently trading under the 50-week MA. If historical trends repeat, this could mean that Bitcoin might see a significant drop, potentially reaching around $36,200, which could potentially represent the low point of the bearish cycle for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, there are analysts who retain a bullish outlook. BTC Bottom In Sight? Market researcher and analyst Miles Deutscher expressed a confident sentiment, stating he believes there is a 91.5% likelihood that the Bitcoin price has hit its bottom, based on his analysis of key developments. He noted that recent weeks have been dominated by negative news stories, including concerns surrounding Tether (USDT) and the implications of China’s actions on crypto, which he asserts often mark local price bottoms. Moreover, Deutscher pointed out a shift in market flows from predominantly bearish to bullish. He explained that the trading environment has recently seen a resurgence in buying momentum, with large investors, or “OG whales,” ceasing their selling. This change has been reflected in the order books, indicating a possible stabilization in market sentiment.

The potential appointment of a new Federal Reserve chair known for dovish policies, coupled with the official end of quantitative tightening (QT), could further influence market dynamics in favor of buyers. Deutscher concluded by emphasizing that given the extreme levels of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market, combined with improvements in trading flows, he believes that the odds favor the notion that the Bitcoin price has indeed reached its bottom.

That’s the stark future billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary paints for the crypto market. In a recent statement, the ‘Shark Tank’ star delivered a sobering verdict: the vast majority of altcoins will fail. He argues that only Bitcoin and Ethereum possess the foundational strength to endure the coming market consolidation. This prediction forces every investor to ask a critical question about their portfolio’s future. Why Does Kevin O’Leary Believe Most Altcoins Will Fail? Kevin O’Leary’s perspective isn’t based on short-term price swings. Instead, he looks at long-term viability through the lens of institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. He views the current crypto landscape as overcrowded. Many projects, he suggests, lack a clear, sustainable use case beyond speculation. Therefore, as regulations tighten and the market matures, a brutal natural selection will occur. Projects without real utility, strong development teams, and clear governance are the most likely to disappear. This process means a significant number of altcoins will fail, consolidating value into the proven leaders. The Survivors: What Makes Bitcoin and Ethereum Different? If the prediction that most altcoins will fail comes true, what saves the top two? The answer lies in their established roles and network effects. Bitcoin (BTC): It operates as digital gold—a decentralized store of value. Its first-mover advantage, unmatched security, and brand recognition make it the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum (ETH): It functions as a global settlement layer and the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). Its massive developer community and continuous upgrades solidify its position. Both have something most altcoins lack: widespread institutional acceptance and a clear narrative that regulators are beginning to understand. This distinction is crucial for their survival. What Are the Implications for Crypto Investors? O’Leary’s warning that most altcoins will fail is a call for strategic thinking. For investors, this means shifting focus from pure speculation to fundamental analysis. It’s no longer just about finding the next ‘moonshot.’ The potential for massive losses in the altcoin space is real. However, this doesn’t mean all altcoins are doomed. A small subset with robust technology and solving real-world problems may thrive. The key takeaway is to prioritize quality over quantity and understand that high risk accompanies high reward in this segment. How Should You Navigate This Predicted Shakeout? Facing a future where most altcoins will fail requires a disciplined approach. First, conduct thorough research on any project beyond the top two. Look for active development, a tangible product, and a strong community. Second, consider portfolio allocation. Many experts advise having a core position in Bitcoin and Ethereum before exploring higher-risk altcoins. Finally, stay informed on regulatory developments, as these will be the primary catalyst for the predicted consolidation. Being proactive is your best defense against the coming volatility. Conclusion: A Future of Quality Over Quantity Kevin O’Leary’s prediction that most altcoins will fail paints a challenging but clarifying picture of the crypto future. It signals a move from a wild, experimental phase to a more mature market focused on utility and stability. While this may seem daunting, it ultimately benefits the long-term health of the industry by weeding out weak projects. For savvy investors, this era presents an opportunity to build a resilient portfolio anchored by Bitcoin and Ethereum, with careful, selective bets on the most promising altcoin innovations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Kevin O’Leary think all altcoins will go to zero? A> Not necessarily all, but he believes the vast majority (most altcoins) will fail and disappear, leaving only a handful of survivors. Q: What are the main reasons altcoins might fail? A> Primary reasons include lack of real-world use case, poor tokenomics, weak development teams, inability to scale, and increased regulatory pressure. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins based on this prediction? A> Not as a blanket rule. Use this prediction as a prompt to rigorously re-evaluate each altcoin you hold based on its fundamentals and long-term prospects. Q: Are there any altcoins that could survive besides Bitcoin and Ethereum? A> Yes, O’Leary’s view focuses on the majority. Some altcoins with strong fundamentals, like Solana or Cardano, could potentially survive, but the field will be much narrower. Q: How long does O’Leary think this shakeout will take?

However, a leading industry analyst is pushing back, suggesting the panic is largely unfounded. According to James Butterfill, Head of Research at digital asset manager CoinShares, the data tells a story of strength, not weakness. Let’s dive into why the latest Tether liquidity concerns might be more noise than signal. Are Tether Liquidity Concerns Justified? Recent commentary from figures like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes sparked anxiety. Hayes suggested a significant drop in Tether’s asset values could erase its equity. This analysis naturally raised Tether liquidity concerns among investors. However, Butterfill provides a crucial counterpoint grounded in current financials. He argues the company’s robust reserve position and massive profitability create a substantial buffer against market volatility. The Numbers Behind the Stability Butterfill’s report, cited by Cointelegraph, presents compelling figures. These numbers are key to understanding the real picture behind the Tether liquidity concerns . Reserve Surplus: Tether holds $181.4 billion in reserves against $174.4 billion in liabilities. Capital Buffer: This creates a comfortable surplus of $6.8 billion. Record Profitability: Critically, Tether generated over $10 billion in net profit in just the first nine months of this year. This profitability is a powerful tool. It allows Tether to continuously reinforce its equity cushion, directly addressing the core of the liquidity concerns. What Do the Experts Really Say? Butterfill acknowledges that risks exist in the stablecoin sector. No financial instrument is entirely without risk. However, he makes a vital distinction. The current data, in his view, does not indicate a systemic risk to the broader crypto market. Therefore, while prudent caution is wise, outright fear may be premature. The debate highlights the importance of distinguishing between theoretical vulnerabilities and actual, present-tense financial health. Should Investors Be Worried About Tether? For everyday users and investors, the takeaway is nuanced. The persistent Tether liquidity concerns serve as a healthy reminder to understand the assets you use. However, the evidence suggests Tether’s position is currently secure. The company’s ability to generate enormous profits provides a dynamic defense mechanism not always present in traditional finance. This financial engine helps mitigate the very risks critics highlight. In conclusion, the narrative of impending doom for Tether appears exaggerated. The firm’s substantial reserve surplus and staggering profitability paint a picture of an entity with significant financial resilience. While monitoring stablecoin issuers remains essential, the current wave of Tether liquidity concerns seems disproportionate to the published facts. The market may benefit more from focusing on this concrete data than on speculative worst-case scenarios. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are the main Tether liquidity concerns? The primary concern is whether Tether holds enough high-quality, liquid assets to back every USDT token in circulation, especially if many users redeem at once or if its reserve assets lose value. What did CoinShares’ research head say about Tether? James Butterfill stated that concerns are “somewhat exaggerated,” pointing to Tether’s $6.8 billion surplus capital and over $10 billion in profit this year as signs of strength. How much profit did Tether make recently? Tether generated more than $10 billion in net profit during the first three quarters of this year alone, a key factor in bolstering its financial position. Could a market crash wipe out Tether’s equity? Analyst Arthur Hayes suggested a 30% decline in Tether’s gold and Bitcoin holdings could erase its equity. However, Butterfill’s analysis implies current profits and reserves provide a significant buffer against such shocks. Is my USDT safe? Based on the latest published figures from a leading analyst, Tether appears to have a strong financial cushion. However, as with any cryptocurrency, understanding the risks and not holding more than you can afford to lose is always prudent. Why is Tether’s profitability important? High profitability allows Tether to continuously add to its equity (owner’s capital), which acts as a shock absorber against losses in its reserve assets, directly addressing liquidity concerns.

Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency’s structure remains intact, but warned that it must bounce quickly or risk retesting the November lows. Related Reading: XRP ETFs Record 13-Day Streak As SOL Funds See Largest Outflows Since Launch Bitcoin Retests $88,000 After Rejection On Friday, Bitcoin lost the recently reclaimed $90,000 level, falling to a key support area before stabilizing. The flagship crypto has been attempting to recover from the November market correction, which sent its price to a seven-month low of $80,600. Since reaching its local lows two weeks ago, the cryptocurrency has traded within a macro re-accumulation range, between $82,000 and $93,500, attempting to break out of this zone on Wednesday, when it reached a multi-week high of $94,150. However, as the first week of December approaches its end, BTC has lost the upper area of its local range again, falling below its monthly open and tapping the $88,000 support. Amid the drop, Analyst Ted Pillows noted that BTC has been struggling to reclaim the $94,000 resistance, adding that price “wants to go lower here before another breakout attempt.” Therefore, he suggested that a bounce back from the $88,000-$89,000 support zone is likely. Altcoin Sherpa affirmed that the ongoing retest would confirm whether the recent bounce was “just lower highs and price is going lower or if we actually have any juice to bounce to like 100k or something.” The analyst outlined two potential outcomes. In the first scenario, the flagship crypto would retrace to the $87,000-$89,000 area and bounce above the $93,000-$94,000 resistance levels. In the second scenario, Bitcoin would continue to move sideways below the local resistance before eventually sliding to the November lows and potentially lower levels. Per the analysis, the leading cryptocurrency must bottom quickly, or it will risk the second outcome. BTC Shows Shallowing Pullback Tendency Analyst Rekt Capital also pointed out that Bitcoin continues to face rejection from the range high resistance. However, he considers that investors should not worry as long as the pullback isn’t as big as the previous ones. If “the rejection is shallower than the previous two, then this resistance will continue to weaken until eventually breached,” he explained, adding that “as long as this weakening continues, BTC should be able to finally breach this resistance over time & try to challenge the multi-week Downtrend above.” Earlier this week, the analyst affirmed that BTC’s consolidation structure will remain intact as long as Bitcoin closes the week above the range lows. He also noted that its Macro Downtrend, which “has been dictating resistance throughout this phase of the cycle,” remains the dominant structural barrier and the level to break. Related Reading: Solana Eyes Major Resistance After $140 Reclaim, But Analyst Questions SOL’s Strength As the price stabilized between the $88,500-$89,350 area, the analyst added that today’s retracement “continues to be a shallower pullback than the previous two,” which keeps the range “‘retrace shallowing’ tendency” intact. He noted that Bitcoin could technically drop into the ascending two-week support trendline, or tap the $86,000 level and still perform a shallower correction than the recent 10% drop. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,400, a 2.9% decline in the daily timeframe.

55410458,641049,1764990041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55410458.jpeg,Key Updates On The US Crypto Market Structure Bill: What You Need To Know,https://bitcoinist.com/key-updates-on-the-us-crypto-market-structure-bill/,"The anticipated crypto market structure bill, or namely the CLARITY Act, designed to provide essential regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States, is approaching critical dates in the Senate. However, it faces significant complexities related to stablecoin yield, conflicts of interest, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Senate Divided On Crypto Market Structure Bill Legal expert and Chief Legal Officer of Variant Jake Chervinsky, reports that the Senate is divided into two committees: Banking, which is handling the securities law aspect, and Agriculture, responsible for the commodities law portion. Both committees have published drafts of their work this fall, with the next step being markup, a process where hearings will be held to vote on amendments before sending the bill to the Senate floor for a full vote. However, both committees are cautious and are unlikely to proceed with markup until they resolve ongoing disputes. Among these, three significant issues stand out. The first major concern involves stablecoin yield . In the GENIUS Act, banks lobbied for a prohibition on interest payments, meaning stablecoin issuers cannot offer holders any form of interest or yield. While the current prohibition prevents direct yield payments to holders, it does not address non-yield rewards or yield provided by third parties. Banks consider this gap a “loophole” and are advocating for broader restrictions to be included in the market structure bill. Conflicts Of Interest And DeFi Regulations Stall Progress The second issue revolves around conflicts of interest. Some Democratic senators have indicated they would not support the market structure legislation unless it includes provisions that restrict the President’s family from conducting business in the crypto space. The third and perhaps most crucial issue pertains to DeFi. It is important to note that market structure legislation primarily addresses centralized platforms that exercise custody over user funds and transactions. Chervinsky believes the bill should primarily focus on protecting DeFi, but t raditional finance (TradFi) stakeholders have been pushing Congress to categorize virtually all entities in the crypto sector—developers, validators, and others—as intermediaries. The expert emphasized that the success of any market structure bill hinges on ensuring robust protections for developers since the viability of the crypto industry relies on their contributions. Given the intricate nature of these issues and the swiftly approaching holiday break, Chervinsky noted that it is possible that discussions about market structure could extend into January. Senate Markup Set For December 17-18 Market analyst MartyParty provided another update on December 4, indicating that the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Structure Bill is gaining significant momentum in Congress, with a markup session in the Senate Banking Committee tentatively scheduled for December 17-18, just before the holiday recess If successfully passed, he states that the bill could establish clearer pathways for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and mitigate “debanking” risks, paving the way for compliant exchanges and potentially stimulating market volumes following the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approvals for spot crypto trading. This “regulatory convergence” is seen as a catalyst that could drive liquidity and energize the next bull market, reinforcing President Trump’s vision for the US to emerge as the “crypto capital of the world.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|CLARITY Act|crypto|crypto market structure|crypto market structure bill|crypto news|crypto regulation|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|Digital Asset Market Clarity Act|Senate Market structure bill,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 03:00:41

Over the past day, a wave of crypto futures liquidations swept through major exchanges, with one clear, dominant victim: traders betting on higher prices. This event provides a crucial snapshot of current market sentiment and the inherent risks of leveraged trading. What Do Recent Crypto Futures Liquidations Reveal? Data from the last 24 hours paints a stark picture. The perpetual futures market, where most retail leverage is employed, saw massive forced position closures. The overwhelming majority of these crypto futures liquidations were long positions, meaning traders who borrowed funds to amplify bullish bets were caught off-guard by a price dip. This pattern signals a sudden shift in short-term momentum and potential over-leverage on the buy side. A Breakdown of the Damage: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Let’s examine the numbers, which highlight the scale of this event. The liquidations were not isolated to one asset but formed a clear trend across major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC): Total liquidations hit $147 million. A staggering 88.9% of this volume, approximately $130.7 million, came from long positions being forcibly closed. Ethereum (ETH): Saw $98.68 million in liquidations. Here, 82.81% (about $81.7 million) were longs. Solana (SOL): Recorded $21.78 million in liquidations, with longs constituting 88.59% of the total. This data confirms a market-wide phenomenon where bullish traders faced significant losses. Why Are Long Positions So Vulnerable to Liquidations? Understanding why longs dominated this round of crypto futures liquidations requires a look at market psychology and mechanics. First, after periods of price appreciation, bullish sentiment often peaks, encouraging traders to use high leverage to maximize gains. When the market reverses unexpectedly, even a small downward move can trigger margin calls on these highly leveraged long positions. Essentially, the crowd was leaning too far in one direction. Key Takeaways for Crypto Traders This event is more than just a statistic; it’s a learning opportunity. For anyone involved in futures trading, these crypto futures liquidations underscore critical lessons. Risk Management is Paramount: Always use stop-loss orders and avoid excessive leverage, especially during periods of high volatility. Sentiment is a Contrarian Indicator: Extreme bullishness can often precede a shakeout. Watching liquidation heatmaps can provide early warning signs. Volatility is the Constant: The crypto market can change direction rapidly. Never trade with capital you cannot afford to lose. Conclusion: Navigating the Futures Landscape The recent dominance of long positions in crypto futures liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s dual nature: offering high reward potential alongside substantial risk. While liquidations can induce short-term panic, they also help reset over-leveraged markets, potentially creating healthier foundations for future moves. The key for traders is to learn from these events, prioritize capital preservation, and maintain a disciplined strategy regardless of market euphoria or fear. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto futures liquidations? A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because they no longer have enough collateral (margin) to maintain it, usually due to an adverse price move. Why were mostly long positions liquidated? It indicates that a sudden price drop triggered margin calls for a large number of traders who were using leverage to bet on prices going up. The market was overcrowded with bullish bets. Are large liquidations bad for the market? They cause short-term pain for leveraged traders and can increase volatility. However, they can also flush out excessive leverage, which may reduce systemic risk and lead to a more stable price discovery. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set prudent stop-loss orders, constantly monitor your margin ratio, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Do liquidations signal a market bottom or top? Not definitively. While massive long liquidations can sometimes mark a short-term bottom (a “capitulation” event), they are best used as one data point among many, not a standalone signal. Where can I track liquidation data? Several analytics websites like Coinglass and Bybt provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and charts for major cryptocurrencies.

The bank, Monet Bank, formerly one of the federally chartered banks owned by billionaire backer Andy Beal, has repositioned itself to serve cryptocurrency firms and digital-asset businesses, according to a recent regulatory approval from the Texas Department of Banking. This move is part of the community bank’s goal to transform into a modern bank, focusing on digital finance and cutting-edge digital solutions rather than conventional consumer banking. The announcement was made public after the Texas-based bank shared its website, highlighting that “Monet aims to be the top financial institution for digital assets, offering creative and modern solutions for the digital economy.” Financial institutions shift their focus towards the crypto ecosystem Following U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Beal decided to explore the crypto ecosystem. This decision reflects a growing trend among financial institutions that are adopting and accepting cryptocurrencies in their operations. The Texas lender began operating in 1988. At this time, it was operating as Beal Savings Bank. Earlier this year, it adopted a new name and started referring to itself as XD Bank. Two months later, it changed its name again to Monet Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation monitors this state-chartered bank, with reports from federal records also indicating that the bank operates six branches. Notably, Monet Bank is viewed as a very small community bank because it has less than $6 billion in assets and a little more than $1 billion in capital, according to state records . However, even with this challenge in place, the financial institution still pushed forward its goal of exploring the crypto industry. The news on the Texas bank’s shift towards digital assets was made public on Friday, December 5, by the Information. Sources close to the matter noted that this decision places the bank among a growing number of banks that are seeking to serve the crypto market. Meanwhile, as financial institutions express growing interest in the crypto space, reports dated October this year mentioned that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) granted Erebor Bank, a new tech-based company supported by Peter Thiel from Founders Fund, a conditional charter. Moreover, former firm leaders from Signature Bank introduced a narrow bank with a Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution charter known as N3XT earlier this week. They claimed that this new financial institution would streamline the payment process using a private blockchain. This change marks a broader shift in how federal bank regulators approach cryptocurrency. Trump’s pro-crypto stance encourages exposure to the crypto world Since Trump assumed the presidency of the United States, several bans related to the cryptocurrency sector have been lifted to support this rapidly growing industry. Some of these bans have been lifted, including previous warnings issued to banks regarding the exercise of caution with crypto. The president’s administration has also established new guidelines to assist the crypto Industry gain improved access to banking services. To further support the crypto ecosystem, Travis Hill, the acting chair of the FDIC, submitted a proposal notifying the relevant authorities that his agency intends to propose new regulations governing the crypto industry, specifically those related to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act . The proposal was submitted during a hearing earlier this week. In the meantime, when reporters reached out to Beal’s company to comment on their progress in exploring the crypto industry, a request was sent to a media contact at Beal Bank, but the firm declined to respond.

ETH's technicals are mixed: it held $2600 support shows an RSI breakout but faces resistance at $4100 after a bearish death cross. The ETF's low 0.15% expense ratio and strong liquidity make it attractive for taxable accounts, though high volatility warrants small position sizing. I plan to re-enter ETH next week after a tax-loss sale, as early bullish indicators suggest the crypto market's correction may be ending. Ether has disappointed investors in 2025, particularly those who climbed aboard over the summer, when the cryptocurrency soared to near $5000. That’s also when Tom Lee of Fundstrat argued for much higher ether prices, which investors could gain exposure to through this Digital Asset Treasury Fund Bitmine Immersion (BMNR). I had a buy rating on the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) back in August . That turned out to be a lousy call, with ether falling below what I deemed “critical support” at the $4100 level. From there, the token plunged to near $2600... a support spot I detailed just a few weeks ago . So, I’m keeping with a buy rating on ETH. In fact, after taking a tax loss in November on my ether position, I plan to buy back in next week. My trade was selling an ETH ETF and buying the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). Catching my eye right now is a relative chart of ether to bitcoin. Ether shows relative strength for the first time since August, and I see that as a telltale sign that the entire cryptocurrency market’s bearish run lately may, in fact, be over. ETH -6% YTD Stockcharts.com According to the issuer , ETH is solely and passively invested in ether. Its investment objective is to reflect the value of ether held by the Fund, less expenses and other liabilities. Ether is a digital asset that is created and transmitted through the operations of the peer-to-peer Ethereum Network, a decentralized network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols. The Ethereum Network allows people to exchange tokens of value, called ether, which are recorded on a public transaction ledger known as a blockchain. ETH is a small ETF with $2.3 billion in assets under management as of December 4, 2025. That’s down from $2.9 billion at the time of my previous analysis. The annual expense ratio is low at just 15 basis points, while there is no yield . Low cost and no distributions make ETH ideal for taxable brokerage accounts (not IRAs or HSAs). Share-price momentum has turned dreadful, now featuring a weak D- ETF Grade by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. For perspective, it was an A+ just three months ago. But risk happens fast in the crypto space, and with a high historical standard deviation, ETH scores very poorly on risk metrics . Hence, my ether ETF stake will be only about a 0.5% portfolio weight (IBIT is 1.5% of my overall net worth). Finally, on liquidity , ETHA is highly tradable. Its average daily volume is north of 6 million shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is tight at just two basis points, per Grayscale. So, key to my bullish thesis is relative price action between ether and bitcoin. I see a breakout underway, in which the often more speculative ether is jumping to multi-week highs versus bitcoin. The months-long correction with both coins may be over. And I’m putting my money where my writing is—I'll buy ETH early next week once my 30-day wash-sale period is over. ETHUSD vs BTCUSD: Breakout Stockcharts.com I encourage readers to check out my BMNR article from last month . I make the case that while Tom Lee’s product has its appeals, I’d rather own ether outright through a low-cost ETF. Tom Lee's Bold Ether Call BMNR Seasonally, there are tailwinds. Historically, gains have been strong from December through May, while volatility has been the theme from June through November. I like to say that seasonality is secondary to price, but this is a bullish factor to consider. ETHUSD: Bullish December-May Trends Barchart Finally, ether’s technical situation is mixed. Notice in the chart below that the token held key support at the $2600 mark, while a bearish death cross indeed occurred (it’s something I called out would be likely to happen in my BMNR article). But take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart—it is just now breaking out of a downtrend. They say that momentum tends to turn before price, so this could be a bullish harbinger for ETH price action to come. Still, there remains a significant amount of volume by price up to the $4100 mark, and that level is major long-term resistance following the bearish false breakout in August. For now, technicals are not outright strong, but there are bullish early indicators. ETHUSD: RSI Breakout, Death Cross a Risk, $2600 Support Held Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on ETH. I plan to buy the ETF next week, as its relative strength to IBIT is at fresh multi-week highs, while ether itself has held long-term support. Bullish calendar trends are also underway.",ETH-USD|ETHA|ETH,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-06 03:56:00

Why The Four-Year Cycle May Be Ending In a recent post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, the Bull Theory analysts noted that the concept of Bitcoin adhering to a neat four-year cycle is weakening. They highlighted that significant price movements over the last decade weren’t solely driven by Halving events; rather, they were influenced by shifts in global liquidity. The analysts pointed to the current landscape of stablecoin liquidity, which remains high despite recent downturns, indicating that larger investors are still engaged in the market, poised to invest when appropriate macroeconomic conditions arise. Related Reading: XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6 In the US, Treasury policies are emerging as pivotal catalysts. The recent buybacks are notable, but the analysts emphasize that the larger narrative lies in the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance, which is currently around $940 billion—almost $90 billion above its normal range. This surplus cash is likely to flow back into the financial system, enhancing financing conditions and adding liquidity that typically gravitates toward risk assets. Globally, the trends appear even more promising. China has been injecting liquidity for several months, while Japan recently announced a stimulus package worth approximately $135 billion, alongside efforts to simplify cryptocurrency regulations. Canada is also moving toward easing its monetary policy, and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has officially halted its quantitative tightening (QT) measures—a historical precursor to some form of liquidity expansion. Political And Monetary Factors Align To Create Bullish Condition The analysts explained that when major economies adopt expansive monetary policies simultaneously, risk assets like Bitcoin tend to respond more rapidly than traditional stocks or broader markets. Additionally, potential policy tools, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption—implemented in 2020 to allow banks more flexibility in expanding their balance sheets—could return, resulting in increased credit creation and overall market liquidity. There is also a political dimension to consider. President Trump has discussed potential tax reforms, including abolishing income tax and distributing $2,000 tariff dividends. Furthermore, the likelihood of a new Federal Reserve chair who supports liquidity assistance and is constructive toward cryptocurrency could bolster conditions for economic growth. Extended Bitcoin Uptrend Historically, whenever the Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (ISM PMI) surpasses 55, it has been followed by periods of altcoin season. The probability of this occurring in 2026 appears high, according to the Bull Theory. Related Reading: Trend Reversal Puts Dogecoin On A Path To $0.188 The convergence of rising stablecoin liquidity, the Treasury’s injection of cash back into markets, global quantitative easing, the cessation of QT in the US, potential bank-lending relief, pro-market policy shifts in 2026, and major players entering the crypto sector suggests a very different scenario than the old four-year halving model. The analysts concluded that if liquidity expands concurrently across the US, Japan, China, Canada, and other significant economies, Bitcoin is unlikely to move counter to that trend. Therefore, rather than experiencing a sharp rally followed by a prolonged bear market, the current environment indicates a more extended and broader uptrend that could span through 2026 and into 2027.

In October 2025, officials bought 53 tons of gold , a level that analysts say is the highest monthly demand seen this year. These moves reflect growing concern about inflation, weaker currencies and rising geopolitical risk. Central Bank Buying Surges According to data cited by financial outlets, 2025 is on track to be the fourth-highest year this century for institutional gold accumulation when measured net year-to-date through October. Analysts at Deutsche Bank put gold’s share of central-bank reserves at about 24%, a level not seen since the 1990s. Those figures help explain why governments that once moved away from bullion are returning to it now. Bitcoin Enters The Conversation Some banks and market researchers are now asking whether Bitcoin could play a similar role for national treasuries. Based on reports from major financial firms, Deutsche Bank projects that Bitcoin could appear on central-bank balance sheets by 2030 as a complementary reserve asset. Central banks are ramping up gold purchases: Global central banks purchased +53 tonnes of gold in October, the most since November 2024. This marks a +194% jump compared to July, and the 3rd-straight monthly acceleration. In the first 10 months of the year, central banks have… pic.twitter.com/7pZWyEjjvf — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 4, 2025 Bitcoin’s market profile has changed: liquidity has risen, and price swings have been less extreme during recent months even though volatility remains higher than older reserve assets. Bitcoin also reached a record above $123,500 in recent trading, a price point that has captured wide attention. A Few Banks Are Testing The Idea A small number of central banks are now at least studying the idea more seriously. The Czech National Bank, for example, has discussed the possibility of a “test allocation” to learn how crypto might behave inside a reserve mix. Those conversations tend to focus on custody, accounting rules and how to report gains or losses, rather than immediate buying. On Gold & Bitcoin: Why Officials Are Cautious Risk is the main reason most central banks have not moved faster. Bitcoin still shows larger price swings than standard reserve assets, and global rules for how to hold and audit crypto are not uniform. Based on expert commentary, regulators and auditors would need clear guidance before many central banks felt comfortable adding crypto to official reserves. What This Could Mean For Markets If even a handful of national banks were to allocate a small share of reserves to Bitcoin, demand could rise sharply and change how markets view the asset. A modest sovereign allocation would not replace gold or the US dollar, but it could give Bitcoin a stronger role as a hedge for countries facing currency weakness or rising inflation. At the same time, such a move would push more work into custody and compliance services, which would have to scale up quickly. Gold buying by central banks is already significant — 53 tons in one month and about 24% of reserves in gold for some — and that Bitcoin is being discussed as a possible next step for some policymakers. The path from discussion to adoption is uncertain, and many technical and legal questions remain. Still, the debate has moved from theory to test runs and official reports, making this one of the more closely watched trends in global finance this year.

During an interview on Friday, Le said: We’re very much are a part of the crypto ecosystem and Bitcoin ecosystem. Which is why we decided a couple of weeks ago to start raising capital and putting US dollars on our balance sheet to get rid of this FUD. Phong Lee At the beginning of the week, Strategy announced the $1.44 billion US dollar reserve, funded through a stock sale. Le explains that the reserve had been raised in just over a week and will fund dividends on preferred stock and interest payments on outstanding debt over a period of at least 12 months, with plans to extend coverage to 24 months gradually. Le noted that this dual-reserve strategy provides them the flexibility to navigate volatile market conditions without having to liquidate Bitcoin. Phong Le says new reserve neutralizes dividend FUD and strengthens market confidence The creation of the USD reserve comes amid concerns that Strategy may be unable to continue servicing its debts and dividend payment obligations if the stock price falls too far. “And it’s really this FUD,” Le said on Friday. The move represents a strategic shift from the company’s previous approach, which primarily relied on issuing debt or shares to acquire more Bitcoin. Le emphasized that they wouldn’t have an issue paying their dividends, and they weren’t likely to have to sell their Bitcoin . Still, he noted that FUD was spread that the company would fail to meet its dividend obligations, which cause d people to pile into a short Bitcoin bet . He said that the short time frame used for the $1.44 billion – 21 months’ worth of dividend obligations was intended to show people that they are still able to raise money in a Bitcoin downcycle. Last week, Le said that Strategy would only consider selling Bitcoin if its stock fell below net asset value and the company no longer had access to fresh capital. The company also launched a “BTC Credit” dashboard, which claims it currently has enough assets to service dividends for more than 70 years. As of now, Strategy holds over 650,000 BTC , purchased at an average price of $87,000 per coin. The creation of the USD reserve ensures that the company can avoid selling Bitcoin during short-term downturns, allowing it to stay aligned with its long-term crypto-focused strategy. Corporate BTC treasuries take a bigger role as miner pressures and volatility rise The timing of the reserve also matches with mounting pressure on Bitcoin miners, whose production costs have risen following recent halvings. As miners come under increasing pressure with tighter margins and higher break-even prices, analysts say corporate holders such as Strategy are increasingly contributing to the stability of the markets. Strategy’s moves, along with its enormous BTC treasury, pretty much make it one of the market’s biggest long-term claimants. As miners cut supply and short-term volatility gathers momentum, institutional balance sheets—rather than mining output—are also increasingly determining investor confidence. A group of market watchers also argues that Strategy’s reserve represents a maturing phase for Bitcoin as a corporate asset, signalling the movement away from speculative accumulation towards structured financial management. The miners’ and overall production costs of Bitcoin are often discussed on a much smaller scale than those of other cryptocurrencies; however, Strategy’s balance sheet strength and proactive risk management now play a significant role in market confidence, according to industry analysts. The reserve suggests that even during adverse cycles of the crypto market, corporate holders can minimize liquidity risk.

Do Kwon Seeks Reduced Sentence Of Five Years Bloomberg reported that in a court filing late Thursday, US prosecutors described the Terraform Labs co-founder’s fraudulent actions as “colossal in scope.” They emphasized that his “misleading statements to customers” triggered a domino effect of crises across the crypto landscape, culminating in the downfall of notable entities such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX . This comes amid a regulatory environment that has grown increasingly lenient under the Trump administration. In late October, President Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), who had been convicted for failing to uphold proper anti-money laundering measures. In a recent court filing, Terraform Labs co-founder expressed a desire for a reduced sentence of five years. His legal team asserted that he has already “suffered substantially” for his actions, noting that he has spent nearly three years in detention conditions described as “brutal” in Montenegro. Kwon’s lawyers argued that a five-year prison term would be sufficient and that the prosecutors’ recommendation of 12 years is “far greater than necessary” for justice to be served. Potential For Sentence Transfer For Terraform Labs Co-Founder Initially, Kwon pleaded not guilty in January to a nine-count indictment that charged him with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. However, he changed his plea in August to guilty for conspiracy to defraud and wire fraud. During this change, Terraform Labs’ leader acknowledged that his actions included making “false and misleading statements” regarding the restoration of TerraUSD’s peg in 2021, admitting, “What I did was wrong.” As part of his plea agreement, Kwon has consented to forfeit $19.3 million and some properties. Prosecutors have chosen not to demand restitution for the millions of investors who collectively lost $40 billion, citing that calculating individual losses would be too complicated. Kwon faces charges in both the US and his native South Korea, where prosecutors are also pursuing a lengthy prison sentence potentially reaching up to 40 years. He was arrested in Montenegro in 2023 while using a fake passport, and following a protracted legal battle, he was extradited to the United States in January after spending nearly two years in a Balkan jail. US prosecutors have indicated they would support Kwon’s opportunity to serve the second half of his sentence in South Korea, provided he adheres to the terms of his plea deal and qualifies for a transfer program. Kwon is scheduled for sentencing by US District Judge Paul Engelmayer on December 11. When writing, Terraform Labs’ native token Luna Classic (LUNC) saw a 75% increase in response to Do Kwon’s probable sentence, trading at $0.000050 and placing it at the helm of the market’s top performers on Friday.

Tether, which issues the market-leading USDT stablecoin, has faced repeated scrutiny over the composition and transparency of its reserve holdings. Hayes reignited the debate by arguing that the company is increasingly exposed to volatile positions that could undermine its ability to maintain a 1:1 dollar peg. Hayes Says Decline in Bitcoin and Gold Could “Wipe Out” Equity Buffer In recent commentary, Hayes said Tether is “in the early innings of running a massive interest-rate trade.” He warned that a 30% decline in the value of the company’s Bitcoin and gold holdings could eliminate its equity cushion. Tether has significantly expanded its exposure to gold over the past several years, alongside an increase in Bitcoin holdings. Hayes argued that while Tether currently earns substantial income from interest-bearing assets, this strategy increases vulnerability if markets turn sharply lower. He concluded that in a severe downturn, USDT could become “technically insolvent.” CoinShares Research Head Pushes Back James Butterfill, head of research at digital-asset firm CoinShares, disputed Hayes’s analysis in a market update issued on Dec. 5. He said concerns about Tether’s solvency “look misplaced,” pointing to the company’s latest attestation covering the third quarter of 2025. According to that report, Tether held $181 billion in total reserves against approximately $174.45 billion in liabilities. This left a surplus of nearly $6.8 billion. Butterfill argued that the data show no immediate systemic risk, although he emphasised that stablecoin issuers should always be monitored cautiously due to their role in broader market liquidity. Ongoing Debate Over Reserve Quality Tether remains one of the cryptocurrency sector’s most profitable companies. It generated an estimated $10 billion in profit during the first three quarters of 2025 — an unusually high figure considering its relatively small workforce. However, the firm continues to face criticism regarding the composition of its reserves. S&P Global recently downgraded USDT’s ability to defend its dollar peg , citing exposure to “higher-risk” assets such as gold, loans and Bitcoin. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissed the downgrade as “Tether FUD,” arguing that the company’s financial statements show its position remains strong. He pointed to the firm’s attestation as evidence of adequate liquidity and responsible asset management. Market Position Remains Dominant Despite recurring concerns, USDT continues to be the largest stablecoin in the world. The token has approximately $185.5 billion in circulation. It also controls nearly 59% of the global stablecoin market. Tether maintains a substantial allocation to U.S. Treasuries — estimated at more than $130 billion — which remains its most stable reserve component. However, the increasing share of Bitcoin and gold exposes the company to greater price swings, keeping the debate alive among analysts and regulators. The long-running dispute over Tether’s reserve practices is unlikely to subside soon, particularly as stablecoins continue to serve as a key pillar of global cryptocurrency trading.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-12-06 05:09:30

ChatGPT With Pi Network Price Predictions,https://cryptopotato.com/will-pi-rebound-in-the-week-ahead-chatgpt-with-pi-network-price-predictions/,"Pi Network’s native token has proven in recent months to defy the overall market trend. For example, it actually posted some gains during November when BTC, ETH, XRP, and other larger-cap altcoins dropped by double digits. In contrast, the overall market started to recover at the start of December, with bitcoin climbing past $94,000 and ETH surging beyond $3,200 at one point. PI, though, lagged and couldn’t produce similar increases. Just the opposite, it’s actually down by 12% in the past week and now sits inches above $0.22. Consequently, we asked ChatGPT about its take on the matter and whether the following week will be more positive for PI. Pi Network’s PI Price on CoinGecko Technical Side OpenAI’s solution offered some grim perspective for the PI bulls. It noted that the overall trading volumes have declined lately, which, coupled with the asset drop from $0.28 to $0.225 as of now, shows that the trend structure has turned bearish for the short-term, but it “has not broken the macro support.” Despite the ongoing decline, Pi Network’s token remains well above the October all-time low of $0.172. It needs to rebound from the first crucial support at $0.21-$0.22, which would mean that “the broader recovery structure remains intact.” If it breaks below it, though, then it can test the October lows once again. Should it bounce, PI’s first main obstacle is situated at $0.24-$0.25, which seems like a tall task given the overall trend in the past week. In fact, ChatGPT warned that PI is likely to stay below that level as long as there’s no major update coming to shake things up a bit. Most Likely Scenario After categorizing a breakout past $0.25 as the least probable scenario, ChatGPT outlined that a bear case – meaning a drop below $0.20 – is also quite unlikely, unless the overall market structure doesn’t collapse. If the market conditions remain identical, it believes PI will trade sideways in the following week with a lower boundary of $0.22 and an upper one at $0.24. “PI’s weekly decline does not necessarily signal a trend reversal. The token remains structurally stable above $0.21, but momentum has shifted in favor of caution. The next week will be critical — holding support could set the stage for a rebound, while a breakdown risks extending the correction toward $0.20,” concluded the AI platform.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-next-leg-up-will-be-massive-heres-why/,"Community analyst Arthur recently outlined why he believes XRP may be nearing a major turning point. His assessment focuses on what is already functioning within the ecosystem, what institutions now have access to, and how broader economic conditions align with these developments. He presented a clear argument that the groundwork for a stronger valuation is in place, even though the price remains stable around $2. XRP next leg up will be MASSIVE – Ripple Prime is live, serving U.S. institutions – XRP Ledger ecosystem exploding (DeFi, Firelight, EURØP, tokenization…) – ETFs breaking records – Macro setup screaming for a rate cut and QE – Institutional rails, custody, liquidity,… — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 4, 2025 Institutional Access and Ripple Prime Arthur pointed to Ripple Prime now being live and serving U.S. institutions. He described it as a key step that gives professional firms direct access to liquidity and infrastructure designed for large-scale financial operations. He noted that Ripple’s broader push to build the financial rails used by institutions is advancing, with custody solutions, liquidity pathways, and operational tools already functioning. In his view, these elements form the structural base that will matter when markets reassess the asset’s value. Growth Across the XRP Ledger Ecosystem Arthur highlighted growth across the XRP Ledger, emphasizing active sectors such as DeFi, Firelight, tokenization projects , and the development of EURØP. He described the ecosystem as expanding in real time, supported by tangible on-chain activity rather than speculation. Despite this expansion, XRP continues to trade between roughly $2.10 and $2.20. Arthur argued that the price does not yet reflect the level of development underway. Macro Conditions and ETF Performance Beyond ecosystem progress, Arthur pointed to macroeconomic factors that may eventually support higher valuations. His view is that expectations for rate cuts and possible quantitative easing could create a favorable environment for digital assets. He also noted that ETFs continue to post strong results , reinforcing the role of institutional products in providing access to the asset class. Taken together, he believes these conditions strengthen the case for a future market adjustment. Community Reactions and Diverging Views The commentary drew different responses from the community. X user BD InTheHouse agreed with Arthur’s position, stating that most of the required elements are already in place, including regulatory clarity, institutional partnerships, cross-border payment deployments, and the recognition that XRP is not classified as a security. Meanwhile, user @cube5542 expressed skepticism, pointing out that similar claims have been made in the past without material price changes. He noted that repeated optimism makes it difficult to stay enthusiastic. Arthur’s position is that the next move for XRP will not be a brief surge but a broader repricing based on institutional infrastructure, ecosystem growth, and macro conditions. He maintains that these elements are already active and that the market has yet to recognize their impact fully.

On December 5th, these popular investment vehicles recorded a total net inflow of $54.8 million, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. This resurgence in spot Bitcoin ETFs activity provides a crucial snapshot of institutional and retail confidence in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Drove the Return to Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows? Data from Farside Investors reveals a fascinating story beneath the headline number. The return to positive flows for spot Bitcoin ETFs wasn’t a uniform rally. Surprisingly, the giant BlackRock’s IBIT fund experienced a net outflow of $32.5 million on the same day. This indicates that the inflows were driven by strategic moves into other funds, showcasing a dynamic and competitive landscape. So, where did the money go? A handful of funds captured investor attention: Ark Invest’s ARKB led the charge with a substantial $42.8 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely, attracting $27.3 million. Other gainers included VanEck’s HODL ($11.4M), Bitwise’s BITB ($4.9M), and WisdomTree’s BTCW ($900,000). Is This a True Recovery for Bitcoin ETFs? While the daily figure is encouraging, context is key. Despite this single-day gain, the broader picture for the week of December 1-5 remained negative, with the category posting a cumulative net outflow. This creates a compelling narrative of a market in flux. The daily inflow acts as a counter-punch, but the weekly outflow suggests underlying caution or profit-taking was still at play. This pattern highlights the inherent volatility and sensitivity of spot Bitcoin ETFs to market micro-movements, news cycles, and broader macroeconomic indicators. For investors, it underscores the importance of looking beyond daily headlines to understand longer-term trends. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Strategy? The activity in spot Bitcoin ETFs serves as a high-profile barometer for institutional interest. A return to inflows, even a modest one, can be interpreted as a sign of resilience. It shows that dedicated capital is waiting on the sidelines, ready to buy during perceived dips or periods of stability. However, the mixed signals—daily inflow versus weekly outflow—advise against over-optimism. It’s a reminder that the crypto market, especially through the lens of regulated products like ETFs, is maturing but remains subject to swift sentiment changes. Therefore, a balanced, long-term perspective is often more valuable than reacting to every daily data point. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope in a Volatile Arena The $54.8 million inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 5th is a noteworthy development. It broke a short streak of outflows and demonstrated that demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure persists. The fact that inflows occurred despite a pullback from the largest fund adds a layer of complexity, revealing a diverse and active investor base. Ultimately, this event reinforces the role of spot Bitcoin ETFs as a critical bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Their daily flows will continue to be a metric watched closely by everyone from seasoned traders to casual observers, offering transparent insights into the evolving story of cryptocurrency adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are spot Bitcoin ETFs? A: Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrency directly. Q: Why did BlackRock’s IBIT have outflows while others had inflows? A> This is common in competitive markets. Investors may rebalance portfolios, take profits from one fund to invest in another they perceive as having better potential, or respond to specific fund metrics like expense ratios. It shows healthy market differentiation. Q: Are net inflows always good for Bitcoin’s price? A> Generally, yes. Net inflows mean more money is being used to buy the underlying Bitcoin held by the ETFs, which can create upward price pressure. However, many other factors also influence Bitcoin’s price. Q: Should I invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF based on one day of inflows? A> No. Daily flow data is just one piece of information. Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and a long-term strategy, not short-term fluctuations. Q: Where can I find this flow data? A> Data is aggregated by firms like Farside Investors and widely reported by financial and crypto news outlets. Many investment platforms also provide summaries of ETF activities. Q: Do these ETFs make Bitcoin a more stable investment? A> They provide a more accessible and regulated way to invest, which can attract more institutional capital over time. However, Bitcoin itself remains a volatile asset, and the ETFs reflect that volatility. Found this breakdown of the latest spot Bitcoin ETFs movement helpful?

55414249,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=233578,1764999011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Japan’s Crucial Rate Hike Threatens Bitcoin Liquidity and Global Risk Assets,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-rate-hike-bitcoin-liquidity/,"BitcoinWorld Japan’s Crucial Rate Hike Threatens Bitcoin Liquidity and Global Risk Assets Global cryptocurrency investors are facing a pivotal moment as Japan’s central bank prepares for a historic policy shift. An expected interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan could significantly tighten the liquidity that has recently fueled Bitcoin’s recovery and other risk assets worldwide. This potential Japan rate hike Bitcoin liquidity squeeze stems from the unwinding of a decades-old trading strategy, creating new challenges for market participants. How Could a Japan Rate Hike Squeeze Bitcoin Liquidity? The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is anticipated to raise its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at its December policy meeting. This would mark the highest level since 1995, ending an era of ultra-low rates that has persisted for years. The direct mechanism affecting Bitcoin liquidity involves what traders call the “yen carry trade.” For years, investors borrowed Japanese yen at near-zero rates to invest in higher-yielding assets globally, including: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Emerging market stocks High-yield bonds Other speculative assets This massive flow of cheap Japanese capital created abundant liquidity in risk markets. However, a Japan rate hike makes borrowing yen more expensive, potentially forcing investors to unwind these positions and repatriate funds. What Is the Yen Carry Trade and Why Does It Matter? Imagine borrowing money at 0% interest and investing it elsewhere for potentially higher returns. That’s essentially the yen carry trade in simple terms. This strategy has been extraordinarily profitable because Japan maintained the world’s lowest interest rates while other economies offered better yields. The Japan rate hike changes this calculus dramatically. As borrowing costs rise in Japan, the trade becomes less attractive. More importantly, a stronger yen typically coincides with what traders call “risk-off” sentiment—when investors become cautious and pull money from volatile assets. This creates a double-whammy for Bitcoin liquidity : Cheap funding dries up as yen borrowing costs increase Risk aversion leads to selling pressure on speculative assets How Does This Timing Affect Global Markets? The situation becomes particularly intriguing because markets face conflicting central bank policies. While Japan prepares to raise rates, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates next year. This policy divergence could create unusual market dynamics. Investors who positioned themselves for continued easy money from Japan now face a reckoning. The potential Japan rate hike Bitcoin liquidity impact comes just as cryptocurrency markets showed signs of recovery. This tightening of financial conditions could therefore test the resilience of recent gains. Market analysts note that while traders already anticipate the BOJ’s move, the actual implementation often triggers position adjustments that can be more dramatic than expected. The unwinding of carry trades tends to happen quickly once momentum shifts. What Should Crypto Investors Watch For? Navigating this changing landscape requires attention to specific indicators. First, monitor the yen’s strength against major currencies like the U.S. dollar. A rapidly appreciating yen often signals carry trade unwinding is underway. Second, watch for volatility spikes in cryptocurrency markets, particularly during Asian trading hours. The Japan rate hike could create disproportionate effects during Tokyo market sessions. Finally, consider these practical steps: Review portfolio allocations to risk assets Monitor liquidity indicators like trading volumes and bid-ask spreads Prepare for increased volatility around the December BOJ meeting Diversify funding sources if using leverage Conclusion: A New Era for Global Liquidity The potential Japan rate hike Bitcoin liquidity connection highlights how interconnected global financial markets have become. What happens in Tokyo boardrooms now directly affects cryptocurrency traders worldwide. While markets have anticipated this shift, the actual unwinding of the yen carry trade could create unexpected turbulence. Successful navigation of this environment requires understanding these global linkages rather than focusing solely on cryptocurrency-specific news. The era of unlimited cheap Japanese money appears to be ending, potentially ushering in a new chapter for risk asset investing where fundamentals matter more than abundant liquidity. Frequently Asked Questions What is the yen carry trade? The yen carry trade involves borrowing Japanese yen at low interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. This strategy has provided cheap funding for risk assets globally for decades. How exactly would a Japan rate hike affect Bitcoin? A rate hike makes borrowing yen more expensive, potentially forcing investors to sell Bitcoin and other risk assets to repay their yen loans. This selling pressure could reduce liquidity and create downward price pressure. When is the Bank of Japan expected to raise rates? Most analysts anticipate a rate hike at the BOJ’s December policy meeting, though the exact timing could shift based on economic data and market conditions. Could other cryptocurrencies be affected too? Yes, all risk assets that benefited from cheap yen funding could face pressure. This includes other cryptocurrencies, emerging market stocks, and high-yield bonds. How long might these effects last? The initial adjustment period could last several weeks as positions are unwound. However, the longer-term impact depends on whether this marks the beginning of a sustained tightening cycle in Japan. What should I do with my crypto investments? Consider reviewing your risk exposure, ensuring adequate diversification, and preparing for potentially higher volatility around the BOJ decision date. Avoid panic selling but be cautious about adding leverage. Found this analysis helpful?

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.0000449 Market Capitalization $432.59M Trading Volume $43.6M Circulating Supply 9.657T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.00004781 24-hour Low $0.00004426 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.78% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.00006022 14-Day RSI 37.99 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 23 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $0.00008290 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: • FLOKI is sliding toward lower support on both charts, with still-bearish momentum. • The RSI near 37 hints at seller fatigue, but not enough for a reversal yet. • Recovery starts only with a break back above $0.0000465 – $0.0000480. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the daily chart for December 6, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000448, sitting just above the lower Bollinger Band at $0.0000429, which currently acts as the last technical cushion before a potential volatility expansion to the downside. The mid-band at $0.0000481 remains the immediate upside barrier; until the price reclaims this level, bullish momentum is unlikely to return. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD displays a slowly widening bearish histogram, with the signal line maintaining its downward slope, confirming weakening momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Meanwhile, RSI sits around 37, placing FLOKI in a mildly oversold but not aggressively discounted territory, enough to slow the decline but not enough to force a rebound on its own. Candlesticks from the past three sessions show diminishing body sizes, suggesting seller exhaustion; yet, the lack of a real bullish response keeps the near-term tone defensive. A daily close below $0.0000430 would expose $0.0000410, while a bounce above $0.0000480 would indicate the start of a recovery phase. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour chart, FLOKI is stuck below the Alligator’s teeth and lips (approx. $0.0000466–$0.0000469), revealing that the trend remains firmly bearish in the shorter timeframe. The price, hovering flat around $0.0000448, without any impulsive buying, reflects indecision and a lack of bullish strength. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The 4-hour MACD is more notably negative than the daily, with a growing red histogram and moving averages diverging downward. This confirms active short-term selling pressure. The PVT line also shows a dip, signaling weakening volume-backed demand during this decline. For buyers to gain any traction on this timeframe, FLOKI must first reclaim $0.0000460–$0.0000470. Failure to do so keeps the lower support zone at $0.0000440–$0.0000430 at risk of breaking.

If $0.0000430 holds, the market may attempt a short-term rebound; if it breaks, expect a deeper slide. Bulls need a clear reclaim of $0.0000465–$0.0000480 to flip momentum back upward. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Fresh data reveals these funds experienced a significant net outflow of $75.2 million on December 5th. This marks the second day in a row of withdrawals, pushing the entire week’s cumulative flow into negative territory. For anyone tracking the institutional adoption of Ethereum, this trend demands a closer look. What Do the US Spot ETH ETF Outflows Really Mean? According to reliable data from Farside Investors, the story on December 5th was remarkably singular. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was the only fund with recorded activity, and it was solely responsible for the entire $75.2 million exit. All other US spot ETH ETFs reported zero net change in their flows for the day. This concentration suggests the movement may be driven by specific institutional strategies rather than a broad retail sell-off. Why Are Investors Pulling Money from ETH ETFs? While daily flows can be volatile, two consecutive days of outflows for the US spot ETH ETFs raise questions. Several factors could be influencing this trend: Profit-Taking: Early investors may be locking in gains after the initial launch and subsequent price movements. Market Sentiment: Broader cryptocurrency market conditions or Ethereum-specific news can impact ETF flows. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutions often adjust their holdings at month or quarter-end, which can lead to temporary outflows. Liquidity and Familiarity: As newer products, these ETFs are still building their track record and investor base compared to more established offerings. It’s crucial to remember that the landscape for US spot ETH ETFs is still very young. Short-term flows are a useful pulse check, but they don’t necessarily predict long-term success or failure. A Closer Look at the Weekly Picture for ETH ETFs The data from Farside Investors confirms that the outflows on December 4th and 5th were enough to drag the total flow for the week of December 1-5 into the red. This weekly negative cumulative flow is a key metric for analysts. It indicates that, for this specific period, more capital left the US spot ETH ETFs than entered them. However, one week does not make a trend. The coming weeks will be critical to watch for stabilization or a reversal. What’s Next for US Spot Ethereum ETFs? So, should investors be worried about this outflow? Not necessarily. All new financial products experience growing pains. The true test for US spot ETH ETFs will be their ability to gather assets over the next several quarters and through different market cycles. Their long-term viability hinges on continued institutional interest and the overall performance and utility of the Ethereum network itself. In conclusion, the recent $75.2 million outflow from US spot ETH ETFs is a notable data point that highlights current market caution. It underscores that while the launch was a landmark event, the journey toward deep, sustained institutional adoption is just beginning. Observing flow trends, alongside Ethereum’s network developments, will provide the clearest picture of this asset class’s future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which US spot ETH ETF had the outflow on December 5th? A: The entire $75.2 million net outflow came from BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). All other spot Ethereum ETFs reported no net flows for that day. Q: Does this mean Ethereum ETFs are failing? A> No, it’s too early to draw that conclusion. New investment products often see volatile flows initially. This could be short-term profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing by early investors. Q: Where can I find data on ETF flows? A> The data cited in this article comes from Farside Investors, a firm that tracks daily flows for exchange-traded products. Financial news websites and the ETF issuers themselves also report this information. Q: How do ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A> In theory, a spot ETF issuer must sell the underlying asset (ETH) to meet redemption requests, which could create selling pressure. However, the market is complex, and many other factors simultaneously influence ETH’s price. Q: Should I sell my Ethereum ETF shares because of this news? A> This article provides information, not financial advice. Investment decisions should be based on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and research, not on short-term flow data alone. Q: Are Bitcoin spot ETFs seeing similar outflows? A> Flow patterns for Bitcoin ETFs and Ethereum ETFs can differ based on unique investor perceptions and market dynamics for each asset. It’s important to check the specific data for each product. Found this analysis of the US spot ETH ETF outflows helpful?

According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, an address linked to mining giant Bitmain executed another massive Bitmain ETH purchase , acquiring 22,676 Ethereum worth approximately $68.7 million. This follows an even larger transaction the previous day, creating a powerful narrative about institutional confidence in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. What Does This Massive Bitmain ETH Purchase Mean? When a major player like Bitmain makes consecutive large-scale purchases, the market pays attention. The recent Bitmain ETH purchase represents more than just another transaction—it signals institutional belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Bitmain, known primarily for Bitcoin mining hardware, expanding its Ethereum holdings suggests a strategic diversification that could influence other institutional investors. Let’s break down the numbers clearly: First purchase : 41,946 ETH worth $130.78 million Second purchase : 22,676 ETH worth $68.67 million Total accumulation : 64,622 ETH worth approximately $199.45 million Why Is Bitmain Betting Big on Ethereum? The timing of this Bitmain ETH purchase raises important questions about market strategy. Several factors could explain this aggressive accumulation: First, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has reduced its energy consumption dramatically, making it more attractive to environmentally conscious investors. Second, the growing ecosystem of decentralized applications built on Ethereum creates fundamental value beyond simple speculation. Finally, institutional adoption of Ethereum for various financial products continues to expand. Consider these key benefits that might have influenced Bitmain’s decision: Diversification strategy beyond Bitcoin mining operations Positioning for Ethereum 2.0 upgrades and improvements Institutional trend alignment with growing crypto adoption Long-term value storage in a proven blockchain platform How Does This Bitmain ETH Purchase Affect Market Sentiment? Major purchases by known entities create ripple effects throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This substantial Bitmain ETH purchase serves as a powerful vote of confidence that could influence retail and institutional investors alike. When industry leaders demonstrate conviction through significant capital allocation, it often signals to others that the asset has strong fundamentals. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. While this development is certainly noteworthy, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on any single entity’s actions. What Can We Learn From This Institutional Move? The consecutive Bitmain ETH purchase transactions offer valuable insights for market observers. First, they demonstrate that major industry players are actively accumulating Ethereum during what some consider consolidation periods. Second, they highlight the importance of blockchain analytics in understanding market dynamics. Finally, they remind us that institutional adoption of cryptocurrency continues to progress steadily. For individual investors, the key takeaway isn’t necessarily to mimic Bitmain’s actions but to understand the strategic thinking behind them. Large-scale accumulation by established companies often reflects extensive research and long-term planning rather than short-term speculation. Conclusion: A Significant Signal in Evolving Markets The recent Bitmain ETH purchase totaling nearly $200 million represents more than just another cryptocurrency transaction. It signals growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s infrastructure and future potential. As the blockchain space continues to mature, moves by established companies like Bitmain provide valuable indicators of where smart money is flowing. While no single development guarantees future price movements, the scale and timing of these purchases deserve attention from anyone interested in cryptocurrency markets. They reflect a broader trend of institutional adoption that continues to shape the evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions Q1: Who is Bitmain and why is their purchase significant? A1: Bitmain is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of cryptocurrency mining hardware. Their substantial Ethereum purchases signal institutional confidence that can influence market sentiment and potentially encourage other large investors. Q2: How was this Bitmain ETH purchase identified? A2: Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported the transactions by tracking wallet addresses associated with Bitmain. These addresses are identified through patterns, transaction histories, and sometimes public disclosures. Q3: Does this mean Ethereum’s price will definitely increase? A3: While large purchases can create positive sentiment, cryptocurrency prices depend on numerous factors. No single transaction guarantees price movement, though institutional accumulation often indicates long-term confidence. Q4: Should individual investors follow Bitmain’s lead? A4: Investment decisions should align with individual financial goals and risk tolerance. While observing institutional moves provides valuable market insight, copying them directly may not suit every investor’s strategy. Q5: What makes Ethereum attractive to institutional investors? A5: Ethereum offers a robust smart contract platform, growing decentralized finance ecosystem, and ongoing technical improvements. Its transition to proof-of-stake has also addressed previous environmental concerns. Q6: Are there risks to such large-scale accumulation? A6: Like any investment, cryptocurrency carries risks including volatility, regulatory changes, and technological challenges. Even institutional moves involve calculated risks based on their research and strategic outlook. Found this analysis of the significant Bitmain ETH purchase insightful?

By contributing its technology, ecosystem experience, and institutional partnerships, Polytrade will help architect, build, and scale Integra’s Asset-Specific Layer 1, designed for the global real-estate market. Since 2021, Polytrade has operated at the forefront of real-world asset tokenization. The company has built one of the most active RWA ecosystems in the industry, integrating issuers, liquidity providers, secondary market participants, global distributors, and enterprise partners. This on-ground experience revealed a structural gap: traditional blockchains were not designed to support the data, compliance, valuation, settlement, and identity layers that institutional real-estate markets require. Over the past five years, Polytrade’s institutional division has worked across banks, funds, and enterprises on private-chain and regulated RWA deployments. This work includes long-standing engagements with international partners, payment networks, enterprises, and tokenization companies across multiple jurisdictions, including Mastercard. The insight gained from these projects shaped Polytrade’s conviction that RWAs needed a chain engineered around the realities of regulated assets. Integra provides this foundation. As a purpose-built chain for real estate, Integra introduces a vertically integrated environment where asset information, ownership records, compliance proofs, data feeds, liquidity flows, and market applications are natively embedded. This architecture aligns directly with the requirements of issuers, institutional capital, regulators, and global RWA participants. As per the whitepaper released on 28th November, Integra is building a full-stack Asset Specific L1, whereby the Foundation will build the blockchain, but also native applications and a native stablecoin. The consortium of anchors also includes leading real estate asset managers such as Nitya Capital, builders such as BNW Developments, and other technology companies such as Digishares. Having these asset managers and tokenization leaders allows Integra to seed a flourishing business from the start. Given its ambition with a native stablecoin as well as native DApps, Integra stands to capture value not just by gas or transaction fees as other L1s do, but also by yield on the stablecoin and native DApps fees. By bringing on-chain the movement of hundreds of millions in rents, exits, and sales from just its consortium members, Integra is well-positioned to become a new, value-generating L1, potentially sparking the growth of Asset-Specific L1s. By joining the Consortium, Polytrade will lead technical development across the chain and its core infrastructure, support ecosystem expansion, and contribute to onboarding institutional partners and asset flows. With a pre-existing distribution network and a tested RWA marketplace, Polytrade brings an operational advantage that accelerates Integra’s path to adoption. As a gesture to its long-standing community, Polytrade confirmed that $TRADE holders will receive an allocation of Integra’s native token, $IRL. Final allocation details will be shared once the Foundation concludes its allocation process. Commenting on the announcement, the Polytrade team noted that this next chapter represents the natural extension of the company’s mission: to bridge traditional assets with blockchain environments purpose-built to support them. Polytrade will continue to operate its marketplace and institutional services under the broader Integra umbrella while contributing engineering leadership, ecosystem development, and industry expertise to the chain. The company emphasized that this partnership reflects a long-term ambition to transform how real-estate markets operate globally, with Integra serving as the dedicated infrastructure for that transformation. About Integra Integra is a real estate–focused Layer 1 blockchain designed for trust, compliance, and interoperability. It enables tokenization, management, and exchange of real-world assets at scale. With a consortium representing $12B+ in managed assets, Integra provides the foundation layer for a programmable, liquid real estate economy.

This, amid market fluctuations and heightened volatility in the broader crypto market, impacting the exchange’s stock performance. Bernstein Forecasts New Bullish Phase For Coinbase Despite these challenges, analysts at Bernstein hold an optimistic outlook on Coinbase’s stock price, suggesting a potential new bullish phase that could propel COIN to surpass previous all-time highs and reach levels above $500. Bernstein maintains a price target of $510 on Coinbase, underlining the exchange’s shift from a trading-centric platform to what analysts dub an emerging “everything exchange.” Related Reading: XRP Price Predictions: AI Forecasts $4.40 By March 2026, Analysts Target Up To $6 Analysts led by Gautam Chhugani highlighted the delicate market conditions, citing crypto price fluctuations influencing listed crypto-exposed equities. However, Bernstein distinguishes the current market environment from past crypto downturns, noting that speculative excess primarily affects what they refer to as “MSTR copycats,” referencing Strategy’s (previously MicroStrategy) stock performance. Central to Bernstein’s bullish thesis is Coinbase’s strategic diversification away from volatile spot trading revenue. They assert that exchange is evolving into a comprehensive financial platform. The analysts emphasize that clearer regulatory guidelines in the US could drive a revaluation of these business lines, bridging the gap with offshore competitors benefiting from faster token listings and fundraising fees. Coinbase’s foray into token issuance through a launchpad-style model, exemplified by Monad’s (MON) recent listing, demonstrates growing market interest. Bernstein notes that these launches, directly influencing trading activity, can stimulate a cycle of issuance, listing, and heightened trading volume. Confident Ratings For COIN Looking ahead, one of the exchange’s most notable catalysts is the upcoming product showcase on December 17, anticipated to unveil developments in tokenized equities, prediction markets, and other tools expanding the exchange’s offerings beyond spot crypto trading. The integration with Deribit is also expected to further bolster Coinbase’s derivatives expansion, positioning the exchange closer to platforms like Robinhood as both entities diversify their product offerings.

Top Analyst Assigns 91.5% Probability On the consumer front, the exchange’s Base app, focusing on wallet services, payments, and social features, acts as a centralized access point for the broader token markets, reaffirming the analysts’ bullish predictions. Bernstein’s reaffirmed “Buy” rating on Coinbase with a massive $510 price target underscores the firm’s confidence in COIN’s growth trajectory. Monness Crespi’s recent upgrade from “Neutral” to “Buy” with a $375 target further adds to the bullish sentiment surrounding the stock’s valuation amid falling prices.

55416936,640900,1765000855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55416936.jpeg,From Top To Bottom: Bitcoin’s Largest & Smallest Hands Both Now Accumulating,https://bitcoinist.com/top-bottom-bitcoins-largest-smallest-accumulating/,"Data shows distribution on the Bitcoin network has dropped off, with both the largest of whales and small retail hands taking to accumulation. Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Shows Shift Toward Buying As explained by Glassnode analyst Chris Beamish in an X post , Bitcoin investors have been showing a lot less distribution at the recent price levels. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “ Accumulation Trend Score ,” which tells us about whether BTC holders are buying or selling. The metric tracks investor behavior using not just the changes happening in their wallet balance, but also accounting for the size of their wallets. This means that larger entities have a higher influence on the score. When the value of the Accumulation Trend Score is greater than 0.5, it means the investors are displaying a net trend of accumulation. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the dominance of distribution. Now, here is the chart shared by Beamish that shows how the Accumulation Trend Score has changed for the different Bitcoin investor segments over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score has reflected a varied behavior for the different investor segments during the last couple of months, but very recently, a uniform picture has started to develop. The smallest of investors in the market, those holding less than 1 BTC, started participating in aggressive accumulation around the time of BTC’s low in November and have since maintained the indicator nearly at a perfect value of 1. This suggests that retail investors have been buying the dip. Meanwhile, the 100 to 1,000 BTC traders, popularly called the sharks , have been accumulating throughout the drawdown that has followed since the early October peak, indicating that these investors haven’t lost conviction despite the deep decline. The story is a bit different for the whale cohorts, however. The 10,000+ BTC holders, corresponding to the largest of hands on the network, were in a phase of distribution between August and November, but they have finally started accumulating since the price low, although the Accumulation Trend Score isn’t as high as the retail investors in their case. The 1,000 to 10,000 BTC whale group didn’t stop distributing even after the bottom, but very recently, their score has just breached the 0.5 mark. With this, a uniform behavior has begun to appear on the Bitcoin blockchain, with investors as a whole opting to expand their wallet balance. It now remains to be seen how long this trend of accumulation will continue. BTC Price Bitcoin has faced a drop of more than 3% over the last 24 hours that has taken its price to $89,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin accumulation|Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 06:00:55

Rather than treating 2026 as a distant projection, he argues that Brad Garlinghouse has effectively confirmed it as a target during his detailed panel appearance at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai. The conversation, paired with visible institutional involvement, forms the basis of Squire’s interpretation that the shift toward 2026 is already in motion. THE MESSAGE THEY DIDN’T WANT TO HEAR. Brad Garlinghouse isn’t predicting 2026. He’s confirming it. BlackRock, Vanguard, ETFs, clarity, utility. The move is already underway. pic.twitter.com/k5gqXwn0zN — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 4, 2025 Market Conditions and Institutional Momentum In the video shared with Squire’s post, Brad Garlinghouse responded to questions about why the market has seen a bearish phase. He noted that crypto still moves through familiar cycles and that current uncertainty reflects a broader risk-off period. Despite this, he emphasized that many macro factors are now supporting the sector. He pointed to the United States—representing a large share of the global economy—as a region that has moved from a hostile posture toward a clearer regulatory direction. According to him, institutions are still adjusting to this new environment, but their presence at major events indicates they are positioning for what lies ahead. Garlinghouse referenced the appearance of Franklin Templeton, BlackRock , and the recent shift by Vanguard , which had previously refused to engage with digital assets. He described Vanguard’s reversal as a strong sign that institutional participation is broadening rather than retreating, a point that aligns with the message Squire conveyed. ETF Growth and Long-Term Expectations When asked whether ETF developments were exaggerated, Garlinghouse said they were not. He explained that ETFs were blocked for years due to regulatory issues, and only recent clarity allowed them to emerge. He stated that hundreds of millions of dollars have already flowed into XRP ETFs within a short period, describing this as demand that had been unable to enter the market earlier. Garlinghouse added that crypto ETFs currently make up only a small portion of the overall ETF market, and he expects that share to grow well beyond current levels by 2026. His comments reinforced his view that institutional inflows have begun and will continue to expand. Utility, Stablecoins, and Real-World Adoption Garlinghouse also addressed the role of stablecoins, explaining that many users remained in stable assets during risk-off periods due to trust and convenience. He highlighted that Ripple’s stablecoin has surpassed a billion dollars in market cap and has been approved in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. He said these developments show that practical applications, including payments and collateral use, are becoming more prominent. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He discussed Ripple’s acquisition of G Treasury , noting that several corporate clients with large payment volumes are already exploring stablecoin solutions for efficiency and flexibility. This interest, he explained, is rising because the regulatory environment is improving. Regulatory Progress and the 2026 Target On U.S. regulation, Garlinghouse said recent developments, including the Genius Act and the ongoing work on the Clarity Act , are drawing more institutions into the sector. He expects additional progress in the first half of next year. He ended his remarks by projecting that Bitcoin could reach $180,000 by the end of 2026. Squire’s post frames all these points as confirmation that institutional forces, regulatory stability, and real utility are aligning for the years ahead. In his view, the shift toward 2026 is not merely expected—it has already begun. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Right now, the data from Bitcoin perpetual futures contracts on the world’s largest exchanges is telling a subtle but important story. While the market isn’t screaming bearish, it’s leaning towards caution. Let’s decode what a 51% short position really means for the king of crypto. What Do the Bitcoin Perpetual Futures Numbers Show? The long/short ratio is a crucial sentiment gauge. It shows the percentage of traders betting on a price increase (long) versus those betting on a decrease (short) using perpetual futures contracts. Over the last 24 hours, the aggregate data from Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io reveals a market that is almost perfectly balanced—but with a slight tilt. The overall split is 49% long to 51% short. This means shorts hold a razor-thin majority in the Bitcoin perpetual futures market. A Closer Look at Exchange-by-Exchange Sentiment Not all trading venues see the market the same way. Diving deeper into the numbers gives us a more nuanced picture: Binance: 49.31% long / 50.69% short Bybit: 49.09% long / 50.91% short Gate.io: 51.43% long / 48.57% short Interestingly, Gate.io is the only one of the top three where longs have a marginal majority. This divergence highlights how sentiment can vary even among major liquidity pools. However, the weight of Binance and Bybit, which together represent the lion’s share of open interest, pulls the overall Bitcoin perpetual futures market into short territory. Why Should You Care About This Slight Short Bias? A 2% difference might seem insignificant, but in the high-stakes world of crypto derivatives, it can be a leading indicator. This data suggests that professional traders and institutions using these platforms are exhibiting a degree of skepticism or are hedging their spot holdings. It doesn’t signal a crash, but it does hint at expectations of consolidation or a potential pullback. Monitoring these Bitcoin perpetual futures ratios over time is more valuable than a single snapshot, as shifts can precede price movements. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders So, what can you do with this information? First, don’t panic. A slight short bias is normal in healthy markets and often represents prudent risk management. However, it’s a piece of the puzzle you should consider. If you are bullish, this could indicate a potential ‘wall of worry’ to climb, which is historically positive. If you are looking for entry points, this cautious sentiment might present opportunities. Always combine this derivatives data with on-chain analysis, spot market volume, and broader macroeconomic trends. The Bottom Line on Current Market Sentiment In conclusion, the Bitcoin perpetual futures market is currently a battlefield where bulls and bears are in an almost dead heat, with bears holding a tiny advantage. This reflects a market that is uncertain, perhaps waiting for a catalyst. It’s a environment defined more by hesitation than conviction. For savvy observers, this is not a signal to act recklessly, but a reminder to stay vigilant, manage risk, and watch for the next shift in this delicate balance of power. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin perpetual futures? They are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price without an expiry date, using leverage. Funding rates keep their price tethered to the spot market. Why is the long/short ratio important? It provides a real-time snapshot of market sentiment among leveraged traders, often considered the ‘smart money’ or more active participants in the market. Does a short majority always mean the price will drop? Not necessarily. Markets can remain irrational, and extreme positioning can sometimes lead to a ‘short squeeze’ where rapid price rises force shorts to buy back, fueling the rally. It’s a contrarian indicator at extremes. How often does this data update? The long/short ratio typically updates in real-time or at very short intervals (e.g., every few minutes) on exchange data pages and analytics platforms. Which exchange’s data is most reliable? Binance and Bybit are generally considered the benchmarks due to their massive open interest and liquidity, making their sentiment data highly influential. Should retail traders make decisions based solely on this? Absolutely not. This is one metric among many. It should be used in conjunction with technical analysis, on-chain data, and fundamental research. Found this breakdown of Bitcoin perpetual futures sentiment helpful?

According to the analysis, Bitcoin continues to form a volatile bode, and the price has dipped below the $92,000 level again, indicating that directional uncertainty in the market remains. MakroVision emphasizes that selling pressure remains prevalent in the short term. The analysis highlights that Bitcoin's $87,400-$88,700 range is a critical technical cluster zone. This range contains key Fibonacci levels from the recent downtrend. Experts believe that stabilizing the price within this range is essential for a new recovery structure to form. Otherwise, a breakdown within this range could push the price back toward the $82,000-$80,000 range.

55418744,641146,1765004458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55418744.jpeg,‘Stablecoins Are Here To Stay’: IMF Calls For Global Cooperation To Prevent Financial Risks,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-imf-calls-for-global-cooperation/,"As stablecoins continue to gain worldwide momentum, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called for global cooperation to avert potential macro financial stability risks related to the rapidly growing sector and to turn the industry “into a force for good.” Stablecoins To Foster Innovation, Financial Inclusion On Thursday, the IMF released a 56-page report discussing the growing influence of stablecoins, their potential use cases in mainstream financial markets, and the risks associated with the sector’s varying oversight. Amid the sector’s rapid growth, the organization highlighted that the two largest stablecoins, USDT and USDC, have tripled their market capitalization since 2023, reaching a combined $260 billion. Meanwhile, their trading volume has increased by around 90% to $23 trillion in 2024, with Asia surpassing North America in stablecoin activity volume. The IMF noted two major potential benefits from stablecoins. First, they could enable faster and cheaper cross-border payments, especially for remittances, which can cost 20% of the amount being sent and face some delays. However, “being a single source of information, blockchains can greatly simplify the processes linked with cross-border payments and reduce costs,” the Fund’s economists explained in a blog post. Second, stablecoins could expand financial access, driving innovation by increasing competition with established payment service providers, therefore, making retail digital payments more accessible to underserved customers. They could facilitate digital payments in areas where it is costly or not profitable for banks to serve customers. Many developing countries are already leapfrogging traditional banking with the expansion of mobile phones and different forms of digital and tokenized money. Notably, competition with already established providers could lower costs and lead to enhanced product diversity, “leveraging synergies between digital payments and other digital services.” IMF Warns Of Fragmented Oversight Despite their potential benefits, stablecoins also carry significant risks, the IMF explained, including de-pegging and collapsing if the underlying assets lose value or if users lose confidence in the ability to cash out. Per the report, this could also trigger fire sales of the reserve assets and disrupt financial markets. Stablecoins could also accelerate a “currency substitution” dynamic, where individuals and companies abandon their national currency in favor of a foreign one, like US dollars or euros, due to instability or high inflation. The organization noted that the dynamic decreases a country’s central bank’s ability to control its monetary policy and serve as the lender of last resort, damaging the financial sovereignty of affected nations. In addition, the potential to reduce cross-border frictions and make faster and cheaper transactions could be undermined by a lack of interoperability if various networks are unable to connect or are restricted by different regulations and other hurdles. “Stablecoin regulation is in its infancy, so the ability to mitigate these risks remains uneven across countries,” the organization affirmed, noting that “the IMF and the Financial Stability Board have issued recommendations to safeguard against currency substitution, maintain capital flow controls, address fiscal risks, ensure clear legal treatment and robust regulation, implement financial integrity standards, and strengthen global cooperation.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the FSB vowed in October to address the evolving threats from private finance and the growing use of stablecoins, promising to increase the global watchdog’s policy response and overhaul its surveillance system to make it more flexible and quicker. Nonetheless, major jurisdictions have taken different stances in key areas, as the IMF detailed, which could result in the exploitation of gaps between jurisdictions and issuers to locate where oversight is weaker. All this underscores the need for strong international cooperation to mitigate macrofinancial and spillover risks (…). Tokenization and stablecoins are here to stay. But their future adoption and the outlook for this technology are still mostly unknown. The organization concluded that “improving the existing global financial infrastructure might be easier than replacing it. Achieving the best possible balance will require close cooperation among policymakers, regulators, and the private sector.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto legislation|crypto oversight|FSB|IMF|IMF stablecoins|stablecoin adoption|stablecoin oversight|Stablecoins|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|USDC|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 07:00:58

In 2027, it will range between $100.22 and $119.01, with an average price of $109.61. In 2031, it will range between $225.49 and $244.28, with an average price of $234.88. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability to support the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Technical indicators give bearish signals, but the price charts showcase a bullish market scenario at the time of writing. Why is Hyperliquid up?

However, from a broader perspective, the HYPE price increased to $31.23, gaining 0.81% in its total value today. Is Hyperliquid a Good Investment? HYPE has growing utility, and its Ethereum compatibility helps it steal a share of DeFi industry. While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does justify predicting a $50 target. In the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, but if the token maintains its price levels, a rally can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by any time in 2025 once again, as it did in September and October. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2027. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $119.01. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan’s HYPE price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $244.28, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $244.28 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved during this period, reaching above $8 billion, showing significant growth, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February, when the broader trend turned bearish again. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025, which significantly decreased the market capitalization. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached a high price of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and on August 27, it discovered the $50.99 level with changing market dynamics. On September 18, HYPE achieved its ATH at $59.30, and in October, it corrected to $50. At the start of December, the HYPE token price fell to the $31 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZEC|ZRX|USDC|AIRDROP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 07:06:46

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/history-is-exactly-repeating-for-xrp-heres-what-is-coming/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has highlighted a chart comparison suggesting that XRP’s current market structure is closely tracking the pattern seen in 2017. The analyst placed the two price charts side by side, each marked with three key points showing an early low, a mid-cycle peak, and a later low. The 2025 chart reflects a similar sequence, with the recent pullback forming the third point in the pattern. Both charts also include a curved projection extending upward from the 2025 low, mirroring the sharp rise that followed in 2017. By aligning the patterns, the analyst suggests that XRP may be entering a stage that previously led to a significant price rally, although no numerical prediction was explicitly stated. History is exactly repeating for $XRP Buckle up! pic.twitter.com/oj4SvIMQrZ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 4, 2025 What the projection implies The curved trajectory on the 2025 chart suggests the analyst anticipates a strong market recovery if the pattern continues to follow the earlier cycle. While the graphic does not provide a specific target, the scale indicates a potential return to higher price levels over the coming year. The comparison focuses on pattern repetition rather than detailed technical metrics, leaving the projected outcome open to interpretation. Community responses on timing and expectations Reactions from platform users show a mix of optimism and caution. One user expressed the view that XRP may not move beyond around $3.50 until July 2026, offering a more conservative outlook on timing. Another user interpreted the comparison as signaling that market conditions are aligning for a renewed rally. These differing perspectives reflect ongoing debate about how closely historical patterns can guide expectations in current market conditions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent market conditions add further context to the analyst’s outlook. ETF inflows tied to XRP have continued to strengthen, introducing steady institutional demand at a time when the amount of XRP held on exchanges has been falling . This combination of increasing accumulation and reduced available supply can create firmer pricing conditions. While not determinative on their own, these developments complement the chart-based argument by reinforcing the possibility that a supply-demand imbalance could support a more sustained upward move. Steph’s post illustrates a visual argument for structural similarity, but actual price performance will depend on other factors beyond his analysis.

Ripple’s native token has not been spared, even though the spot XRP ETFs have been on an impressive streak ever since the first one hit the US markets in mid-November. Nevertheless, it continues to struggle and dipped to $2.00 yesterday, a crucial support level that has held up its decline for the past few weeks. With the overall momentum still slightly bearish, we asked ChatGPT for its perspective on the week ahead and whether XRP can stage a notable recovery or the $2.00 support will finally give way. The Warning Signs After outlining the significance of the $2.00 support as well, ChatGPT noted that a drop below that level could lead to a subsequent retreat to the next major line of defense at $1.90. Such a move is possible due to declining trading volume and recent behavior by whales. Recall that these large market participants began a substantial sell-off in October, which has only intensified since then. More recently, they offloaded 150,000,000 XRP in the span of just two days earlier this week, as reported by CryptoPotato. ChatGPT also mentioned the BTC dominance, which could spell trouble for larger-cap altcoins if it continues to increase. The metric had dipped below 56% (on CoinGecko) a few months back, but holds strong above 57% as of press time. The Bull Case In contrast, OpenAI’s solution said technical momentum indicators, such as the RSI and MACD, show that XRP has entered “short-term oversold conditions, which often precede a corrective bounce.” Nevertheless, it admitted that the overall structure remains fragile, and this could be another repeat of the mid-week pump to $2.20 and the subsequent correction to just over $2.00. However, ChatGPT said XRP’s sentiment could turn bullish if the ETF inflows return to the heights from the first few weeks after their launch. Although they are still in the green, the demand for the financial vehicles has slowed, as evidenced by the declining inflows in the past five days. XRP ETF Inflows Dec 6. Source: SoSoValue Additionally, XRP could benefit from a market-wide relief rally in the following week, but it will most likely remain sideways between $1.98 and $2.12, said ChatGPT. In its bull case, the AI platform outlined $2.25 as the upper boundary for a surge, but admitted that this would require a strong bounce from $2.00 aligned with sizeable inflows into the ETFs.

Already, the project’s Phase 6 presale is well on its way to being sold out, with a remarkable rate of 95% sold out, showcasing the overwhelming support of its more than 18,330 early believers as well as the project’s impressive haul of nearly $19.15 million. More fuel added to the fire, MUTM is in the middle of its Halborn security audit, giving its valued investors much-needed assurance that its smart contracts are secure, something that sets the project apart from its many counterparts. With its V1 Sepolia testnet launch expected in Q4 2025, this project is soon going live with its completely functional decentralized lending-and-borrowing system, including interest-bearing tokens, yield-driven incentives, and much more. Mutuum Finance is now considered a top crypto to buy for early investors. MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance is one of the most anticipated projects on the blockchain scene for the year 2026. Mutuum Finance’s presale is still ongoing, with more than 18,330 participants, along with a raised amount exceeding $19.15 million. At the moment, the cost of buying phase 6 tokens is $0.035. However, with phase 7 increasing the cost of the token by a further 20% to $0.04, this is the last stage for buying MUTM below $0.04. What sets Mutuum Finance apart from other cryptocurrencies is that it focuses on use within the real world, as opposed to mere speculation. This is particularly attractive as a starting investment for individuals seeking assets that hold real value, with MUTM being especially desirable as a new crypto for serious investors. Moving Closer to V1 Testnet on Sepolia Mutuum Finance is on the brink of this with its soon-to-be launched V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet, which will happen in Q4 2025. With this, the basic elements of its dynamics, such as its mtToken, rewards system, terms of collateralization/borrowing, interest rate formula, as well as ETH and USDT, will be fulfilled. With its presale happening in tandem with its testnet, users will be provided with the ability to participate in the dynamic realm of DeFi, as opposed to simply investing in a token. MUTM is now recognized as a top crypto to buy for both retail and institutional investors seeking long-term DeFi exposure. Halborn Audit Currently, the lending and borrowing system of the Mutuum Finance application is being audited independently by Halborn Security . This assessment will assess the final software product for its correctness in terms of functionality, strong system integrity, as well as the security of user funds. Upgrades will be provided periodically, with the schedule of the testnet launch announced once this testing assessment is completed. This is a good sign that MUTM is concerned with its integrity, reliability, as well as assurance within its ecosystem, thus establishing itself as a new crypto with real-world utility and strong investor trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still on record with sterling speed, with its Phase 6 almost sold out, exceeding over 18,330 participants, and $19.15 million. With the V1 Sepolia testnet soon to be launched in Q4 2025, Mutuum will soon start its lending-and-borrowing protocol. At this stage, early birds can buy MUTM tokens for only $0.035, but this will soon change with the launch of its Phase 7, soon to sell them at a higher cost of $0.04. This makes MUTM a new crypto to watch in 2025 and a top crypto to buy for early entry.

The Chamber of Deputies approved two resolutions presented by Deputy María Constancia Benítez on Thursday, December 4. These projects are intended to consolidate the state’s control, transparency and supervision mechanisms. Paraguay’s approach to Bitcoin mining The first resolution directs the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to provide reports on all registered people and companies authorized to mine Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This includes all background information in both physical and digital formats. The second resolution targets the National Electricity Administration, known as ANDE, demanding a comprehensive list of all electrical connections authorized for crypto mining. This record must include the names of responsible parties and installation locations. Both agencies have 15 days to deliver the requested reports. The resolutions are needed due to the widespread unauthorized mining operations that Paraguay dealt with in 2024. ANDE reported interventions at more than 30 secret mining farms in 2024 alone. Authorities seized tons of Bitcoin mining equipment and passed a law that punishes illegal mining with up to 10 years in prison. Paraguay produces more electricity than its small population needs. It typically exports 90% of its power production to neighboring countries like Brazil and Argentina at low prices. Still, with the entrance of Bitcoin miners and the expansion of the mining industry, Paraguay can sell the excess energy to miners at a higher rate than it does other countries. Doing this, the National Electricity Administration generates approximately $12 million monthly from cryptocurrency mining operations. The United States ranks first on the global hashrate chart, followed by Russia and China. Paraguay comes in fourth with 3.9% of the global hashrate in its control. Do Bitcoin miners have to register in other countries? Aside from Paraguay, several major mining countries have introduced similar registration requirements to keep up with the industry’s rapid growth. Kazakhstan passed its Law on Digital Assets in 2023, which requires all miners to obtain licenses and register with government authorities. Mining companies must register their hardware and software systems in a special state registry and provide detailed information about their operations. Kazakhstan also mandates that miners sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin through licensed exchanges. Russian legal entities and individual entrepreneurs must register with the Ministry of Digital Development to engage in mining activities. Miners are also required to provide information about obtained digital currency and wallet addresses to Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service. Only small individual miners consuming energy below government-set limits can operate without registration. The Bitcoin mining rules vary by state in both the U.S. and Canada. Mining operations within the U.S. are required to register as businesses and comply with local energy regulations. While in Canada, they register with provincial regulators. Some areas like New York and Quebec have imposed a temporary ban on new mining operations due to environmental concerns, while others like Texas and British Columbia actively welcome miners. Paraguay currently has 45 licensed cryptocurrency mining operations, according to various reports, with approximately 20 additional applicants seeking approval. HIVE Digital Technologies announced on October 21, 2025, that it signed an agreement to develop an additional 100 megawatt hydroelectric-powered data center at its Yguazú site in Paraguay. This expansion is set to begin in early 2026, to be completed in the third quarter of the year, increasing HIVE’s total capacity in Paraguay to 400 megawatts. Don’t just read crypto news.

BTC suffered a monthly drawdown of nearly 10%, and the Nasdaq managed a mere 0.2% gain this month. Since the beginning of 2025, the market share of altcoins has been in a ""slow and steady"" decline, and the ""data vacuum"" threatens to prolong this situation for months, or even longer. The current market structure presents a sustained and steady ""far-month bearishness"". This means traders are not only hedging against immediate declines but are wagering on a long, painful downward cycle. ""When Gold and Silver Eclipse All Else"" In an era awash with algorithmic trading and high-frequency market makers, nothing is more ironic than a sudden intrusion by the physical world. Last Friday, a data centre malfunction at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), so-called ""pulling the plug"", provided the global market with an unscheduled stress test. The results revealed an unsettling truth for investors: in the face of genuine liquidity panic, capital instinctively flocks to age-old safe havens, not ""digital gold"". As screens lit up and futures quotes resumed, we witnessed a textbook example of ""The Great Divergence"". Gold not only reclaimed lost ground but surged past $4,200/oz, while silver stormed to fresh record highs with wild abandon. By comparison, BTC ( BTC-USD ) resembled a toy left forgotten in a corner, lingering at its lows. Although a rebound during the trading week briefly pushed BTC prices near $94k, the last time gold reached these levels, BTC was trading around $120k. From a yield perspective, gold has delivered a return of 7.29% over the last 30 days, while silver has achieved an impressive 23.59%. Meanwhile, BTC suffered a monthly drawdown of nearly 10%, and the Nasdaq managed a mere 0.2% gain this month. Source: Tradingview Source: Tradingview This was not merely short covering triggered by a technical glitch but a microcosm of liquidity reallocation. As the spectre of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) tightening offshore liquidity looms, global capital has, to an extent, reined in its risk appetite. Yet, the greater danger stems from a bond market spiralling out of control: as of November, the total outstanding US T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds reached $30.2 trillion. This $30.2 trillion debt accounts for the bulk of the total US federal debt. Moreover, the total US national debt stands at $38.4 trillion, including obligations to the Social Security Trust Fund and holders of savings bonds. Source: jec.senate.gov Astronomical interest servicing costs have further fuelled investor anxiety regarding potential risks in US Treasuries. According to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the US raised $4.3 trillion through the issuance of the aforementioned three types of government bonds in 2020, with the fiscal deficit that year exceeding $3 trillion. Although the deficit has since narrowed (falling to approximately $1.78 trillion for the 2025 fiscal year), interest payments on the debt alone amount to a staggering $1.2 trillion. Even if tariff revenues reach $300–400 billion, they fall far short of the interest payable on existing debt. Consequently, offshore investors have begun to re-embrace gold and silver. Although an element of a ""short squeeze"" contributed to silver's price surge, a shift in market narrative has provided robust support for its valuation. While BTC is also viewed as an ""emerging digital precious metal"" akin to gold and silver, it is still largely perceived as an ""alternative vessel for USD liquidity"", placing it at a disadvantage in the competition for liquidity. A December of Blind Men and the Elephant For risk assets, the worst news is that forward visibility is practically zero. Although the weakness in November's ADP employment data (coupled with previously poor retail figures) has all but locked in a Federal Reserve rate cut for December, this is not the ""preemptive cut"" the market desires. It appears, instead, to be a forced measure under the shadow of an economic slowdown. Even more headache-inducing is the persisting ""data vacuum"". Non-farm payroll data will be absent until mid-December, and the normalisation of economic data releases is not expected until 2026. In a market that relies on real-time data for algorithmic pricing, we are still trading based on data from the end of the third quarter; this is tantamount to blind men attempting to describe an elephant. Losing one's anchor means the risk premium must rise; this is another reason why the 10-year T-note yield remains firmly above 4%. Source: www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com Put simply, if you cannot see the road clearly, you do not drive fast. This is why long-term risk appetite is being suppressed, which is detrimental to a crypto market that relies on continuous capital inflows. Since the beginning of 2025, the market share of altcoins has been in a ""slow and steady"" decline, and the ""data vacuum"" threatens to prolong this situation for months, or even longer. Source: Tradingview Whales are Betting on a ""Prolonged Slump"" If the macro environment is a headwind, the internal structure of the crypto market suggests engine failure. Let us look at implied forward yields. In a healthy bull market, futures premiums typically push up implied forward yields, indicating investors are willing to pay a considerable cost for potential upside, while offering arbitrageurs decent profits. But now? BTC's implied forward yield is a mere 5.31%, and ETH ( ETH-USD ) is as low as 3.81%. When the yield on holding Ethereum futures shorts cannot even beat 10-year T-notes, this is more than just ""low sentiment"". Institutional capital remains ""uninterested"" in the potential performance of ETH and the vast majority of cryptocurrencies for the foreseeable future. Source: Amberdata Derivatives The most worrying signal comes from the options desk. If you want to know what ""smart money"" is thinking, do not listen to what they say on Twitter; look at what options they are buying. The current market structure presents a sustained and steady ""far-month bearishness"". This means traders are not only hedging against immediate declines but are wagering on a long, painful downward cycle. Source: Amberdata Derivatives Furthermore, BTC prices are sliding towards the zero gamma zone. For investors, this means the market's ""shock absorbers"" are weakening. Market makers are no longer smoothing out volatility by ""selling high and buying low""; instead, they may be forced to sell as prices fall, thereby accelerating any crash. Source: Amberdata Derivatives The market in December will be a game of ""confidence"". The Fed will cut rates, but this may not be sufficient to offset the receding tide of offshore liquidity (courtesy of the BoJ) and the uncertainty brought about by the data vacuum. This winter, gold and silver have proven themselves to be reliable old friends. And cryptocurrencies? Unless they can swiftly recover liquidity, they will be left to face the cold wind alone.

A recent development in the U.S. exchange placed the asset in a new category. Abs Nassif opened his Good Evening Crypto show by stating that “XRP just got the green light to be used as collateral in the USA.” He highlighted the partnership between Ripple and Bitnomial, which began with Ripple’s $25 million investment in 2024. XRP is now accepted as margin collateral on a CFTC-regulated exchange. Nassif noted that this puts XRP in the same position as Bitcoin and Gold. ALERT: CFTC APPROVES $XRP AS COLLATERAL LIKE BITCOIN & GOLD! 72 HOURS COUNTDOWN STARTS NOW! CLICK BELOW TO WATCH NOW!! https://t.co/n8ovjjN4eh — Good Evening Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) December 6, 2025 XRP Becomes Collateral on a CFTC-Regulated Exchange In November, Bitnomial became the first U.S.-regulated derivatives clearing organization to accept stablecoins as collateral with RLUSD. It went further and added XRP. Traders can now use XRP for leverage, futures, options, and perpetual trading. This improves capital efficiency since users don’t need to convert XRP into fiat for margin. This strengthens XRP’s role in a trusted, compliant U.S. framework. Why Collateral Use Helps XRP Nassif described this shift as a path to greater utility because the asset can move directly into collateral functions that support high-volume activity. Johnny Krypto, his co-host, said that using XRP as collateral keeps it off the market. He noted that “you’re kind of locking it up” when you place tokens as margin for trades. This reduces selling pressure and can lead to a tighter supply. A potential supply shock as demand grows. He also said the move supports a long-term goal for XRP holders. It allows the asset to be multipurpose. It no longer sits only in payment corridors. It now fills a role in a regulated derivatives market with high trading volume. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Clearer Rules Support Further Growth The episode featured a clip of Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who stated Ripple “faced existential regulatory threat” in the form of the XRP lawsuit for years. This legal battle held back adoption. With that threat gone , he sees a growth of real use cases. A second clip featured Teucrium CEO Sal Gilberti. Gilbertie pointed to Ripple’s work with global banks and the increasing adoption of XRP. He believes usage on the XRPL will rise once the Clarity Act passes in 2026 because banks need a clear set of rules before they move forward. Nassif ended by noting that XRP trades in oversold territory while new ETFs have already gathered over $1 billion in assets. These products removed 473 million tokens from exchanges. He said the CFTC approval adds another path for demand and places XRP in a stronger spot as institutions expand their activity in the sector.

The platform has announced it will list POWER/USDT perpetual futures , providing traders with a new instrument to speculate on the POWER token’s price movements. This move highlights Binance’s commitment to diversifying its market and catering to advanced trading strategies. The contract goes live on December 6, 2023, at 09:00 UTC, introducing up to 20x leverage to the mix. What Are POWER/USDT Perpetual Futures? If you’re new to crypto derivatives, you might wonder what this listing means. POWER/USDT perpetual futures are a type of contract that allows you to bet on the future price of the POWER token without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, these contracts don’t settle on a specific date; you can hold them as long as you maintain your position. They are settled in USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, which simplifies the pricing and margin process. This listing gives traders more flexibility and tools to manage their exposure to the POWER token. Why Is This Binance Listing a Big Deal? Every new futures contract on a major exchange like Binance signals increased market maturity and liquidity for the underlying asset. The introduction of POWER/USDT perpetual futures offers several key benefits for the trading community: Enhanced Liquidity: Binance’s massive user base will provide deep order books, making it easier to enter and exit positions. Leverage Opportunities: With up to 20x leverage, traders can amplify their potential gains (and losses) from smaller price movements. Hedging Capability: Holders of the POWER token can use these futures to hedge against potential downside risk in the spot market. 24/7 Market Access: Trade around the clock, capitalizing on volatility at any time. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify profits, it also exponentially increases risk. Key Details for Trading POWER Perpetual Futures Before you dive in, understanding the contract specifications is vital. The POWER/USDT perpetual futures contract will be available on the Binance Futures platform. Here are the essential details every trader should know: Launch Time: December 6, 2023, at 09:00 UTC. Leverage: Up to 20x. Tick Size: The minimum price movement will be defined by Binance at launch. Funding Rate: As a perpetual contract, it will have a periodic funding rate mechanism to keep the futures price aligned with the spot price. Always check the official Binance announcement page for the most accurate and updated specifications before trading. How Can You Start Trading POWER Futures Safely? Ready to explore this new market? Responsible trading is paramount, especially with leveraged products. First, ensure you have a funded Binance account and have completed any necessary identity verification. Next, familiarize yourself with the Binance Futures interface using the testnet or by starting with minimal capital. Develop a clear risk management strategy: use stop-loss orders, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and understand how liquidation works at high leverage. The POWER/USDT perpetual futures market will likely see initial volatility, so caution is advised. What Does This Mean for the POWER Token Ecosystem? The listing of POWER/USDT perpetual futures is more than just a new trading pair; it’s a vote of confidence from a top-tier exchange. It typically leads to increased visibility, attracts more professional traders and institutional interest, and can contribute to price discovery. For the POWER project, this represents a milestone in its growth and integration into the broader crypto financial system. In summary, Binance’s decision to list POWER/USDT perpetual futures is a significant development for traders seeking exposure to this asset. It provides powerful tools for speculation and hedging but demands respect for the inherent risks of leveraged trading.

The Core Team has made several improvements in the past several months, and the latest was announced on Friday. AI Integration Pi Network’s team has long dabbled with AI integrations, including in the Pi App Studio. Now, they have opted for the new tech revolution in the Standard KYC system by incorporating the same technology infrastructure that powers the Pi Fast Track KYC. The idea is to dramatically speed up identity verification, reduce bottlenecks, and support the next major wave of Mainnet migration. The statement reads that this enhanced AI system has already cut the pending human-review queue by around 50%, making KYC faster, more scalable, and more accessible to the millions of claimed Pioneers worldwide. The expanded AI validation layer improves the system in the following manner, said the team: Reduces validator shortages in regions with limited human reviewers Speeds up Mainnet-unlocking KYC for more Pioneers Decreases the number of applications needing manual review Further enhances privacy by reducing what human validators can see (sensitive data is already redacted) The Core Team added that human validators will still be present despite the introduction of AI services. The system intentionally uses ‘very conservative AI checks’ to prevent false approvals, so any shady cases are routed to human reviewers for final analysis. The statement noted that this process should maintain accuracy while reducing the total labor required. This saved human labor from KYC will be reallocated toward other areas in Pi’s ecosystem, such as human-feedback processes for AI training, app utilities, and emerging platform-level opportunities. KYC Statistics The team said that more than 17.5 million users have fully passed KYC, while 15.7 million have already migrated to the mainnet. Around three million Tentatively KYC’d Pioneers can now self-unblock by completing additional liveness checks. They also advised all fully KYC’d users to finish the mainnet checklist, including wallet confirmation, 2FA setup, and signing the token-receipt terms. “These millions of KYC’d Pioneers on the Pi Mainnet, with many more to join, are an important achievement of the collective efforts of the Pi community and a great resource of the network that not only help maintain the security and integrity of our network but serve as the foundation to nurture more real utilities in Web3 and AI industries that will shape our future,” finished the statement.

55419533,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=873873,1765008995,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55419533.jpeg,Grayscale moves to list SUI ETF shortly after 21Shares US launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/grayscale-files-to-launch-sui-etf/,"Grayscale has filed registration paperwork with the U.S. regulator to launch its own SUI‑linked exchange-traded fund, coming mere days after 21Shares brought the first U.S.-listed SUI fund online. The proposed fund is set up as a spot ETF, meaning it seeks to track the actual market price of SUI, minus fees and operating expenses. Grayscale’s new filing indicates that the firm remains eager to gain a foothold in the digital-asset ETF market . The firm has been quietly adding single-asset ETFs throughout the year, making itself one of the most active issuers in the crypto-linked exchange-traded products space in recent months. If approved, the Grayscale Sui Trust would enable investors to gain exposure in the Sui blockchain ecosystem in a compliant and secure manner. Investors would not need to purchase or store SUI tokens, nor would they need to take any action to secure them. The filing highlights the growing momentum behind SUI. If approved, the Grayscale Sui Trust would be among the first U.S. securities to hold SUI assets exclusively. Modeled after the firm’s other single-asset products, the trust is designed to provide traditional investors with a regulated and familiar way to access emerging markets, such as cryptocurrency. The premier products in their class are designed to provide investors with access to the U.S. market while substantially mitigating liability associated with tax obligations arising from distributions made throughout the year. 21Shares leads the race with first U.S. SUI-ETF launch Grayscale’s filing comes just days after 21Shares caused a stir with the introduction of the first SUI-based ETP in the United States, which was announced on Tuesday. The product, trading on Nasdaq under the ticker “ TXXS ,” is a leveraged ETF that seeks to generate 2x daily exposure to changes in the price of SUI. Instead of directly holding SUI, the fund uses derivatives to amplify gains and losses from those tools, which makes it especially suitable for active and short-term traders. TXXS was the first blockchain-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) in America, thus establishing trust in Sui’s network and signaling an early sign of faith in Sui’s network. Its first day turned out to be surprisingly strong, closing at a little over $24, and with more than 4,700 shares traded. Some analysts are saying that this launch marks a major milestone for altcoin-linked ETFs, boosting market optimism for SUI’s future in regulated markets. It cleared the path for a new asset class in the ETF market and caused an avalanche of filings. Grayscale’s move, so soon after the index launched, suggests a fiercely competitive struggle to take early advantage of the SUI-dominant investment products. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Canary Funds also submitted a filing to launch its own spot SUI fund. SUI ETFs drive market shift and investor interest Both 21Shares and Grayscale’s quick moves indicate a major shakeup in the digital-asset investment world. Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the limelight in the ETF world, as growing excitement about other dedicated crypto products pressured issuers to become more competitive. SUI-based offerings are emerging as new blockchain networks gain traction in the mainstream finance sector. The surge in attention around SUI reflects multiple trends reshaping investor participation in open-source cryptocurrency ecosystems. Regulated products, such as spot SUI ETFs, are available to a wider swath of investors. And rather than dealing with foreign crypto exchanges, investors can purchase exposure to SUI within the same brokerage accounts they are leveraging for stocks and bonds. And it makes entry simpler, adding some of the safety and oversight that more traditional investors tend to require. Additionally, the competition among multiple companies to list SUI funds suggests growing institutional confidence. Large asset managers often do not build products around networks that indicate little demand.

Key Takeaways: Strive says MSCI’s plan to exclude crypto-heavy firms would shut investors out of key growth sectors. JPMorgan warns Strategy could face up to $2.8B in losses under the proposal. Strive argues BTC-focused firms are vital to AI infrastructure and structured finance, making the cutoff unfair. In a letter addressed to MSCI chairman and CEO Henry Fernandez, the company warned that the proposal, which would exclude firms whose crypto holdings exceed 50% of total assets, risks shutting passive investors out of fast-growing corners of the market. JPMorgan Warns Strategy Could Lose $2.8B Under MSCI Proposal JPMorgan analysts recently cautioned that Strategy , a prominent Bitcoin treasury company included in the MSCI World Index, could face as much as $2.8 billion in losses if the exclusion moves forward. Strategy’s chair, Michael Saylor, has confirmed that discussions with MSCI are ongoing as the company attempts to head off the decision. Strive CEO Matt Cole argued that the proposal misunderstands the role large Bitcoin-focused firms play in emerging industries, particularly artificial intelligence. He noted that miners such as MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, and Hut 8, all potential exclusion targets, are rapidly expanding into AI infrastructure by retooling data centers for high-intensity compute workloads. “Many analysts argue that the AI race is increasingly limited by access to power, not semiconductors,” Cole wrote, adding that miners are uniquely positioned to meet those needs. https://t.co/5gdKWpFATh — Matt Cole (@ColeMacro) December 5, 2025 Even as AI revenue increases, he said, companies will continue holding sizable Bitcoin reserves, meaning MSCI’s exclusion would permanently wall off a sector positioned at the intersection of digital assets and next-generation computing. Cole also pointed to the rising demand for Bitcoin-linked financial products. Firms such as Strategy and Metaplanet function similarly to banks offering structured BTC notes, providing equity-based access to Bitcoin performance without requiring investors to hold the asset directly. Excluding these treasury companies, he argued, would give traditional financial institutions, including JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, an uneven playing field, as index-linked capital would become biased against firms whose business models center on Bitcoin exposure. Strive Says MSCI’s 50% Rule Would Cause Index “Whiplash” Strive further challenged the practicality of MSCI’s 50% threshold, noting that tying index eligibility to a volatile asset would cause companies to drift in and out of benchmarks, increasing tracking errors for funds that follow them. Cole highlighted Trump Media & Technology Group as an example. Despite holding one of the largest public Bitcoin treasuries, it narrowly avoided MSCI’s preliminary exclusion list because its BTC exposure currently sits just under the cutoff. Instead of a blanket rule, Strive proposed a parallel “ex-digital asset treasury” version of MSCI’s indexes. This would allow asset managers who wish to avoid crypto-heavy companies to do so, while others could maintain exposure to the full investable universe. MSCI has not yet indicated whether it will revise its proposal, but industry pressure is mounting as treasury-heavy firms await a final decision.

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethena Ticker ENA Price $0.26 (-7%) Market cap $3.59 Trading volume (24-hour) $457M Circulating supply 7.15B ENA All-time high $1.52 (11 April, 2024) All-time low $0.1858 (11 October, 2025) ENA technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.26 Price Prediction $ 0.2148 (-25.34%) Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.54% (Very High) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.3373 200-Day SMA $ 0.4831 14-Day RSI 46.80 (Neutral) ENA price analysis Resistance for ENA is at $0.3063 Support for ENA/USD is at $0.2233 The ENA price analysis for December 6 confirms that ENA witnessed bearish pressure as it declines toward $0.26. Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a bearish rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bearish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bearish correction after sellers pushed the price toward support lines. Sellers are now aiming for a hold below the immediate Fib channels around $0.26. The 24-hour volume dropped toward $41 million, showing a decline in trading interest today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.26, which has dropped by over 7% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers within the neutral region at 42, showing that bears control price momentum slightly. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.8, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening selling positions. ENA price predictions: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.4056 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.3367 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.3254 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.2973 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.3373 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.4831 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.4831 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.3005 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.3462 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.4359 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.5275 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5549 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.5118 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.4874 SELL What to expect from ENA price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the ENA price from an immediate surge. However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.3063, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.3673. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2233, resulting in a correction to $0.1674. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price down today? ENA’s price gained selling pressure around recent highs, resulting in a minor downward push. This created a decline toward $0.26. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.3 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA 21Shares has launched the Ethena ETP (EENA) on European exchanges, giving investors regulated access to ENA and following Ethena’s strong $151M Q3 fees and its new Hyperliquid partnership.

In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3. By the end of November, ENA declined below $0.23.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-06 08:25:00

Key Takeaways: Strategy built a $1.44B cash reserve to ease investor fears about its ability to meet dividend and debt obligations. The firm raised the funds in just eight and a half days, aiming to show it can still attract capital without selling any Bitcoin. Strategy says it will only consider selling BTC if its stock falls below NAV. Speaking on CNBC’s Power Lunch , Le said the move followed weeks of speculation about whether the firm could continue meeting its dividend and debt commitments if market conditions worsened. “We’re very much a part of the crypto ecosystem and Bitcoin ecosystem,” Le said. “Which is why we decided a couple of weeks ago to start raising capital and putting US dollars on our balance sheet to get rid of this FUD.” Strategy Builds Cash Buffer to Avoid Selling Bitcoin in Market Slump The reserve, announced Monday and funded via a stock sale, is intended to secure at least 12 months of dividend payments, with plans to stretch that buffer to 24 months. The company emphasized that the stock-funded buildup gives Strategy breathing room without having to sell any Bitcoin during a turbulent period for the market. Concerns over Strategy’s dividend stability had grown louder in recent weeks as Bitcoin retreated from its highs. Le acknowledged the market chatter but dismissed it as exaggerated. “We weren’t going to have an issue paying dividends, and we weren’t likely going to have to tap into selling our Bitcoin,” he said. “But there was FUD that was put out there that we wouldn’t be able to meet our dividend obligations, which causes people to pile into a short Bitcoin bet.” This afternoon, Phong Le, CEO of @Strategy , joined @CNBC @PowerLunch to discuss how $MSTR moves with bitcoin, how our USD reserve addresses recent FUD, the shifting Overton Window, key volatility drivers, and why bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains strong. pic.twitter.com/1t5hsfov0m — Strategy (@Strategy) December 5, 2025 The CEO said raising $1.44 billion in just eight and a half days was intended as a direct response, showing the firm can still attract capital even in a downcycle. “We did it to address the FUD, and to show people we’re still able to raise money when Bitcoin is under pressure.” Last week, Le said Strategy would only consider selling Bitcoin if the stock dropped below net asset value and the company lost the ability to raise additional funds. Strategy has also introduced a new “BTC Credit” dashboard, which it says shows the company holds enough assets to service dividends for more than 70 years. Strategy Adopts Dual-Reserve Model as BTC Buying Slows As reported, Strategy has shifted from its long-standing “buy Bitcoin at all costs” approach to a dual-reserve treasury model that pairs long-term BTC holdings with a growing dollar buffer. The move follows a dramatic slowdown in the firm’s accumulation pace, from 134,000 BTC per month at its 2024 peak to just 9,100 BTC in November, signaling preparation for a potentially prolonged bear market. Despite the slowdown, the company remains one of the world’s largest Bitcoin holders, with roughly 650,000 BTC on its balance sheet.

55419719,https://cryptonews.com/?p=460725,1765009875,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55419719.jpeg,Indiana Bill Would Mandate Bitcoin in Pensions and Shield Self-Custody Rights,https://cryptonews.com/news/indiana-bill-bitcoin-etf-pensions-crypto-rights/,"A newly introduced bill in Indiana would require public retirement programs to offer Bitcoin-related investment options and would also limit how much power local governments have to restrict the use of digital assets. The proposal was filed on Thursday by State Representative Kyle Pierce, a Republican from Anderson. Known as House Bill 1042, the legislation was presented during a meeting of the House Financial Institutions Committee. It focuses on giving public workers access to cryptocurrency investments while setting clear legal boundaries around digital asset use, custody, payments, and mining. Indiana Targets First-in-the-Nation Mandate for Bitcoin in Public Pensions Under the bill, administrators of several state-run retirement and savings plans would be required to include cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds as standard investment choices. It would also permit certain public pension funds to invest directly in crypto-linked ETFs and give the state treasurer authority to place funds from specific accounts into stablecoin-based ETFs. Pierce said the bill is designed to give Indiana residents more financial flexibility as digital assets become a larger part of the broader economy. He added that the legislation is intended to balance investment choice with regulatory guardrails while allowing the state to explore potential government use of blockchain technology through pilot programs. Source: Indiana House Republicans The legislation goes beyond retirement investing and takes aim at local regulation. Cities and counties would be prohibited from passing rules that place “unreasonable” limits on digital assets if similar rules do not apply to traditional financial activity. That protection would extend to crypto payments, private ownership of digital wallets , and mining operations . The bill adds clear safeguards for self-custody. It states that private digital asset keys could only be demanded through a court order and only when no other legal method of access is available. It would also prevent local governments from zoning out mining facilities from industrial zones and would protect properly zoned residential mining activity. If enacted, Indiana would become the first state in the country to require publicly managed retirement programs to provide Bitcoin exposure as a standard option. While some states permit limited crypto investment flexibility, none currently mandate it. U.S. States Expand Crypto Access in Pensions, Payments, and Property Laws Other states have taken related but narrower steps. Oklahoma passed a law in 2024 protecting residents’ right to hold crypto in self-custody wallets and blocking special taxes on Bitcoin transactions. In 2025, Kentucky followed by formally recognizing self-custody as a protected property right. Wyoming has also approved laws that allow public pension funds to invest in digital assets. Elsewhere, Arizona introduced legislation that would allow Bitcoin ETFs in retirement accounts, while Florida outlined legal pathways for holding digital assets through ETFs in certain state funds. Arizona’s push to integrate digital assets into state financial infrastructure is nearing a critical milestone. #Arizona #Bitcoin https://t.co/jNb7UnYvX1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 18, 2025 Indiana’s proposal stands apart by making crypto ETF access a requirement rather than a choice. Momentum around crypto-linked retirement exposure continues to build nationwide. In August, Michigan’s state retirement system tripled its Bitcoin ETF holdings to 300,000 shares, valued at about $11.4 million, according to regulatory filings. The State of Michigan Retirement System has increased its exposure to Bitcoin, tripling its holdings in the @ARKInvest 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. #Michigan #Bitcoin https://t.co/lUxWycmp4A — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 6, 2025 The fund also holds roughly $13.6 million in Ethereum through the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. Wisconsin’s state investment board has also disclosed more than $387 million in Bitcoin ETF exposure. States are also widening their use of digital assets outside of investing. In September, Ohio finalized plans to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for official state payments. In October, California updated its Unclaimed Property Law to ensure dormant crypto is not automatically converted into cash when transferred to state custody. California has become the first US state to formally protect unclaimed crypto from being forcibly converted to cash. #California #Bitcoin https://t.co/PoV40lmZi9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 New York City has taken its own steps by setting up a municipal Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain.

According to the police report, the scam, which took the shape of a romance crypto scam, saw the bad actors target yet another elderly widow who thought she had found love and a long-time companion on the internet. The incident is also another brutal wake-up call to victims, as scammers continue to lure elderly widows and widowers, especially in the California area, into what seems like a loving relationship. After they had been trapped and asked to give away funds running into millions, the victims now discover they have been scammed. California woman loses nearly $1 million to pig butchering scam The victim, Margaret Loke, has been full of regrets since the incident occurred, going over bank statements, wire transfer documents, and other stuff that could help law enforcement nab the criminals. According to the police, the scam wiped nearly all her funds, leaving her with almost nothing to live on. “Why am I so stupid. I let him scam me!” she said. “I was really, really depressed.” According to reports, the California woman could also lose the two-bedroom condo she bought for her retirement. She mentioned that she has been working tirelessly to save the house, noting that it is the only thing she has left. Loke noted that she had lived a fairly quiet life since her husband passed, but things changed in May when a friend connected her with a man on Facebook. “She says, ‘Oh this is a nice guy… you just say hi to him, that’s it’… I say, ‘We are from San Jose,’ and then he said, ‘Oh I like to, you know, meet people from San Jose, and I’m from Texas,'” Loke recounted. The California woman noted that the man’s name was Ed, a businessman of Chinese descent. She added that they hit it off almost instantly, moving their chats to WhatsApp after chatting online for a while. The California widow added that he was really nice to her, greeting her every morning. She said he sometimes wakes up ahead of her just to send her beautiful messages in the morning. Soon after they started talking, the man started making his intentions known. She added that while they talked every day, they shared interesting details about their lives, including what they ate, where they went, and other details. Soon, he started calling her honey. Widow falls for romance scammer The pair continued to share loving messages, while Loke mentioned that Ed always insisted that they didn’t have to meet in person. He also asked her to keep their romance a secret. A while after, he started prying into her investments, asking her what kind she had. Loke, unsuspecting of any agenda, told him that she didn’t have any investment, a reply that Ed found surprising. Ed told her that he was rich because of all the investments that he had made, highlighting that she could also be rich. The California woman claimed that Ed wanted to give her $15,000 to invest in digital assets, a gesture she rejected. She told him she had enough money to invest in whatever she wanted. Under his guidance, she wired her money into an account and then signed up on a crypto investment website. After a while, the investment site showed that she had made big profits. Seeing the kind of profit she could make, the California woman moved $120,000 into the online account. Again, she saw big profits. Ed then told her to keep investing to reach their goal of $5 million. After a series of investments, she realized that the funds were frozen when she tried to withdraw her funds.

During a candid interview at Binance Blockchain Week, CZ, as he’s widely known, shared a simple yet profound truth that resonates far beyond the crypto charts: the real joy of life lies in its beautiful uncertainty. This insight from one of the most influential figures in technology challenges our constant pursuit of certainty and reframes how we view our daily struggles. What Did Changpeng Zhao Say About Life’s Uncertainty? When asked about the five wishes he’d want fulfilled before he dies, Changpeng Zhao gave a surprising answer. “One is enough,” he stated. He elaborated by comparing life to a game, explaining that a game with a known outcome is simply less enjoyable. The true value, according to CZ, isn’t in the final score but in the process of cooperation and effort involved in getting there. This philosophy directly challenges the common narrative of success being a fixed destination. For Changpeng Zhao , the founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, this isn’t just abstract talk. His entire career has been a testament to navigating the volatile and unpredictable world of blockchain. He added a crucial point that many miss: life’s difficulties are part of its enjoyment . This mindset shift—from seeing problems as obstacles to viewing them as integral parts of a meaningful journey—is a powerful tool for personal and professional growth. How Can We Apply CZ’s Philosophy to Crypto and Life? The wisdom from Changpeng Zhao is incredibly relevant for anyone involved in cryptocurrency or any innovative field. The market’s notorious volatility isn’t just a risk to be managed; it can be seen as the very source of opportunity and engagement. Here are three key takeaways from his perspective: Embrace the Process: Focus less on predicting the exact price of Bitcoin and more on understanding the technology and community building around it. Reframe Challenges: View market dips and regulatory hurdles not purely as threats, but as necessary phases that test and strengthen the ecosystem. Value Cooperation: The crypto space thrives on collective effort—from developers to users—much like the cooperative game CZ describes. What is Changpeng Zhao’s One Simple Wish? Amidst deep philosophical discussion, Changpeng Zhao concluded with a remarkably humble and universal wish. His single desire is for everyone to be healthy . This simple statement grounds his entire philosophy. It suggests that without basic well-being, the journey itself becomes impossible to enjoy. It’s a reminder that in our quest for wealth or success in crypto, health is the fundamental asset we often neglect. This perspective from Changpeng Zhao is a masterclass in resilience. In an industry defined by rapid change and uncertainty, cultivating a mindset that finds joy in the unknown is perhaps the most valuable skill of all. It encourages us to stay engaged, curious, and adaptable, whether we’re analyzing a new DeFi protocol or facing personal challenges. The Ultimate Takeaway from CZ’s Wisdom The lesson from Changpeng Zhao is clear: stop fighting uncertainty and start appreciating it. The unpredictable path of life, much like the volatile crypto market, is filled with potential for learning, growth, and unexpected joy. By letting go of the need for guaranteed outcomes, we open ourselves to richer experiences and more meaningful collaborations. CZ’s journey with Binance exemplifies this—building a global empire not by avoiding risk, but by navigating it with a focus on process and collective effort. In conclusion, the next time you feel anxious about an uncertain market move or an unpredictable life event, remember the words of Changpeng Zhao . The joy isn’t in knowing the end of the story; it’s in the thrilling, collaborative, and sometimes difficult process of writing it together. Embrace the unknown—it’s where the real adventure begins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly did Changpeng Zhao say about life’s uncertainty?

The remarks highlighted a development that many retail investors may be overlooking, pointing to a measurable shift in how institutions are positioning themselves around XRP through early ETF inflows. Ripple CEO Highlights Early Institutional Positioning At the event in Dubai, Garlinghouse disclosed that XRP-focused ETFs have already surpassed $700 million in inflows. X Finance Bull emphasised this point, noting that this milestone has been reached at a very early stage, especially considering that crypto ETFs still account for only a small portion of the global ETF market. He argued that this suggests institutions are in the early phases of allocation, gradually increasing exposure rather than rushing into the market. $700M in $XRP ETF inflows and most people still think it’s a side play Brad Garlinghouse just dropped a stat that’s getting buried: XRP ETFs have already crossed $700 million… and we’re still in the first inning. Crypto ETFs currently make up just 1–2% of the global ETF… pic.twitter.com/LQfE78AtOn — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 4, 2025 Why Institutions Are Focusing on XRP X Finance Bull placed significant focus on the kinds of assets institutions are choosing at this stage. He emphasized that XRP’s continued ability to attract inflows—despite past legal disputes , regulatory delays, and negative media pressure—shows that it has maintained the trust of large financial players. He pointed to XRP’s liquidity profile, clearer regulatory positioning, and real-world utility as factors that make it appealing to institutions seeking long-term, structured investment exposure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Retail Behaviour Versus Institutional Strategy He also drew a contrast between institutional behaviour and the priorities of many retail investors. While retail interest often centres on short-term or speculative assets, major entities such as BlackRock and Vanguard appear to be quietly increasing their exposure to assets that offer stronger frameworks and more established use cases. According to the pundit, the steady inflows into XRP ETFs reflect this difference in approach, though it receives limited public attention. XRO Community’s Insight Another market participant, CryptoWhat, commented that the consistent inflows signal growing institutional confidence. He noted that it is encouraging to see interest shift toward assets with clearer utility and more mature long-term structures as the market continues to develop. The confirmation from Garlinghouse in Dubai, combined with X Finance Bull’s observations, points to a clear trend of institutional engagement. With XRP ETF inflows exceeding $700 million and exchange supply gradually tightening, institutional participation may continue to support XRP’s longer-term outlook.

According to Bloomberg , the government described Kwon’s crimes as “ colossal in scope ” in a Thursday filing before US District Judge Paul Engelmayer, pointing to cascading market failures that ultimately contributed to FTX’s downfall. Kwon will face sentencing on December 11, with his own legal team requesting just five years behind bars. The 34-year-old South Korean entrepreneur pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy and wire fraud charges under an agreement capping prosecutorial recommendations at 12 years. However, the statutory maximum reaches 25 years for his role in the algorithmic stablecoin fraud. Source: Financial Times Prosecutors Highlight Systemic Market Damage The Justice Department’s sentencing memorandum emphasizes that Kwon’s fraudulent statements to customers triggered a chain reaction across cryptocurrency markets. Prosecutors specifically cited the collapse’s contribution to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX implosion as evidence of broader systemic damage beyond Terra’s immediate investor losses. Kwon admitted in court that between 2018 and 2022, he “ knowingly agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud purchasers of cryptocurrencies ” from Terraform Labs. He acknowledged making false statements about TerraUSD’s peg restoration mechanisms and concealing Jump Trading’s secret role in propping up the stablecoin during a May 2021 depeg event that foreshadowed the larger catastrophe. The timing carries added significance, as the Trump administration has largely eased the tough-on-crypto enforcement actions, as the Biden administration did before. Most recently, President Donald Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao on October 23 after his conviction for anti-money laundering program failures at the world’s largest crypto exchange. Although the administration defended the pardon, claiming it was reviewed “with the utmost seriousness.” Defense Cites Montenegro Detention and Dual Prosecution Kwon’s attorneys argue that nearly three years in what they describe as “ brutal conditions in Montenegro ” should factor heavily into sentencing calculations. His legal team emphasizes that more extended imprisonment proves “ far greater than necessary ” to achieve justice, particularly given the substantial punishment already endured during extended foreign detention. The defense filing highlights Kwon’s agreement to forfeit over $19 million and multiple properties under the plea deal reached with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. His lawyers further note that Kwon still faces trial in South Korea for identical conduct, where prosecutors are seeking a 40-year prison term that creates additional consequences warranting consideration in the American sentence. Do Kwon seeks a five-year sentence for Terra's $40 billion collapse while facing a separate 40-year prosecution in South Korea. #DoKwon #FTX https://t.co/Ex54HALudb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 27, 2025 Prosecutors notably aren’t pursuing restitution from the millions of investors who lost $40 billion, citing the excessive complexity of determining individual losses across global markets. US authorities have indicated they will support Kwon serving the second half of his sentence in South Korea if he complies with the plea terms and qualifies under international transfer programs. Sentencing Disparities Raise Deterrence Questions The contrasting approaches to major crypto fraud cases have sparked debate over the consistency of punishment. Bankman-Fried received 25 years , plus an $11 billion restitution order, after a trial conviction on all counts, though recent reports indicate that four years were later reduced from that sentence. Kwon’s guilty plea significantly reduced his exposure despite Terra’s larger $40 billion loss compared to FTX’s $8 billion fraud. Legal experts note that federal sentencing guidelines for fraud at Terra’s magnitude would typically suggest advisory ranges approaching life imprisonment before statutory caps, making Kwon’s five-year request face steep odds. US agrees to recommend a 12-year prison sentence and a $19m fine for Do Kwon after he has pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy #DoKwon #TerraUSD https://t.co/ktCCrKzob4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 12, 2025 The Judge handling his case, Engelmayer, is known for the strict handling of financial fraud cases, and most observers expect sentences of 15 to 20 years, given the massive victim impact. The December 11 hearing will determine whether cooperation through guilty pleas significantly reduces punishment compared to trial convictions, as in Bankman-Fried’s case. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 while traveling under a fake passport, triggering a lengthy extradition battle between US and South Korean authorities. He spent nearly two years detained in the Balkan nation before being sent to America in January, where his case became one of the most closely watched legal battles in cryptocurrency’s brief history.

Butterfill’s December 5 market update affirmed that Tether maintains over $181 billion in total reserves against roughly $174.45 billion in liabilities, leaving a surplus of approximately $6.78 billion. The dismissal comes as crypto markets navigate turbulence in Japanese government bonds and softer US employment data that showed a -32,000 print versus forecasts of +10,000. Hayes sparked controversy on November 30 by arguing Tether is “ running a massive interest rate trade ” that positions the company for Federal Reserve rate cuts while exposing it to dangerous volatility through its $22.8 billion allocation to gold and Bitcoin. The Tether folks are in the early innings of running a massive interest rate trade. How I read this audit is they think the Fed will cut rates which crushes their interest income. In response, they are buying gold and $BTC that should in theory moon as the price of money falls.… pic.twitter.com/ZGhQRP4SVF — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 29, 2025 Tether CEO Counters Insolvency Claims with Financial Data CEO Paolo Ardoino swiftly refuted Hayes’s assessment with detailed disclosures showing Tether Group’s total assets reach approximately $215 billion. The executive explained that the company holds roughly $7 billion in excess equity on top of its stablecoin reserves, plus another $23 billion in retained earnings as part of Tether Group equity. Bitcoin and gold represent just 12.6% of total reserves, with over 70% held in short-term U.S. Treasuries. “ S&P made the same mistake of not considering the additional Group Equity nor the ~$500M in monthly base profits generated by U.S Treasury yields alone, ” Ardoino stated, suggesting critics are “ either bad at math or have the incentive to push our competitors. “ re: Tether FUD From latest attestation announcement (Q3 2025): ""Tether will continue to maintain a multi-billion-dollar excess reserve buffer and an overall proprietary Group equity approaching $30 billion.""

His defense followed S&P Global’s November 26 downgrade of USDT’s peg-stability rating from 4 to 5, citing increased exposure to “ high-risk ” assets and “ persistent gaps in disclosure. ” Ardoino responded defiantly, declaring, “ We wear your loathing with pride, ” while positioning Tether as “ the first overcapitalized company in the financial industry, with no toxic reserves. ” The rating action carries profound implications under MiCA regulations, which prohibit USDT from EU exchanges with a “5” rating, potentially shifting institutional liquidity toward competitors like Circle’s USDC. Industry Veterans Challenge Hayes’s Fundamental Analysis Joseph Ayoub, former head of digital asset research at Citi, noted Hayes overlooked critical distinctions between Tether’s disclosed reserves and total corporate holdings. The analyst explained that Tether maintains a separate equity balance sheet comprising mining operations and corporate reserves that aren’t publicly reported under the company’s “ matching philosophy ” for reserve disclosure. “ Tether isn’t going insolvent, quite the opposite; they own a money printing machine, ” Ayoub concluded, pointing to the company’s roughly $120 billion in interest-yielding Treasuries generating approximately 4% returns since 2023.

However, traditional institutions benefit from central bank lender-of-last-resort support that Tether lacks. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Invest, characterized Tether’s structure as “ better than fractional banking reserves, ” while CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju dismissed Hayes’s warning as motivated by trading position management. Former FT Alphaville editor Izabella Kaminska offered a deeper structural analysis, suggesting Tether’s thick equity buffer and retained earnings model creates “ a capital structure that looks a lot like the banking model academic Anat Admati advocates: much thicker equity buffers, far less leverage, and minimal maturity mismatch. “ Kaminska noted that if Tether’s depositor base proves willing to redeem directly in gold during stress situations, the metal becomes “ the natural last-resort funding asset for its shadow/grey exposures and a hard-asset substitute for the lender-of-last-resort support that banks get from central banks. ” Analysts are overlooking how stablecoins that retain earnings (aka Tether) are evolving into something structurally unusual. The reality is, as Tether’s retained earnings accumulate, they operate economically like a very thick equity buffer — far beyond the capitalisation… https://t.co/KXtsrG52kU — Izabella Kaminska (@izakaminska) November 30, 2025 This cross-border redemption channel operates without dependence on synchronized regulatory frameworks. The controversy emerges as Tether expands beyond stablecoin issuance into commodity trade lending , having deployed approximately $1.5 billion in credit across oil, cotton, wheat, and agricultural markets. The company’s Q3 attestation showed USDT issuance increased by more than $17 billion during the quarter, lifting circulating supply above $174 billion, with October figures surpassing $183 billion.

Announcing the development, Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib states that the move is part of its effort to integrate digital assets into Pakistan’s economy. Stablecoins are digital tokens whose values are always tied to fiat currencies, such as the dollar, making them more stable than the average digital assets like Bitcoin. Bin Saqib made this known as the Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, highlighting that the country has also been working on the creation of its Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Pakistan announces plans to launch its first stablecoin In his address, Bin Saqib mentioned that Pakistan sees stablecoins as one of the best ways to collateralize government debt. “We want to be at the forefront of this financial digital innovation that is happening. Why should we be at the tail-end of it when we have the muscle and the adoption?” he said. PVARA is an autonomous federal body governed by a multi-stakeholder board, including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan. Other stakeholders in the agency include the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the Federal Board of Revenue. The agency was set up to curb illicit financial activities, protect users, and unlock several opportunities lying in fintech, remittances, and tokenized assets , while enforcing shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes. According to a post on X, the Pakistan Crypto Council also noted that Bin Saqib participated in a panel discussion on the future of digital assets and emerging market regulation. “He emphazised that for countries like Pakistan, clear and innovation-friendly crypto regulation is a key driver of economic growth,” the post read. “Pakistan’s work on stablecoins, data frameworks, and banking the unbanked can become valuable case studies for the world.” Earlier this year, Bin Saqib revealed that Pakistan was working on its first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the initiative after delivering a keynote address at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 event in Las Vegas, which had in attendance several high-profile personalities who have shown support for the crypto industry. They included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. Government ramps up usage of AI In May, the Pakistani government also announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data. Meanwhile, in another report, Pakistan is set to deploy artificial intelligence to intensify its crackdown on illegal migration using fake documents. The government has also vowed to go after companies in the business of creating fake visas. In a meeting held between the Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, it was decided to make the protector issuance system better, with “reforms to be introduced in the immigration system to facilitate passengers.” The ministers asked those in charge to submit their final recommendations concerning the technology and its improvement in the next seven days. Naqvi added that an AI -based pilot application would be launched in Islamabad from January to curb illegal migration. He noted that the technology will enable authorities to determine in advance those who are eligible to travel and those who are not. Naqvi highlighted that those who attempt to travel using incomplete or fake documents would be barred. He added that there would be zero tolerance for fake visas and agents, noting that those who are deported would not be reissued new ones. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Technical indicators across multiple time frames paint a concerning picture for the cryptocurrency. Bollinger Bands on all major charts reveal why the asset continues its descent rather than finding stability. At the time of writing, XRP trades at around $2.02, indicating a 2.84% decline in the last 24 hours. Weekly losses stand at 7.4%. XRP price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The market's behaviour suggests traders are losing confidence. Each attempted rally loses steam faster than the previous one. Price movements indicate the digital asset never established a sustainable foundation above critical levels. The technical structure points toward additional downside pressure in the near term. Monthly and Weekly Charts Reveal Structural Weakness The monthly chart delivers the most telling evidence of XRP's predicament. The midband remains anchored below $2, floating between $1.82 and $1.85. This positioning indicates the market never accepted higher valuations as legitimate. The recent rally extended well beyond this zone, but failed to shift the underlying trend. The price is now gravitating back toward levels that the market considers accurate. Weekly data reinforces this bearish outlook. XRP trades beneath the midband at $2.69 and clings to the lower band near $1.94. The asset has repeatedly tested this lower boundary without producing a meaningful bounce. Previous support at $2.20-$2.30, which once served as a launching point for upward moves, now acts as resistance. The market refuses to sustain gains above this range. Source: TradingView Technical patterns show that each recovery attempt weakens progressively. This deterioration typically precedes a more forceful retest of support levels. The lower band has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure, but buying interest remains absent. Volume profiles suggest participants are unwilling to defend current prices aggressively. Daily Time Frame Confirms Bearish Momentum The daily chart tightens the case for further declines. The midband sits at approximately $2.12, a level XRP has traded below for weeks. The lower band near $1.95 has been reached multiple times without triggering sustained buying. The bands themselves are beginning to slope downward, a development that signals momentum has not reversed. Price compression near the lower band often precedes breakdowns. The bands contract when volatility decreases, then expand when a directional move emerges. Current positioning suggests the next significant move may favour sellers. Buyers have not stepped in with sufficient force to reclaim the midband, leaving the path of least resistance pointing lower. Shorter time frames fail to contradict this bearish narrative. Four-hour and hourly charts show consistent selling pressure on rallies. Resistance zones form at progressively lower levels. This pattern indicates distribution rather than accumulation. Market participants are exiting positions on any price strength.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-06 09:20:24

The core metric tells a stark story. With just 60 transactions, the Base-Solana bridge adoption rate is minimal. This isn’t merely a slow start; it’s a signal that the anticipated synergy between these two major ecosystems hasn’t materialized. According to Wu Blockchain, this data highlights a significant gap between infrastructure launch and actual user and developer engagement. Jesse Pollak, a core developer for Base, provided context. His team actively reached out to projects within the Solana ecosystem. However, not all expressed interest in building bridges. This reveals a fundamental challenge: technical connectivity does not guarantee community or economic alignment. The Developer Divide: A Clash of Visions? The reaction from Solana’s co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, adds another layer. He suggested that Solana developers would only find value once applications from Base fully migrate and operate on the Solana network. This perspective points to a deeper narrative. Different Goals: Base may seek liquidity and users from Solana, while Solana seeks full application migration. Ecosystem Loyalty: Developers often build deeply within one ecosystem, making cross-chain moves complex. Technical Hurdles: Bridging assets is one thing; ensuring seamless composability and user experience is another. Therefore, the Base-Solana bridge isn’t just underused; it’s caught between two powerful ecosystems with potentially competing visions for interoperability. What Does This Mean for Crypto Interoperability? This situation serves as a real-world case study. It shows that building the bridge is only the first step. Success depends on compelling use cases, economic incentives, and genuine collaboration between communities. A bridge with no traffic is merely architecture. For users and investors, the low activity on the Base-Solana bridge suggests caution. It indicates that the promised fluid movement of assets and value between these chains is not yet a reality. The market has voted with its absence, waiting for a clearer reason to cross. Conclusion: A Bridge Waiting for Its Reason The story of the Base-Solana bridge is a reminder that in crypto, technology alone cannot drive adoption. It requires community buy-in, aligned incentives, and solving a real user pain point. While the bridge stands ready, its future hinges on whether developers and users find a compelling reason to make the journey. For now, it remains a quiet path between two bustling metropolises, awaiting its first major wave of travelers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Base-Solana bridge? It is a cross-chain bridge allowing users to transfer assets between Coinbase’s Base network and the Solana blockchain. Why are there only 60 transactions on the bridge? Low adoption is likely due to a lack of immediate use cases, insufficient developer incentives, and differing strategic goals between the two ecosystems. What did Solana’s co-founder say about the bridge? Anatoly Yakovenko indicated that value for Solana developers would come when Base applications migrate fully to run on the Solana network, not just from asset bridging. Does this mean the bridge has failed? It’s too early to declare failure. However, the extremely low initial usage highlights significant challenges that need to be addressed for the bridge to become viable. Should I use the Base-Solana bridge? Given the low liquidity and activity, users should exercise caution and thoroughly research current risks and supported assets before using the bridge. Found this analysis insightful?

The number of transfers of DOGE above $1 million is down to merely four, compared with a recent high of 38, which is the lowest point achieved in two months. This pause in whale activity mirrors the testing of the critical level of $0.14 for the third time this year, a pattern that often precedes a breakdown. As Dogecoin struggles with keeping this level intact, its weakness might cause a sharp fall of as much as 25 percent, likely extending its struggles in registering any appreciable increase as more participants seek other, emergent DeFi crypto coins. Dogecoin Price Analysis At this juncture, the prevailing Dogecoin forecast is greatly impacted by the absence of whale activity, which hurts the potency of any form of priced-based turnaround. With the Relative Strength Index showing strong negative momentum as well as the instrument currently being valued at 31.5% below its 200-day exponential moving average, the direction of least resistance seems to be negative. In the past, any form of a Dogecoin turnaround required the pricing to move more than 40% below this critical juncture, so further decreases in the token appear likely before any form of turnaround can begin. Such realities are causing individuals seeking the top cryptocurrencies for investment purposes to alter their focus, with many individuals now focusing their attention on the presale phases of utility-based platforms that still offer entry benefits. This search will often come across Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin, whose presale speed is in extreme contrast with that of DOGE. Currently, the project’s Phase 6 is already 95% sold out, showing intense interest in this project that qualifies MUTM as one of the top picks for those investors seeking the crypto to buy now for long term gains. Momentum in the Mutuum Finance Presale The fast-paced sell-out of Mutuum Finance’s Phase 6 offers a closely time-constrained investment opportunity. Currently priced at $0.035, this figure has already seen a 250% increase from the initial phase launch. With this phase largely sold, the time-sensitive investment opportunity in purchasing the tokens at this rate is soon coming to a close, as Phase 7 will begin with a price of $0.04. Having already amassed a presale value of $19,150,000 with the addition of 18,330 holders, this clearly represents the presale’s popularity. With the launch value established as $0.06, purchases will see a 450% profit, clearly establishing that an investment in MUTM is necessary, as delays will see investment in possibly one of the most fresh, new cryptocurrencies of the season being missed. Dual Lending Mutuum Finance establishes a foundation that focuses on security and innovation. The DeFi solution proposed by this project is being tested through a thorough independent audit carried out by Halborn Security, with the latter assessing the primary lending/borrowing smart contracts. In the midst of such turbulence raging within traditional assets such as Dogecoin, the dominant sentiment remains geared towards projects that are well-structured with well-articulated routes for expansion. Mutuum Finance is one such project, as its value chain is sufficiently exemplified within a well-articulated presale stage. This presale stage remains a defining point for any investor seeking a list of top cryptocurrencies.

55421448,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=873900,1765013407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55421448.jpeg,RWA tokenization faces pushback from Chinese industry groups,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinese-groups-warn-against-rwa-tokenization/,"Mainland Chinese industry groups have collectively issued a warning to providers of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization after the government’s stringent regulations. This move crushed hopes that Beijing would relax regulations on digital assets due to competition with the United States. The groups highlighted several risks associated with tokenizing real-world assets, including fake assets, business failures, and speculative trading. In a notice, seven industry organizations, including the National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association, and the Securities Association of China, stated that the Chinese authorities did not approve any of the activities mentioned above. These associations conduct their operations under the oversight of regulators such as the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Meanwhile, it is worth noting that this recently issued warning is the first warning from the industry since Chinese authorities began focusing on RWA tokenization. The process involves creating digital representations of traditional assets on a blockchain, a method designed to enable faster and cheaper transactions. China strictly warns against the trade of digital assets in the country Chinese officials have recently stressed their strict approach towards the crypto ecosystem. This emphasis has led many to abandon hopes that Beijing might ease its negative stance on digital assets. According to their expectations, these individuals anticipated that China could follow the lead of the US after its policymakers became more supportive of the cryptocurrency industry. But as speculation grew that China might gradually embrace digital assets, new reports revealed that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), along with the public security ministry, cyberspace administration, the top court, and other major regulators, stated last week that stablecoins fail to meet the mainland’s client identification and anti-money-laundering requirements. Regarding the warning issued on RWA tokenization, industry groups cautioned that their member firms should not be involved in the issuance or trade of cryptocurrencies and tokenized real-world assets in China. They were also warned against providing related services to customers who are willing to participate in these activities. While China warns against cryptocurrency trading, Hong Kong embraces its goal of becoming a regulated hub for this expanding asset class. This difference in decision has ignited new worries among investors. Considering the intense nature of the situation, Andrew Fei, a partner at King & Wood Mallesons law firm in Hong Kong, weighed in on the matter. He argued that this notice has a major impact across borders. Fei also pointed out that the associations stated that foreign firms offering cryptocurrency and tokenized RWA activities services, either directly or indirectly, would be viewed as involving themselves in illegal financial activities. Moreover, the notice highlighted that employees in China working for these foreign service providers could face legal consequences. This situation implied that RWA providers needed to fully separate themselves from the mainland Chinese market, according to an analysis released on Friday, December 5, by Liu Honglin, founder of the Mankun law firm in Shanghai, which specialized in blockchain issues. Hong Kong positions itself as a hub for digital assets Following China’s stringent regulations on crypto trading, several firms from mainland China, including financial and tech companies, have initiated RWA projects in Hong Kong this year. This is due to the favorable crypto regulations in the region, as it seeks to solidify its position as a hub for digital assets. However, these firms stayed out of the spotlight since the CSRC had urged Chinese brokerages in September this year to stop their RWA initiatives in the city. Meanwhile, one of the most recent developments emerged from a Hong Kong branch of China Merchants Bank. This branch has reportedly tokenized a $3.5 billion money market fund on BNB Chain , the blockchain established by Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. At the same time, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is running the tokenization sandbox for Project Ensemble This update was made public after Ant Group chairman Eric Jing Xiandong released a statement in November during Hong Kong Fintech Week. In his statement, he mentioned that through this sandbox, they utilized tokenized bank deposits to allow real-time settlement between banks. On the other hand, it is worth noting that Ant Group is a division of Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the Post. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Originally scheduled to end on December 4th, the event will now continue as a fully enhanced Boost Phase , running until the DEX officially launches—tentatively set for January. During the initial campaign, users earned 1 MaxPack for every 10 transactions executed on the MemeCore network. Each MaxPack includes the opportunity to unlock up to USD $1,000,000 in rewards , with the overall incentive pool designed to remain uncapped , allowing rewards to scale as participation increases. A MemeMax spokesperson said: “The response to the MaxPack campaign exceeded every expectation we had. The 400% spike in MemeCore network activity shows that users are not just anticipating the launch—they are actively preparing for it.” Boost Phase Extends Event with Higher Reward Opportunities With the shift into the Boost Phase, the MaxPack event is now operating with increased win probabilities and strengthened incentives , giving both existing and new participants more opportunities to accumulate MaxPacks before launch. The extension is intended to carry the current momentum directly into MemeMax’s debut month. MaxPack and MemeMax Launch: A Connected Incentive Loop Once the Perp DEX goes live in January, users will be able to unlock their MaxPack rewards through trading activity on the MemeMax platform . This mechanism aligns platform growth with community activity and is seen by analysts as a more sustainable alternative to traditional one-time airdrop structures. The integration ensures that MaxPack holders form a highly engaged initial user base, directly contributing to early liquidity and market activity. MemeMax as the Core Trading Layer of the Meme 2.0 Ecosystem MemeMax is positioned as a foundational element of the broader Meme 2.0 vision , serving as the primary trading hub for emerging Meme-native assets. It will operate in conjunction with other tools within the MemeCore ecosystem, providing an interconnected infrastructure built specifically for viral memecoin culture. Market observers note that the combination of the MaxPack Boost Phase, MemeCore’s 400% activity spike, and the upcoming January launch has created one of the strongest pre-launch momentum curves in the memecoin sector. The MemeMax team commented: “We’re finalizing the launch experience based on the insights gained from the MaxPack campaign. Our goal is a high-energy debut where user engagement and platform growth reinforce each other from day one.” As January approaches, industry attention is sharply focused on MemeMax, now regarded as one of the most anticipated Perp DEX launches in the memecoin landscape. About MemeMax MemeMax is a next-generation PerpDEX that merges the speed, transparency, and composability of DeFi with the culture-driven energy of Web3.

PEPE is up 2.11% in the last 24 hours, trading around $0.000004869 as buyers defend a key support area. After another sharp move, traders are watching whether this bounce can hold or turn into just one more short-lived spike. For many, the current setup looks less like an early moonshot and more like a mature meme asset trying to hold its range. That is why some holders who caught earlier moves are quietly taking profits and looking at fresher opportunities with clearer upside, such as Noomez Coin. Pepe Coin Price Today: Key Data Points Key stats for the Pepe crypto price today : Market cap: $2.04 billion Price: $0.000004869 24-hour change: 11.36 percent 24-hour volume: $440.29 million The volume/market cap ratio: 21.54 percent Total and circulating supply: 420.68 trillion PEPE Holders: 495.43 thousand The combination of a huge supply and nearly two billion dollars in market cap means it now takes massive volume for PEPE to move further. The wide trading range and high volume indicate that speculation remains active, but each new rally faces greater resistance as more traders lock in gains. Why PEPE’s Support Zone Matters Now The support area that PEPE is retesting has already acted as a floor several times. Each time the price dips into this zone, buyers step in, yet the follow-through has been weaker compared to earlier phases of the rally. Short-term traders are treating bounces as chances to take profit, while long-term holders are waiting for clearer confirmation before adding more. Analysts at Gold Trade Signals note that this behavior is typical when a meme coin matures into a large-cap: volatility remains high, but the explosive upside starts to fade. That does not mean PEPE is finished. It just means that for people looking for the next move, it may no longer be the most obvious answer among high-potential meme plays. From PEPE Gains to Noomez Coin: Why Some Traders Rotate As Pepe Coin price today behaves more like a heavy large-cap, some traders are moving part of their profits into earlier-stage projects. One name that keeps coming up is Noomez Coin (NNZ), a meme coin presale still in its discount phase. Noomez has a total supply of 280 billion Noomez $NNZ , of which 140 billion are reserved for a 28-stage presale. Each stage has a fixed price, and any unsold tokens at that level are burned before the next one opens. The current stage is priced at $0.0000283 , while the planned launch target sits at $0.0028 . Every time a stage sells out, the entry price rises and never returns to its old level, creating urgency without relying solely on sudden chart spikes. Why Noomez Coin Appeals to Early Stage Hunters Noomez goes beyond simple stage pricing. Every presale round includes a Stage X Million draw where anyone who spends at least $20 receives one ticket, and one wallet wins X million NNZ for that stage. Stage 14 and Stage 28 unlock Noom Vaults with extra token drops, NFTs, USDT rewards, and the first Noom Engine partner reveal. On top of that, Noom Rewards staking offers APY up to 66% during the presale window, and a 10% referral bonus rewards both the referrer and the new buyer. Team wallets are vested, and liquidity is planned to be locked at launch, which gives extra reassurance to traders who have seen too many chaotic meme launches. For traders who caught the recent move in PEPE and are now asking what to do next, splitting gains between a mature meme like PEPE and an early-stage structured presale like Noomez is one way to stay exposed to the sector while still hunting for asymmetric upside.

Buenos Aires approves payment of taxes with crypto The official Dogecoin handle posted “Doge is everywhere,” highlighting its ever-expanding real-world utility. The development also marks another major milestone for the project, which started as an internet joke and has now gained practical applications in several projects and countries. In addition, it has amassed a big follower base, with famous Tesla billionaire CEO Elon Musk still solidly supporting the project. According to the report, residents are also allowed to use other supported digital assets to fulfill their municipal obligations. The new policy removes the challenges that citizens face when making payments using traditional means, providing them with faster alternative methods for settling their government-related expenses. In addition, city officials claim the program was designed to modernize financial infrastructure and attract tech-focused businesses to the country. Buenos Aires has been pursuing several initiatives as the Argentine capital continues to make moves to establish itself as a crypto-friendly city. Last month, Binance announced that it had signed a collaboration agreement with officials from the Buenos Aires city government. As part of the partnership, Binance will help the government promote safe and responsible cryptocurrency adoption among residents in the city, helping them make better crypto choices. In addition, the city of Buenos Aires and Binance announced the launch of “Live Crypto in Your City,” an educational awareness campaign. The initiative informs residents about cryptocurrency and its fundamentals. In addition, it also sought to educate residents about secure usage practices. Campaign materials emphasize practical use cases for digital assets, helping residents understand how digital assets can be used as a financial tool. Countries in a race for crypto adoption The educational push comes at a time when countries worldwide are in a crypto adoption race. While some are looking for ways to further crypto adoption in their countries, some are looking at ways to regulate the adoption to save citizens from falling prey to bad actors. Buenos Aires officials believe that users can make better decisions about digital assets if they are informed. They also believe that the program will address common misconceptions and security concerns about crypto. Buenos Aires is not the only region looking to enjoy the benefit of crypto and its accompanying technologies, with Japan recently hinting that it could anchor its national digital ID infrastructure on XRPL , a technology built by crypto firm Ripple Labs. The country feels the move could reshape finance, improve compliance, and help the country’s emerging tokenized economy. Japan has been moving towards a tokenized economy as government agencies continue to test blockchain-based asset issuance. According to analysts, this development could cement XRPL as Japan’s foundational layer for digital assets, identity verification, and regulatory compliance. It will also set a local precedent as one of the first national-scale deployments of zero-knowledge technology on a public blockchain. In addition, it could also boost the adoption of Ripple’s technology, increasing investor confidence and reinforcing XRP’s role in the crypto market.

According to on-chain analysis, this transaction aligns perfectly with the company's past purchasing patterns. This week alone, Bitmine purchased 97,650 ETH, bringing its current holdings to $12 billion and becoming a major company holding 3.16% of the Ethereum supply. Bitmine president Tom Lee attracted attention by saying in his speech at Binance Blockchain Week that Ethereum could reach $62,000 in the coming months. Related News: Famous CEO Reveals Bitcoin Price Prediction for 2026 “Ethereum is having its 1971 moment this year,” Lee said, comparing Ethereum’s current trajectory to the breakout periods in U.S. financial history.

55422017,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91525,1765015231,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Analysis: This $0.035 New Altcoin Could Jump 1,000% Towards Q1 2027",https://timestabloid.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-analysis-this-0-035-new-altcoin/,"A new altcoin is starting to attract attention across the market, and the numbers suggest its early stage might not stay quiet for long. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits at $0.035, yet some analysts believe it could climb far higher as its roadmap begins turning into real products. With Phase 6 of the presale almost complete and new holders joining daily, the project is entering a moment where momentum could accelerate, especially if broader cryptocurrency prices stay strong. The next few months may decide whether this token becomes one of the top cryptocurrencies heading into Q1 2027. Presale Progress and What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at $0.01. Since then, interest has grown steadily, raising $19.1 million with more than 18,300 holders and over 810 million tokens sold. Out of the 4 billion total token supply, about 1.82 billion tokens are allocated to the presale, meaning nearly half the future circulating supply will come from early participants. Mutuum Finance is building a DeFi lending protocol with two connected markets. The Peer-to-Contract market lets users supply assets like ETH or USDT into a liquidity pool. They receive mtTokens as a receipt, and those mtTokens grow in value as borrowers pay interest. The system creates natural APY growth powered by real borrowing activity instead of fixed yield promises. The Peer-to-Peer market gives borrowers direct access to flexible rates determined by liquidity in the pool. When liquidity is high, borrowing costs stay lower. When liquidity tightens, rates rise to attract more deposits. Borrowers must also maintain safe LTV levels. If collateral falls below the required threshold, liquidations occur, where liquidators buy discounted collateral to repay part of the loan. This keeps the protocol balanced and protects overall liquidity. With Phase 6 now over 98% filled, urgency continues to build as the current price is close to shifting upward again. V1 Launch, mtTokens, and the Buy-and-Distribute Model Mutuum Finance confirmed on its official X account that the first version of the lending protocol is scheduled for the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The V1 rollout includes the liquidity pool, mtTokens, a debt-token system, a liquidator bot, and ETH and USDT as initial supported assets. This gives the project a functional foundation before mainnet expansion. The mtToken system plays a central role in Mutuum Finance. As borrowers pay interest, mtTokens increase in value over time. This rewards suppliers naturally, without artificial inflation. With more borrowing demand, mtToken growth becomes stronger, which can attract long-term users who want predictable yield tied to real protocol activity. The token also has a buy-and-distribute mechanism built into its economic model. A portion of platform revenue will be used to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens are redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This creates steady buy pressure and rewards long-term participation. Some analysts believe this mechanism could help support price growth once the token begins trading on major exchanges. Market commentators suggest that if the platform launches as planned and earns early traction, MUTM could experience rapid appreciation during its first year. Some analysts believe that if borrowing demand rises alongside general crypto investment activity, MUTM could join the list of fast-growing DeFi assets and potentially follow the path seen by tokens like Aave in their early years. Analyst Forecasts Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a USD-pegged stablecoin that is minted and burned on demand. The interest repaid by borrowers will help support the stablecoin’s backing and improve liquidity throughout the platform. This gives Mutuum Finance another revenue source and strengthens its lending ecosystem. Layer-2 deployment is also part of the roadmap. As more users shift toward low-fee networks, Mutuum Finance plans to expand to chains such as Arbitrum, Base, and others. This could give MUTM access to deeper liquidity, more users, and better borrowing markets once the protocol is live. Accurate pricing is vital for liquidations, so Mutuum Finance will rely on Chainlink data feeds along with fallback oracles for safety. The project’s oracle design also includes aggregated feeds and on-chain DEX pricing where liquidity is strong enough. This is important because liquidation timing affects the health of the entire lending market. When analysts model future scenarios, they often blend revenue growth, L2 expansion, stablecoin adoption, and exchange listings. Some analysts believe that if market conditions remain bullish, MUTM could jump between 600% and 1,000% heading into Q1 2027. Early investor sentiment indicates that the $0.035 price feels undervalued for a project preparing a live lending platform, especially with a confirmed beta timeline and active audits. Security Audit, Bug Bounty, and the 24-Hour Leaderboard Security is a core part of Mutuum Finance’s public communication. The project completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score, and Halborn Security is now reviewing the lending and borrowing smart contracts. The team also launched a $50K bug bounty aimed specifically at finding code vulnerabilities. This increases confidence for new users entering the ecosystem. Every day, Mutuum Finance runs a 24-hour leaderboard, where the top contributor receives $500 in MUTM. This helps maintain steady interest and is one of the reasons presale activity has remained consistent. When the treasury grows sharply within a short window, such as a $100K jump in less than a day, many market watchers view this as a sign of whale interest and rising confidence. Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of the best crypto to buy now among early-stage DeFi launches. With the presale nearly moving to its next stage, a confirmed testnet release, buy pressure built into the token model, and analysts modeling steep upside, the project sits at a crucial moment. If the platform launches smoothly and the market stays strong, Mutuum Finance could enter Q1 2027 with momentum that pushes it far beyond its current price. The window at $0.035 will not stay open for long, especially with Phase 6 almost fully allocated and the next stage approaching.

Key Takeaways: MetaMask has integrated Polymarket, allowing users to trade real-world event outcomes. The integration adds one-tap funding from any EVM chain. Polymarket’s rapid growth continues amid a potential $15 billion valuation. “You can now trade on the future outcome of real world events inside your wallet,” Consensys’ Gabriela Helfet wrote , adding that users will also earn MetaMask Rewards points for every prediction placed. MetaMask Becomes New Gateway to Polymarket With One-Tap Funding The integration creates a new on-ramp for Polymarket and introduces “one tap funding,” allowing users to deposit with any token from any EVM-compatible chain. The move further tightens the link between everyday crypto wallets and decentralized betting platforms, positioning MetaMask as a gateway not only to Web3 apps but also to real-world event speculation. Polymarket has surged in popularity over the past year, fueled in part by heightened attention during the 2024 US election cycle. Former President Donald Trump’s embrace of crypto and a more relaxed regulatory climate helped push the platform back into the US market. The company is now reportedly exploring a valuation of up to $15 billion, following a $2 billion strategic investment from Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the NYSE. Predicting on MetaMask only takes a few seconds.

In October, it launched multichain accounts that support both EVM and non-EVM networks, including Solana. The wallet is also preparing for the rollout of a native MASK token , as parent company Consensys gears up for a potential IPO . The move comes as Polymarket is recruiting staff for an internal market-making team that would trade against its own customers, mirroring a controversial feature already used by rival Kalshi that has drawn criticism and legal challenges. As reported, the New York-based prediction market startup has approached traders, including sports bettors, to join the new unit, people familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity because the plans remain private. Prediction Markets Hit $13B in Record Activity Prediction markets have crossed $13 billion in cumulative trading volume, marking a record high even as broader crypto markets cool. The surge has drawn in major players across tech and finance, including Fanatics, Coinbase, and MetaMask, all of which have recently launched or expanded event-trading platforms. Against this backdrop, YZi Labs, the venture firm founded by Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, has been intensifying its involvement in the sector. YZi-backed Opinion has emerged as one of the most surprising breakout platforms. Launched on BNB Chain in October, it recorded nearly $1.5 billion in weekly trading volume within its first month, briefly overtaking established names such as Kalshi and Polymarket. Meanwhile, prediction markets platform Kalshi has secured a major media breakthrough after signing a partnership with CNN, making the company the network’s official prediction markets partner while closing a $1 billion funding round at an $11 billion valuation.

Today, meme coins have grown massively and became an important niche in the crypto space. But how can you start trading meme coins, and which exchanges best fit your needs? This guide will help you select the best crypto exchange for meme coin trading. Why Meme Coin Exchanges Matter Explosive Growth of Meme Coins in 2025 Meme coins have seen explosive growth in 2025. The total market cap of meme coins has been moving between $60 billion and $90 billion, with a market dominance of 5% to 7% of the total crypto market cap. This growth has been driven by popular launchpads like Pump.fun, Jupiter, and other initiatives launched by exchanges like Binance, OKX, and others. Moreover, the endorsement from public figures like Elon Musk helped introduce meme coins to the masses. Dogecoin inspired Musk to create the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after joining President Trump in curbing U.S. government spending. The number of deployed meme coins on launchpads like Pump.fun is in the tens of millions. The meme coin space is a revenue gusher for exchanges and dApps, bringing billions of dollars in fees. Importance of Liquidity and Speed for Meme Coin Traders Deep liquidity and speed are important for meme coin traders. Deep liquidity facilitates buying and selling large volumes of meme coins without affecting the price or experiencing slippage. Speed, on the other hand, is important to catch opportunities when there is a social media trend or market sentiment change. It’s essential for traders to act fast and lock in profits. Centralized vs Decentralized Access — Which Fits You? Meme coins are listed on a variety of decentralized and centralized exchanges. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the playground for newly launched meme coins. They’re ideal for seasoned traders with an appetite for risk. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) provide access to well-established meme coins with deep liquidity. Trading meme coins on CEXs has minimal risk and fast execution. Some CEXs list new meme coins after a rigorous vetting process. Key Factors We Considered Here are the factors we considered before selecting the top exchanges for trading meme coins. Liquidity and Trading Volume Meme coins with deep liquidity and high trading volume provide healthy markets. An exchange with deep order books indicates an abundance of buyers and sellers. A high trading volume means the meme coin moves between traders frequently. Deep liquidity and high trading volumes mean traders can buy and sell meme coins without spillage or price shocks. The chances of losing funds and “holding the bag” are slim. Meme Coin Listings (Variety and New Tokens) An exchange with a variety of meme coins and new listings is favorable. New token listings provide early access and new opportunities. Clear listing criteria, such as smart contract audits and community vetting, attract traders. An exchange with known meme coins and new tokens provides flexibility. Traders can safely bet on established meme coins or buy newly listed tokens with high-risk, high-reward outcomes. Fees and Spreads Flexible trading fees and tight spreads are favorable for meme coin markets, especially for frequent traders. High maker/taker fees can eat into gains, while wider price spreads are risky and can lead to greater losses. An exchange with a variety of trading accounts, tiered maker/taker fees, and tight spreads is ideal. It provides meme coin traders with better cost efficiency and more room to maximize profits on every trade. Security and Reputation Meme coins are volatile. Trading on a secure exchange with strong infrastructure is more important than low fees. The past failures of CEXs, especially during hacks or market crashes, have made traders more wary. Selecting an exchange with regular audits, cold storage, compliance, and periodic proof-of-reserve (POR) reports is important. An exchange with a good reputation is determined by positive user reviews and strong customer support. These qualities build trust when trading volatile meme coins. User Experience and Availability Trading on an exchange with a smooth user experience (UX) design is vital. A clean layout and an intuitive user interface (UI) make it easy to buy, sell, deposit, and withdraw meme coins. Access to a responsive web or mobile app gives traders the freedom to trade 24/7. CEXs with an application programming interface (API) attract whales and advanced users to automate trades in large volumes. Regulatory and Geographic Access A fully regulated crypto exchange provides a risk-free trading experience for users. Licensed CEXs with clear geographic access are better options than exchanges operating in a gray area. A regulated CEX also enforces anti–money laundering (AML) policies and meets compliance requirements. Selecting an unregulated or non-compliant exchange could limit withdrawals or lead to account termination. Top 10 Exchanges for Meme Coin Trading (2025 Edition) 1.

With ongoing legal battles, growing institutional adoption, and evolving market dynamics, understanding XRP’s price trajectory requires careful analysis. This comprehensive guide examines the factors that could propel XRP to new heights or present significant challenges on its journey to $5. What Is Ripple XRP and Why Does It Matter? Ripple XRP represents more than just another cryptocurrency—it’s a bridge currency designed for fast, low-cost international payments. Unlike Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system, XRP uses a consensus protocol that validates transactions in seconds with minimal energy consumption. This technological advantage positions XRP as a practical solution for financial institutions seeking efficient cross-border transactions. The ongoing development of Ripple’s payment network and partnerships with major banks create a foundation for potential growth that could significantly impact XRP price prediction models. XRP Price Prediction 2025: The Critical Year 2025 represents a pivotal moment for XRP’s trajectory. Analysts project that if Ripple secures favorable regulatory clarity and expands its institutional partnerships, XRP could reach between $1.50 and $2.50. Several factors will influence this outcome: Resolution of the SEC lawsuit and resulting regulatory clarity Increased adoption by financial institutions for cross-border payments Overall cryptocurrency market conditions and Bitcoin’s performance Technological developments within the Ripple ecosystem The most optimistic scenarios suggest that a perfect storm of positive developments could push XRP toward the higher end of this range, while regulatory setbacks could limit gains. XRP 2026-2030: The Long-Term Vision Looking beyond 2025, XRP’s potential becomes even more intriguing. By 2030, several analysts believe XRP could challenge the $5 threshold if certain conditions align: Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Optimistic Prediction 2026 $1.80 $2.50 $3.20 2027 $2.20 $3.00 $4.00 2028 $2.60 $3.50 $4.50 2029 $3.00 $4.00 $5.00 2030 $3.50 $4.50 $6.00+ These projections assume continued adoption of Ripple’s technology, favorable regulatory environments in major markets, and overall growth in the cryptocurrency sector. The path to $5 requires consistent progress across multiple fronts. Will XRP Reach $5? The Key Factors The question of whether XRP will reach $5 dominates cryptocurrency discussions. Several critical elements will determine the answer: Regulatory Resolution: The outcome of Ripple’s legal battles with the SEC will either unlock institutional investment or create ongoing uncertainty. Institutional Adoption: More banks and payment providers integrating Ripple’s technology would increase XRP’s utility and demand. Market Sentiment: Cryptocurrency markets remain influenced by broader economic conditions and investor psychology. Technological Advancements: Improvements to the XRP Ledger and related infrastructure could enhance its competitive position. Competitive Landscape: The emergence of alternative solutions for cross-border payments could impact XRP’s market share. While $5 represents a significant increase from current levels, historical cryptocurrency rallies demonstrate that such movements are possible under the right conditions. Ripple XRP Challenges and Opportunities Every investment carries both risks and potential rewards. For XRP, the regulatory uncertainty represents the most significant immediate challenge. The ongoing SEC case has created a cloud of uncertainty that affects institutional adoption and price stability. Additionally, competition from other blockchain payment solutions and central bank digital currencies could pressure XRP’s market position. Conversely, XRP’s opportunities are substantial. The global cross-border payment market represents trillions of dollars annually, and even capturing a small percentage could dramatically increase XRP’s utility and value. Ripple’s existing partnerships with financial institutions provide a foundation for expansion, while technological advantages in speed and cost could prove decisive as digital payments evolve. Actionable Insights for XRP Investors Navigating XRP investment requires strategy rather than speculation. Consider these approaches: Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio rather than concentrating solely on XRP Monitor regulatory developments, particularly regarding the SEC case resolution Research Ripple’s quarterly reports and partnership announcements Consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks Set clear investment goals and risk parameters before entering positions Remember that all cryptocurrency investments carry substantial risk, and predictions represent possibilities rather than guarantees. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for XRP The journey toward $5 for XRP will likely be complex and nonlinear. While the potential exists for significant growth, particularly if regulatory clarity emerges and adoption accelerates, investors must remain aware of the substantial risks and uncertainties. The coming years will test Ripple’s technology, business model, and ability to navigate regulatory landscapes across multiple jurisdictions. Whether XRP reaches $5 depends not just on market forces but on the fundamental value it delivers to the global financial system.

Most altcoins have followed suit, with almost all charts deep in the red today. ZEC and CC lead on the way south. BTC Below $90K The new month began on the wrong foot yet again for the largest cryptocurrency. The asset had recovered some ground following the November crash and stood above $91,000. However, the bears returned on Monday and initiated a violent leg down that drove BTC to just under $84,000. After losing more than seven grand in hours, bitcoin bounced off almost as quickly and reclaimed the $90,000 line by Tuesday. Moreover, it kept climbing in the following days and challenged the $94,000 resistance on a couple of occasions. However, it couldn’t penetrate that level, and the subsequent retracement drove it to the $91,000-$92,000 range. That was until Friday, when the bears took control of the market again after the release of the US PCE and Core PCE data. BTC dumped to $88,000 in minutes, dragging the altcoins with it and triggering $500 million in liquidations. It has bounced since then, but it’s still below $90,000 as of press time. Its market cap has dropped to $1.8 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands above 57% on CG. BTCUSD Dec 6. Source: TradingView Alts In Red Most larger-cap alts are in the red as well today. Ethereum is inches above $3,000 after a 3.4% decline, while XRP is close to breaking below $2.00 after another 2% drop. SOL, ADA, LINK, HYPE, DOGE, and XLM are with losses of up to 5%, while SUI, ENA, PEPE, UNI, and DOT have dropped by 6-7%. Even more profound losses come from ZEC and CC, both of which have dumped by double digits. In contrast, BCH and TRX have posted minor gains. The total crypto market cap has shed around $60 billion in a day and is down to $3.130 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview December 6.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are watching Cardano with intense interest. The burning question on everyone’s mind: can ADA reach the coveted $2 mark in the coming years? This comprehensive analysis examines Cardano price predictions from 2025 through 2030, exploring the technical developments, market dynamics, and expert forecasts that will shape ADA’s journey. Understanding Cardano’s Current Position Cardano stands as one of the most researched and methodically developed blockchain platforms in the cryptocurrency space. Founded by Charles Hoskinson , one of Ethereum’s co-founders, Cardano has built its reputation on peer-reviewed research and scientific philosophy. Unlike many projects that prioritize speed over security, Cardano has taken a deliberate approach to development, which has both frustrated some investors and impressed others with its thoroughness. The current ADA price reflects a complex interplay of factors. Market sentiment, technological milestones, regulatory developments, and broader cryptocurrency trends all influence where Cardano stands today. As we look toward 2025 and beyond, understanding these foundational elements becomes crucial for making informed predictions. Cardano Price Prediction 2025: The First Major Test 2025 represents a critical year for Cardano’s price trajectory. Several key developments could significantly impact ADA’s valuation: Hydra Scaling Solution: Full implementation of Hydra, Cardano’s layer-2 scaling solution, could dramatically increase transaction throughput DeFi Ecosystem Growth: Expansion of decentralized finance applications on Cardano Institutional Adoption: Increased interest from traditional financial institutions Regulatory Clarity: Potential clearer cryptocurrency regulations in major markets Most analysts suggest a conservative Cardano price prediction for 2025 ranges between $1.20 and $1.80. However, if market conditions align favorably with technological milestones, some experts believe ADA could test the $2 threshold by year’s end. The key determining factors will be adoption rates of Cardano-based applications and overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. ADA Price Forecast 2026-2027: Building Momentum Looking further ahead to 2026 and 2027, Cardano’s price potential becomes even more intriguing. By this period, many of the platform’s core upgrades should be fully operational, potentially positioning ADA for significant growth. Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Optimistic Prediction 2026 $1.50 – $2.00 $2.00 – $2.50 $2.50 – $3.00 2027 $2.00 – $2.75 $2.75 – $3.50 $3.50 – $4.50 Several factors could drive ADA price upward during this period. First, network effects from a mature DeFi and NFT ecosystem could create substantial demand for ADA tokens. Second, interoperability features allowing Cardano to communicate with other blockchains might expand its utility. Third, potential partnerships with governments or large corporations for identity solutions or supply chain management could validate Cardano’s real-world applications. Cardano Future: The 2028-2030 Outlook Long-term predictions always carry more uncertainty, but examining Cardano’s trajectory through 2030 reveals fascinating possibilities. By this timeframe, blockchain technology should be more integrated into global systems, and Cardano’s research-driven approach might position it well for enterprise adoption. For the Cardano future between 2028 and 2030, predictions vary widely: Conservative Scenario: $3.00 – $5.00 range, assuming steady but not explosive growth Moderate Scenario: $5.00 – $8.00 range, based on substantial adoption in developing economies Optimistic Scenario: $8.00 – $12.00+ range, if Cardano becomes a foundational layer for global systems The most bullish Cardano price predictions for 2030 suggest that if the platform successfully implements its vision of becoming a “financial operating system” for the unbanked and underbanked populations, particularly in developing nations, ADA could see unprecedented demand. However, this outcome depends on numerous variables, including technological execution, regulatory environments, and competitive dynamics. Will ADA Price Hit $2? The Critical Analysis The question of whether ADA will reach $2 dominates Cardano discussions. Based on current trajectories and planned developments, reaching $2 appears not just possible but probable within our timeframe. However, the timing remains uncertain. Key factors that could accelerate ADA’s journey to $2 include: Successful implementation of all planned technological upgrades Significant growth in total value locked (TVL) in Cardano DeFi protocols Major partnerships or enterprise adoption announcements Favorable regulatory developments in key markets Broader cryptocurrency bull market conditions Conversely, challenges that might delay or prevent ADA from reaching $2 include intense competition from other smart contract platforms, potential security vulnerabilities (despite Cardano’s rigorous approach), regulatory crackdowns in major economies, or broader economic conditions that depress cryptocurrency markets generally. Risks and Considerations for Cardano Investors While Cardano price predictions provide valuable guidance, prudent investors must consider several risks: Development Delays: Cardano’s methodical approach sometimes results in slower implementation than competitors Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and subject to rapid sentiment shifts Regulatory Uncertainty: Changing regulations could impact Cardano’s adoption and utility Competition: Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and other platforms compete for similar use cases Technological Challenges: Unforeseen technical issues could emerge despite rigorous testing Successful investment in ADA requires balancing optimism about Cardano’s potential with realistic assessment of these challenges. Diversification across different cryptocurrency assets and traditional investments remains a wise strategy. Actionable Insights for ADA Investors Based on our Cardano price prediction analysis, here are practical steps for interested investors: Dollar-Cost Average: Consider regular, smaller investments rather than timing the market Monitor Development Progress: Follow Cardano’s GitHub repositories and official announcements Understand the Technology: Learn about Cardano’s proof-of-stake mechanism and governance model Watch Ecosystem Growth: Track metrics like number of projects building on Cardano and TVL in DeFi protocols Stay Informed on Regulations: Follow regulatory developments in major markets like the US, EU, and Asia Remember that all price predictions involve uncertainty. While our analysis suggests Cardano has strong potential, particularly for the long-term investor, market conditions can change rapidly. FAQs About Cardano Price Predictions Who created Cardano? Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson , who was also a co-founder of Ethereum. The project is developed by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) , led by Hoskinson. What makes Cardano different from other cryptocurrencies? Cardano distinguishes itself through its research-driven, peer-reviewed approach to development. It uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros and emphasizes formal verification methods for enhanced security. How does Cardano’s proof-of-stake work? Cardano uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake protocol that divides time into epochs and slots. Stakeholders can delegate their ADA to stake pools that validate transactions and create new blocks, earning rewards in the process. What is the maximum supply of ADA? Cardano has a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA tokens. As of 2023, approximately 35 billion were in circulation, with the remainder being released through staking rewards over time. Where can I buy and store ADA safely? ADA is available on most major cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance , Coinbase , and Kraken . For storage, consider hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor , or official Cardano wallets like Daedalus or Yoroi. Conclusion: Cardano’s Promising but Uncertain Journey Cardano represents one of the most thoughtfully designed projects in the cryptocurrency space, with ambitious goals and a methodical approach to achieving them. Our analysis suggests that ADA reaching $2 is not only possible but likely within the next few years, assuming favorable market conditions and successful implementation of planned upgrades. The Cardano future appears bright, with potential for significant growth through 2030 if the platform achieves widespread adoption for decentralized applications, identity solutions, and financial services. However, investors should maintain realistic expectations, understanding that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile and unpredictable. Ultimately, Cardano’s success will depend on execution—turning its carefully researched vision into practical, widely-used applications. For those who believe in this vision and have patience for its deliberate development timeline, ADA represents an intriguing opportunity in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Apeing’s Best Crypto Whitelist Could Bring You the $0.001 Boost You’ve Been Waiting For,https://timestabloid.com/missed-bitcoins-move-yesterday-apeings-best-crypto-whitelist-could/,"Why do crypto charts look calm until the moment everyone blinks and the entire market flips direction? The entire space moves in cycles. Many traders remember missing Avalanche’s meteoric rise, when AVAX surged from a market cap of around $80 million to over $20 billion, delivering gains exceeding 25,000%. During these swings, most traders react the same way. They freeze. They wait. They stare at indicators until their brains go numb. This hesitation has erased more portfolios than any bear market event and left countless investors wishing they had trusted their instincts. During these shifts, a new trend has been developing quietly. Apeing has captured the attention of traders, analysts, and meme coin enthusiasts alike. Its momentum is built on community power, rapid engagement, and early access, positioning it as the project that embodies the best crypto whitelist experience in a chaotic market. Why Apeing’s Best Meme Coin Whitelist Resonates With Experts And Meme Enthusiasts Alike Apeing stands out because it merges humor, accessibility, and cultural power. Meme coins shape crypto culture by turning shared jokes into economic engines. This dynamic transforms digital communities into influential collectives that push narratives forward. When a project captures this synergy, early momentum often follows quickly. Industry experts point to the importance of emotional connection. According to multiple crypto behavioral studies, emotional engagement dramatically increases holder retention. Traders who feel part of a movement tend to remain active longer compared to those who treat tokens purely as speculative assets. Apeing builds this connection by speaking directly to the degen mindset that thrives on courage, humor, and bold decision-making. Developers also highlight the growth potential when meme culture aligns with early access incentives. This synergy makes Apeing attractive for those seeking simple entry steps and strong identity-driven branding. The project encourages traders to act rather than overanalyze, which appeals to a large segment of the crypto market. This approach places Apeing in a strong position to compete for the best crypto whitelist spot. Early Movers Win Big: Join the Apeing Whitelist for Priority Access Getting involved in $APEING’s upcoming crypto presale is simple and secure. To join the Apeing whitelist, just visit the official website, enter your email in the designated section, and confirm via the email sent to you. This ensures early participants gain priority access, maximizing their potential for significant early returns. The whitelist system is designed to prevent bot activity, ensuring fair token distribution. Analysts emphasize that early verified access allows investors to tap into the initial community-driven momentum while avoiding the risks of dilution faced by latecomers. As history shows, being part of the first wave often leads to the highest ROI in meme coin projects. Those who delay may miss the chance to build meaningful positions as others secure their tokens early. Missing Avalanche: Lessons From Those Who Hesitated The story of Avalanche offers a cautionary tale for traders who wait too long. AVAX debuted with a market cap of roughly $80 million and eventually skyrocketed past $20 billion, delivering gains exceeding 25,000% for early adopters. Many investors froze during its initial launch, scrutinizing charts, waiting for confirmation, or overanalyzing technical indicators. By the time the broader market caught on, the opportunity for outsized returns had already passed, leaving hesitant traders to watch from the sidelines. This episode underscores a recurring theme in crypto cycles: instinct and early action frequently outperform caution. Historical analysis shows that tokens with strong community momentum, active engagement, and scarcity dynamics often reward those who “ape in” early. Experts note that missing AVAX was less about luck and more about behavioral patterns—overthinking and delay often cost far more than calculated risk. Final Thoughts As Traders Watch Apeing Build Toward The Next Major Wave Apeing has captured the interest of traders who remember missing out on Avalanche’s explosive gains and now believe that instinct and action create opportunity long before charts confirm it. The project aligns with the mindset that drives the degen community. Its narrative encourages traders to act rather than freeze, echoing the lessons from AVAX, where early movers secured massive returns while cautious traders were left on the sidelines. As social communities push the project further into trending discussions, it strengthens its identity as one of the most talked-about opportunities in the current cycle. Many now associate Apeing with the best crypto whitelist experience due to its energy, accessibility, and strong cultural resonance. Traders who follow community behaviors, network participation, and momentum indicators continue monitoring it closely, determined not to repeat the mistake of missing the next big wave.

The journey from 2025 to 2030 promises to be transformative, with potential milestones that could redefine digital asset valuation. This comprehensive analysis examines the key factors that will shape Bitcoin’s future trajectory. What Drives Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2025? The year 2025 represents a critical juncture for Bitcoin’s evolution. Several converging factors create a compelling case for significant price appreciation. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major financial players integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios. Regulatory clarity in key markets provides a more stable foundation for growth. The Bitcoin halving event scheduled for 2024 will have fully manifested its supply shock effects by 2025, potentially creating scarcity-driven upward pressure. Market analysts point to several key indicators for 2025: Increased institutional custody solutions Mainstream payment integration Enhanced regulatory frameworks Technological improvements in scalability BTC Price 2026: The Institutional Adoption Phase By 2026, Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance is expected to reach new heights. The BTC price in 2026 will likely reflect growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Central bank digital currency developments may create both competition and complementary use cases. The maturation of Bitcoin-based financial products, including ETFs and derivatives, could provide additional liquidity and price discovery mechanisms. Factor Impact on Price Timeframe Institutional Investment High 2025-2026 Regulatory Clarity Medium-High Ongoing Technological Advancements Medium 2024-2027 Global Economic Conditions Variable Continuous Bitcoin 2030 Forecast: The Long-Term Vision Looking toward 2030 requires considering Bitcoin’s potential role in the global financial system. The Bitcoin 2030 forecast must account for macroeconomic trends, technological evolution, and shifting societal attitudes toward digital assets. By this point, Bitcoin may have established itself as a true digital gold standard, with price reflecting both its store of value properties and growing utility. Key considerations for 2030 include: Global adoption rates and penetration Competition from other cryptocurrencies Technological obsolescence risks Environmental and sustainability concerns Geopolitical factors affecting digital assets Cryptocurrency Market Analysis: Beyond Bitcoin Alone Understanding Bitcoin’s future requires examining the broader cryptocurrency market analysis. Bitcoin doesn’t exist in isolation; its price movements influence and are influenced by the entire digital asset ecosystem. The relationship between Bitcoin and altcoins, the development of decentralized finance, and the evolution of blockchain technology all contribute to Bitcoin’s long-term valuation potential. The cryptocurrency market’s maturation brings both opportunities and challenges: Increased correlation with traditional markets Growing regulatory oversight globally Technological innovation in competing networks Changing investor demographics and preferences Bitcoin Future Value: The Ultimate Question Predicting Bitcoin future value involves balancing quantitative analysis with qualitative assessment of technological and social trends. While precise numbers vary widely among analysts, consensus suggests substantial growth potential. The combination of fixed supply, growing demand, and expanding utility creates a powerful foundation for long-term appreciation. Critical factors influencing future value include: Adoption as a reserve asset by corporations and nations Integration into global payment systems Development of layer-2 solutions enhancing utility Macroeconomic conditions favoring hard assets Technological security and network resilience FAQs: Your Bitcoin Prediction Questions Answered What is the most realistic Bitcoin price prediction for 2025? Most analysts suggest a range between $100,000 and $200,000, depending on adoption rates and macroeconomic conditions. How does the Bitcoin halving affect long-term price? The halving reduces new supply by 50%, historically creating upward price pressure as scarcity increases relative to demand. What role do institutions like BlackRock play in Bitcoin’s future? Institutional adoption through products like Bitcoin ETFs brings significant capital, legitimacy, and stability to the market. How might regulations from agencies like the SEC impact Bitcoin? Clear regulation can reduce uncertainty and attract institutional investors, though restrictive policies could limit growth in certain regions. What technological developments could affect Bitcoin’s price? Improvements in scalability through solutions like the Lightning Network and Taproot upgrades could enhance utility and demand. How do experts like Cameron Winklevoss view Bitcoin’s long-term potential? Many industry leaders believe Bitcoin could reach valuations comparable to gold’s market capitalization over the long term. Conclusion: The Path Forward for Bitcoin Investors The journey from 2025 to 2030 represents a pivotal period for Bitcoin and its investors. While predictions vary, the underlying fundamentals remain strong: fixed supply, growing adoption, and increasing recognition as a legitimate asset class. Successful navigation of this period requires understanding both the opportunities and risks inherent in cryptocurrency investment. The most prepared investors will be those who combine technical analysis with fundamental understanding of Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global economy.

The Bank of Japan is expected to raise its benchmark rate to 0.75% at the December policy meeting, the highest level since 1995. The prospect of this change has already strengthened the yen, which moved from above 155 per dollar to roughly 154.56 on Friday. BOJ tightening shifts funding costs and pressures high-beta markets Policy makers are inclined to increase by 25 basis points at the December 19 meeting, according to those involved in the deliberations, unless a large shock arises in global or domestic markets. Governor Kazuo Ueda stated that the board would make an appropriate decision, using the same wording as in previous increases. According to market data , the likelihood of a December move has been reported to be nearly 90%. The shift is expected to be supported by government ministers aligned with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, indicating that the tightening agenda will enjoy wider political backing. The cost of funding also increases, which directly impacts the yen carry trade. The approach enabled hedge funds and proprietary desks to borrow cheaply in yen and invest the funds in more volatile assets. Bitcoin is one of the markets that has been most susceptible to changes in leverage and liquidity, and is therefore susceptible as investors reposition themselves to the increased cost of borrowing. The strengthening of the yen is in line with the de-risking of macro portfolios, which could constrain the liquidity environment that has helped Bitcoin recover from intramonth lows. This tension was evident in the price of Bitcoin earlier in the week, which fell to around $86,000 before rising to around $89,000, in tandem with U.S. equities. Its motions have been pegged to fluctuating global rate expectations in what has been a tumultuous month in the rotation of macro-linked assets. Japan aligns tax policy and investment rules with broader market reforms This policy change coincides with Japan’s planned redesign of its cryptocurrency tax regime, which is set to shift to a flat tax of 20% on gains from trading, effective in 2026. The tax would be equivalent to those levied on equities and investment trusts, and crypto would be the same as any other financial instrument. According to the proposal, crypto earnings would be a distinct tax bracket between both national and local governments. Currently, the income from digital assets is subject to a progressive tax structure, which may exceed 55% of the total income. Critics argue that such a structure will not promote sales, as it creates a risk of incurring large tax liabilities. The advocates of the intended reform anticipate that the reduced, unified ratio will spur involvement in Japan’s internal crypto market, which saw approximately eight million active accounts and approximately 1.5 trillion yen (around $9.6 billion) of spot exchange in September. Japanese asset managers have also begun to align with the new regulatory direction. Nomura Asset Management has established an internal task force to assess product strategies, and Daiwa Asset Management is collaborating with Global X Japan to explore potential offerings. Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management and Amova Asset Management are renegotiating their custody, pricing, and standards protocols to support more digital-asset exposure to retail and institutional investors.

XRP holders feel this more intensely today, as institutional activity grows behind the scenes. Many retail investors sense a gap between what happens in public markets and what moves quietly in private channels. This tension fuels concern, curiosity, and a desire for greater fairness. Rising Frustrations Within the Community Future XRP captured these emotions in a recent post that now resonates widely. The message reflects deep fatigue over how institutions accumulate XRP through private pathways not visible to retail traders. Many holders believe these channels offer advantages unavailable on open exchanges. This perception creates a sense of imbalance and weakens confidence in transparent price discovery. I'm going to be honest. I'm tired of institutions being able to load up on $XRP through OTC desks and private liquidity channels. I'm tired of the fact that we have no transparency into how those desks get supplied or how much early access big players get. I'm tired of retail… — Future XRP (@the5blairs) December 5, 2025 Institutional Liquidity Channels and OTC Access A major point of frustration involves OTC desks and private liquidity hubs used by large investors. These venues allow institutions to execute massive block trades without major slippage. Retail traders must use public markets, where order books shift rapidly and spreads change often. The contrast feels unfair, especially during volatile periods. Institutional demand has surged in 2025, and much of that flow occurs through quiet, negotiated trades. The Transparency Problem A growing transparency gap now shapes discussions around XRP’s market structure. Retail investors rarely see how institutions source liquidity or how early they gain access to large supplies. This lack of visibility fuels suspicion that deeper market activity happens away from the charts. It also encourages fear that price is being suppressed by players with far greater resources. Clearer reporting on off-exchange liquidity could ease these concerns and help restore trust. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulation and Market Evolution The shift toward private liquidity routes did not happen by accident. Institutional interest expanded rapidly after the Ripple–SEC case concluded in 2025 . The decision removed years of uncertainty and opened the door for regulated financial products tied to XRP. Ripple’s rollout of RLUSD further reinforced confidence in its long-term plans. These developments attracted institutions seeking deep liquidity and stable execution. As a result, more trading now occurs in private markets rather than public order books. Retail Expectations and the Road Ahead Despite frustration, many XRP holders remain optimistic about future value. They believe XRP’s real utility will emerge as global payment systems modernize. Yet optimism does not erase the feeling that progress is slow and uneven. Retail investors want clearer insight into market flows and more balance between public and private trade access. Transparency, fairer execution, and stronger reporting standards could help bridge this divide. A Community Waiting for Fair Reflection Future XRP’s message captures the emotional reality of long-term holders. They are tired of uneven access, tired of opaque liquidity, and tired of watching institutions move first. But they also believe the real opportunity is still unfolding. That belief keeps many holders committed, even as they wait for XRP to reflect its full purpose on a global scale.

Meanwhile, MoonBull ($MOBU) is drawing enormous interest during its presale, which has shown a 7,244% ROI from Stage 6 to the listing price. These developments are proof that some meme coins are evolving into strong contenders with real mechanics and future potential. As the hunt for the top crypto with 1000x potential heats up, investors are keeping a close eye on these exciting projects. Whether it’s the meme-centric momentum of MoonBull, the institutional interest in Mog Coin, or the mainstream traction of Pudgy Penguins, these coins are shaping up to be key players in the meme coin market. Let’s dive into why each of these projects could be the next big thing for crypto investors. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Top Crypto with 1000x Potential MoonBull ($MOBU) is not just another meme token; it’s a top crypto with 1000x potential built on Ethereum with fairness, transparency, and long-term vision baked in. One of MoonBull’s standout features is its referral program, which plays a significant role in its growth strategy. The referral system rewards users with 15% bonus tokens on each invitee’s purchase, making it a win-win for both the referrer and the new buyer. Additionally, monthly top referrers earn USDC rewards, providing an extra layer of incentive for the community to spread the word and grow the ecosystem. As of now, the presale is rocking: Stage 6 is live, more than $640K raised, over 2100 holders. With the current price at $0.00008388, the ROI from Stage 6 to the anticipated listing price is over 7,244%, and the next jump could bring roughly 27.4% more. Investing $70,000 could hypothetically turn into over $5.1 million at listing; it’s like catching that rocket when it still had training wheels. Mog Coin: Recent Moves and Why It Still Matters Mog Coin (MOG) just got a severe jolt of institutional-style interest. Canary Capital has applied to launch what could become the first dedicated meme coin ETF tied to MOG. This filing triggered a wave of buzz across the crypto world, pushing MOG into the spotlight as a candidate for wider adoption beyond the usual meme-coin crowd. This kind of backing from a fund like Canary Capital could bring new liquidity and visibility to MOG, making it more accessible to investors who prefer regulated vehicles. On the price front, MOG has shown signs that the bottom might be behind it. Recent analyses found that after a rough stretch earlier in 2025, MOG has clawed back somewhat, holding a market capitalization of around $121 million with a recent real-time price near $0.00000031. While the past month saw a dip, some bullish voices are calling this a consolidation phase, hinting at a possible rebound if macro crypto sentiment improves. Pudgy Penguins Price (PENGU) Jumps 26% Amid Whale Accumulation Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) has seen a strong price rebound, surging 26% after hitting a low of $0.00956. The price increase follows significant whale activity, with one whale purchasing $273,000 worth of tokens, sparking renewed investor interest. Along with the whale buy, the token has also attracted $1.3 million in new inflows from smart money, indicating confidence in the project’s future. This price spike brings the token back above the $0.011 level, and technical indicators such as MACD and RSI suggest that bullish momentum is building. Further fueling the rise is Pudgy Penguins’ recent collaborations, including a major partnership with the NHL. The collaboration centers on the 2026 Discover NHL Winter Classic and will feature giveaways and fan activations likely to draw mainstream attention. Final Thoughts Based on research and market trends, MoonBull ($MOBU) stands out as the top crypto with 1000x potential among the trio. Its community-first design, structured presale and referral system give it real backbone. For anyone serious about discovering a high-reward opportunity early, MoonBull’s presale offers rare upside, and maybe more importantly, built-in fairness that protects from whale dominance.

In addition, the lawmaker also wants local governments to be prevented from establishing rules that could limit the growth and use of digital assets in the state. The proposal, submitted by Rep. Kyle Pierce (R), would mandate retirement and savings programs used by public servants to make exchange-traded funds offering cryptocurrency exposure available as an investment option. According to the description of House Bill 2014, it would also restrict the ability of local governments to adopt regulations that would unreasonably stifle the use of digital assets in payments, mining, or the ability for individuals to choose crypto self-custody. Indiana lawmaker submits bill to include Bitcoin in pensions The bill was introduced and submitted before Indiana’s House Financial Institutions Committee. In the middle of redistricting discussions, the 2026 Indiana Legislative Session began on Monday, rather than in January. Pierce, who punched his ticket to the Indian General Assembly in 2022, mentioned in a statement that Indiana should be ready to engage in a smart and responsible way. He also added that the bill will provide Hoosiers with more investment choices while establishing the right guardrails. The version of the bill introduced this week includes language requiring the statement to look into how digital assets could be used by the government while leaving room for pilot programs. While legislation would prevent local governments from kicking out miners from areas zoned for industrial use, it would also protect mining in private residences located in the area. The initiative from Indiana is different from bills submitted by other states that allow governments to make allocations to digital assets on their behalf. Examples of such bills are the one that was passed in New Hampshire . In the bill signed back in May, Governor Kelly Ayotte signed off on the state creating its Bitcoin reserve. “New Hampshire is once again first in the nation!” Ayotte wrote on X at the time. “Just signed a new law allowing our state to invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals.” States continue to move forward with crypto-related bills Other crypto-related bills that have been introduced in the United States have sought to tax transactions to fund public health measures. An example is the one that was introduced by New York lawmaker Phil Steck. The bill, Bill A0966, will see New York impose a 0.2% excise tax on crypto transactions, using the proceeds to help schools combat substance abuse in upstate New York, where an opioid epidemic has severely impacted communities for years. Steck mentioned at the time that they could generate an estimated $158 million in annual revenue from crypto investors who are driven by the single motive of making profits. “The funding shall be used to expand the substance abuse prevention and intervention program to schools in upstate New York,” a separate description of the bill states. Meanwhile, Wyoming also announced its crypto initiatives to assist schools. The state plans to use funds generated by the reserves of its stablecoin to improve its education fund. In addition, state lawmakers have also been proposing various bills that look like the strategic reserve for Bitcoin that was announced by United States President Donald Trump. The president signed an executive order, announcing that a digital asset stockpile will be created. The development was announced by White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, who claimed that the initiative would not cost taxpayers, noting that it would be created with Bitcoin forfeited through seizures.

The asset is showing a critical bullish signal as the TD Sequential indicator turns positive on the weekly chart, suggesting the token may be entering a potential reversal phase after weeks of downward pressure, according to insights by Ali Martinez shared in an X post on December 5. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Ali_charts Notably, the TD Sequential is a timing tool that flags when trends are losing strength and may be ready to reverse. Its current bullish setup suggests XRP’s recent selling pressure is fading and that the downtrend may be nearing an end. The market structure supports this shift, with XRP tightening its range through late November and showing reduced downside momentum. The latest weekly candle points to an early reversal, strengthening the case for a move higher if buyers step in. If momentum builds behind this technical trigger, the next major area of interest sits near $2.50, a zone that previously acted as a pivot during the earlier stages of the autumn rally. XRP social sentiment However, while this technical structure suggests a possible rebound, the same outlook is backed by social sentiment. To this end, insights by Santiment indicate that XRP has dropped 31% over the past two months and is now facing its most intense wave of fear, uncertainty, and doubt since October. The analysis shows a surge in days marked by abnormally high bearish commentary, or “Fear Zone” signals, highlighting a sharp shift in crowd expectations even as Bitcoin sentiment remains relatively firm. Historically, these fear spikes have coincided with short-term price rebounds. The last comparable cluster of bearish sentiment appeared on November 21, when the cryptocurrency quickly rallied 22% over the following three days before enthusiasm flipped toward greed and halted the move.

If crowd anxiety unwinds as it did in late November, XRP could see a relief push, though sustained upside would require the market to avoid slipping back into the “Greed Zone” that previously capped momentum. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.03, having plunged about 1.8% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe the token has dropped over 7%. XRP seven-day price chart.

This launch of BPCE crypto trading services represents more than just a new product line; it’s a powerful endorsement of digital assets from one of the continent’s most established financial institutions. For investors and the crypto market at large, this development marks a pivotal moment of institutional validation. What Does BPCE’s Crypto Trading Launch Actually Mean? According to reports from Solid Intel, the Groupe BPCE—which manages a staggering $1.52 trillion in assets—has begun offering cryptocurrency trading. This follows earlier indications from French financial media that the group planned to roll out crypto investment services by 2025 through its subsidiary, Hexarq. Therefore, this launch appears to be ahead of schedule, suggesting strong internal confidence and market readiness. The service essentially allows BPCE’s vast client base to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies directly through a trusted, regulated banking partner. This bridges a critical gap for many potential investors who have been hesitant to use standalone crypto exchanges due to security or regulatory concerns. Why is BPCE’s Entry into Crypto Trading a Big Deal? The significance of this move cannot be overstated. BPCE is not a niche fintech startup; it is a pillar of the French and European financial system. Its entry provides a level of legitimacy and stability that the cryptocurrency sector has long sought from traditional finance. Here are the key implications: Mainstream Accessibility: Millions of existing BPCE banking customers now have a familiar and secure gateway to crypto assets. Regulatory Confidence: The launch operates within France’s progressive regulatory framework for digital assets, showcasing a compliant path forward for other banks. Market Maturation: It signals that major financial institutions now view cryptocurrencies as a substantive asset class worthy of inclusion in their portfolios. How Will BPCE Crypto Trading Impact the Average Investor? For the everyday person curious about digital currencies, this development is a game-changer. The primary barrier for many has been complexity and perceived risk. BPCE crypto trading services demystify the process by integrating it into a standard banking interface. Investors can likely manage their traditional and digital assets from a single platform, simplifying portfolio management. Moreover, the backing of a major bank implies enhanced security measures, insurance protections, and customer support that are often absent from pure crypto exchanges. This safety net could unlock a new wave of adoption from conservative investors who have been waiting on the sidelines. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While this is a bullish development, challenges remain. The volatile nature of crypto markets means BPCE must educate its clients thoroughly. Furthermore, the bank must navigate evolving global regulations. However, the opportunities are immense. This move positions BPCE as a leader in the digital transformation of European finance. It also creates a blueprint for other major banks, potentially triggering a domino effect of institutional adoption. If successful, this BPCE crypto trading initiative could significantly increase liquidity and stability in the crypto markets, attracting even more institutional capital and fostering innovation in blockchain-based financial products. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto and Traditional Finance BPCE’s launch of cryptocurrency trading services is a transformative event. It blurs the lines between traditional and digital finance, offering validation, security, and accessibility. This move is less about a single bank’s strategy and more about a fundamental shift in how the financial world perceives and integrates blockchain technology. As one of Europe’s banking giants takes this leap, it paves the way for a more integrated, innovative, and inclusive financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly has BPCE launched? A1: Groupe BPCE, France’s second-largest bank, has launched a service allowing its clients to trade cryptocurrencies directly through its platform, reportedly via its subsidiary Hexarq. Q2: Why is a traditional bank offering crypto trading significant? A2: It provides mainstream legitimacy, enhanced security, and easier access for millions of existing bank customers, signaling broad institutional acceptance of crypto as an asset class. Q3: Can anyone use BPCE’s crypto trading service? A3: The service is likely available to existing BPCE banking clients, subject to standard onboarding and compliance checks, similar to opening any other investment account. Q4: Does this mean cryptocurrencies are now safe? A4: While a bank-backed platform may offer improved security and custody, cryptocurrencies themselves remain volatile assets. The “safety” refers to the trading environment, not the elimination of market risk. Q5: Will other major banks follow BPCE’s lead? A5: BPCE’s move creates strong competitive pressure. If successful, it is highly probable that other large European and global banks will accelerate their own plans for crypto trading services. Q6: What cryptocurrencies can be traded? A6: Specific details on the supported assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) are yet to be fully disclosed, but services from major institutions typically start with the largest and most established cryptocurrencies.

However, despite this high activity, the price of XRP has seen some selling pressure, falling by 6.7% to around $2.04 with its trading volumes doubling to $4 billion. This seeming contradiction between strong usage and weak prices positions the digital currency at a crossroads, with investor attention focused on its immediate direction, as well as interest in other new cryptocurrencies such as defi projects. XRP Price Analysis Experts are studying if this payment rise is a precursor to a large movement in the market or if this is a warning within the existing bearish sentiments. The XRP/USD price prediction is testing a strong support level of $1.90, which Is a temporary relief bounce in response to the positive economic news in the U.S. Breaking this strong support may likely trigger a correction down to the value of $1.65, showing a weakening of 19%. However, as Ripple’s (XRP) position remains clouded with so much ambiguity, smart investors are now focusing their attention on innovative defi crypto projects that always come with some form of utility as well as rapid progression plans. One such project that stands out as the best crypto to invest in option for cryptocurrencies, as preferred by those who focus on projects that are still in their early stages of development, is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance Presale The presale of Mutuum Finance is currently taking center stage as the next big thing in cryptocurrencies. Currently in phase 6, which is almost full with 95% of its allotted space, the time to pick up MUTM at $0.035 is running out fast. At this rate, this represents a 250% jump from the initial cost in phase one, which was only $0.01. With Phase 6 running out fast, this represents the last opportunity to invest within this pricing stratified system, as the forthcoming Phase 7 will experience a near 20 percent increase in cost to a rate of $0.04. With the launch cost established securely within the realm of $0.06, those that were involved prior to the launch will realize a profit gain of 450%. In terms of the presale, this effort has netted a remarkable $19,150,000, with a cumulative group of 18,330 holders of the MUTM token. Putting off the decision to invest now may mean that one of the best entry points that this market will see will be missed. With the increasing speed of the fill rate that is being reached in Phase 6, there is a senior moment of fear of missing out, as the chance to buy the tokens with a starting investment cost, before the anticipated explosion in value, is slipping away with every second that passes. In addition to the presale dynamics, Mutuum Finance provides other strong selling arguments. It provides better user interaction with the introduction of a new Mutuum Finance Dashboard with a 24 Hour Leaderboard. This lists the top 50 holders, with the first person every day getting a bonus of $500 MUTM, if they conduct any form of deal within the day, resetting every day at UTC 00:00. The Path Forward Although the dynamics of the market for XRP remain highly important, the defi crypto market still provides ground-floor investment opportunities with huge growth potential. Mutuum Finance is a case in point. It combines a high-stakes presale with innovative elements and secure infrastructure. Diversified portfolio owners seeking investment guidance on which crypto to invest in today must examine both established platforms as well as new projects with strong fundamentals. There is no doubt that time is running out as the presale progresses.

GLXY differentiates itself from peers like IREN and CoreWeave by not abandoning crypto amid its AI pivot. Recent performance has lagged since October despite solid earnings, with investor concerns persisting. The investment thesis centers on dual exposure to both AI and cryptocurrency growth opportunities. Galaxy Digital ( GLXY )(GLXY:CA) is a cryptocurrency company that plans to add a significant Artificial Intelligence (""AI"") infrastructure business. Unlike IREN Limited ( IREN ) and CoreWeave ( CRWV ), it intends to continue investing in cryptocurrency and growing that business after establishing its AI infrastructure business. The stock has not done very well since late October for several reasons. First, this investment may turn off investors unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency industry. As I get deeper into this article, I will mention some terms that some in traditional finance may never have heard of, such as staking and Tokenization. Before considering buying this company, become familiar with the cryptocurrency industry; otherwise, you will likely fail to understand Galaxy Digital. Next, investors have been concerned that several significant cryptocurrencies have been selling off since the beginning of October. Galaxy remains heavily reliant on cryptocurrency trading to generate revenue, making it highly susceptible to cryptocurrency market fluctuations. The downdraft in cryptocurrency prices may show up in reduced revenue in the company's fourth quarter. Data by YCharts The market was also displeased in the latest quarter by a massive jump in Gross Transaction Expenses, the equivalent of the cost of goods sold for a typical company; the jump in third-quarter 2025 Gross Transaction Expenses caused total operating expenses to rise 228% to $28.67 billion. Galaxy Digital Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Press Release. Transaction expenses can increase rapidly when trading volume jumps, which occurred in the third quarter. Galaxy Digital's third-quarter 2025 press release stated: Galaxy's digital asset trading volumes increased 140% in the quarter, reaching all-time highs and outpacing broader market growth amid stronger sentiment and client activity. This included the execution of a $9 billion notional bitcoin sale, or over 80,000 bitcoin, on behalf of a client in the quarter, and robust spot execution for digital asset treasury companies. The sheer size of Gross Transaction Expenses and operating expenses may have shocked some investors and caused an adverse reaction in the stock price. Despite the rise in Gross Transaction and Total Operating Expenses, the 140% increase in trading volumes is suitable for the company because the 231% increase in revenue exceeds the 228% increase in Total Operating Transaction Expenses, resulting in higher profits. The company's net income increased from a $33.33 million loss in the previous year's third quarter to $505.057 million this year. Additionally, although the company maintains it is on schedule to deliver 133 megawatts (""MW"") in the first half of 2026, the market may have expected the Helios investment to generate revenue sooner. Galaxy's AI infrastructure revenue has the potential to be more stable and higher-margin than its cryptocurrency trading business. Hence, the market wants to see it generating revenue sooner rather than later. Unfortunately for Galaxy Bulls, ""being on schedule"" is not soon enough for some investors, which may be why the stock sold off after earnings. Galaxy Digital Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Press Release. Following the cryptocurrency selloff and potential initial investor concern over higher-than-expected Gross Transaction Expenses in its third fiscal quarter (""FY"") 2025 and a slower-than-expected return on investment (""ROI"") from its data center investment, the stock dropped by 12.9% from its 52-week high of $45.92 the day after reporting its third-quarter earnings to $37.34. It later drifted down another 33.26% to $24.80 by the December 2 close. Data by YCharts Despite the current gloom and doom surrounding the company, there are reasons to be bullish on the stock, including a shift away from trading to recurring revenue streams in its Digital Assets business and in its new AI infrastructure business. Generating new recurring revenue The Galaxy Digital AI infrastructure project, Helios, is a former Bitcoin mining site on a campus in Texas that Galaxy Digital acquired in late 2022 . On March 28, 2025, Galaxy Digital announced in its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings results that it had signed a 15-year lease agreement on November 7, 2024, with CoreWeave to deliver 133 megawatts of critical IT load for AI and HPC operations Management expects its CoreWeave deal to generate high-margin recurring revenue , specifically $1 billion in annual revenue at an estimated 90% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin. Helios gets most of the hype for its potential to transform Galaxy's business. However, investors shouldn't dismiss the company's Digital Assets segment. One of the company's pathways to generating a recurring revenue is through a process called Tokenization—turning traditional assets like real estate, stocks, or funds into digital tokens on a blockchain. Galaxy got into this business when it finalized the acquisition of GK8 on February 23, 2023, for approximately $44 million. Galaxy is in the process of creating a business to tokenize assets using GK8's ""Tokenization Wizard"" platform and to serve as a custodian of the assets on the blockchain. The company will generate revenue through custodian fees based on Assets Under Management (""AUM"") and through licensing GK8 to other financial institutions and partners, thereby generating steady, annual Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) fees. Galaxy can also generate additional fees as an offshoot of its tokenization business, which includes staking, asset management, and smart contract management fees. Let me briefly discuss staking, since it is a crypto activity not everyone is familiar with. This (staking) business may be difficult to understand because it is purely a crypto concept. The following Coinbase article defines staking: Staking is a way to earn rewards by putting your crypto to work on a blockchain network. In return for helping the network run smoothly and securely, you receive more of the cryptocurrency you're staking. The rewards come from the network itself—your crypto isn't being lent out. It's a safe, simple and popular way to grow your crypto while holding. When customers stake their crypto assets with Galaxy, it generates high-margin, recurring fees for the company. The other concept to understand and follow in Galaxy's results is AUM, the total market value of all the assets that Galaxy holds on behalf of its clients. The more assets under management, the higher the fees the company generates. Galaxy Digital Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Press Release. In the third quarter, it had approximately $9 billion in AUM and $7 billion in Stake under management, generating high-margin recurring fee revenue of $40 million. Suppose it is successful in building out a Tokenization platform. In that case, it will diversify its business into a higher-margin, recurring revenue stream, which the market would likely assign a valuation higher than today's, which relies primarily on volatile trading revenue. When I first heard of Tokenization, I thought it was a business that could be quickly commoditized because the technology behind it is pretty easy to implement. However, I discovered that just because it is technically easy to do doesn't mean it's easy to build a tokenization business, because not every business can establish the legal compliance, security, and market structure required to make institutions comfortable adopting it at scale. An analyst on Galaxy Digital's third-quarter 2025 earnings call noted that BlackRock has been talking up Tokenization lately and is actively developing tokenization technology. He asked the following question of Galaxy management: I was wondering because we heard that BlackRock was looking to build its own technology, and we see -- we can understand that most big banks might see a threat with Tokenization. I was wondering where you see GK8 sitting at in this market? And where do you see custody as a service, but mostly as a fee clipping like when you got smart contract settlement and maybe also AllUnity. So I'd like to see if there's a moat regarding GK8 and if at any moment you see GK8 having its own fierce moment, if I may. Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") Michael Novogratz gave the following response: Listen, the tokenization process itself is not so complicated, right? I think where you're going to see the value over time is connecting the entire infrastructure process, which is like capital raising in some ways, right, figuring out what assets should be tokenized or can be tokenized, and how to distribute those and then where those distributed assets sit in custody. It's kind of a complex web...Nobody is really tokenizing at scale right now. And some of that, I think, will change in the next 18 months. I think once you get clarity from the bill that hopefully gets passed in Washington in the next few months, the market structure bill. Once you also get understanding of where these tokenized security assets will trade, right now, they need to trade on ATSs and there are not a lot of big liquid pools around ATSs. And so all the pieces aren't in place yet for the tokenization world to really explode, but we're really close. In other words, Tokenization is still in its very early stages, and Galaxy is positioning itself to be a significant player once the industry takes off. If the tokenization business does take off, the market will likely value its Digital Assets business much higher than it does today. Up until now, Galaxy has primarily focused on institutional investors. The company decided to diversify its revenue sources from institutional investors to individual investors with the launch of GalaxyOne on October 6, 2025. The press release stated: ""We've spent years building institutional-quality infrastructure to serve the world's most sophisticated investors. Now, we're extending that edge to individuals,"" said Mike Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Galaxy. ""Importantly, GalaxyOne advances our mission of becoming a full-spectrum financial services provider that builds trusted, regulated, and accessible products for all market segments."" The new platform should serve as a retail distribution network for services on its institutional financial network. GalaxyOne, if successful, should help shift Galaxy's revenue mix from volatile trading profits to more stable, predictable fee-based income from facilitating individual customers lending their stocks, and profiting from the spread between what it earns on institutional loans and what it pays to GalaxyOne high-value individual users on both cash deposits (currently 4.00% APY via an FDIC-insured bank partner) and an investment note for accredited investors (8.00% APY). It will also unify crypto, equities, and cash management on the GalaxyOne platform, enabling cross-selling across financial products. When I first started looking at this company, I thought it would be just like CoreWeave or IREN, Ltd. , former crypto companies that had pivoted to AI infrastructure. However, I was surprised to discover that Galaxy Digital had no plans to wind down or exit its crypto operations, unlike several other former crypto players that have turned to AI infrastructure. At first, I wondered why, because the market often gives crypto players a lower valuation. After researching, I discovered that the market assigns crypto miners and traders a lower valuation due to the volatility of their revenue and profitability. However, suppose Galaxy morphs from a crypto trading company into a financial services company generating high-margin recurring revenue. In that case, the crypto portion of the business may become as valuable as the AI infrastructure portion. Valuation Through the third quarter of FY 2025, Galaxy's Data Centers Segment contributed little to the company's overall results. The company's Digital Assets Platform, which centers on cryptocurrency and comprises trading, asset management, and investment banking, is best valued using the P/TBV metric. The following chart shows Galaxy Digital's Price-to-Tangible-Book Value (P/TBV) is 2.804, above its three-, five-, and seven-year medians, suggesting the market may overvalue the stock. Suppose the stock sold at its three-year median; its price would be $12.61, a 49.14% decline from its December 1 closing price of $24.80, which is its potential downside if the thesis for investing in it fails to play out (especially the AI infrastructure thesis). Data by YCharts The companies it compares best on a P/TBV basis are Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ), Cboe Global Markets, Inc. ( CBOE ), Futu Holdings Ltd. ( FUTU ), and Robinhood Markets, Inc. ( HOOD ). Data by YCharts Company name Business Model P/TBV Galaxy Digital Cryptocurrency Exchange/Financial/Brokerage 2.804 Coinbase Global, Inc. Cryptocurrency Exchange/Brokerage 6.609 Cboe Global Markets, Inc. Traditional Exchange/Market Operator 75.76 Futu Holdings Ltd. International Online Brokerage 7.455 Robinhood Markets, Inc. Retail Brokerage/Trading Platform 13.84 Since Galaxy has the lowest P/TBV among the comparison group, some may consider it severely undervalued relative to similar financial companies. However, other investors may believe the poorer quality of its Tangible Book Value (""TBV"") warrants a significant discount. For instance, Cboe and Coinbase hold much of their TBV in highly liquid and stable assets, such as fiat cash, regulated securities, and operational capital. In contrast, Galaxy holds most of its TBV in digital assets (cryptocurrencies) and principal investments, which are subject to extreme, sudden market volatility and can sometimes be illiquid. The higher risk that its assets may rapidly decline in value may validate Galaxy's significant discount in the eyes of some traditional finance investors. As a result, some may consider it fairly valued or even overvalued. Once Galaxy's AI infrastructure becomes fully operational, investors will be able to use Enterprise Value (""EV"")/EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) to value the company since the AI infrastructure and data center business model are an excellent fit for that valuation method. However, as of the third quarter, the company is primarily a financial institution with volatile, non-recurring revenue dependent on mark-to-market gains on its balance sheet digital assets, precisely the type of company ill-suited for valuation using EV/EBITDA. As a result, I won't attempt to value Galaxy using EV/EBITDA until AI infrastructure generates a meaningful contribution to the company's revenue. Galaxy Digital's trailing 12-month (TTM) price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 0.08, which is well below the financial sector median of 3.00, suggesting the market undervalues it. Additionally, its TTM P/S ratio is much lower than that of other publicly traded companies in the crypto and financial space. Some investors may consider it significantly undervalued based solely on the P/S ratio. Data by YCharts Let's see how the comparison looks when comparing forward-looking valuation metrics. I use three-year forward numbers in a three-year forward P/S ratio-to-estimated revenue growth (P/S/G) ratio analysis, as the comparison only makes sense when using Galaxy's FY 2027 estimated year-over-year revenue growth. Seeking Alpha The following table compares the three-year forward P/S ratio-to-estimated revenue growth (P/S/G) and TTM profitability metrics of several publicly traded companies in the crypto and financial space.

YCharts for TTM gross margin, TTM Operating Margin, and TTM FCF. A third-party website for TTM ROIC. Generally, the market considers the stock with the lowest P/S/G as undervalued compared to those with higher P/S/G ratios. According to that convention, some investors may consider Galaxy's three-year forward P/S/G ratio of 0.002 as severely undervalued. However, some investors may consider Galaxy's revenue to be of much lower quality than most of the companies in this comparison, given that much of it is non-recurring and volatile. Additionally, the company has the lowest gross margins in the comparison at 3.14%. Therefore, it is likely that many traditional financial investors consider the P/S/G discount well-deserved and believe the stock is trading at fair value. Some may even think the market overvalues it. The market may continue to value it at a discount until the company develops additional recurring revenue streams and higher-margin revenue streams. Galaxy Digital has a TTM price-to-earnings (P/E) of 40.86, well above the Financials sector median of 13.08. Therefore, some may consider it overvalued. The following table shows that analysts expect the company's earnings-per-share (""EPS"") to be inconsistent and its EPS growth to be negative over the next several years. Seeking Alpha Normally, I would calculate a forward P/E-to-growth (""PEG"") ratio here. However, the company doesn't produce a steady positive EPS growth to make the calculation make sense. Until the company achieves higher margins and steady revenue, its EPS growth may be inconsistent. I also won't perform a price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) analysis on Galaxy Digital because its FCF is volatile and often negative, which produces unreliable results. Risks The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet ruled definitively on whether digital assets are securities, creating uncertainty for its business model—its most significant risk. At any time, the SEC may declare that one of the company's critical assets (or the activities it engages in, such as staking) is an unregistered security. Suppose the regulator rules that a specific digital asset is a security. In that case, the government may impose massive fines, file lawsuits, force it to pay expensive licenses for its activities, or force Galaxy to shut down parts of its business for operating an unregistered exchange or brokerage. So far, the SEC has sent mixed signals about which way it is leaning. Even with the current presidential administration's supposedly positive stance on digital assets, a change in the White House several years down the road could alter the SEC's view of digital assets. The market may lower the stock's valuation due to this risk. The company's attempt to transform a Bitcoin mining facility into an AI infrastructure facility at the Helios campus in Texas could expose it to execution risk. Delays in getting the facility up and running as an AI infrastructure facility due to construction delays or cost overruns could delay the promised revenue and cash generation. The market would likely respond by selling the stock off. Some investors may be uncomfortable with the composition of the company's equity capital and net digital assets. The company allocated approximately 40% of its $3.2 billion in equity capital to Digital Assets. Galaxy Digital Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Press Release. Additionally, its Treasury & Corporate segment (representing 35% of equity) is composed mainly of cryptocurrencies and related investments, which include Bitcoin ($546 million), Ether ($258 million), and Solana ($291 million). The Treasury & Corporate segment also includes Venture and Fund Investments, which are illiquid assets that are difficult to sell quickly or value precisely because their valuations rely on management's estimates rather than open-market prices, introducing valuation uncertainty and potential for future write-downs. Venture and Fund Investments are worth approximately $646 million. As a result of exposure to cryptocurrency and illiquid investments, its equity value can sink like a rock if cryptocurrency prices fall for an extended period. One of the prime reasons the market values the stock so low is the potential volatility in its equity value. Among the reasons the company is moving into the data center business is that it represents 25% of equity capital, helping derisk some of its cryptocurrency exposure. The company's move into asset management also derisks its balance sheet and stabilizes its earnings, as it is a high-margin, recurring-fee business that grows with client assets under management and assets under Stake, rather than increasing Galaxy's cryptocurrency trading business. Since cryptocurrency trading involves expanding the digital asset reserves on the balance sheet to facilitate market making and trading, an increase in trading on the platform can make earnings more volatile, worsen the balance sheet, and increase the stock's potential volatility. Galaxy Digital's cash and short-term investments are $6.814 billion, and long-term debt is $4.215 billion. Data by YCharts Galaxy's Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio can be very confusing. If you Google the number, different websites will give you a range of 2.63 to 0.65. If you make a mistake and calculate the D/E using Seeking Alpha figures of total debt of $4.532 billion divided by total equity of $3.172 billion, it equals 1.42. However, the best way to calculate the D/E is to use total liabilities, which were $8.35 billion in the third quarter. If you divide $8.35 billion by $3.172 billion, it equals a D/E of 2.63, which is what you see on many websites. A D/E of 2.63 means the company finances its operations with debt more than equity, which some investors may find too risky. Although a D/E of 2.63 is mathematically correct, it may be inappropriate for Galaxy's digital asset business model. The way to calculate the D/E for a Galaxy's business model differs from that for a traditional company. Galaxy Digital Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Press Release. Galaxy's balance sheet contains several crypto-specific or financial service-specific liabilities that can distort the D/E. The two largest balance sheet items are Digital Assets Borrowed and Collateral Payable. The volume of client trading on the platform can create these crypto-specific liabilities, which differ from traditional corporate debt, as they inflate the debt figure without representing actual financial risk. When eliminating Digital Assets Borrowed and Collateral Payable from total debt; $8.35 billion (total liabilities) - $3.05 billion (digital assets borrowed) - $2.55 billion (collateral payable)/$3.172 billion (Total equity) = a D/E of 0.86, which indicates that Galaxy actually conservatively uses equity more than debt to finance its operations. The difference in these calculations could determine whether an investor considers the stock too risky or conservative. I calculated everything out to show that investors should avoid relying solely on numbers from websites. All websites can get some numbers wrong. I have even caught YCharts and Seeking Alpha figures being mistaken before for several reasons, including the fact that standard calculations may not be appropriate for all companies. Galaxy's current ratio is 1.34, which is acceptable for its business model, meaning it has sufficient assets to cover its short-term liabilities. Still, some investors may be scared off by its balance sheet until the company's diversification efforts (AI infrastructure cash flows, digital asset fee businesses) take effect and reduce the negative impact of cryptocurrency on it. Galaxy Digital is a buy for aggressive growth investors Some of the company's risks make this investment unsuitable for conservative or value investors. However, although this company poses a high risk in both its crypto financial services and AI infrastructure businesses, some risk-taking, aggressive growth investors have an affinity for the company's high potential upside. Mordor Intelligence forecasts the asset tokenization market to grow from $2.08 trillion in 2025 to $13.55 trillion in 2030. Asset Tokenization has yet to really take off in the U.S. because government regulators have not yet fully established regulations for the market. However, those rules are likely to be in Galaxy's favor with a pro-crypto presidential administration behind them on crypto and Tokenization. Galaxy Digital has yet to disclose specific revenue figures for its tokenization activities, but tokenization revenue likely accounts for only a small fraction of the total addressable market. If the company positions itself as a top player in Tokenization, its digital assets business may have just as much, if not more, upside than its much-hyped AI infrastructure opportunity, which the company expects to bring in $1 billion in high-margin annual revenue over the next 15 years. If it builds out both segments, the stock has significant upside potential and may be worth the risk for aggressive growth investors. If you are a risk-tolerant investor looking for a potentially high-upside stock, this might be your cup of tea. I recommend a buy for aggressive growth investors.",GLXY|GLXY:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-06 11:30:04

Le argued that the company maintains its capacity to provide financing even during periods of decline in the BTC price. Phong Le responded to the market rumors that MicroStrategy would default on its dividend obligations or be forced to sell Bitcoin. He noted that these rumors were fueled by social media and some financial circles, saying: We weren't going to have any problems with our dividend payments, but to break this narrative, we decided to add US dollars to our balance sheet. We raised $1.44 billion in just 8.5 days. This amount covers our dividend obligation for 21 months. We did this both to put an end to the rumors and to prove that we can still raise money even when Bitcoin is in a down cycle. Related News: Bank of America Warns: “Everyone is Expecting a 25 Basis Point Interest Rate Cut, But...” Le, who admitted that the company acts like a “leveraged” version of Bitcoin, said, “While Bitcoin has 50% volatility, we have 70%. When BTC goes up, we go up more, and when it goes down, we go down more.” In a striking response to the presenter's question, “Would you ever consider selling BTC?”, the CEO stated that the company would not sell unless it faced liquidity issues. Le humorously explained that, according to current projections, such a liquidity squeeze would only be possible in very long-term scenarios: “If we run out of liquidity and lose access to the US dollar, we might be forced to sell. But by our calculations, that won't happen until 2065. By then, I probably won't be in this business.” Recalling that Bitcoin has seen an average annual increase of 45% over the last five years, Le argued that the debate about the asset's “uselessness” is now behind us. He noted that even giants like Vanguard and JP Morgan have changed their stance on BTC, adding that he believes the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise for the next 20 years. *This is not investment advice.

New York-based brokerage Clear Street is reportedly planning an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the firm at a staggering $2 billion. This move isn’t just another Wall Street listing; it signals a powerful convergence where traditional finance meets the strategic adoption of digital assets. For anyone watching the evolution of money, the Clear Street IPO is a landmark event to understand. What Does the Clear Street IPO Really Mean? The reported Clear Street IPO plans highlight a firm that has quietly become a powerhouse. While many know Clear Street for its role in massive stock and bond deals, its foray into cryptocurrency is what makes this story compelling. The company has managed approximately $91 billion in traditional transactions, but its work facilitating corporate Bitcoin purchases, like those for MicroStrategy, reveals its forward-thinking strategy. This IPO represents a vote of confidence in a new hybrid financial model. Why is Clear Street’s Crypto Connection a Game-Changer? Clear Street’s reported $2 billion valuation isn’t built on legacy services alone. The firm has positioned itself at the heart of a critical trend: corporations building strategic cryptocurrency reserves. By providing the infrastructure for these large-scale BTC acquisitions, Clear Street has become a trusted bridge. This demonstrates a crucial shift where established financial institutions are no longer just observing crypto but are actively enabling its integration into corporate treasury strategies. Consider the key benefits this model offers: Institutional Trust: Clear Street provides a familiar, regulated gateway for large companies to enter the crypto space. Operational Scale: The firm can handle the immense complexity and size of multi-billion dollar asset purchases. Strategic Insight: Their experience offers clients nuanced guidance on treasury diversification into digital assets. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Clear Street? However, the path forward is not without its hurdles. A successful Clear Street IPO will depend on navigating a complex landscape. The firm must balance its robust traditional business with the volatile and rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Regulatory scrutiny on digital assets remains intense, and Clear Street’s role as an intermediary will keep it firmly in the spotlight. Furthermore, convincing public market investors of the long-term value of this hybrid model will be its ultimate test. The Bigger Picture: A Signal for the Entire Market This potential public listing sends a powerful signal far beyond a single company’s balance sheet. It acts as a barometer for institutional crypto adoption. A successful Clear Street IPO at a $2 billion valuation would validate the business of servicing corporate crypto strategies. It could encourage other traditional financial players to accelerate their own digital asset offerings, thereby increasing liquidity, stability, and legitimacy for the entire ecosystem. In essence, Clear Street is demonstrating that the future of finance isn’t a choice between old and new, but a sophisticated blend of both. Conclusion: A Defining Moment in Finance The reported plans for a Clear Street IPO mark a defining moment. It showcases a premier financial institution capitalizing on the seismic shift toward digital assets. By going public with a valuation rooted in both its historic strength and its crypto-forward services, Clear Street is not just seeking capital—it’s making a statement about the future of money. This move could very well pave the way for a new generation of hybrid financial giants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Clear Street?

The chatbot presently leads the space, accounting for 50% of global downloads on mobile devices and 55% of the monthly active users. However, others are now outpacing the firm in other aspects. According to the report, Google AI chatbot Gemini has begun to outpace ChatGPT in terms of download growth, growth of monthly active users, and growth of time spent in the app. Over the next few months, an increase in those metrics could help push Gemini in front, narrowing the gap on ChatGPT. Interestingly, that development worries OpenAI, going by its recent “ code red ” memo. ChatGPT user growth slides as rivals heat the AI race According to reports , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has charged staff to focus on improving the company’s AI products, particularly in areas like personalization, reliability, image generation, and others. Looking at the recent data, it is clear that the race is not yet over between ChatGPT and Gemini, as both chatbots continue to see sizable amounts of growth. ChatGPT saw its global monthly users climb 180% year-over-year as of November, while Gemini saw a boost of 170%. The new data shows that ChatGPT’s global monthly active users only grew about 6% from August to November, reaching around 810 million. According to Sensor Tower, the figure shows that the artificial intelligence chatbot is nearing market saturation. Meanwhile, Gemini’s global monthly active users rose by 30% during the same time. The report noted that the release of its new image generation model, Nano Banana , drove increased adoption. In addition, the report highlighted that around two times more United States Android users are now engaging with Gemini directly through the Android operating system compared to using the standalone Gemini mobile application. This is expected to provide a competitive advantage to Google in the global market that has always been dominated by Android, as it means that Gemini can be used outside its mobile application or the company’s Web platform. Rivals heat the artificial intelligence race Gemini has also been increasing its share of the overall AI chatbot market when compared to other top applications, including ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Grok, and Perplexity . In the past seven months, between May and November 2025, Gemini saw its shares of global monthly active users rise by 3%, according to the report by Sensor Tower. On the other hand, ChatGPT saw its share of global monthly active users drop 3% over the past four months from August to November 2025. The report clarifies that ChatGPT may also be impacted by challenges from Perplexity and Claude, as both firms saw triple-digit growth for their respective chatbots in 2025, with Perplexity up by 370% year-over-year, while the latter was up by 190%. ChatGPT also witnessed a rise in its global downloads, rising to 85% year-over-year as of November, but the figure affected its overall cohort average growth of 110%. Perplexity and Gemini saw the largest growth, rising by 215% and 190% year-over-year, respectively. The report also mentioned that Gemini users’ time spent in the app has doubled in the past few months. As of November, Gemini users were spending 11 minutes per day in the app, up by 120% from March. This has been attributed to the popularity of its Nano Banana image generation model, which was released in September.

This achievement sets a powerful foundation for what comes next. The project is now shifting its gaze to 2026, outlining detailed plans for a token buyback program and a novel revenue model designed to create tangible, real-world value. Let’s break down this pivotal update and explore what it means for the future of the PIBBLE ecosystem. What Did PIBBLE Achieve in Its 2025 Roadmap? The recently updated white paper confirms that PIBBLE has delivered on its promises for the year. The team didn’t just meet targets; they executed a series of complex integrations and launches. Key milestones include the official debut of AION, their global service platform, which has already proven its concept. Furthermore, they successfully integrated an AI agent, established a multi-chain ecosystem, and rolled out an enhanced Tokenomics 2.0 structure. A major symbolic and economic move was the completion of its 10th token burn, a consistent practice to manage supply. Perhaps most notably, the integration with the high-speed Solana blockchain marks a strategic expansion of its capabilities and reach. How Will PIBBLE’s 2026 Plans Create Real-World Value? Looking ahead, the vision for 2026 is even more ambitious. PIBBLE aims to build a financial ecosystem where artificial intelligence and blockchain technology actively expand into the real-world economy. This isn’t just about digital assets in isolation. The core of this plan involves a new revenue model and a dedicated buyback program. Crucially, the funds for these initiatives won’t come from thin air. They will be generated organically through two primary channels: staking rewards and, more importantly, revenue from real-world usage of the PIBBLE platform and its AION service. This creates a direct link between ecosystem adoption and token value. What Are the Mechanics of the New Buyback and Burn Strategy? The 2026 strategy introduces a powerful economic engine. First, the buyback program will use a portion of the staking and usage revenue to purchase PIB tokens from the open market. This action directly increases demand. Second, the project plans to expand its token burn initiative within a new Web3 economic framework. By systematically removing tokens from circulation through burns, the relative scarcity of the remaining tokens is increased. Together, these mechanisms—buybacks and burns—are designed to create positive economic pressure and reward long-term holders who believe in the project’s utility. Organic Funding: Buybacks are funded by real platform revenue, not speculation. Supply Management: Expanded burn initiatives aim to reduce total token supply over time. Staking Incentives: Revenue sharing makes staking more attractive for network security. Utility Focus: Success hinges on real-world adoption of AION and other services. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for PIBBLE? While the plans are compelling, their success is not automatic. The primary challenge is execution and adoption. The new revenue model depends entirely on generating significant income from the AION platform and other services. This requires attracting a substantial user base in a competitive market. Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market’s volatility can impact token prices independently of project fundamentals. However, the opportunity is immense. By successfully linking tokenomics to verifiable platform revenue, PIBBLE could demonstrate a sustainable model for Web3 projects, moving beyond pure speculation to value-backed growth. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Sustainable Growth PIBBLE’s transition from completing a technical roadmap to announcing a financially-driven plan for 2026 marks a mature evolution. The focus has shifted from building infrastructure to activating a sustainable economic engine. The proposed buyback program and expanded burn, fueled by real usage, represent a serious attempt to align the project’s success with tokenholder value. For the crypto community, PIBBLE offers a case study in how blockchain projects can aim for tangible, revenue-based growth in the years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main goal of PIBBLE’s 2026 plan? A: The main goal is to create a sustainable financial ecosystem where AI and blockchain generate real-world revenue, which is then used to fund token buybacks and burns to benefit the ecosystem. Q: How will the 2026 buyback program be funded? A: The buyback program will be funded directly by revenue generated from staking activities and, more importantly, from real-world usage of the PIBBLE platform and its AION global service. Q: What is Tokenomics 2.0, which PIBBLE completed in 2025? A: Tokenomics 2.0 refers to an updated economic model for the PIB token. It likely includes revised structures for staking rewards, fee distribution, and supply management to better support the project’s long-term goals. Q: Why did PIBBLE integrate with Solana? A: Integrating with Solana allows PIBBLE to leverage Solana’s high speed and low transaction costs. This expands its multi-chain ecosystem, improves user experience, and potentially attracts users from the large Solana community. Q: What is the significance of the 10th token burn? A: The 10th token burn demonstrates a consistent commitment to reducing the total supply of PIB tokens. This can increase scarcity over time, which, combined with growing demand, is a core part of the project’s value-accrual strategy.

For millions in high-inflation countries, this is a harsh reality. Now, a global financial giant is stepping in with a powerful solution. Western Union is launching a groundbreaking stablecoin card , a move that could redefine financial security for vulnerable populations worldwide. This isn’t just another crypto product; it’s a targeted lifeline designed to protect purchasing power where it’s needed most. What is Western Union’s New Stablecoin Card? According to reports from Criptonoticias, Western Union is preparing to launch a prepaid card directly linked to a digital dollar. This card will be funded by a new dollar-pegged stablecoin called USDPT, which will operate on the fast and efficient Solana blockchain. The primary goal is straightforward: to offer users in economies suffering from hyperinflation a safe harbor for their money. Instead of holding local currency that may depreciate rapidly, users can hold USDPT, whose value is tied to the US dollar. The company plans to roll out this initiative early next year. This strategic timing indicates a serious commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for tangible social impact. Therefore, this project represents a significant bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. Why Target High-Inflation Countries? The rationale behind this move is both compassionate and logical. Countries like Argentina, Turkey, and Venezuela have seen their local currencies plummet, eroding citizens’ ability to buy essentials. A stablecoin card acts as a shield against this devaluation. Here are the core benefits for users: Preserved Purchasing Power: Money held as USDPT maintains its value relative to the US dollar. Everyday Usability: Unlike purely digital assets, the card allows for spending at regular merchants. Financial Inclusion: It provides access to dollar-denominated stability without needing a foreign bank account. Speed and Low Cost: Leveraging the Solana blockchain enables fast and inexpensive transactions. How Will the USDPT Stablecoin Work on Solana? Choosing the Solana blockchain is a key technical decision. Solana is known for its high throughput and low transaction fees, making it ideal for a payment-focused stablecoin card . The USDPT stablecoin will be fully backed by reserves, likely in US dollars or equivalent assets, ensuring each token is redeemable for one dollar. This model, similar to giants like USDC, provides the trust and stability necessary for mainstream adoption. For the end-user, the process will be seamless. They can convert local currency into USDPT, load it onto their prepaid card, and use it anywhere major cards are accepted. This integration of blockchain rails with a physical card is a masterstroke in user-friendly design. What Are the Potential Challenges? Despite the promise, the path forward has hurdles. Regulatory approval will be paramount in each target country. Governments with capital controls may view dollar-pegged tools with suspicion. Moreover, educating a new user base about digital wallets and stablecoins presents a significant challenge. Western Union’s vast physical agent network could be crucial here, providing the human touch needed to onboard users unfamiliar with crypto. Furthermore, the success of the stablecoin card hinges on widespread merchant acceptance and reliable liquidity for converting between USDPT and local currencies. Western Union’s existing remittance infrastructure may give it a unique advantage in solving these operational puzzles. A Compelling Summary: A New Chapter in Financial Defense Western Union’s venture is more than a product launch; it’s a statement. It signals that major financial institutions now see blockchain-based solutions as essential tools for global economic stability. This stablecoin card has the potential to empower individuals, offering a practical defense against the devastating effects of inflation. If successful, it could inspire a wave of similar innovations, bringing the stability of digital dollars to the pockets of those who need it most. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a stablecoin card? A stablecoin card is a prepaid payment card linked to a stablecoin—a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar. It allows you to spend the value of the stablecoin anywhere that accepts card payments. 2. When will Western Union’s stablecoin card be available? Reports indicate a planned launch early next year, though an exact date has not been officially confirmed. 3. Which countries will have access to this card? While not officially listed, the card is specifically targeted at nations experiencing high inflation, such as those in Latin America and Africa. 4. Do I need a crypto wallet to use the card? Details are still emerging, but the design suggests Western Union will manage the underlying stablecoin holdings, allowing users to interact primarily with the familiar card interface. 5. How is the USDPT stablecoin different from others? USDPT will be issued by Western Union on the Solana blockchain, distinguishing it from stablecoins like USDC or USDT which operate on multiple chains. 6. Are there any fees associated with the card? Fee structures have not been disclosed. However, competitive pricing will be critical for adoption in its target markets. Join the Financial Revolution This move by Western Union could be a watershed moment for practical cryptocurrency adoption. Do you know someone living in an economy affected by inflation who could benefit from this information?

The 3-Key Drivers For Bitcoin $100k Year-end Target The first and most critical driver is the shift in Federal Reserve monetary policy. After months of reducing liquidity through quantitative tightening, where the central bank stopped reinvesting proceeds from maturing bonds and Treasury holdings, the Fed ended this program on December 1 . Markets are now positioning for an easing cycle. QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING DONE ; WHAT’S NEXT FOR $BTC ? Historically, Bitcoin and altcoins struggle during prolonged Quantitative Tightening (QT = red zone), which lasted three years and just ended on December 1, 2025. What usually follows: an uptrend (black zone). Once… https://t.co/oosjrrFd0E pic.twitter.com/VzxaTLa4bn — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) December 6, 2025 Data from the CME FedWatch Tool reveals that traders see an 87% likelihood of a rate reduction at the upcoming Wednesday meeting, with three additional cuts anticipated by September 2026. This policy shift comes as tech sector borrowing costs rise amid substantial AI infrastructure debt , creating conditions where investors may seek alternative stores of value. The combination of these factors could provide the momentum needed for Bitcoin to cross the six-figure threshold in the coming weeks. The second driver is liquidity structure. According to order-book data from CoinGlass, Bitcoin currently has two significant liquidity clusters: the downside liquidity around $90,000, which is currently being tested, and upside liquidity near $94,500. If the latter is breached, a rally toward $100,000 becomes highly probable. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Rising Channel Points to $100k Breakout The third driver comes from technical analysis , which suggests a $100,000 recovery if BTC breaches the $95,000 resistance. The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin trading inside a rising channel, though the latest rejection near mid-range has pushed price back toward the lower trendline. The key support level holding the structure together is $84,000. If BTC stays above that line, the overall channel remains intact, and a rebound toward $95,000 resistance becomes likely. Source: TradingView A breakout above $95,000 would flip the structure bullish and open the path toward the $100,000 region, the next major liquidity target. However, RSI has cooled off sharply and is leaning bearish, indicating weakened momentum. If Bitcoin loses $84,000, the rising channel breaks down, and price could slide toward longer-term support around $80,000. Maxi Doge Presale Gains Traction While Bitcoin awaits bullish confirmation, Maxi Doge (MAXI) is emerging as a notable Ethereum-based meme coin with ambitions to replicate Dogecoin’s success story. MAXI is channeling the community-driven energy that propelled DOGE from $0.00008547 in 2015 to its current $0.138 price, a remarkable +161,800x gain. While replicating that exact trajectory may be ambitious, analysts believe Maxi Doge can deliver a modest 10-50x return for early adopters. MAXI has now raised over $4.2 million and is building a vibrant community where holders share trading setups, early opportunities, and alpha insights. Beyond the meme appeal, 25% of raised funds will be deployed into high-potential plays, with profits reinvested directly into marketing to fuel exponential growth and community rewards. To join the presale at the current $0.0002715 price, visit the official Maxi Doge website . Then connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Best Wallet , and pay with ETH, BNB, or USDT. You can swap existing crypto or use a bank card to invest in seconds.

Despite initial hopes of a resurgence in late November, the premier cryptocurrency is now 29.16% away from its all-time high. Going by the price action, popular analyst with the X username PlanD postulates BTC is now in consolidation guided by two major price levels. Related Reading: The $13.5 Billion Liquidity Injection That Could Send Bitcoin And Crypto Prices Flying Bitcoin Moves In Key Range Between $85,000-$93,000, Market Breakout Awaits In an X post on December 5, PlanD provides an update on a continued analysis of the Bitcoin market, stating the crypto market leader appears to be building momentum within a set price range. Notably, recent price action has pushed the flagship cryptocurrency below the lower boundary of a broadening ascending channel between $93,000 and $131,000, raising fears of a bear market. However, Bitcoin has repeatedly rebounded, forming a strong consolidation range between $85,400 and $93,000. PlanD defines the present market condition as Bitcoin being in a decision zone and needing a price breakout to determine its next major direction. The analyst states that if Bitcoin moves to overcome the price resistance at $93,000, its initial price target lies at $100,000. A successful reclaim of this psychological six-figure level would confirm renewed bullish intent and stronger potential for a full market revival. On the other hand, if Bitcoin breaks below the vital support zone at $85,300, investors should expect steeper losses. In this case, PlanD projects a price drop to around $72,000, representing a potential 19% decline from present market prices. Notably, considering the recent market volatility, the ongoing consolidation may close out sooner than expected, to establish a clear market direction.

Following the turbulent price action of the last week, BTC’s price struggles in Q4 continue against previous popular predictions. Still, several bullish indicators could support a rebound before year-end. Key catalysts include a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on December 9–10. In addition, market sentiment is benefiting from speculation that pro-crypto economist Kevin Hassett could succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair in 2026.

Bitnomial’s new regulatory breakthrough places XRP on a direct path toward deeper institutional acceptance. This moment signals rising maturity within the market and marks a turning point for how XRP integrates with U.S. financial systems. The decision sets the stage for broader adoption and greatly strengthens XRP’s long-term strategic position. XRP Update drew attention to this development and emphasized its significance for the U.S. regulatory landscape. The information quickly gained confirmation across industry channels, reinforcing the event’s importance. The filing is not speculative or experimental. It is an approved step within the American regulatory framework and represents a real evolution for XRP. This shift reflects increasing recognition of XRP’s relevance in regulated environments. Here’s Why Bitnomial’s $XRP Filing Is a Game Changer pic.twitter.com/MqHd1FfwUi — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) December 5, 2025 A Regulated Foundation for XRP Bitnomial operates under full CFTC supervision and follows strict compliance requirements. This regulatory status places it among well-established U.S. derivatives venues that offer audited, transparent financial products. The exchange must meet oversight obligations involving surveillance, reporting, and operational integrity. The proposed XRP/USD spot contract will function inside that supervised environment. This level of direct federal oversight represents a major milestone for XRP, because it aligns the asset with established U.S. regulatory protections. Opening the Door for Institutional Access Banks, hedge funds, and asset managers often face strict internal rules that limit engagement with unregulated markets. These restrictions prevent many large institutions from touching offshore or loosely supervised crypto platforms. A regulated XRP spot market removes this barrier and provides a compliant entry point for institutional capital. Institutions can now interact with XRP via a platform that meets federal transparency and custody requirements. This shift unlocks participation from large financial players seeking secure exposure to digital assets. Building the Structure for Advanced Products A supervised spot market creates essential groundwork for sophisticated financial instruments. Futures, options, settlement tools, and structured products all require reliable and compliant spot pricing. Bitnomial already supports XRP and RLUSD within its margin framework, demonstrating its technical capacity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This expands the potential for engineered financial instruments built directly on top of the XRP market. Improved infrastructure encourages broader institutional activity and strengthens the ecosystem’s long-term liquidity. A Confirmed Timeline Toward Integration The filing sets December 3, 2025, as the official launch date for the XRP/USD spot contract. This timeline signals an organized and deliberate rollout under federal supervision. The upcoming launch provides greater market visibility and reduces uncertainty for participants. Once live, the contract will offer a transparent spot price that aligns with U.S. regulatory expectations. This change should strengthen market depth, enhance liquidity, and improve overall price efficiency. What This Means for XRP’s Market Position Through this regulatory achievement, XRP gains a stronger identity in U.S. finance. Retail participants may benefit from improved liquidity and more reliable market behavior. Institutional investors finally get the compliant channel they’ve been waiting for. Developers and payment platforms may also build new solutions once a regulated price foundation is available. This filing accelerates XRP’s movement toward mainstream adoption and reinforces its relevance within the evolving digital economy. Bitnomial’s filing marks a foundational shift for XRP and delivers the regulatory certainty institutions demand. It positions XRP more firmly inside the U.S. financial framework and supports its growing role in global payment infrastructure. This moment could reshape XRP’s market dynamics and strengthen its long-term institutional appeal. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

A new report from Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, delivers an optimistic forecast: Bitcoin is entering a recovery phase this month . This analysis points to a significant shift in market dynamics, suggesting December could mark a pivotal turning point for investors. Let’s explore the compelling evidence behind this bullish outlook. What Signals the Start of the Bitcoin Recovery Phase? According to Coinbase’s December 5th analysis, cited by BeInCrypto, several macroeconomic and on-chain factors are aligning to create a fertile ground for growth. The primary catalyst is a dramatic change in monetary policy expectations. Markets now price in a 90% probability of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This expectation acts as a powerful tailwind for risk assets like Bitcoin, as lower rates typically increase liquidity and investor appetite for growth. Furthermore, the U.S. M2 money supply—a broad measure of cash and checking deposits—has ballooned to a record $22.3 trillion. This immense liquidity needs a destination, and with traditional markets facing uncertainty, cryptocurrency is becoming an increasingly attractive harbor. The stage is set for capital to flow back into digital assets. How is Bitcoin Supply Pressure Easing? A critical component of any sustainable Bitcoin recovery phase is a reduction in selling pressure. Coinbase highlights a crucial development: long-term Bitcoin holders have significantly slowed their selling. These investors, often called ‘HODLers,’ have weathered previous downturns and their decision to hold tight reduces the available supply on exchanges. This creates a classic supply shock scenario. When new demand meets a constrained supply, the only direction for price is up. The report notes this easing of supply constraints removes a major headwind that has plagued the market for months. Long-Term Holder Selling Dries Up: Reduced selling from steadfast investors stabilizes the market floor. Supply Shock Potential: Constrained supply colliding with rising demand creates upward price pressure. Improved Market Structure: The exit of weak hands leaves a stronger, more conviction-driven holder base. What Does a “Risk-On” Environment Mean for Crypto? The final piece of the puzzle is the return of a ‘risk-on’ market sentiment. When investors feel confident about the economic future, they move capital away from safe-haven assets (like bonds or the dollar) and into higher-risk, higher-reward investments. Cryptocurrency sits firmly in this category. Coinbase suggests that the current environment, characterized by anticipated rate cuts and high liquidity, is perfect for facilitating the return of these risk-on funds. New capital inflows are already being observed, which could act as a powerful accelerator for the Bitcoin recovery phase . This isn’t just about existing crypto traders reshuffling portfolios; it’s about fresh money entering the ecosystem. Actionable Insights for the Current Bitcoin Recovery Phase While the report is bullish, savvy investors should navigate this period with both optimism and caution. A recovery phase is not a straight line up; it often includes volatility and pullbacks. Therefore, consider a strategy of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build a position over time rather than investing a lump sum all at once. Furthermore, keep a close eye on the very factors Coinbase identified. Any shift away from Fed rate cut expectations or a resurgence in long-term holder selling could signal a change in momentum. Use this analysis as a framework, not a guarantee. Conclusion: A Cautiously Optimistic Turning Point The convergence of supportive macroeconomics, easing supply pressure, and returning investor confidence paints a compelling picture. Coinbase’s report provides a data-driven case that the Bitcoin recovery phase is not just hopeful speculation but is grounded in observable market shifts. For investors who have patiently endured the downturn, this analysis offers a well-reasoned argument for renewed optimism as we close the year. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does Coinbase mean by a ‘recovery phase’ for Bitcoin? A: A recovery phase refers to a period where the asset transitions from a prolonged downtrend or consolidation into a new uptrend, supported by improving fundamentals and market structure, like increased demand and reduced selling pressure. Q2: How reliable is the 90% probability of a Fed rate cut? A: This probability is derived from the CME FedWatch Tool, which analyzes prices of federal funds futures contracts. While it reflects market expectations powerfully, it is not a Fed announcement and can change with new economic data. Q3: Why does less selling from long-term holders matter so much? A: Long-term holders own a significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply. When they stop selling, it drastically reduces the daily sell-side pressure, making it easier for even modest new buying demand to push prices higher. Q4: Should I invest all my money now based on this report? A> No. This report highlights a positive shift, but it is not financial advice. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification and a long-term perspective are key. Q5: Could this recovery phase reverse quickly? A> Yes. Crypto markets are volatile. Negative macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, or a shift in the Fed’s messaging could impact sentiment. A recovery phase is a process, not a single event. Q6: Besides Bitcoin, what other cryptocurrencies might benefit? A> Historically, a strong Bitcoin recovery phase often lifts the entire crypto market, particularly major altcoins (like Ethereum) and sectors aligned with the prevailing bullish narrative, such as DeFi or Layer 2 solutions.

The City Cyber Crime Police accused the Gujarat native of scamming an unsuspecting victim by promising him high returns through investments in digital assets. The accused, Parmar Prateek Bipinbhai of Bapunagar, was taken into custody by the Indian police. The 25-year-old was arrested in Ahmedabad, with the Indian police noting that he had already converted the stolen funds into crypto and other forms of digital assets before smuggling them abroad. Indian native arrested in connection to crypto investment scam According to the Indian police, the victim, a doctor, was contacted via mobile applications WhatsApp and Telegram. He was lured by the suspect under the guise of making profits from digital assets. After several chats with the accused, he was then asked to deposit funds into a bank account that was provided. Police claimed that upon investigation, they discovered that the funds were eventually transferred to an account managed by the accused. After the victim discovered that he had been scammed, he alerted the Indian police, which moved swiftly into action. The police sent a special team, conducting searches in Ahmedabad and nearby areas, before successfully apprehending the suspect. He was arraigned before the Thiruvananthapuram Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court (ACJM), where he pleaded his case. The Judge ordered that he be remanded in custody until investigations are finalized. According to the Indian police, this is his third arrest in a similar case. Digital scams are on the rise in India There has been an uptick in fraud cases across the country since the beginning of the year. Suspects have taken it up a notch, using artificial intelligence to alter videos, frightening victims into parting with their funds. A similar case was reported this week when a senior citizen was coerced into transferring funds to criminals in what is described as a “digital arrest.” The Indian police claimed that they threatened the elderly citizens with arrest in a fake case that they claimed was registered at the Colaba Police Station in Mumbai. The scammers even went ahead to show the victim a fake courtroom via video calls, telling him that he would be kept under surveillance because he is a senior citizen. The Indian police claimed that the criminals kept him under surveillance and away from his family, exerting psychological pressure on him. Acting on their instructions, the senior citizen was asked to transfer Rs. 28 lakh to an SBI account before being asked to transfer Rs. 24 lakh to another bank account in November. They claimed the payments were part of a verification process that they would use to help him avoid a jail term. However, the fraud surfaced later that month after the man’s son discovered he had been kept under video surveillance by the criminals . The family approached the Indian police and filed a report with the Cyber Crime Police. He claimed that the criminals constantly threatened and harassed him with arrests if he did not comply with their bidding. He has also initiated action to recover his funds from the criminals. Meanwhile, the police said they are presently on the trail of the suspects and would update the general public. They also asked the public to be careful of these kinds of scams and report them to the police.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-activity-just-went-vertical-heres-what-happened/,"The XRP market entered December with unusual movement on its network data. The asset’s price remained near $2.1, yet the chart from CryptoQuant revealed a shift that caught the interest of XRP holders. Coin Bureau, a cryptocurrency education platform, shared the chart, showing how rapidly the setup developed. Velocity Surges to a New High Coin Bureau’s chart showed a sharp rise in velocity. The spike towered over the previous months, setting a new high for 2025. Velocity measures the rate at which tokens move across the network. When this number rises, it signals heavy transfers. Traders often see this as a sign of fresh liquidity entering the market . The recent move appeared at a point where price volatility had cooled. The chart showed a clear clustering of high-velocity bars around late November and early December. This region stood out far more than in earlier months. Activity jumped from levels near 0.005 to peaks above 0.03. The climb happened while XRP was closer to $2. That combination suggests continued movement by whales and other active traders. It also showed that market participants moved XRP at a scale not seen since September. XRP ACTIVITY JUST WENT VERTICAL! Per CryptoQuant, the massive surge in $XRP velocity signals rising liquidity and heavy trader or whale movement. pic.twitter.com/Cc9ekL4HEh — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) December 4, 2025 What This Means for XRP Holders XRP holders now watch for signs that the activity will send into the price. High velocity often appears before major shifts in market behavior. It does not confirm a direction, but it confirms engagement from investors. Fresh liquidity reduces the chance of stagnation. It also gives XRP more room to form a notable trend. Multiple analysts recently shared bullish XRP predictions . The chart displays a long period of mixed activity through early 2025. Most of the earlier spikes did not cause large price swings, but this new cluster is more notable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP moved sideways between October and November. The network then registered one of its strongest bursts with the market still at a low level. Holders often view this combination as a constructive setup. It signals that traders continue to reposition instead of stepping away. What Comes Next for XRP The recent rise in activity may also reflect stronger interaction from institutions and whales. Velocity spikes of this scale always result from large transfers rather than many small retail rallies. This does not reveal intent, but it shows commitment from active participants. The next stage for XRP depends on whether the market builds on this activity. If velocity stays high, liquidity may continue to flow into the asset. The price reacts more quickly when liquidity increases, often resulting in sharper moves. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This article delves into the dynamics at play, shedding light on how these key cryptocurrencies are performing and which ones are poised for an upward trend. This analysis is powered by Outset PR , a crypto PR firm that uses data, trends, and timing to transform breakthrough moments into brand growth. Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid Price Challenges, Eyes on Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Bitcoin is currently positioned in a trading range between the high eighty-six thousand dollar mark and just under ninety-four thousand dollars. The cryptocurrency is attempting to surpass its immediate resistance level, situated above ninety-seven thousand dollars. Despite recent one-month and six-month declines of over ten percent and thirteen percent, respectively, bullish sentiment remains. Optimistic players anticipate a climb to over one hundred and five thousand dollars, which would represent an approximate thirteen percent increase from its present value. The Relative Strength Index suggests the coin is not overbought, indicating potential for upward movement if market momentum increases, though it currently faces selling pressure. Traders should closely monitor key resistance points and broader market sentiment for future direction. XRP Hovering Below Key Resistance, Eyes on Potential 20% Spike Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between just over two dollars and almost two and a third dollars. It sits below a critical resistance level just over two dollars and forty cents. This zone acts like a ceiling for the price. If XRP can break through this ceiling, it has room to potentially rise by about sixteen percent toward the second resistance mark of two dollars and sixty-eight cents. XRP's price has dropped slightly over the past week and month, yet the modest decline is largely within expectations. While recent momentum feels slow, a climb above current resistance could spark a notable upward trend for XRP. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Chainlink Eyes Potential Growth with Current Market Position Source: tradingview Chainlink's price currently hovers between around $12 and $14. Recently, it's seen a weekly uptick of around five percent, though it slipped by nearly five percent over the past month. With an RSI near 40, it hints that more buyers might step in soon. The immediate challenge is breaking the $14 mark. If it surpasses this, enthusiasm could push it towards the $15 region. On the flip side, the next support is around $10. If Chainlink rides the bullish wave and breaks past both resistance levels, we could witness a potential rise of about 30%. However, holding its position is key for any upward momentum. Conclusion BTC continues to show strong performance. While XRP and Chainlink are striving to regain their positions, BTC solidifies its strength. XRP and LINK are making efforts to recover, but BTC's dominance remains clear. The market dynamics reflect BTC's robustness amid the ongoing attempts of XRP and Chainlink to bounce back. The performance gap highlights BTC's position as a leading force, with XRP and LINK working to catch up. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The invitation comes amid debates between privacy advocates and prominent figures like Strategy founder Michael Saylor, who is not in support of implementing Zcash-style privacy features in Bitcoin. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force will be hosting the roundtable at its headquarters with proceedings webcast to the public. Privacy is up and to the right The SEC roundtable represents a pivotal moment as regulators, industry leaders, and privacy advocates seek common ground. Other blockchains are now working on privacy-related products and services. Paxos and Aleo announced in October that they had partnered to create a private and compliant stablecoin. Also, the Ethereum Foundation launched a dedicated privacy team around the same period. With institutional interest building and philosophical debates on the rise, Zcash finds itself at the center of a brewing conversation about financial privacy in the digital age. Bitcoin maximalists and privacy advocates clash The roundtable announcement coincides with a growing philosophical battle over financial privacy in cryptocurrency. On December 5, Eli Ben-Sasson, a Zcash founding scientist who is now the CEO of StarkWare, revealed details of his conversation with Saylor that reignited market interest in the privacy coin. Saylor argued that Bitcoin should not incorporate Zcash-style privacy features because doing so would enable nation-states to shut down the flagship cryptocurrency. Ben-Sasson countered , saying that “There’s a way to have the cake and eat it too.” To him, viewing keys can be allowed alongside shielding. Cryptopolitan reported in November when Hunter Horsley, chief executive officer of Bitwise, posted on X , “The ‘Bitcoin only, everything else is a scam’ crowd — Is going to get really twisted trying to figure out what to say about Zcash.” He added, “Looking forward to the creative explanations of why Zcash is not ‘crypto.’” Horsley’s comments sparked a heated debate that brought renewed attention to the privacy coin just as Zcash briefly surged toward $700 in November. Privacy advocate Naomi Brockwell also shared her thoughts on the matter last month, stating, ”Authoritarians thrive when people have no privacy. When those in charge start being hostile to privacy protections, it is a major red flag.” Zcash momentum builds on institutional interest Zcash regained footing above the $375 level on December 5 following the exchange between Saylor and Ben-Sasson. The cryptocurrency is currently trading near $340, down by 10% in the past 24 hours as of the time of writing. ZEC price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap However, its latest figures still show recovery from a decline in late November, the same month in which it exceeded $700, its highest price level this year and in a long time. Institutional interest has grown with Grayscale filing an S-3 registration statement seeking to convert its existing Zcash Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund. If approved, it would be the first Zcash ETF in the US. The trust currently holds approximately 2.4% of the ZEC in circulation as of September 30, 2025. Nasdaq-listed insurance group Reliance Global Group converted its entire digital treasury into Zcash, while VanEck’s CEO Jan van Eck flagged Zcash as an alternative to Bitcoin, citing growing concerns over Bitcoin’s long-term cryptographic security and privacy limitations.

The digital asset is trading at around $2.03 at the time of writing. Despite the downward trajectory, technical analysis points toward a possible trend reversal that could push prices toward the $2.50 resistance level. XRP price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Market analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a significant development. The TD Sequential indicator has flashed a bullish signal on XRP's weekly chart. This technical tool identifies moments when prevailing trends lose momentum and may reverse direction. The current setup suggests the prolonged selling phase could be ending. The cryptocurrency has been consolidating through late November. This tightening range indicates reduced downside pressure. The most recent weekly candle formation strengthens the argument for an upward move if buying interest returns. Technical Structure Points to $2.50 Target The TD Sequential works as a timing mechanism for traders. It flags exhaustion points in both uptrends and downtrends. When the indicator turns positive after an extended decline, it often precedes a recovery phase. XRP's market structure supports this technical outlook. The asset has established a pattern of lower volatility after weeks of consistent losses. If momentum builds from this setup, the next critical level sits at $2.50. This zone previously served as a key pivot point during the autumn rally. Price action needs to hold above $2 for the bullish scenario to remain valid. A break below this support would invalidate the reversal thesis and could trigger additional selling. Extreme Fear in Social Sentiment Creates Contrarian Opportunity Beyond technical indicators, social sentiment data reveals extreme negativity surrounding XRP. Santiment research shows the asset has dropped 31% over two months. Market participants are expressing the highest levels of fear and doubt since October. The data tracks abnormal spikes in bearish commentary across social platforms. These ”Fear Zone” signals have increased dramatically in recent weeks. The shift stands in contrast to Bitcoin's relatively stable sentiment readings. Historical patterns suggest these fear extremes often coincide with short-term rebounds. The most recent comparable situation occurred on November 21. XRP rallied 22% over the following three days as sentiment improved. The move ended when crowd psychology shifted to greed. Current conditions mirror the previous setup. Analysts believe the deeply pessimistic mood creates conditions for a counter-trend bounce. If anxiety unwinds as it did in late November, XRP could see a surge in relief buying. The challenge will be sustaining momentum without triggering excessive optimism, which has historically capped rallies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-06 12:51:37

This digital currency has managed to break through a key resistance level, sparking speculation about a potential shift in its market direction. Could this be a sign of new growth opportunities? The following article delves into the details, exploring which cryptocurrencies might be poised for a rise. In an environment where focus and narratives constantly shift, timely interventions and sustained visibility are paramount. This is why data-driven agencies like Outset PR go beyond merely tracking token prices; they also monitor the wider media environment. Outset Data Pulse delivers current intelligence on crypto media performance, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of PR campaigns. Polkadot Eyes Recovery Amid Volatile Cryptocurrency Market Source: tradingview Polkadot's price is hovering between low $2s and mid $2s, showing signs of a potential bounce back. Despite a drop of over 10% in the past month and nearly 45% in six months, the current price rests above a key support level just above $2. If demand picks up, it might climb to the nearest resistance near $2.50, representing a gain of around 10%. A breakout could see it moving towards the next resistance just below $2.70, pushing gains to over 20%. The Relative Strength Index of under 40 suggests it may still be oversold, adding to the chances of recovery. However, recovery remains tentative and depends on market conditions. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Conclusion DOT appears to have made a significant move by breaking its downtrend line. This development suggests that a trend reversal could be in progress. Investors monitor such changes closely as they may indicate potential growth. Whether this will lead to sustained upward movement remains to be seen but breaking a downtrend is often seen as a positive sign. Tracking further performance will help in understanding the true impact of this shift. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Slok stated that current economic data and market conditions point to maintaining tight monetary policy. While there are concerns in the markets that the credit cycle could worsen, Slok said the data suggests otherwise. “When you look at default rates for high-yield bonds and loans, they've been declining for the last six months. So we're not at the beginning of a credit cycle,” Slok said. Related News: Bank of America Warns: “Everyone is Expecting a 25 Basis Point Interest Rate Cut, But...” Slok emphasized that the labor market remains resilient, arguing that unemployment benefit applications are at very low levels and that, according to Indeed data, job postings are trending upward. Slok noted that the slowdown in labor force growth stems not from a lack of demand but from a decline in immigration rates, and he noted that inflation is still solidified at 3%. “Inflation is expected to hover around 3% for the next 12 months. It wouldn't be right to cut interest rates when the Fed's target is 2% and inflation is so sticky.” *This is not investment advice.

Paid ads may drive clicks, but they rarely build trust. In crypto, reputation is earned through consistent narratives, verified information, and coverage from respected, independent voices. Why PR Matters in Crypto — And Why Visibility Alone Doesn’t Build Trust In traditional industries, visibility can often be enough to spark interest. But in crypto, visibility without credibility is meaningless. Crypto audiences look for independent, third-party proof before they believe anything a project says about itself. That proof often comes in the form of: respected media coverage, credible industry commentary, expert analysis from journalists, and consistent presence across reputable publications. This is why PR is indispensable. The right agency can shape your project’s narrative, position your founders as authoritative voices, and ensure that tier-1 media and AI systems reflect your brand accurately and fairly. In an industry where trust gaps are large and entry barriers are low, earned media is often the deciding factor between projects that thrive and those that fade into the background. With this context in mind, here are the top 5 PR agencies in Web3 that specialise in building real, lasting reputation. 1. Outset PR — Tier-1 Pitching and Reputation Building 🔗Website: https://www.outsetpr.io/ Outset PR is one of the few agencies in Web3 that specialises in earned tier-1 coverage — not paid placements, not generic press distribution, but real editorial visibility in publications that genuinely shape market perception. Their work focuses on crafting sharp, journalist-ready angles and pitching directly to trusted reporters at outlets like Forbes, VentureBeat, Investing.com, and other high-authority media. Unlike agencies that rely on mass-market press releases, Outset PR builds each campaign around what top editors actually want: relevance, clarity, expertise, and news value. This is why their stories consistently pass editorial scrutiny and why tier-1 reporters view their pitches as credible and worth opening. Outset PR’s strength lies in transforming a project’s internal expertise into story angles that resonate with influential journalists and deliver meaningful reputation outcomes. Core Principles Sharp story and angle selection that highlights a project’s real expertise Journalist-ready briefs designed specifically for top-tier reporters Direct tier-1 pitching to trusted editors and credible media contacts Fast reactions to news cycles to capture timely opportunities End-to-end management from first outreach to published stories Outset PR’s Real Cases StealthEX — Combined thought leadership + tier-1 pitching delivered26 PR mentions, dozens of syndications, and a total reach of over 3.6 billion.

FAQ: Crypto PR and Reputation Building Why do crypto projects need PR if they can run ads or build on social media? Because ads generate visibility, not trust. In crypto, audiences rely on third-party validation — reporters, analysts, and respected media — before they believe a project’s claims. PR provides this external credibility in a way ads cannot. What’s the difference between paid media and earned media? Paid media refers to sponsored placements, advertorials, and distribution packages. Earned media is editorial coverage published because a journalist finds the story relevant and credible. Earned media carries far more trust, especially in Web3 where audiences are skeptical of anything that looks paid. How does PR actually help a Web3 project grow? Effective PR clarifies a project’s narrative for the market, positions founders and technical leaders as experts, and ensures accurate representation across major publications. This combination strengthens brand trust and supports listings, partnerships, presales, and user acquisition. How do top crypto PR agencies secure tier-1 coverage? They don’t rely on mass press releases. Instead, they: craft angles that match what editors want, build relationships with credible reporters, pitch stories with clear expertise and news value, move quickly around market events and narratives. This is why agencies like Outset PR consistently earn features in major media outlets. Conclusion In Web3, trust is earned, not bought. Visibility alone can spark curiosity, but it cannot answer the deeper questions investors and users ask: Is this project credible? Is the team legitimate? Does the broader industry take them seriously? The agencies in this ranking each bring their own strengths — from global ecosystem storytelling to institutional-grade communications — but they share one critical ability: turning a project’s internal expertise into external validation that lasts. Among the agencies capable of delivering this level of credibility, Outset PR stands out for its consistent track record in securing meaningful tier-1 features and crafting journalist-ready narratives that pass editorial scrutiny.

Traders are watching closely because momentum has shifted after a period of consolidation. Market participants often react quickly when trend-based indicators show signs of exhaustion. The latest development suggests that XRP may be approaching a significant turning point. Ali shared the chart that triggered the renewed discussion, highlighting a clear TD Sequential buy signal on XRP. His post gained rapid traction because the indicator has a long track record in identifying reversals. The alert appeared on a key timeframe, which increased trader interest and fueled broader market analysis across social platforms. The TD Sequential is designed to spot trend exhaustion and potential reversal zones. It includes a setup phase that counts nine consecutive candles aligned with the prevailing trend. When this sequence completes, the indicator suggests that momentum may be weakening. Traders value the TD Sequential because it highlights likely turning points with structured rules. It also works across different timeframes, which increases its utility during volatile movements. $XRP is a buy, according to the TD Sequential. pic.twitter.com/uI9s9Qwu6Y — Ali (@ali_charts) December 5, 2025 XRP’s Current Technical Position XRP recently experienced a notable correction after its previous rally. The pullback pushed price action toward an important area of support. The TD Sequential buy signal appeared exactly at this point, suggesting possible selling fatigue. This alignment increases confidence for traders searching for early reversal signs. The signal does not guarantee instant upside, but it highlights a meaningful shift in short-term dynamics. Why This Signal Matters Now The market environment adds weight to the current setup. XRP has traded within a tightening range, creating tension between buyers and sellers. A confirmed reversal could break that pattern and restore positive momentum. Traders often monitor these moments because they can trigger renewed liquidity. Ali’s alert arrived at a time when many participants were waiting for a decisive technical cue. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Psychology and Sentiment Reversal signals influence sentiment strongly, especially during corrective phases. A TD Sequential buy alert can reduce bearish pressure and attract early buyers looking for discounted entries. Increased interest often improves trading activity and narrows spreads. If the signal gains confirmation through volume or stronger candles, momentum traders may enter more aggressively. This dynamic can accelerate a short-term trend change and strengthen price stability. How Traders Can Approach the Setup A structured approach is essential when trading reversal signals. Traders should confirm the TD Sequential with support levels and volume behavior. Monitoring higher timeframes helps validate the overall direction. Clear risk management protects against unexpected volatility. Stops should be placed below recent structural lows to limit downside exposure. A disciplined plan ensures traders respond to data rather than emotion. What This Means for XRP The TD Sequential buy signal gives XRP a constructive short-term outlook. The setup suggests a possible shift toward renewed strength. Market participants will watch upcoming candles closely for confirmation. A validated reversal could spark a broader recovery and rebuild positive sentiment around the asset. XRP now stands at an important technical moment. Ali’s alert highlights a meaningful opportunity supported by a respected indicator. Traders who approach the setup with discipline and confirmation may find a favorable entry into XRP’s next potential move.

The asset slipped through the past week and lost close to 8% while traders weighed a rare combination of institutional strength and short-term weakness. With a market capitalization near $125 billion and daily volume above $3.3 billion, XRP keeps its position as one of the most liquid crypto assets. The market now watches the psychological $2 support level as heavy inflows clash ih rising short exposure and fading retail conviction. Sentiment Breakdown Creates a Contrarian Setup Market sentiment around XRP sits inside one of the deepest fear zones since October. Santiment reports that sentiment prints the same level of panic that preceded a sharp twenty-two percent rebound on November 21. RSI sits near 45 and the SAR indicator keeps flipping into bearish territory. Source: X Traders feel trapped between disbelief and fatigue after a two-month decline of thirty-one percent. The present slide shows structural weakness rather than blind panic, which means any reversal must appear through rising volume and inflow recovery rather than pure emotion. Traders hunt for signs that shorts may reach exhaustion as they did during past rebounds. Institutions Accumulate While Retail Steps Back Institutional appetite continues to grow even as retail traders exit. U.S. spot XRP ETFs attracted $906 million in net inflows since launch, with not a single day of outflows. The flagship XRPC ETF now holds $336 million, which places it above every competing fund. Franklin Templeton now lists XRP as a top-four holding in its regulated multi-asset crypto product. These flows form a clear divergence: Institutional portfolios build long-horizon positions while retail traders short the asset. The setup shows a market where deep pockets accumulate quietly below the surface, waiting for fear to drain out of the system. Ripple’s $4B Expansion Reshapes Global Finance Ripple pushed aggressively into global finance through a $4 billion acquisition wave across GTreasury, Rail, Palisade, and Ripple Prime. The company now holds strategic control over treasury management, liquidity services, payments, and institutional crypto infrastructure. Regulatory traction strengthens the expansion. Approvals in Singapore and the UAE, plus FSRA authorization of the RLUSD stablecoin, anchor Ripple inside the regulated payments ecosystem. Ripple also reached a major U.S. milestone when Bitnomial launched the first CFTC-approved XRP spot product. This move places XRP beside commodities such as Treasuries on a federally regulated exchange. Markets have not priced this transformation yet, leaving a wide gap between Ripple’s operational dominance and XRP’s market performance. On-Chain Data Reveals a Structural Split The XRP Ledger shows its highest transaction velocity of the year at 0.0324, marking strong network usage. Open interest climbed to $3.85 billion while funding rates stayed negative, which confirms heavy short positioning. A regional concentration also emerges: Upbit holds more than six billion XRP, far above Binance at 2.6 billion. The imbalance introduces the risk of region-based liquidation waves during volatility spikes. Liquidity remains deep and participation strong, yet direction stays capped by pressure from leveraged traders. Long-Term Holders Rotate as Whales Step In Long-term holder dormancy dropped ninety-one percent since mid-November, signaling that older coins rarely move. At the same time, cohorts that held XRP for six months to three years trimmed positions and locked in profits. Institutions absorbed much of that volume through ETF demand, which removed nearly half a percent of total supply from circulation as ETFs crossed one billion dollars in assets under management. Whales keep buying while early holders reduce exposure. This rotation delays any strong recovery but builds the foundation for a future supply squeeze once distribution slows. XRP now enters a rare moment where institutional strength outweighs retail fear, setting the stage for a potential shift once the market resolves its internal pressure.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-06 13:24:45

In just one year, the euro stablecoin market cap has more than doubled, signaling a dramatic transformation. This explosive growth follows the full implementation of the EU’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in June 2023. According to data from payments firm Decta, monthly trading volume for euro-pegged stablecoins like EURS and EURC skyrocketed from $338 million to a staggering $3.8 billion. Let’s explore what’s driving this remarkable surge and what it means for the future of digital finance in Europe. What Is Driving the Euro Stablecoin Market Cap Surge? The euro stablecoin market cap expansion isn’t accidental. MiCA created something crucial for crypto adoption: regulatory clarity. For the first time, businesses and investors have a clear framework for operating with digital assets across the European Union. This confidence directly fuels growth. Moreover, the regulation establishes specific rules for stablecoin issuers, requiring robust reserves and transparency. Consequently, institutional players who previously avoided the space now see euro stablecoins as a legitimate, low-risk entry point into cryptocurrency. How Do Specific Stablecoins Like EURS and EURC Contribute? While the overall euro stablecoin market cap is rising, individual tokens tell the real story. Major players include: EURS (STASIS EURO): A fully collateralized and regulated stablecoin that has gained significant traction. EURC (Circle Euro Coin): Issued by Circle, this token brings the credibility of a major USDC issuer to the euro zone. EURCV: Another key contributor to the growing trading volumes. These stablecoins serve vital functions. They enable faster, cheaper euro settlements for cross-border trade and provide a stable digital euro for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Essentially, they act as a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? The doubling of the euro stablecoin market cap has ripple effects far beyond simple statistics. First, it challenges the long-standing dominance of US dollar-pegged stablecoins, promoting monetary diversity in the crypto economy. Second, it strengthens the euro’s position in the digital age, potentially influencing global finance. Finally, it demonstrates that well-designed regulation can act as a catalyst for innovation, not a hindrance. Other regions now look to MiCA as a potential blueprint. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? Despite the impressive growth in the euro stablecoin market cap , challenges remain. Issuers must continuously prove their compliance with MiCA’s strict reserve and audit requirements. Furthermore, they face competition from potential digital euro projects explored by the European Central Bank. However, the opportunities are immense. As adoption grows, we can expect: More sophisticated euro-based DeFi products. Easier crypto on-ramps and off-ramps for European users. Increased use in remittances and business payments. The trajectory suggests the euro stablecoin market cap is on a path of sustained expansion. Conclusion: A New Chapter for European Crypto The data is clear and compelling. The euro stablecoin market cap has not just grown; it has exploded, doubling in value and seeing trading volumes increase more than tenfold. This stunning growth story is a direct testament to the power of regulatory clarity provided by MiCA. It marks a pivotal moment where Europe is actively shaping its digital financial future. The surge in euro stablecoins is more than a metric; it’s a signal of maturity, trust, and the accelerating integration of cryptocurrency into the mainstream European economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is MiCA regulation? MiCA stands for Markets in Crypto-Assets. It is a comprehensive regulatory framework enacted by the European Union to govern cryptocurrencies and related services, including stablecoins, across its member states. Why did the euro stablecoin market cap double? The primary driver is the MiCA regulation, which provided legal certainty and a clear rulebook for stablecoin issuers and users. This boosted confidence among institutions and investors, leading to massive adoption and increased trading volume. What are the most popular euro stablecoins? The major players contributing to the market cap growth include EURS (STASIS EURO), EURC (Circle Euro Coin), and EURCV, among others. Is my euro stablecoin safe under MiCA? MiCA imposes strict requirements on issuers, including the obligation to hold sufficient reserves and undergo regular audits. This enhances consumer protection compared to the previously unregulated environment. Will this growth affect the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? While not directly, a larger, more regulated euro on-ramp into crypto can increase overall market liquidity and potentially attract more European capital into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. What does this mean for the US dollar stablecoin dominance? It presents the first significant challenge. A growing euro stablecoin market cap offers a viable alternative for those wishing to avoid USD exposure, promoting a more multipolar digital currency landscape.

In the latest battle between the bulls and bears, the premier cryptocurrency appears to be succumbing to pressure from the latter group. As this weekend approached, the Bitcoin price retreated from its latest local high of around $94,000 to beneath the psychological $90,000 level. This latest correction has prompted questions in the crowd, with investors wondering whether it is just a brief obstacle or the end of the recovery. Why $80,500 Could Be The Next Local Low For BTC In a December 5 post on the social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder shared insight into the latest Bitcoin price decline below $90,000. The on-chain expert revealed that losing the $89,800 level is the more relevant occurrence in the latest price downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Faces Potential 60% Decline As Expert Warns Of ‘Major Bull Trap’ In a previous post on X, Wedson evaluated the likely trajectory of the Bitcoin price should it lose the $89,800 level. The crypto pundit revealed that losing this price mark could lead to an accumulation pattern for the bulls or a redistribution phase for the bears. While the accumulation period for the bulls would initially coincide with lower prices, it eventually leads to a Bitcoin price return to above the latest local high. Meanwhile, a redistribution phase could see the bears push the flagship cryptocurrency to around the $70,000 mark. According to the Alphractal CEO, the price of BTC also failed to hold the key on-chain levels, strengthening the probability of a broader price sideways phase. “Sideways action is the cause — the big pumps or dumps are just the effect,” Wedson had earlier stated in his previous X post. Furthermore, Wedson noted that the next level to watch is $86,500, which, if lost, opens the very high possibility for the formation of a new local low around $80,500. This local low could provide a perfect spot for investors to buy the dip and enter the market. Bitcoin Price Overview As mentioned earlier, the past week has been one of highs and lows for the premier cryptocurrency, plummeting to as low as $84,600 on Monday, December 1. After a shaky start to the month, the Bitcoin price recovered strongly to around $94,000 on Thursday, December 4. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $89,415, reflecting an over 3% price decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of Bitcoin has been down by nearly 10% in the past year.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)?,https://cryptopotato.com/the-etfs-battle-where-does-ripple-xrp-rank-vs-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth/,"After months and months of building anticipation and online speculation, the second-largest altcoin joined the two market leaders in having its own exchange-traded funds tracking its performance on November 13. Here’s how XRP compares in terms of inflows and price movements in its first weeks against BTC and ETH. Bitcoin ETF Debut and Price Moves Following a decade of SEC rejections and delays at best, the US regulator finally greenlighted a bunch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. The launch date was set on January 10, and, somewhat expectedly, the underlying asset’s price tumbled immediately in a classic sell-the-news event. BTC had risen to $48,000 at the time, but quickly dipped below $40,000. However, that short-term correction couldn’t keep the asset from rising in the following weeks. In fact, Bitcoin had charted a new all-time high within two months of well over $73,000. A sizeable portion of those gains came on the heels of the impressive ETF inflow numbers. Aside from Grayscale’s converted trust (GBTC), which was almost always in the red, most other BTC ETFs were gaining traction, especially BlackRock’s IBIT. Just a few days before BTC’s ATH, the cumulative net inflows into all ETFs skyrocketed above $1 billion (on March 12), which undoubtedly benefited the underlying asset. Overall, the Bitcoin ETFs had a highly successful debut, which has (mostly) continued ever since with over $57 billion in cumulative net inflows in less than two years. BTC also trades nearly 2x its price on the ETF debut day. ETH’s Disappointment Needless to say, ETH also dumped after the release of the ETFs tracking its performance. The debut day was July 23, 2024, and Ether went from $3,600 to under $2,200 in about two weeks. However, this wasn’t just a one-off sell-the-news event as with BTC. The ETFs couldn’t pick up the pace for months, as the Grayscale withdrawals overshadowed the minor net inflows. In fact, the Ethereum ETFs couldn’t stage an impressive inflow streak until the end of the year. ETH’s price reflected that with a massive surge from under $2,500 to over $4,000 in December 2024. Since then, the ETH ETFs have been mostly stable and positive. However, the largest altcoin’s current price is below its valuation on July 23, 2024. How Does XRP Compare? The first XRP-based ETF with 100% exposure to the asset went live on November 13. Canary Capital’s XRPC broke the 2025 record for highest trading volume on day 1. Three more such financial vehicles followed suit in the next few weeks. The total inflows are close to $900 million. There hasn’t been a single day in which the net outflows have overshadowed the net inflows, and the streak remains intact even though the demand has slowed down a bit. Yet, XRP’s price has followed the overall trend. It dumped on November 13 from over $2.50 to under $2.30 and has been unable to stage a notable recovery. Even though it rebounded from the multi-month low of $1.83 reached on November 21, it currently trades at $2.03, which is well below the debut day price. Nevertheless, the XRP ETFs have outperformed the BTC and ETH counterparts since Canary Capital’s product debuted, which should be considered as a bullish sign for the underlying asset if the inflows continue.

55427313,https://coinpaper.com/12909/galaxy-warns-bitcoin-treasury-premiums-have-collapsed-as-capitulation-hits-record,1765027919,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Galaxy Warns Bitcoin Treasury Premiums Have Collapsed as Capitulation Hits Record,https://coinpaper.com/12909/galaxy-warns-bitcoin-treasury-premiums-have-collapsed-as-capitulation-hits-record,"Bitcoin-linked treasury stocks are losing their premium just as on-chain capitulation spikes to a new high. The combination shows leveraged equity bets and spot holders taking heavy losses at the same time. Galaxy Says Bitcoin Treasury Trade Hits Limit as Premiums Disappear Galaxy Research says the bitcoin “digital asset treasury” trade has reached a turning point as once-rich equity premiums vanish and stock issuance turns from growth tool into drag. In a December 4 report , the firm revisits its July warning that the digital asset treasury, or DAT, model only works while a company’s shares trade above the value of its underlying bitcoin holdings. At that time, stocks such as Strategy, Metaplanet, Semler Scientific and Nakamoto traded at steep premiums to their bitcoin net asset value, which allowed them to issue new shares and use the proceeds to buy more BTC. Galaxy describes that structure as a kind of liquidity derivative. The model relies on equity staying above BTC net asset value so that each new share increases, rather than reduces, bitcoin per share. Once the premium disappears, the feedback loop reverses. According to the report, that reversal is now underway. Bitcoin has dropped from around 126,000 dollars in October to as low as 80,000 dollars, and it trades near 92,000 dollars at the time of writing. The move followed an October 10 deleveraging event that forced liquidations in futures markets, cut open interest and left liquidity weaker into the fourth quarter. Those conditions, Galaxy says, have pushed investors toward a risk-off stance and slowed inflows into crypto exchange-traded funds. For DAT companies, the impact has been sharp. As BTC fell and risk appetite faded, bitcoin net asset value per share dropped and equity premiums compressed. In many cases, shares now trade at or below the value of the bitcoin they represent. That shift means new stock offerings no longer provide accretive capital to buy more BTC and instead dilute existing holders if issued below NAV. Galaxy focuses on four firms as case studies: Strategy, which it cites as the largest and most visible corporate bitcoin holder; Metaplanet in Japan; Semler Scientific; and Nakamoto, now listed via its merger with Kindly MD under the NAKA ticker. Together, they show how a high-beta equity trade can move when conditions change. Galaxy Report Shows Bitcoin Treasury Stocks Flip From Premiums To Sharp Drawdowns The report highlights deep drawdowns across these stocks since their 2025 highs. Nakamoto’s share price has fallen more than 98 percent, which Galaxy compares to the kind of wipeout seen in memecoin markets. By contrast, bitcoin itself is down about 30 percent from its peak, underscoring how equity, issuance and balance-sheet leverage magnified losses on the way down after boosting gains earlier in the year. Unrealized profit and loss figures show the same shift. Galaxy cites Metaplanet’s public dashboard, noting that the company reported more than 600 million dollars in unrealized bitcoin profits in early October. By December 1, with BTC lower, that position showed roughly 530 million dollars in unrealized losses instead. The report adds that Metaplanet and Nakamoto now hold bitcoin at an average cost above 107,000 dollars per coin, leaving their current unrealized PnL firmly negative at recent prices. Metaplanet Unrealized Bitcoin Losses. Source: Galaxy Research A comparison between data from July and updated figures for December illustrates how fast equity premiums have compressed. In mid-summer, Metaplanet traded at about 236 percent of its bitcoin NAV. Today, Galaxy says, premiums for Strategy , Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have “compressed mightily” and often sit near zero or at a discount compared with their underlying holdings. Galaxy concludes that the first phase of the bitcoin treasury trade has likely run its course. The original model, built on issuing stock at a premium and recycling the proceeds into more BTC, has met a natural boundary condition: once shares trade at or below NAV, issuance becomes a tax on holders instead of a growth engine. Equity Premium To Bitcoin NAV Compression. Source: Galaxy Research From here, the report says, the sector faces a period defined by compressed premiums, balance-sheet stress and a greater focus on liquidity management rather than pure bitcoin accumulation. Bitcoin Capitulation Metric Surges to Record Level Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s capitulation metric has climbed to a new all-time high, signaling the strongest wave of forced selling pressure recorded in this cycle. The chart shared by CryptoGoos shows the capitulation line spiking sharply as price moves lower, creating its widest divergence since early 2024. The move reflects heavy realized losses as holders sell into declining markets. Bitcoin Capitulation Metric And Price. Source: Glassnode / X The metric measures how intensely investors lock in losses during downturns. When it rises while price falls, it often indicates that weaker hands are exiting positions at scale. This trend has accelerated in recent weeks, and the latest reading marks the steepest jump in more than a year. At the same time, Bitcoin’s price remains well below its mid-2025 highs. The chart shows that previous capitulation spikes aligned with local bottoms or periods of market stress. However, the current spike exceeds all earlier levels, suggesting unusually strong pressure across the market as long-term and short-term holders both realize losses at the same time. The surge highlights a market environment defined by volatility, reduced liquidity, and forced selling as leveraged positions unwind.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-06 13:31:59

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. However, investors had more bad news coming their way as the cryptocurrency market continued its downtrend, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and other tokens trading in the red. Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00023387 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.000023298 to $0.0023387. The pre-launch phase began on April 1, with the project adopting a dynamic pricing strategy to empower its community and existing HINU token holders while continuing fundraising efforts. The pre-launch’s primary goal is to ensure capital raise, undertake marketing initiatives, fund platform improvements, and facilitate broader ecosystem expansion. Fundraising Struggles Husky Inu has faced its fair share of challenges and is currently facing a slowdown in fundraising, thanks to the ongoing market slowdown. A similar slowdown had brought fundraising efforts to a grinding halt as investors adopted a wait-and-watch approach. This meant the project took an eternity to cross the $900,000 milestone, potentially impacting its long-term fundraising target as well. However, the team remains optimistic about investor sentiment and fundraising picking up as broader market conditions improve. While the official launch date is set for March 27, 2026, the team is open to shifting launch dates to adapt to market conditions. The team has held two review meetings to assess market conditions, with a third scheduled for January 1, 2026. Crypto Market Continues Downtrend Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market extended its decline for a second day with nearly all tokens in bearish territory. Bitcoin (BTC) fell almost 3% over the past 24 hours, losing $90,000 and moving to $89,401. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to stay above $3,000, down 4.50% at $3,021. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 3%, while Solana (SOL) is down over 4%, trading around $132. Popular memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has shed almost 6% over the past 24 hours, while Cardano (ADA) is down 77% at $0.410. Chainlink (LINK) is down 4.91% and Stellar (XLM) is down over 5%, trading around $0.238. Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered substantial declines over the past 24 hours. As a result, the overall crypto market cap is down nearly 3% at $3.05 trillion.

Price action shows calm, yet institutional demand tells a louder story. U.S. spot XRP ETFs crossed $1 billion in assets under management , marking one of the fastest ETF growth streaks in the digital asset sector. This surge arrives just weeks after launch, and it now reshapes market expectations for 2025. A Relentless Wave of Inflows Powers the ETF Boom Five U.S. issuers now run spot XRP ETFs , and every one of them reports consistent inflows. The group has recorded consecutive days of net inflows since mid-November. No outflows appear anywhere in the data. The total now sits between $897 million and $1 billion, depending on the latest update. Canary Capital leads with the strongest haul. Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton follow with growing demand from family offices and hedge funds. A new entrant, 21Shares , prepares to expand competition. Fresh issuers signal a deeper trend as institutions shift capital toward regulated crypto products. Millions of XRP Flow Into Vaults as Supply Shrinks The ETF buying wave locked 473.5 million XRP in regulated vaults, pulling nearly 0.5% of the entire circulating supply out of active markets. Analysts tracked this climb throughout the week as cumulative inflows surged. Grayscale played a major role. The firm added nearly 20 million XRP in a single day, pushing its trust above 103 million XRP and more than $217 million in AUM. The move helped push combined ETF holdings above 400 million XRP, then above 470 million, and signals firm demand even during a period of weak price action. Traders now watch how supply removal influences future volatility once inflows slow. ETF Flows Rise While Bitcoin and Ethereum Show Mixed Trends The contrast between XRP ETF flows and larger competitors stands out. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs show uneven or negative inflows during the same period. XRP, on the other hand, draws capital every single day. Analysts call this divergence rare. Flow leads price, not the reverse. Institutions build exposure while retail traders sit out. Markets saw similar patterns in other assets before large price swings. The price of XRP stays near $2 despite the surge in institutional buying. Social sentiment dipped into fear territory this week. Those conditions last appeared in October. The fear index does not match the inflow surge, creating one of the sharpest disconnects in the market. Ripple’s Stablecoin Strategy Adds Fuel to Institutional Interest Ripple’s growing role in the stablecoin ecosystem adds a second tailwind.They project that U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins could reach $2.5 to $3 trillion by 2030. Ripple positions its regulated stablecoin, RLUSD, as a bridge for global settlement flows. Executives highlight a two-track system. XRP handles liquidity and settlement, while RLUSD manages daily payments and treasury operations for banks and payment firms. Institutional investors watch this model gain traction as tokenization and cross-border clearing gain attention across global finance. The ETF inflows align with this growing strategic interest. Investors view XRP as infrastructure, not speculation. They accumulate early and reduce liquid supply while the market waits for catalysts in 2025. The Next Levels Traders Watch Closely Market watchers now focus on two milestones. The first is how fast new inflows push past the $1 billion line. The second is whether XRP’s price reacts once that level holds. If flows begin to influence price, traders expect sharp volatility. If the price stays stable, institutions may continue loading quietly. Either path strengthens the long-term outlook. One fact now stands out across the sector. XRP ETFs attract capital while other crypto funds lose it. Demand does not disappear. It simply moves.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-06 13:38:59

The company announced the reserve on Monday. It said the cash pile, funded through a stock sale, is meant to cover at least 12 months of dividend payments, with a plan to extend that buffer to roughly 24 months over time. Le told CNBC the raise took about eight and a half days and equates to roughly 21 months of dividend obligations. He said the move was meant both to address concerns about a possible shortfall and to show Strategy can still attract capital “in a Bitcoin downcycle” without selling any of its Bitcoin holdings. In a post on X summarizing the appearance, Strategy said Le discussed how MSTR’s share price moves with Bitcoin, how the new dollar reserve addresses “recent FUD,” the shifting Overton window for corporate Bitcoin treasuries, key volatility drivers, and “why Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains strong.” Le also repeated that Strategy would only consider selling Bitcoin if its stock traded below the value of its holdings and the firm no longer had access to fresh capital, echoing guidance he gave in earlier remarks now restated in today’s coverage. Analyst Sees Strategy’s 2025 Slump Echoing 2021 Pattern, Flags $100 Target Zone A trader posting under the name MarketMaestro says Strategy Inc.’s weekly chart mirrors its 2021 topping pattern and could still slide toward a support area near $100 before the downtrend exhausts. The view appears in his community post and in the weekly chart image you shared, created on TradingView on Dec. 5. In his analysis, MarketMaestro compares two multi-month structures on the weekly MSTR chart: one that formed in 2021 and the current one in 2025. In both cases, he marks an initial peak labeled “A,” followed by a rounded top labeled “1-E-2” under a dotted arc. Beneath each arc he draws a green horizontal band that he calls a “confirmation” zone, where price breaks down and turns the pattern bearish. The chart shows Strategy already losing that confirmation area in the 2025 leg. Candles sit well below the weekly moving average line, which runs near the prior range.

Illegal mining has caused over a billion rubles’ worth of damage to utilities in Russia’s southernmost region this year alone. That’s despite an ongoing crackdown that already relies on high-tech surveillance and support from feared federal security agents. Russian Caucasians are not giving up on crypto mining A report from the Russian Southwest is clearly demonstrating how hard it is to eradicate an additional source of income for a population with few options to make a buck the legal way. Despite the strictest ban possible, people in the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic (KBR), a small region of less than a million inhabitants in the Russian Caucasus, are still mining on stolen electricity. The local power distribution company is constantly finding mining machines, often in the strangest of places, the Vesti Kavkaza wrote in an article before the weekend. Employees of the utility have just announced their latest catch – more than 20 mining rigs minting digital coins in abandoned buildings in one of the republic’s villages. They were placed in insulated boxes to suppress the noise and hide them well. Quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency, the local branch of Rosseti North Caucasus estimated that the operators of the recently discovered devices stole 764,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity from the state. That translates into over 5.8 million rubles (over $75,000) of financial losses, according to the calculations posted in a press release, which also detailed: “Specialists from Kabbalkenergo, stopped an electricity mining theft in the village of Stary Cherek in the Urvan District. Two dilapidated, non-residential buildings located on an abandoned site were illegally connected to the grid.” The organizers of such small-scale mining operations, which are harder to detect due to the relatively low energy consumption of the improvised installations, often pick former industrial or agricultural sites for their underground farms, as in many cases, these still provide access to electricity transformers. The fate of the rogue cryptocurrency miners in Kabardino-Balkaria will be decided by law enforcement agencies and the judiciary, the regional news outlet noted in its report. Police are now preparing to open a criminal case under an article of the Russian Criminal Code which prosecutes the “causing of property damage by fraud or abuse of trust on an especially large scale.” The latter is punishable by up to five years of prison. Russia intensifies crackdown on illegal mining Russia regulated mining in 2024, making it the first legalized crypto activity in its jurisdiction. However, the high concentration of mining enterprises in some parts of the country has been blamed for growing energy deficits. Since the beginning of the year, the minting of digital currencies has been temporarily restricted during periods of peak electricity consumption or permanently banned for years to come in about a dozen Russian regions, from Siberia to occupied Ukraine. The strictest restrictions apply to almost all Russian republics in the North Caucasus, including the BRK, Chechnya and Dagestan. Illegal mining there is believed to have caused 1 billion rubles ($13 million) in damages to local power grids and utilities in 2025, according to information released by the Telegram channel Mash in late November. Under current Russian law, both companies and individual entrepreneurs are allowed to participate in the mining business, as long as they register with tax authorities, but the majority have yet to do so. A recently proposed amnesty aims to bring more of them out of the shadow economy. While mining has been recently recognized as a growing Russian export , big enough to be added to the country’s balance of payments, an estimate made public earlier this week suggests Russia will have to invest $77 billion in new generation capacities to satisfy its needs and those of AI data centers. Meanwhile, Russian authorities have started using increasingly sophisticated means to locate illegal crypto farms, including technology tracking energy consumption and internet traffic as well as drones equipped with thermal vision cameras. Officers from the Federal Security Service (FSB) are now often participating in joint raids to dismantle such operations. In one of these last week, they busted a large mining facility in Chelyabinsk, reportedly owned by the son of a prominent politician.

Fresh data from Token Terminal place Q4 stablecoin transfers near the 6-trillion-dollar mark, already above last quarter’s total with weeks still remaining. At the same time, chart analysts say Ethereum’s multi-year structure has moved into a Wyckoff accumulation phase, reflecting quieter positioning beneath the surface as the market resets after the 2022–2023 decline. Ethereum Stablecoin Volume Nears 6 Trillion Dollars in Q4 Ethereum is on pace to process nearly 6 trillion dollars in stablecoin transfers during the fourth quarter, according to new data from Token Terminal. The chart shows that Q4 activity has already surpassed Q3 levels even though the quarter is not finished. This marks one of the strongest periods of on-chain settlement for Ethereum as demand for stablecoin transfers continues to accelerate across DeFi and exchange infrastructures. Ethereum Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Quarterly). Source: Token Terminal The figure also places Ethereum ahead of the most recent quarterly transaction volumes reported by Visa and Mastercard. While the networks measure traditional payment activity and Ethereum records on-chain transfer volume, the scale gap this quarter remains notable. It highlights how much value now moves through blockchain rails as stablecoins become a preferred settlement tool for trading, remittances, and institutional flows. The jump in activity reinforces Ethereum’s position as the primary settlement environment for stablecoins. USDT, USDC , and other dollar-pegged tokens account for most of the volume, driven by increased use across decentralized exchanges, lending pools, and cross-chain bridges. With a month still left in the quarter, analysts expect the final Q4 figure to become Ethereum’s largest stablecoin volume reading to date. Analyst Maps Ethereum Into New Wyckoff Accumulation Phase Crypto GEMs argues that Ethereum has entered a fresh accumulation zone under the Wyckoff market-cycle framework, based on a long-term price chart that labels prior mark-up, distribution, mark-down, and accumulation phases. The current range follows the 2022–2023 decline, which the analyst treats as the last mark-down before a potential trend reset. Ethereum Wyckoff Cycle Phases. Source: Crypto GEMs / TradingView In this reading, the sideways structure since 2023 mirrors earlier periods when large players quietly built positions ahead of stronger advances. Crypto GEMs says past cycles on the chart show that similar accumulation blocks have preceded powerful mark-up legs, and projects that a new advance could eventually carry Ethereum toward the 20,000-dollar area by 2026. The post notes that sentiment remains divided, with skeptical traders viewing the range as exhaustion while more optimistic holders treat it as a chance to increase exposure.

While currently manageable, their unpredictable nature poses a long-term planning challenge. In a significant development, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a novel solution: creating a dedicated gas futures market on the blockchain itself. This idea aims to bring financial predictability to one of crypto’s most volatile costs. What is a Gas Futures Market and Why Do We Need It? Simply put, a futures market lets people buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price for delivery on a future date. Applying this to Ethereum gas means users could lock in today’s price for transaction fees they expect to need months or even years from now. Buterin highlighted this need, noting that while fees are low now, predicting their trajectory over the next two years is incredibly difficult. A gas futures market would directly address this uncertainty. How Would an On-Chain Gas Futures Market Work? The core function would be hedging. Developers planning a major project launch or users expecting high transaction volumes could purchase gas futures contracts. Therefore, if market gas prices spike later, they are protected, having secured their fees at a lower, known rate. Conversely, if prices fall, they might pay a slight premium. This system creates a formal mechanism for price discovery and risk management directly on Ethereum. Hedging Against Volatility: Users and businesses can shield themselves from sudden, costly gas fee surges. Better Financial Planning: Projects can accurately budget for future network costs, improving operational stability. Enabling New Features: Buterin suggested it could allow for pre-booking or pre-purchasing gas for specific periods or events. What Are the Potential Challenges and Hurdles? However, implementing a robust gas futures market is not without its complexities. Key questions remain about the underlying asset. Would the contract be for a specific amount of computational ‘gas’ units, or for the fee price itself? Furthermore, designing a secure, decentralized, and liquid market that cannot be manipulated is a significant technical challenge. The market would need to integrate seamlessly with Ethereum’s core mechanics to be truly effective. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum? This proposal signals a maturing phase for Ethereum, shifting focus from pure scalability to economic stability and advanced financial primitives. A successful gas futures market could make Ethereum more attractive for institutional adoption and large-scale enterprise projects that require predictable operating costs. Moreover, it represents a move towards a more sophisticated and user-friendly economic layer, which is crucial for mainstream acceptance. Conclusion: A Forward-Thinking Proposal for Economic Stability Vitalik Buterin’s call for an on-chain gas futures market is a forward-thinking attempt to solve a fundamental pain point. By allowing users to hedge against fee volatility, it promises greater predictability and could unlock new models for interacting with the Ethereum network. While technical hurdles exist, the vision points toward a more stable and professionally accessible blockchain ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are gas fees on Ethereum? A: Gas fees are payments users make to compensate for the computing energy required to process and validate transactions or smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Q: How would a gas futures market benefit the average user? A: While powerful for developers, average users could benefit indirectly through more stable and predictable costs for decentralized applications (dApps) and services built on Ethereum. Q: Is this market live or just a proposal? A: This is currently a proposal and discussion point from Vitalik Buterin. No official or live gas futures market exists on Ethereum yet. Q: Would this make gas fees more expensive? A: Not necessarily. The goal is price discovery and risk management, not inherently raising fees. It could create more competition and efficiency in how future fees are priced. Q: Can other blockchains implement a similar system? A> Absolutely. Any blockchain with variable transaction fees could explore similar derivative markets to provide economic predictability for its users. Found this insight into Ethereum’s economic future valuable?

Atkins emphasized the SEC’s intent to modernize its rules to facilitate an on-chain market environment, leveraging distributed ledger technology and the tokenization of financial assets. SEC Chair Advocates For Crypto Tokenization Atkins highlighted the transformative potential of these technologies for the capital markets. He stressed that enhancing these markets is essential for US firms and investors to maintain their leadership on a global scale. The chair underscored that the advancements in blockchain technology could streamline not only trading processes but also the entire issuer-investor relationship, which would enable a more efficient and transparent financial ecosystem. Tokenization, according to Atkins, goes beyond merely changing the mechanics of trading. He pointed out that it can foster direct connections for various important functions such as proxy voting, dividend payments, and shareholder communications, all while reducing the reliance on multiple intermediaries. In his address, Atkins acknowledged several innovative models that deserve consideration. He noted that some companies are directly issuing equity on public distributed ledgers in the form of programmable assets. These assets can integrate compliance features, voting rights, and governance capabilities, allowing investors to hold securities in a digital format that promotes transparency and reduces the number of intermediaries involved. Additionally, he mentioned that third parties are engaging in the tokenization of equities by generating on-chain security entitlements that represent ownership stakes in traditional equities. The emergence of synthetic exposures—tokenized products designed to reflect the performance of public equities—was also highlighted. While many of these offerings are currently being developed offshore, they showcase the international interest in US market exposure supported by distributed ledger technology. Atkins Critiques Past SEC Strategies However, Atkins cautioned that transitioning to on-chain capital markets entails more than just issuance. He stated that it is essential to address various stages of the securities transaction lifecycle effectively. For instance, if tokenized shares cannot be traded competitively in liquid on-chain environments, they risk becoming little more than conceptual assets without practical utility. The chair also criticized the previous SEC’s approach toward the crypto industry under the agency’s former chair Gary Gensler , which attempted to adapt to on-chain markets through an expansive redefinition of “exchange.” This earlier strategy enforced a broad regulatory framework that ultimately created uncertainty and stifled innovation, Atkins stated. He said that it is vital to avoid repeating such mistakes in order to stimulate innovation, investment, and job creation in the United States. To foster a conducive environment for growth, Atkins called for compliant pathways that can enable market participants to capitalize on the unique benefits of new technologies like crypto. In light of this conviction, he has instructed SEC staff to explore recommendations for utilizing the agency’s exemptive authorities, permitting on-chain innovations while the Commission works toward developing long-term, effective crypto regulatory frameworks.

Source: Finbold Why crypto market is tumbling The overall market decline was driven primarily by a cascade of forced liquidations. Nearly $500 million in leveraged positions were wiped out across major exchanges, including roughly $420 million in longs. More than 140,000 traders were liquidated within a single day, accelerating the downturn. Weaker ETF demand added to the pressure with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust having now logged six consecutive weeks of outflows totaling more than $2.8 billion, while overall US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows dropped to just $59 million on December 3, signaling softening institutional interest at a critical moment. At the same time, macro conditions deepened the volatility. The Bank of Japan hinted at a possible rate hike, a shift that threatens carry-trade liquidity supporting global risk assets. Additionally, traders moved to reduce exposure ahead of the latest US PCE inflation report, keeping Bitcoin locked in a cautious $91,000–$95,000 range before the sell-off intensified. Although the PCE data arrived broadly in line with expectations, showing cooling but still elevated core inflation, the reading was not convincing enough for markets to assume faster Fed rate cuts. The result was a guarded reaction that reinforced risk-off behavior across crypto.

The researcher reported on his Telegram channel that the suspect is Danny Mitch, who also goes by Danish Zulfiqar (Khan). He added that cryptocurrency belonging to the suspect may have been seized. ZachXBT says approximately $18.58 million in assets can be traced to an Ethereum address associated with the individual. He notes that the wallet’s recent consolidation activity resembles patterns seen when authorities seize crypto funds. The researcher also claims that Zulfiqar was “last seen in Dubai” and that people who previously communicated with him have stopped responding. However, local Dubai media and official channels have not reported any arrests, searches, or seizures connected to this case. Background on One of Crypto’s Largest Individual Thefts The Genesis theft occurred in August 2024 and ranks among the largest known attacks against an individual. According to ZachXBT, the attackers posed as Google support staff and persuaded the victim to reset two-factor authentication on their Gemini account. Once inside, the attackers drained the account, withdrawing 4,064 BTC through multiple crypto services. ZachXBT previously tied the hack to three individuals known as Greavys, Wiz, and Box — later identified as Malone Lam, Vir Chetal, and Jandiel Serrano. His findings were forwarded to law enforcement, leading to multiple U.S. criminal cases linked to similar schemes. The U.S. Department of Justice has charged the group with fraud and extortion exceeding $260 million, detailing operations involving SIM swapping, social engineering, and physical access, with proceeds spent on luxury travel, cars, and entertainment. In a related matter, in May 2025, Genesis filed two lawsuits against Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its founder Barry Silbert, seeking $3.3 billion in damages. As authorities investigate the latest developments around Zulfiqar, the crypto community awaits confirmation from Dubai officials on whether a major break in the case has occurred.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-06 14:14:34

The request was submitted to the New York District Court four months after Kwon pleaded guilty to two fraud charges. Prosecutors insist that his actions not only accelerated Terraform’s downfall but also contributed to the broader onset of the “crypto winter.” They also called for full forfeiture of any income tied to his conduct. Defense Seeks Leniency as Global Legal Pressures Mount Kwon was indicted in the United States in 2023 on charges that included securities fraud and money laundering. After Terra’s collapse, he went into hiding before being arrested in Montenegro on unrelated offenses and later extradited to the U.S. Now, the court must determine his final sentence. Judges are not bound by the prosecution’s request — meaning the punishment could be shorter or significantly longer than 12 years. Defense Cites Harsh Consequences in South Korea Kwon’s legal team is pushing for a sentence of no more than five years, arguing that once his U.S. sentence is served, he will be deported directly to South Korea, where he faces up to 40 years in prison. They emphasize that Kwon will not be eligible for release between the two proceedings. When determining his punishment, the judge will weigh both sides’ arguments and compare similar cases. Sam Bankman-Fried : 25 years Alex Mashinsky : 12 years Carl Sebastian Greenwood : 20 years for OneCoin As reported earlier, Bankman-Fried has claimed that his own case involved judicial bias and has requested a review.

An Experienced Expert Responds,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-the-tether-usdt-fud-real-an-experienced-expert-responds/,"CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill gave a clear response to the Tether debate that has flared up again in the cryptocurrency markets in recent days. Butterfill stated that comments from Arthur Hayes and S&P Global regarding Tether's bankruptcy risk were “taken too seriously by the market.” Pointing to Tether's latest report, Butterfill noted that the company had $174.45 billion in liabilities against approximately $181 billion in reserves, resulting in a surplus of approximately $6.8 billion. He noted that Tether, which generated $10 billion in profit in the first three quarters of 2025, is one of the most profitable companies in the sector. Butterfill's assessment wasn't limited to Tether. The analyst noted that Japan was at the center of the recent volatility in global markets, adding that the increasing stress on long-term Japanese government bonds was straining global liquidity. He added that the weak demand seen in the 20-year JGB auction, in particular, indicated that Japanese capital, which has long kept global yields low, is now under pressure. Related News: Ethereum Bull Tom Lee Makes Another Massive ETH Move Butterfill noted that Japanese institutions have been pouring significant amounts of capital into US bonds and stocks for years, noting that even a partial return of these funds could squeeze global liquidity. He added that this situation could suppress risky assets and, in the long run, bolster Bitcoin's “alternative store of value” narrative. Butterfill noted that weak employment data from the US has also exacerbated market fragility, noting that the 32,000-person employment decline makes a rate cut more likely in December, but that financial conditions remain tight. This tightness was among the factors that triggered the recent pullback in crypto assets. Butterfill also commented on the renewed discussions surrounding Tether's bankruptcy, arguing that current data doesn't indicate a risk. He noted that the company has a large capital surplus and that the high-interest rate environment is driving its profits. However, he also argued that caution shouldn't be completely abandoned in the stablecoin space. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is the Tether (USDT) FUD Real?

Dormant Casascius holdings worth tens of millions of dollars moved for the first time in more than 13 years, while two analysts split over whether the latest price action marks the start of a bear market or a make-or-break test of support near 90,000 dollars. Dormant Casascius Coins Move After More Than 13 Years Two large batches of Bitcoin linked to Casascius physical coins have moved on-chain after sitting dormant for more than 13 years, according to alerts from TimechainBot. The bot reported that transactions of about 1,000.00287192 BTC and 1,000 BTC were broadcast in consecutive blocks 926,566 and 926,567, ending a long period of inactivity for the addresses. Dormant Casascius BTC Transactions Alert. Source: TimechainBot / TimechainIndex Casascius coins are physical tokens created in Bitcoin’s early years, each loaded with a fixed amount of BTC and protected by a hidden private key under a tamper-evident hologram. When holders peel the hologram and sweep the key, the underlying coins can be spent on the blockchain. In this case, the movements suggest that owners of high-value Casascius holdings have decided to redeem or relocate the funds. Each 1,000-BTC tranche would be worth tens of millions of dollars at current market prices, placing the transfers among the larger coin awakenings seen this year. On-chain analysts are now tracking the destination of the funds to see whether they move to exchanges, custodial services, or new long-term storage addresses. Analyst Flags Possible Bitcoin Bear Market Signal Titan of Crypto says Bitcoin may have entered a bear market in the first week of November, based on a divergence between BTC price action and USDT dominance. In his chart, Bitcoin’s weekly trend line slopes upward while USDT’s share of the crypto market begins to turn higher from a falling line, echoing a similar pattern that appeared before the 2021 cycle peak. Bitcoin vs USDT Dominance Divergence Source: Titan of Crypto / TradingView According to the analyst, this combination of a rising stablecoin dominance and an extended Bitcoin advance has previously marked exhaustion in bullish trends. He argues that the recent move could signal a shift from risk-on positioning into stablecoins as traders take profit and reduce exposure. However, confirmation would still depend on how Bitcoin behaves around key support levels in the coming weeks. Analyst Says Bitcoin Must Reclaim 90,000 Dollars After Bounce Meanwhile, Bitcoin bounced after retesting support near the 88,000-dollar area, but trader Ted Pillows says the move remains fragile while price trades under 90,000 dollars. He views 90,000 dollars as a short-term pivot: a clean break and daily close above that level would confirm that buyers have regained control and open room toward the next resistance band around the low-90,000s. The chart shows stacked supply zones above, with heavier resistance sitting closer to 98,000–102,000 dollars. Bitcoin Support And Resistance Levels. Source: Ted Pillows / TradingView However, Ted warns that rejection below 90,000 dollars would keep Bitcoin locked in a tight range and likely send it back to the 87,000–88,000-dollar support. A clear loss of that floor could expose deeper demand areas in the low-80,000s, where an earlier consolidation zone appears on the chart. For now, the structure leaves BTC at an inflection point, with traders watching whether price can flip 90,000 dollars from resistance into support.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-06 14:28:02

The implementation of the proposal involves using A-GPS technology, which functions with both satellite signals and cellular data. The Indian government is considering a telecom industry proposal that would require all smartphones to have satellite-based location tracking permanently enabled, with no option for users to turn it off. Apple and Google reject India’s telecom industry proposal The Cellular Operators Association of India ( COAI ), representing major carriers like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel presented the proposal. According to Reuters, referencing to internal government emails from June, telecom companies want precise user locations provided through A-GPS technology, which uses both satellite signals and cellular data and can allow tracking accurate to within about one meter. Currently, authorities can only use cellular tower data that can only estimate location within several meters. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government was forced to withdraw an order requiring all smartphones to come with a state-run cyber safety app already installed on it, with no option to delete it. However, activists and politicians raised alarms about potential government snooping, which led to the policy’s quick reversal, according to reporting by Cryptopolitan. Apple, Samsung, and Google also told the Indian government not to force the installation of the app. The India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), representing both Apple and Google, sent a confidential letter to authorities in July arguing that the proposal has no precedent anywhere in the world and would constitute “regulatory overreach.” The tech companies stated that A-GPS network services are “not deployed or supported for location surveillance” in their letter. They warned of significant “legal, privacy, and national security concerns,” noting their user base includes military personnel, judges, corporate executives, and journalists who handle sensitive information. Permanently enabled location tracking could compromise their security. “This proposal would see phones operate as a dedicated surveillance device,” Digital forensics expert, Junade Ali, from Britain’s Institution of Engineering and Technology, said. Cooper Quintin, a security researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, called the idea “pretty horrifying” and said he had not heard of any similar proposal elsewhere. Apple recently sent cyber threat notifications to users in 84 countries on December 2, warning them they may have been targeted by state-backed hackers. Apple has now notified users in over 150 countries about potential surveillance threats. Why do India’s telecom companies want this change? India’s Modi administration has expressed frustration for years that government agencies cannot obtain precise locations when making legal requests to telecom firms during investigations. The current cellular tower system can only provide estimated area locations, which are less efficient for surveillance operations. Smartphone makers worsen the issue by displaying pop-up messages alerting users that “your carrier is trying to access your location.” The COAI believes the message alerts the target to the fact that they are being tracked by security agencies. The telecom group is urging the government to order phone makers to disable these notification features entirely. Apple and Google’s lobby group argued in their July letter that these notifications “ensure transparency and user control over their location.” India’s home ministry scheduled a meeting with top smartphone industry executives for Friday to discuss the matter, but it was postponed. At this point, no policy decision has been made by India’s IT or home ministries. India is the world’s second-largest mobile market and had 735 million smartphones as of mid-2025. Google’s Android powers more than 95% of these devices, with Apple’s iOS accounting for the remainder. Any policy decision would affect hundreds of millions of users and set a potential precedent for government surveillance capabilities worldwide.

BREAKING: Major exchange GEMINI says: “Feel the Ripple effect.” SOMETHING HUGE IS COMING FOR #XRP pic.twitter.com/aqZmbgiDjk — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) December 4, 2025 Ripple and Gemini’s Strengthening Link Ripple increased its direct involvement with Gemini this year. The most visible move came through a $75 million credit facility . Gemini disclosed this in its IPO filing. The agreement grants the exchange access to increased liquidity as it progresses toward a public listing. The facility has the option to grow to $150 million if conditions allow. Gemini can also draw part of the facility using RLUSD, which is Ripple’s USD stablecoin. This structure ties the two firms together in a more operational way. More Consumer Products The partnership expanded into consumer products. After weeks of teasers on X, Gemini released an XRP Edition of its credit card . The card gives XRP rewards on everyday purchases, with some merchants providing up to 10% cash back. The card comes from WebBank through Mastercard, but the XRP focus provides Ripple with deeper visibility. The two firms also moved forward with RLUSD support. Ripple, Gemini, WebBank, and Mastercard began a pilot project that explores the settlement of card transactions on the XRP Ledger. The pilot uses RLUSD for those settlement flows . This test shows that the network’s path toward payment use cases goes beyond the exchange environment.

Each step this year pushed Ripple and Gemini closer. The post from Gemini now sits against this backdrop, creating a sense of anticipation. What Gemini’s Message Could Mean for XRP Gemini’s message did not include details. The wording of the post invites speculation because of its suite of consumer-facing products . It may also be close to launching new XRP features that align with the credit card pilot. The message could also point to deeper XRP integration across the exchange as Gemini approaches its IPO. Gemini has not confirmed any specific move, but the recent history of cooperation gives the XRP community a reason to watch for a new update.

According to Bitcoin World market data, Bitcoin is now trading at $90,009.98 on the Binance USDT market. This breakthrough marks a pivotal moment for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, capturing the attention of investors and analysts globally. But what’s fueling this remarkable ascent, and what could it signal for the future of digital assets? What’s Driving the Historic BTC Price Rally? The surge in the BTC price past $90,000 is not an isolated event. Several converging factors are creating a powerful bullish momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption is providing a solid foundation of demand. Major financial firms are integrating Bitcoin into their offerings, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, continue to drive investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Finally, positive regulatory developments in key markets are reducing uncertainty and building investor confidence. This combination of factors creates a potent recipe for sustained growth. Key Implications of Bitcoin’s New Price Territory Crossing the $90,000 threshold is psychologically significant for the market. It demonstrates resilience and validates the long-term investment thesis for many. For traders and holders, this new BTC price level opens up several considerations: Market Sentiment: Such a breakthrough typically fuels positive sentiment, potentially attracting more capital. Volatility Awareness: While exciting, new highs can also precede periods of increased volatility and profit-taking. Network Strength: A higher valuation often correlates with increased security for the Bitcoin network, as miner incentives grow. Therefore, while celebrating the milestone, it’s crucial to maintain a balanced perspective on risk and opportunity. How Should Investors Navigate This BTC Price Environment? With the BTC price at unprecedented levels, both new and experienced participants need a clear strategy. The core principle remains: never invest more than you can afford to lose. For those considering entry, a disciplined approach like dollar-cost averaging can help mitigate timing risk. For existing holders, having a plan for taking profits or rebalancing a portfolio is wise. Most importantly, focus on the fundamental technology and long-term adoption trends rather than short-term price fluctuations. The journey to $90,000 has been volatile, and the path forward will likely be the same. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Gold The breach of the $90,000 mark for the BTC price is a landmark event that reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a formidable asset class. It reflects a maturing market driven by institutional interest, macroeconomic trends, and technological conviction. However, this is a moment for informed optimism, not unchecked euphoria. The cryptocurrency landscape remains dynamic, and continued education and prudent risk management are every investor’s best tools. This milestone is less of a finish line and more of a signpost on Bitcoin’s ongoing journey toward broader financial integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does BTC price surpassing $90,000 mean? It signifies a major psychological and financial milestone, indicating strong buying pressure, growing institutional adoption, and sustained investor confidence in Bitcoin as a digital store of value. Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at this price? Market timing is extremely difficult. Many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest regularly over time, regardless of price, to mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Could the BTC price drop sharply from here? Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Significant price increases are often followed by corrections as some investors take profits. Long-term investors typically focus on the fundamental trend rather than short-term swings. What are the main risks at this BTC price level?

This unexpected move raises questions about the potential price impact. Cryptocurrencies have long sought real-world use cases, but will this news finally make a difference? Delve into this article to discover if DOGE and other digital coins are poised for significant growth. Dogecoin Hovers Beneath Key Levels but Eyes Potential Rise Source: tradingview Dogecoin's price is currently sailing between fourteen and fifteen cents. The coin is facing some hurdles around sixteen cents but could aim for over seventeen and a half if momentum shifts. In contrast, the safety net is at nearly thirteen and a half cents, with a deeper fallback at twelve cents. Over the past week, Dogecoin dipped by over six percent and nearly sixteen percent for the month. While the recent trend shows a downward path, the potential for a bounce-back to break the existing resistance could lead to gains of around twenty-two percent from the current higher range, should buying interest pick up. Conclusion The acceptance of DOGE for taxes in Buenos Aires marks a significant step for its practical use. This real-world utility can boost trust and interest in the coin, potentially impacting its market performance. As mainstream adoption grows, the price could see positive changes. The overall effect on DOGE's value will depend on broader market trends, new use cases, and investor sentiment. It will be important to watch how this integration influences consumer and institutional behavior toward DOGE in the coming months.

ChatGPT still holds the top spot in the AI assistant space. Data from Sensor Tower shows that OpenAI captures half of all worldwide mobile downloads and accounts for 55% of people using AI chatbots each month around the globe. However, Google’s competing product is now growing faster across three key areas: new downloads, monthly active users, and average user engagement time. The numbers have caught OpenAI’s attention. A recent “code red” memo from CEO Sam Altman instructed workers to focus on improving the company’s AI tools. The note highlighted several areas needing improvement, including making responses more personal, enhancing the system’s functionality, and creating more effective images. Growth numbers tell two different stories The competition isn’t finished yet. Both products continue adding users at a strong pace. ChatGPT saw its worldwide monthly user base jump 180% compared to a year earlier, reaching a record 11.5 million users in No vember 2025. Gemini wasn’t far behind with 170% growth over the same period. But a closer look at recent months tells a different story. From August to November, ChatGPT’s monthly users worldwide increased by just 6%, reaching approximately 810 million people. Sensor Tower suggests that this small increase might indicate the product is approaching a ceiling in terms of the number of people who want to use it . Go ogle’s Gemini moved much faster during those same months, with monthly users climbing about 30%. The jump came after the company released Nano Banana, its new tool for creating images, which attracted more users. Google’s Android advantage could change the game Google has another edge that could matter more as time goes on. About twice as many Android phone users in the United States now work with Gemini straight through their phone’s operating system instead of opening a separate app. Since Android dominates the phone market worldwide, this built-in access gives Google a way to reach people beyond just those who download an app or visit a website. Looking at the bigger picture of AI chatbots, which includes ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok, Gemini is grabbing a bigger slice. Between May and November 2025, Gemini picked up three percentage points more of all monthly users across these apps. ChatGPT went the other direction. From August through November 2025, it lost three percentage points of its share of monthly users. Other challengers are also making waves. Both Perplexity and Claude saw their user numbers more than double in 2025. Perplexity shot up 370% compared to the previous year, while Claude grew 190%. The download numbers paint a similar picture. ChatGPT’s worldwide downloads rose 85% compared to a year ago as of November. But that fell short of the 110% average growth seen across all major AI chatbots. Perplexity and Gemini led the pack in download growth, jumping 215% and 190% respectively when compared to the year before. How long people spend using these apps also shows the shift happening. Gemini users more than doubled their time in the app over several months, according to Sensor Tower. By November, people spent an average of 11 minutes per day using Gemini, a 120% increase since March. The company credits Nano Banana’s success after its September launch . Ch atGPT users only increased their daily time by 6% during the same stretch. Even more concerning for OpenAI, time spent using ChatGPT dropped 10% when comparing November to July. While Google appears to be catching up to the market leader, much of its recent success ties back to Nano Banana. OpenAI could regain momentum if it releases new products that make a similar impact on users. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

With BlackRock making a hefty $28.7 million investment, questions arise about a potential rebound. This article explores which cryptocurrencies might be poised for growth amid this renewed confidence. Ethereum Price Drifts, Eyeing Resistance as Potential Catalyst for Growth Source: tradingview Ethereum is currently bouncing between just under $2800 and over $3100. It's flirting with a resistance level just shy of $3300. If it breaks through, Ethereum could test a stronger ceiling at about $3600. That's a possible rise of nearly 15% from the top of the present range. Short-term, the coin has barely moved, with only a small increase this week. However, it's had a rough month, losing over 11%. But keep in mind, long-term holders have reason to celebrate, given the surge of over 21% over six months. The cryptocurrency market's pulse suggests Ethereum is a coin to watch closely. Conclusion ETH has shown resilience after a significant network disruption. The recent investment by BlackRock signals strong institutional interest. This can potentially boost confidence among other investors. If buying momentum continues, ETH may enter a sustained rally. The market will be closely watching these developments.

ProCapBTC, the brainchild of prominent investor Anthony Pompliano, has officially completed its merger with special purpose acquisition company Columbus Circle Capital. This strategic move paves the way for the company to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange starting next Monday, marking a significant step for Bitcoin in the traditional financial arena. What Does the ProCapBTC SPAC Merger Actually Mean? Let’s break down this major development. A SPAC, or Special Purpose Acquisition Company, is essentially a “blank check” shell company designed to take another company public without going through the traditional IPO process. The completion of this ProCapBTC SPAC merger means ProCapBTC has bypassed a lengthy and complex initial public offering. Instead, it merged with an already-listed entity (BRR) to gain immediate access to public markets. This is a faster route that has become popular for bringing innovative tech and crypto-focused firms to major exchanges. Why Is the Nasdaq Listing a Game-Changer? The Nasdaq is one of the world’s largest and most prestigious stock exchanges. A listing here provides immense benefits: Enhanced Legitimacy: Trading on a major U.S. exchange signals maturity and regulatory compliance, attracting a new class of investors. Greater Liquidity and Access: It opens the doors for institutional investors, pension funds, and mainstream traders who may have been hesitant to buy crypto directly on digital asset exchanges. Increased Visibility: Being on the Nasdaq puts ProCapBTC and its Bitcoin-centric mission in front of a global financial audience daily. This move is more than just a ticker symbol change; it’s a bridge between the digital asset ecosystem and traditional finance. Who Is Behind the ProCapBTC SPAC Merger? The driving force is Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, a well-known figure in the crypto space and founder of Pomp Investments. His advocacy for Bitcoin is no secret. By steering ProCapBTC through this ProCapBTC SPAC merger , Pompliano is executing a clear strategy: to create a regulated, accessible public vehicle for exposure to Bitcoin’s growth. His involvement brings a layer of credibility and a dedicated following, which will be crucial as the company navigates public markets. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? Listing on the Nasdaq is a triumph, but the journey is just beginning. The company will now face the constant scrutiny of public markets, including quarterly earnings reports and volatile share price movements tied to both its performance and broader Bitcoin sentiment. However, the opportunity is monumental. If successful, ProCapBTC could become a blueprint for other crypto-native companies seeking public market validation. It offers a tangible way for traditional portfolios to gain Bitcoin exposure without the technical hurdles of custody and private keys. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitcoin Adoption The completion of the ProCapBTC SPAC merger and its imminent Nasdaq debut is a watershed event. It represents the accelerating convergence of cryptocurrency and mainstream finance. For investors, it provides a novel, stock-market-friendly avenue to participate in the Bitcoin ecosystem. For the industry, it demonstrates a path to legitimacy and scale. All eyes will be on the ticker next Monday as this new chapter for institutional Bitcoin investment begins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is ProCapBTC? A: ProCapBTC is a company founded by Anthony Pompliano, designed to provide exposure to Bitcoin and its ecosystem. It has now gone public via a merger with a SPAC. Q: What is a SPAC merger? A: A SPAC merger is when a publicly-traded “blank check” company (the SPAC) merges with a private company to take it public quickly, avoiding a traditional IPO. Q: When will ProCapBTC start trading on Nasdaq? A: According to reports, trading is scheduled to begin on the Nasdaq the Monday following the merger announcement. Q: What will the stock ticker be for ProCapBTC? A: The announcement indicates it will merge with Columbus Circle Capital, which trades under the ticker “BRR.” The new ticker symbol post-merger should be confirmed by the company and Nasdaq. Q: Why is this listing important for Bitcoin? A: It creates a regulated, traditional stock market instrument for gaining Bitcoin exposure, potentially attracting billions in institutional capital that previously stayed on the sidelines. Q: Can I buy Bitcoin directly through this stock? A: No. Buying shares of ProCapBTC is an investment in the company itself, not direct ownership of Bitcoin. The company’s value is expected to be correlated with Bitcoin’s performance. Think this merger is a pivotal moment for crypto?

Meanwhile, there’s a portion of this holder community quietly amassing positions in Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) new cryptocurrency, with its presale Phase 6 being 97% sold out. This significant move indicates an overall trend among holders in favor of high-growth investments based upon the exponential presale sale rate and impending price surge in MUTM. The simultaneous factors reflect not only proactive diversification in this volatile market but also position MUTM among candidates warranting consideration in the best cryptocurrencies to invest in at this time. XRP Price Slowly Forms A Rare Pattern The XRP price saw an increase of 5% on December 2, erasing losses from earlier market uncertainty. However, analysis of technical levels has shown the formation of a falling wedge pattern that historically projects reversals from negative trends. This observed technical trend seems to be supported by that of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator in forecasting positive momentum with the possible breakout from the formed pattern possibly leading towards the $3 level. On the other hand, XRP has seen ETF inflows increase towards $756 million with the asset under management rising towards $723 million in record-breaking time towards the $1 billion level. This level indicates significant appreciation in institutional investment; however, more investors are now chasing opportunities outside popular tokens like XRP in presales like Mutuum Finance. The novel cryptocurrency provides timely investment opportunities considering XRP’s technical levels. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Nears Critical Level Moving the attention away from XRP’s market movements, Mutuum Finance presents itself as an exciting DeFi cryptocurrency project gaining investors’ attention. However, Mutuum Finance’s presale Phase 6 is 95% filled, and this marks the final stage in acquiring MUTM tokens at the current rate of $0.035. This rate has increased by 250% from the Phase 1 ‘buy-in’ rate of $0.01. Phase 7 promises a substantial 20% hike in prices to $0.04. The project has already raised $19,150,000 from 18,350 investors, emphasizing deep levels of confidence in the project’s feasibility. After its successful launch at $0.06, investors could potentially pocket 400% gains in the project’s profitability and potentially cement MUTM’s position in the DeFi cryptocurrency market as the best investment choice yielding substantial financial gains. This particular presale pressure point proves to be one of the most selling features in this project’s favor. Mutuum Finance’s Unique Offerings Apart from the presale momentum, Mutuum Finance also adopts novel technologies that increase project attractiveness. First, the project has developed a dashboard with a 24-hour leaderboard ranking the first 50 holders. The best-ranked holder receives a reward of $500 in MUTM tokens every day if they perform transaction actions in 24 hours. However, the rank resetting occurs every day at 00:00 UTC. Secondly, the project’s security has been enhanced through the current auditing process conducted independently. Halborn Security audits Mutuum’s lending and borrowing smart contracts. This project code has already been finalized and undergoes rigorous analysis. Thirdly, the project’s availability has been increased through the overall major upgrade in card purchases whereby there are no purchase limits. The project’s version 1 protocol will be launched through Sepolia’s testnet in 2025 Q4, starting with support for lending and borrowing in ETH and USDT tokens. Moreover, Mutuum Finance aims to reward followers through the $100,000 giveaway in celebration of the presale. 10 lucky people will pocket $10,000 MUTM. All this makes MUTM one of the best DeFi crypto coins in the market and hence may be considered in terms of what crypto coins are best to be bought now. Capitalizing on Opportunities in this Dynamic Environment The current industry landscape Within current crypto markets, the crossroads between technical analysis of XRP and the presale momentum of MUTM highlights the crucial point of entry for investors. For those considering the purchase of cryptocurrencies currently, Mutuum Finance provides a fresh take in terms of innovation, safety, and future appreciation in value. With Phase 6 selling out, the chance to invest in this new cryptocurrency while still discounted passes quickly in preparation for the future appreciation in value. This DeFi crypto asset provides a clever investment choice in terms of being among the best cryptocurrencies to buy currently.

This move will end the application of different regulatory styles in several member states operating under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA). ESMA’s Single Crypto Authority To Boost Competitiveness, Innovation – EC In a Thursday announcement , the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union (EU), rolled out a series of regulatory measures aimed at creating a singular financial service market. This initiative centers around creating a competitive, innovative, and efficient financial system that offers EU citizens better options for wealth growth and business financing. A statement from the announcement read: Deeper integration of financial markets is not an end, but a means to create a single market for financial services greater than the sum of its national parts. Simplified access to capital markets reduces costs and makes the markets more appealing for investors and companies across all Member States, irrespective of size. In particular, the EC’s new regulatory package will move the oversight of Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs), among other groups of businesses to under the sole authority of the ESMA. Interestingly, the EC’s recent move comes just three months after the French , Austrian, and Italian market authorities pushed for a stronger European framework for cryptocurrencies, citing major differences in each national implementation of the MiCA regulations. Presently, crypto regulation across the 27 EU member states operates under MiCA, resulting in a patchwork of national approaches which the EC claims is hindering competition and effective cross-border operations. The ESMA’s singular regime aims to eliminate these discrepancies in order to provide a better integrated EU financial market. The EC said: Improvements to the supervisory framework are closely linked to the removal of regulatory barriers. The package aims to address inconsistencies and complexities from fragmented national supervisory approaches, making supervision more effective and conducive to cross-border activities, while being responsive to emerging risks. Alongside the new singular regime, the European Commission has also expressed plans to create a friendly environment for the adoption of distributed ledger technology, e.g, blockchains, to spur innovations in the financial sector. However, all these regulatory changes still remain subject to negotiation and approval by the European Parliament and European Council. Crypto Market Overview At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $3.04 trillion, following a slight 0.25% loss in the past day.

He based his prediction on the Bitcoin price action and how ETH could match the flagship crypto on a potential run to the upside. Tom Lee Explains How The Ethereum Price Could Rally To $12,000 Speaking at the Binance Blockchain Week, Tom Lee predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $12,000 as Bitcoin rallies to $250,000 within the next few months. He explained that ETH can reach the $12,000 target if the ETH/BTC ratio returns to its eight-year average of 0.0479. Lee described this potential rally to $12,000 as a “huge move.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price To Recover Or Crash? The Real ‘Leverage Point’ Investors Should Know About Tom Lee further predicted that the Ethereum price could reach $22,000 if the ETH/BTC ratio gets to its 2021 high of 0.0873. He added that he believes Ethereum will become the future of finance and the payment rails. As such, Lee predicted that the ETH/BTC ratio could reach 0.2500, sparking an Ethereum rally to as high as $62,500. In line with this, the expert declared that ETH at $3,000 is “grossly undervalued.” Tom Lee also remarked that the bigger the base, the bigger the breakout for the Ethereum price. He noted that ETH spent years building a similar base to its current price action before the move from $90 to its previous all-time high (ATH) of $4,866. The expert added that if the pattern plays out again, the next leg could be larger than what people expect. It is worth noting that Tom Lee is the chairman of BitMine, which is the largest Ethereum treasury company. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, the company currently holds 3.73 million ETH, which is just over 3% of the altcoin’s total supply. Lee remains bullish on the Ethereum price, despite his company holding an unrealized loss of $3.3 billion of their ETH investment. A Rally To $62,000 Is “Ambitious” Market commentator Milk Road described Tom Lee’s Ethereum price prediction of $62,000 in a few months as being ambitious. The platform stated that an ETH/BTC ratio of 0.25 has never happened. The highest it has ever gone is 0.15, and that was during the 2017 supercycle, which makes it less likely now, given that market conditions have changed. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Go Into A Bear Market? Tom Lee had based his Ethereum prediction on Bitcoin hitting $250,000, which Milk Road also described as an issue. The market commentator noted that BTC would need to surge 177% from current prices to reach this target. The last time this happened was in 2020 when it surged from $7,000 to $19,000 during the “peak mania.” Notably, BTC didn’t record a 100% gain even when the Bitcoin ETFs launched last year. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,000, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

55429997,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91588,1765033462,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Shares Updated XRP Price Targets,https://timestabloid.com/expert-shares-updated-xrp-price-targets/,"A new wave of analysis is reshaping expectations for XRP as multiple market forces converge. Liquidity cycles, global bond stress, and tightening token supply are creating a narrative that many analysts believe could trigger major price movement. The latest update offers a detailed breakdown of these conditions and why they matter now. In his recent X broadcast, Zach Rector projected near-term XRP targets between $7 and $10 . His outlook combines macro signals, institutional expansion, and supply-side pressures. These elements form the core of his updated analysis while aligning with broader market data and recent ecosystem developments. Global Bond Market Stress Rector pointed to rising tension within the Japanese bond market. The Bank of Japan issued warnings about uncertain rate paths. Japanese regional banks now face record unrealized losses on domestic bonds. New Update just dropped! XRP Targets $7-$10 https://t.co/7HZD7vgCgs — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) December 5, 2025 These losses surged sharply after Japan’s first rate hike since 2007. Similar pressure exists in the United States, as commercial banks also hold large unrealized losses on bond books. These stresses restrict global liquidity and increase the chance of future easing. Institutional Demand Through ETFs XRP spot ETFs continue to see sustained adoption . Recent trading sessions recorded steady inflows and strong daily volume. These funds require significant XRP reserves, which removes tokens from active circulation. This trend supports the argument for a shrinking effective float on exchanges. Institutional rails are expanding, and liquidity demands are rising alongside them. DeFi Lockups and Shrinking Tradable Supply The launch of Firelight on Flare added another supply sink. The protocol reached its first 25 million XRP deposit cap within hours. These deposits represent tokens locked in staking, lending, or liquidity pools. The broader Flare F-asset system adds even more locked supply. When combined with ETF custody and long-term private holdings, the accessible float becomes far smaller than the reported circulating supply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Sentiment Indicators and Market Psychology Social analysis from Santiment shows elevated fear across XRP communities. The data reflects a dominance of bearish commentary over bullish remarks. Historically, similar fear clusters preceded rapid price recoveries. This pattern suggests a potential turning point as sentiment nears exhaustion. Technical Outlook and Key Levels Analysts referenced by Rector point to critical support near $2.04. Holding this level could establish a new bullish wave toward higher resistance targets. A deeper retracement remains possible if this support fails. However, both main scenarios still align with projected moves toward $7 to $10. The analysis highlights a decisive period for XRP’s structure. Final Perspective Rector’s outlook rests on visible trends. Bond market instability limits central bank flexibility. ETF expansion strengthens institutional demand. DeFi growth continues to lock up supply. These forces shape the argument for higher XRP prices in the coming cycle. Traders should watch liquidity conditions, ETF flows, and new protocol lockups as the next market phase develops.

See Why and Buyers,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-must-sell-25-of-xrp-in-escrow-soon-see-why-and-buyers/,"Crypto Sensei (@Crypt0Senseii) released a clip that highlighted a topic many holders follow but rarely hear explained with precision. He described how Ripple can manage its escrowed XRP and introduced scenarios that could influence future supply dynamics. In the tweet, he noted that Ripple “could sell the right to receive the tokens released from escrow or even sell the accounts the escrow completes into” but stressed that the XRP “still can’t circulate.” His point centered on the difference between contractual rights and actual on-chain movement. He said that people make claims about quiet deals with major institutions, such as BlackRock, but he urged caution. He added that “we can speculate,” yet the facts “we can actually prove are much different.” #RIPPLE MUST SELL 25% #XRP SOON??? WHO IS THE BUYER??? pic.twitter.com/bieU9z7iPN — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) December 4, 2025 The Escrow System His message placed attention on the repeated relocking of XRP. Ripple has been relocking about 700 million XRP after each monthly escrow release . Crypto Sensei questioned the idea that Ripple already sold large amounts to institutions because, in his view, those tokens would not return to escrow if they were no longer under Ripple’s control. This became the foundation of his argument that many claims in the community need a closer look. Will Ripple Sell Its Escrowed Tokens? Crypto Sensei acknowledged that Ripple can sell XRP to institutions in specific ways. He believes this can include selling rights tied to escrowed tokens. He did not state that such sales have occurred. He instead described it as a future possibility. His video then shifted to the Clarity Act . He explained that the bill includes a rule that prevents a single company from owning more than 20% of a blockchain’s total tokens. He stated that Ripple holds approximately 45 billion XRP, which equals roughly 45% of the supply. In his view, Ripple must reduce its holdings by about 25% to comply if the bill passes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He outlined two possible outcomes. Ripple may need to reveal who controls certain escrow wallets. It may also need to present a clear plan to bring its 45 billion XRP down to 20 billion. These comments matter because any future reduction of Ripple’s holdings could influence market confidence. What it Means for XRP’s Prospects XRP’s price growth often depends on clear information about supply, especially when large holders play a major role in the market structure. Crypto Sensei’s comments show a defined path for Ripple’s holdings. He suggested that the next phase becomes more important if the Clarity Act advances. Investors want predictable supply movements. How XRP sells its tokens could determine its trajectory, and the buyer may be just as important. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For some the correction felt like a setback but for others it created opportunity. Prices cooled, valuations normalized, and capital rotated into early stage projects that show real technical advancement. In this environment, Mono Protocol has emerged as one of the most compelling crypto presale opportunities. The protocol combines unique technology, strong execution, and a clear economic model that aligns with market needs. With a token sale currently in Stage 19 at $0.0550, and a projected launch price of $0.500, the potential upside is significant. After the Drawdown, Investors Look for High-Utility Systems The correction across altcoins created a reset point. When prices decline, capital becomes selective. It flows toward innovation, scalability, and strong execution. That is why a well designed crypto presale catches attention now more than ever. Mono Protocol combines three factors that stand out: timing, technology, and product market fit. The project has already raised $3.77M out of a $3.80M stage target, with $3.77M raised toward the full goal of $22.8M. Demand is coming from both retail buyers and industry professionals. A completed $2M private round included strategic individuals from Revolut, Crypto.com, ConsenSys, Ethereum and Google. These networks represent expertise, not speculation, and it strengthens confidence that Mono Protocol is built for long-term adoption. Liquidity Locks and Instant Execution The technology stack includes Liquidity Locks, which guarantee settlement without reverts. Transactions are executed instantly and without exposure to MEV attacks. This improves trader confidence and makes every interaction predictable. Performance metrics highlight the advantage. Mono Protocol delivers up to 40% faster cross-chain execution with no security trade-offs. It avoids frontrunning, price impact, and value leakage. For the user, the benefit is clear, faster, cheaper, and more reliable transactions. Token Utility Designed for Network Growth The MONO token plays a central role in the ecosystem. It is used for universal gas, protocol fees, and routing. Operators stake MONO to secure the network and earn rewards. Solvers and routers bond MONO to guarantee instant settlement under the Liquidity Locks model. Each use case drives demand. Every transaction requires MONO for fees. Every operator needs MONO for staking. Every solver bonds MONO for execution guarantees. This creates a circular economic model that supports long-term token value. With the crypto presale priced at $0.0550 and a token launch target of $0.500, the upside is compelling. Current metrics estimate a potential profit of up to 809% for early participants if launch targets are achieved. Roadmap Shows Execution, Not Promises Investors often look at promises with caution. Mono Protocol shows progress and delivery instead. The roadmap is active and detailed. Q3 2025 stage is complete.

Shelton also strongly supported White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's potential candidacy for Fed Chair. Shelton described a rate cut at the Fed's meeting next Wednesday as “almost inevitable.” Shelton noted that the 32,000 job losses in the private sector were particularly concerning, and emphasized the importance of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data coming in line with expectations. According to Shelton, if inflation data had been higher, it could have strengthened the hand of hawkish members of the Fed who “want to maintain restrictive interest rates.” However, Shelton noted that currently, small businesses, in particular, are being crushed by loan interest rates of 8% to 12%, which is hindering growth, and that the interest rate cut is justified. Related News: Big Bull Strategy CEO Responds to Claims They Will Sell Bitcoin! “FUD” The program also questioned White House Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's comments that the American economy had entered a “historic golden age.” Hassett predicted that increased demand from tax breaks on tips, overtime, and Social Security payments, combined with the efficiencies brought about by artificial intelligence, would stimulate the economy. Judy Shelton stated that she “100% agreed” with Hassett's view. Referencing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant's definition of “shared prosperity,” Shelton stated that we are entering a period where the financial and real sectors will benefit together, and that growth rates could approach 4%. Asked for his thoughts on President Trump's nomination of Kevin Hassett as the next Fed Chair, Shelton was full of praise for his colleague. “I think Kevin Hassett is a superb economist and a great choice,” Shelton said. Shelton emphasized the critical importance of Hassett's belief in the Trump administration's “supply-side economics” agenda (lower taxes, reduced regulations, and smart energy and trade policies), noting his keen understanding of the inflation-reducing effects of these policies and the importance of access to capital. Finally, addressing concerns about AI-related layoffs, Shelton emphasized that foreign investment and new manufacturing companies will require workforce resources. He added that he is optimistic that technology-driven productivity gains could improve the long-term employment outlook. *This is not investment advice.

As investors find the new markets’ zeal for new crypto projects making DOGE no longer the “diamond mine” it once was, the markets are finding it necessary to turn to crypto projects that provide true use and sound and viable tokenomics, and as such, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has come into focus as the best crypto to buy. MUTM is an emergent DeFi crypto that utilizes a decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem, complete with interest-bearing tokens and yield incentives, and as such, it’s gaining steam as the crypto that, despite already having reached Phase 6 of the ongoing presale and boasting an already 95% sale-out, provides investors the necessary growth that DOGE no longer does. Priced currently at the market’s pre-sale price of $0.035, investors are already seeing the crypto’s use and functionality, as well as the impending V1 launch coming on the Sepolia testnet, and as such, MUTM looks to provide the opening salvo that DOGE no longer brings to the markets. Dogecoin Tries for Rebound as Buyers Probe Vital Resistance Levels Dogecoin (DOGE) appears to be showing the first glimpses of a potential resurgence following an aggressive reaction to an important demand pocket, breaking above the June low support extension and thus leaving an imbalance zone, which indicates the beginning of new buying interest. On the technical charts, the ticker begins to escape the deeply over-extended descending channel and the consequent break above the narrowing range that was formed just above major levels. Provided that the new buying interest sustains and the breakthrough above the decreasing resistance range becomes reality, the DOGE/USD pair could press further, but the $0.158–$0.165 levels are an important obstacle to overcome. Upon successful reclaiming, the ticker would open the gates for the $0.175–$0.180 area. In the meantime, while investors are determining the authenticity of the new break, attention focuses on new/up-and-coming use case-associated projects that are gaining mass attention, as the spotlight currently focuses on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is on the cusp of an important phase of their presale, and the interest shown by investors across all levels has been increasing steadily. Starting from $0.01 during Phase 1, MUTM tokens are already up to $0.035 during Phase 6 and are inching their way towards the listing price of $0.06. This means that buyers are actually paying less than half the value during listing, which translates to an accumulative increase of 600% from phase 1. MUTM has already raised over $19.18 million, and it has attracted over 18,350 investors. This makes MUTM the leading DeFi crypto in 2025. Since Phase 6 of the project is already over 95% sold, there are limited supplies left, and the approaching Phase 7, which sees the price hike to $0.04, serves to create urgency. This makes the present phase one of the last moments for investors to join the program, thus solidifying MUTM as the best crypto to buy before the launch. Investor Enthusiasm Mounts as Phase 6 Approaches Full Allocation Momentum from Phase 6 showcases an increasing confidence in the fundamentals of Mutuum Finance. This becomes clear as the presale’s tiered pricing and soft caps have always rewarded early investors, and every phase of the presale has been quick to sell out. This 250% growth already achieved only showcases how the desire for MUTM, the DeFi crypto project that has high potential for 2026, keeps increasing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has attained $19.18M raised from 18,350+ investors, with Phase 6 over 95% sold for $0.035. The launch for the V1 Sepolia testnet is imminent, providing an entire lending and borrowing platform, which makes it one of the last opportunities to acquire the best crypto to buy before the price increases to $0.04. This firmly establishes MUTM as the top DeFi crypto for investors aiming to benefit from early-stage growth and real-world utility.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/smart-escrows-are-coming-to-the-xrp-ledger-heres-the-significance/,"The XRP Ledger is entering a new phase of innovation. Its escrow system has always been efficient, but it was limited to time-based and hash-based releases. That model is about to transform. A more advanced form of conditional settlement is emerging, and it carries major implications for automation, institutional adoption, and digital finance. Vet, a well-known XRPL validator and ecosystem contributor, revealed the update on X . His post highlighted a major upgrade that introduces programmable, on-chain logic to the native escrow feature. This means escrows will soon support custom conditions governed directly on the ledger. Understanding the Shift to Smart Escrows Smart Escrows expand the basic escrow model with embedded, verifiable logic. The feature allows each escrow to contain a small program that evaluates preset conditions. The program determines whether the escrow should release or return funds. This design upgrades escrow behavior without creating a heavy smart-contract system. How the Conditional Logic Works The new logic operates inside the escrow object. It checks on-chain data or oracle inputs against rules set during escrow creation. Since the logic is lightweight, it preserves the XRPL’s speed and efficiency. Developers can now automate simple agreements directly on the ledger without building external systems. The Role of Oracles in Smart Escrows Oracles will play a central role in the feature’s adoption. They can supply external data such as price feeds, exchange rates, or compliance confirmations. If a condition is met, the escrow can release funds instantly. If not, the funds remain locked. This capability enables trust-minimized execution between all parties. New Use Cases Across Finance Price-based escrows are one major use case. A user can lock funds until XRP reaches a set price. Businesses can automate vendor payments after delivery confirmation. Lenders can release collateral when obligations are met. Institutions can design programmable settlement flows for cross-border operations. Smart Escrows unlock these use cases without custom code bases. The upgrade requires validators to run updated software. Proper updates ensure that the amendment activates smoothly. Coordinated readiness protects the ledger from disruption. The XRPL community is already preparing for the change through testing and phased releases. Why This Advancement Matters Smart Escrows merge automation with the XRPL’s reliability. Users gain transparency because all conditions appear on-chain. Institutions benefit from predictable execution. Developers gain an expressive tool without sacrificing performance. The feature keeps the XRPL lightweight while expanding its transactional logic. Smart Escrows mark a significant advancement for the XRP Ledger . They offer richer automation, stronger guarantees, and new financial possibilities. As testing progresses and validators finalize upgrades, this feature is set to redefine conditional settlement across the XRPL ecosystem.
