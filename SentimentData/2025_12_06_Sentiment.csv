This leaves the country as the last EU member without a national MiCA-style regime. According to a Bloomberg report, the vote was held in the lower house of parliament on Friday, falling short of the three-fifths majority required to overturn President Karol Nawrocki’s decision to reject the legislation. The outcome halts Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s push to place Poland’s crypto sector under tight regulatory control and forces the government to restart the legislative process from scratch. Tusk Flags Crypto as National Security Threat Amid Russia Sabotage Claims Tusk had framed the bill as a national security measure in the days leading up to the vote. Addressing parliament, he said the unregulated crypto market had become a conduit for money laundering and foreign interference, including activity linked to Russia and Belarus. He told lawmakers that Polish authorities had identified “several hundred” foreign entities operating in the domestic crypto market and warned that Russian intelligence and organized crime groups were exploiting digital assets for covert financing. Government officials have tied those concerns to recent security incidents. Last month, Warsaw blamed Russia for a blast on a key railway route used for supply traffic to Ukraine, an allegation Moscow dismissed. Polish security services have also cited cases of underground groups allegedly paid in cryptocurrencies to carry out sabotage activities inside the country. Russia is using cryptocurrencies to pay saboteurs carrying out hybrid attacks across the European Union, according to a Polish security official. #Russia #Crypto https://t.co/MsOjIZjSfu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 14, 2025 The veto has deepened an already sharp political confrontation between Nawrocki, a nationalist conservative, and Tusk’s pro-European coalition. The president rejected the bill earlier this month , arguing that it went far beyond EU requirements and threatened civil liberties, property rights, and the stability of the state. Polish President Karol Nawrocki vetoed a sweeping crypto law, saying it threatens property rights and personal freedoms. #Crypto #Regulation https://t.co/BXYSh74MPF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2025 The blocked law would have implemented MiCA-style rules in Poland, introducing licensing for crypto-asset service providers, investor protection standards, stablecoin reserve requirements, market abuse bans, and strict anti-money laundering controls. It also proposed granting authorities the power to block crypto-related websites through administrative orders, a provision the president described as opaque and vulnerable to abuse. Political Tensions Rise After Poland Blocks Sweeping Crypto Oversight Bill Nawrocki also criticized the scale of the bill, which exceeded 100 pages, contrasting it with far shorter implementing laws in neighboring Czechia and Slovakia. He warned that heavy supervisory fees and added domestic restrictions would drive Polish crypto firms to register in other EU countries, costing Poland tax revenue and talent. His chief of staff, Zbigniew Bogucki, said on Friday that the president is open to regulation as long as future proposals are not excessively restrictive. The failure to override the veto leaves crypto companies operating in Poland without a clear national legal framework ahead of the EU’s July 1, 2026, MiCA compliance deadline. The political dispute has increasingly drawn in industry players. Nawrocki has portrayed himself as a defender of the crypto sector and was endorsed before his election by Kristi Noem, a senior U.S. official, at a conference in southeast Poland sponsored by trading platform Zondacrypto. Poland has elected Karol Nawrocki, a conservative who says crypto should be “born in freedom, not buried in red tape.” #poland #crypto https://t.co/BVJXhQBnrK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 The exchange later stated that it accepts no Russian clients and fully complies with anti-money laundering rules. Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski added another dimension to the dispute on Friday, saying on radio RMF FM that the crypto industry sponsors figures across the right wing of Polish politics, explaining the sharp resistance to tighter oversight. The veto follows months of turbulence around crypto regulation in Poland. In September, lawmakers had initially passed the bill , triggering strong backlash from industry leaders who warned that Poland’s version of MiCA amounted to overregulation . Zondacrypto’s chief executive at the time described it as a “step backwards” that risked criminalizing core blockchain development activity.

The model warns that all three cryptocurrencies could experience heightened turbulence over the coming weeks, with major moves possible in either direction. Below are Qwen3-MAX’s two-track predictions showing both the potential upside and the risks each asset may face throughout December. XRP (XRP): Alibaba AI Sees Either a Drop to $0.15 or a Run Toward $10 by Year-End In its pessimistic projection, Alibaba’s model suggests Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could retreat from its current $2.06 level to around $0.15, a drop of roughly 93%, should bearish sentiment continue dominating the market. Source: Alibaba Such a correction would contrast sharply with XRP’s powerful performance earlier this year, when the token soared to a new seven-year high of $3.65 in July following Ripple’s pivotal legal win over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout most of 2025, XRP has hovered between $2 and $3. Its relative strength index (RSI) now sits at a neutral 37 and is downtrending as traders cash in on profits today from a brief price bounce yesterday. However, Alibaba’s bullish outlook paints a very different picture, one in which XRP surges 385% to touch $10 before New Year’s Eve, almost tripling its all-time high. The recent debut of nine U.S. spot XRP ETFs could fuel a wave of institutional interest this holiday season, echoing the early inflows seen when Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs first launched. More ETF approvals are anticipated in the coming months, increasing the probability that 2026 becomes a transformative year for XRP. Investors who accumulate now may find themselves well-positioned ahead of that shift. Cardano (ADA): Alibaba Predicts a Potential 2,274% Explosion in December Cardano ($ADA) remains one of the most academically rigorous and research-driven blockchain ecosystems. Launched by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, the network prioritizes peer-reviewed development, security, scalability, and long-term sustainability. With a market cap exceeding $15.6 billion and more than $189 million in TVL , Cardano continues to stand out among layer-1 networks thanks to its active development community and expanding suite of decentralized applications. According to Alibaba AI, ADA could surge to approximately $10 by early 2026, an extraordinary 2,274% climb from its current price at $0.4212 and more than triple its 2021 peak of $3.09. Analysts note that Cardano’s carefully paced upgrades and robust fundamentals could position it as a major winner in the next DeFi-centric bull cycle. Still, Alibaba’s bearish prediction warns that ADA could slip toward $0.10 if macro weakness worsens, representing a downside of just over 76% from today’s price. Dogecoin (DOGE): Alibaba AI Targets $2.50 in Moonshot Scenario and $0.02 in Potential Collapse Dogecoin ($DOGE) , initially created in 2013 as a parody of the crypto boom, now accounts for roughly $21.7 billion in market value, representing nearly half of the $45.8 billion meme-coin sector. The token formed several bullish chart setups in late summer and early autumn, but momentum has since cooled. In Alibaba’s more negative scenario, DOGE could sink to $0.02, a drop of about 86% from its current price of $0.1387. Dogecoin’s all-time high of $0.7316 came during the retail-driven mania of 2021, and its long-discussed $1 milestone remains elusive. Yet Alibaba’s bullish case suggests DOGE could actually rally 1,700% to $2.50, or 18x its current price. Meanwhile, real-world adoption continues to grow: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise, and payment platforms including PayPal and Revolut support DOGE transactions. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Rapidly Emerging Meme Coin Overlooked by Alibaba’s Forecasts While Alibaba AI highlights the upside potential for major blue-chip cryptocurrencies, early-stage presale tokens potentially deliver far larger percentage gains. One fast-growing contender is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which has already brought in nearly $4.3 million as it positions itself as the next breakout Doge-themed meme coin. MAXI’s narrative follows Maxi Doge, a canine crypto bro and degen distant relative to the original Dogecoin. Maxi is obsessed with lifting weights, trading meme coins with 1,000x leverage, and cultivating a degen community across social media to help him usurp Dogecoin’s throne. As an ERC-20 token, MAXI benefits from Ethereum’s energy-efficient proof-of-stake network and its massive developer ecosystem, advantages that Dogecoin’s older Bitcoin-style proof-of-work consensus mechanism does not offer. The ongoing presale includes staking rewards of up to 72% APY, although yields decrease as more participants join in. MAXI is currently priced at $0.0002715 in its active presale phase, with automated price increases scheduled in upcoming rounds. Buyers can participate using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

The tax authority HMRC has said that putting digital coins or stablecoins like USDC and USDT onto decentralised finance platforms won’t count as a taxable event at the moment of deposit. This means people who lend out their cryptocurrency, stake it, or borrow money against it won’t face capital gains charges just for placing their digital holdings onto these platforms. Stani Kulechov, who started the DeFi platform Aave , said the decision follows years of back-and-forth discussions with tax officials and brings much-needed answers to users. Tax bills will now only kick in when someone actually gets rid of their assets by selling them, swapping them for something else, or cashing out. Moving tokens in and out of DeFi protocols is being treated as having “no gain, no loss,” giving people clearer rules about what they’ll owe. What this means for crypto users “For users, this is significant,” Kulechov told Yahoo Finance Future Focus. “They now have more clarity over HMRC’s approach, and they can use DeFi lending protocols to borrow funds against their collateral without creating a taxable event or a disposal.” The tax authority made it clear that locking up cryptocurrency as collateral for a loan, or putting a single token into a lending or staking arrangement, wouldn’t trigger a tax charge when deposited under this “no gain, no loss” approach. The taxable moment generally gets pushed back until there’s an actual disposal, such as selling or exchanging the asset. Kulechov said this clarity might also push more professional investors to try crypto innovations. These bigger players have often stayed away from DeFi because they weren’t sure about the rules and taxes. “It simplifies the tax approach, which reduces the burden and allows for wider adoption by institutions, but also simplifies things for regular retail users,” he said. Kulechov pointed out that getting more people to use decentralised finance depends heavily on making it simpler. Up until now, DeFi has mostly attracted people who know their way around blockchain wallets and exchanges. Aave is trying to change that by building a consumer-friendly experience that works on mobile phones, letting users shift money from regular bank accounts into Aave without much hassle. The platform handles the complicated technical stuff behind the scenes. “Providing a seamless mobile experience is a really big opportunity for retail users,” he said. “It makes yield generation and lending accessible to a much wider audience.” Changes to traditional savings The new guidance arrives as traditional savings options in Britain are becoming less appealing. The government’s autumn budget decided to cut cash ISA allowances, which could push many savers to look for better returns elsewhere. Starting April 2027, the yearly cash ISA limit for people under 65 will drop from £20,000 to £12,000, giving people less room for tax-free cash savings. DeFi platforms like Aave, on the other hand, let users earn steady returns on their digital assets that don’t move with traditional markets, while still being able to put money in or take it out whenever they want. Kulechov said this mix is becoming more attractive to savers hunting for new financial options. “What DeFi really helps with is accessing yield and financial opportunities,” Kulechov said. “Aave has been battle-tested over the past five years and shows how decentralized finance as financial infrastructure can work effectively, mitigating single points of failure through smart contracts.” Get seen where it counts.

55403329,https://cryptonews.com/?p=460504,1764974100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55403329.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Today 5 December – XRP, Solana, PEPE",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-today-5-december-xrp-solana-pepe/,"Bitcoin is currently holding the fort above $91k after a prolonged downturn sent the world’s favourite crypto down to a seven-month low of $82,000 by November 21, not long after Bitcoin notched a new all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 on October 6. The wider crypto market jumped 6% yesterday, lifting total capitalization to about $3.24 trillion. Today, momentum has cooled with a near 2% drop to $3.18 trillion. Bulls remain optimistic that this pause is consolidation, not capitulation. Additionally, with crypto entering maturity, Bitcoin dominance is generally falling, indicating that the next substantial bull market may well be powered by altcoins. With that in mind, here’s why XRP, Solana, and Pepe are the best crypto to buy right now. XRP ($XRP): Transforming Global Cross-Border Payments Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to dominate the international value-transfer niche thanks to its fast settlement speeds and minimal fees. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) serves as Ripple’s answer to slow, expensive legacy systems like SWIFT. Major institutions, including the UN Capital Development Fund and U.S. government agencies, have highlighted the XRPL’s utility, while Ripple’s expanding network of fintech partners has helped XRP secure its position as the third-largest non-stablecoin, now capitalizing over $124 billion. Ripple’s rollout of RLUSD, a dollar-backed stablecoin, marks a strategic move to capture the next generation of global payments infrastructure. Every RLUSD transaction burns a small amount of XRP, gradually reducing supply and reinforcing XRP’s long-term value proposition. Following the resolution of its five-year legal battle with the SEC, XRP rallied to a July high of $3.65. Its current price near $2.09 represents a 43% retracement, but indicators suggest resilience. Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) sits at 36, indicating the token is likely to conclude today’s -2.8% selloff over the weekend and swing back into green. The recent introduction of nine U.S.-based XRP ETFs is expected to accelerate institutional inflows throughout the holiday season. Additional ETF approvals may follow, and if Congress successfully passes comprehensive crypto legislation before year-end, XRP could target $15 or more by 2026. Solana (SOL): The Speed Leader Closing In on a Potential $1,200 Target Solana ($SOL) has cemented itself as a top-tier smart-contract network, prized for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees. With a market cap surpassing $76 billion and almost $9 billion in total value locked across its DeFi protocols, Solana remains Ethereum’s most formidable competitor. New Solana spot ETFs from Grayscale and Bitwise, launched late last month, could open the door to significant capital inflows, echoing earlier institutional waves that propelled Bitcoin and Ethereum to new heights. After dipping near $100 earlier this year, SOL now trades around $136, holding firm at a critical support zone. A bullish flag pattern has taken shape since mid-September, signaling a potential breakout. The next major resistance sits near $250; a decisive move above that level could propel SOL beyond its prior ATH of $293.31, with a 4x up to $1,200 emerging as an ambitious yet attainable stretch target if the festive season turns into a bull market. At the same time, Solana has become a leading hub for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, with giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton choosing the network to deploy tokenized financial products. Pepe (PEPE): The Internet’s Favorite Frog Prepares for a Potential Upswing Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly rose through the meme-token ranks, capitalizing on the global popularity of Matt Furie’s iconic character. Now boasting a market cap above $1.9 billion, PEPE enjoys an unmatched cultural presence, amplified when Elon Musk briefly switched his X profile picture to a Pepe meme, fueling speculation about his meme coin interests. Musk is publicly known to hold Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Currently priced near $0.000004554, PEPE sits roughly 84% below its late-2024 high of $0.00002803 after a quiet summer and subdued fourth quarter. Its RSI is now around 45, which indicates the token is neither overbought nor oversold and has plenty of headroom for further gains over the weekend. With the token hovering near its lowest valuation in nearly two years, PEPE offers traders a high-upside entry point ahead of the next major market run. Clearer U.S. regulatory guidance could revive risk appetite and fuel a meme coin gold rush, potentially giving PEPE the momentum to retest its all-time high before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 Built for 2026 and Beyond One emerging project generating buzz ahead of 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin layer-2 solution wrapped in meme-culture branding. Despite its playful façade, HYPER targets real technical improvements with high-speed throughput, ultra-low fees, and smart-contract functionality. Developed using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER features decentralized governance and a Canonical Bridge designed for seamless Bitcoin movement across multiple chains. The presale has already raised around $29 million, and prominent analyst Borch Crypto forecasts the token could surge up to 100× upon exchange listing. A recent Coinsult audit revealed zero contract vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. HYPER tokens power transaction fees, governance, and staking, with presale users able to earn up to 40% APY. With the project’s full platform release planned for 2026, both seasoned Bitcoin users and newcomers have the chance to position themselves early in what may evolve into a major enhancement of Bitcoin’s utility landscape.

According to an X post from the founder of the SlowMist Blockchain security firm, the user who was exploited was named “Babur,” and they had their wallets drained of about $27 million in total. Crypto holder loses funds to malware attack The blockchain security expert was able to trace some of the biggest transactions and surmised that the exploit was the result of scammers poisoning Babur’s computer after he clicked a malicious website link, which triggered an automatic download of an executable file. Of course, this wasn’t a typical phishing email. It was more insidious and likely disguised, but once executed, the malware scanned for critical crypto-related information, used keyloggers to glean passwords and private keys. After that, it automated the transfer of the data to the hacker. According to popular claims, such poisoning scams are currently mostly effective on computers on which private keys and sensitive data are stored, rather than iPhones. But since the investigation is still ongoing, everything remains speculation at this point. The founder, who goes by @evilcosuser on X, claims that real poisoning attacks are not as complex or advanced, reassuring everyone that there is no need to panic. Upbit hack headlined exploits in November The attack on Babur is one of the most recent attacks on the cryptocurrency industry. Last month on the 27th, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit reportedly had $30 million worth of assets stolen from its Solana wallet due to a security weakness, which led to the theft of Official Trump, USD Coin, BONK, and other tokens. And as in Babur’s case, the weakness enabled private key inference. All digital asset transactions were halted following the incident, which many suspect may have been conducted by the North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group. “This breach is a direct result of Upbit’s inadequate security management, and there is no room for excuses. Upbit, which prioritizes member protection, promises that no damage will occur to member assets,” said Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok, who reassured users that the private key vulnerability has since been fixed. Upbit intends to leverage its assets to convert customer losses due to the breach and has already commenced an extensive security system review and wallet system restructuring that has seen the exchange tear down its entire deposit address system and rebuild from scratch. According to the exchange, the purge is part of a broader hardening of its wallet infrastructure after the hack revealed lingering vulnerabilities. Now, all users — across every asset and every network — are required to generate new addresses before depositing again. The company said the decision was meant to eliminate any compromised keys or undiscovered vulnerabilities that remain in circulation. South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is monitoring the process as part of its ongoing inspection.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Fails To Shake Ripple CEO — He Still Calls For $180K According to the bank, the move would go beyond the derivative products that most Russian banks have offered so far. It is a clear shift toward opening traditional finance to digital assets, at least for now among wealthy clients. Client Eligibility And Timetable Reports have disclosed that VTB intends to begin with high-net-worth customers only. The bank set thresholds for its initial offering: clients with assets above $1.3 million or annual income over $649,000 would be eligible at first. Andrey Yatskov, who heads VTB’s brokerage arm, said there is “sharp demand” from clients for access to actual crypto, not just paper products tied to token prices. The bank has picked 2026 as the planned start year, but it made that clear the launch depends on regulators signing off. Real Crypto, Not Just Contracts Based on reports, the service would allow ownership of the underlying coins — not merely derivative contracts or token-linked notes. That is a significant distinction in Russia, where until recently banks were limited to offering exposure through derivative instruments. Allowing customers to hold coins directly would require legal and compliance work, from custody arrangements to anti-money-laundering controls. Those steps are on the critical path before any retail expansion can happen. Potential Market Signals VTB has also given investors a sense of how it views crypto as an asset class. The bank recommended a 7% allocation to crypto for some investor profiles, and its internal forecasts have mentioned medium-term Bitcoin price targets in the $200,000–$250,000 range under favorable conditions. If VTB moves forward, it could be the first major Russian bank to operate in this way — a signal that some parts of the financial sector see token ownership as something to be offered through mainstream channels. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets Regulatory Hurdles And Geopolitics The plan is not risk free. Russian regulation of crypto is still evolving, and any permit to offer direct trading will require approval from the relevant authorities. Sanctions and other geopolitical pressures could alter timelines or force changes to how the service is structured. Compliance teams will need to reconcile domestic rules with international restrictions that affect many big banks operating in or dealing with Russia. For now, the rollout remains conditional. VTB’s timeline, client criteria, and product design all hinge on legal clarifications and regulator consent. Market participants and clients will likely follow announcements from the Bank of Russia and other agencies to judge how soon broader access might come.

55405263,640848,1764975653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55405263.jpeg,Layoff Rumors And Metaverse Cuts Push Meta Shares Higher—Details,https://bitcoinist.com/layoff-rumors-and-metaverse-cuts-push-meta-shares-higher-details/,"Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back. Metaverse Budget Faces A Major Trim Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces. Reality Labs Has Been Losing Billions Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money. Investors Reward A Smaller Bet The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns. Layoffs Could Follow Early Next Year Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software. A Bigger Push Toward AI And Wearables At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie. What This Means For Users And Competitors For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business. Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.

Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week 2025, he dismissed the current bearish mood around crypto as temporary and completely out of sync with the fundamentals supporting the market. 2026 has the potential to be “the most bullish year in crypto yet,” with institutions paving the way for a $180,000 Bitcoin. BREAKING: RIPPLE $XRP CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE PREDICTS BITCOIN WILL HIT $180,000 BY THE END OF 2026. pic.twitter.com/uIRgKm7zIr — Crypto Rover (@cryptorover) December 3, 2025 The pro-crypto regulatory shift in the U.S. has unlocked one-fifth of global GDP, with institutional-level demand only just being tapped into with the introduction of ETFs. And they have only just permeated the mainstream with traditional asset manager giants outside of digital-native firms playing “catch-up,” introducing their vast clientele. Garlinghouse rejects the idea that ETF demand has peaked, noting the few crypto offerings represent just 1–2% of all ETF assets, a tiny fraction that leaves enormous upside. XRP is a standout beneficiary with steps towards regulation, like the GENIUS stablecoin Act, paving the way for its infrastructure, like stablecoins, to become mainstream. Ripple’s stablecoin approvals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai reinforce that point; stablecoins are no longer experimental, they’re becoming embedded in real financial systems . XRP Price Prediction: How High Can XRP go in 2026? December is shaping a strong launchpad into 2026 with a strong confluence of support laying the groundwork for a 4-month descending channel breakout. The lower boundary of this consolidation is about to be retested, aligning with the level that has provided a firm bottom market throughout the bullish phase of the market cycle at $1.90. A strong technical setup for a launchpad, and momentum indicators could support it. XRP USD 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView . While its most recent attempt has ended in rejection, the RSI is now testing the 50 neutral line after weeks in deep oversold territory. Strength is building towards a bullish shift. While the MACD verges on a death cross below the signal line, it may prove short-lived as XRP nears the confluence zone. The key breakout threshold lies at $2.70, a former strong support level that recently flipped to resistance. Reclaiming this zone could confirm a breakout targeting an 80% upside move to $3.70 . And with further U.S. interest rate easing expected into and growing institutional involvement, the setup could extend much higher, eyeing $5 in the approach of past all-time highs for a 150% run.

Pepe Price Prediction: Lead Team Fails to Address the Threat – How Low Can PEPE Go? Meme coins have experienced big losses in 2025 as the market has shunned this entire category despite the May-October altseason. Source: TradingView The token has lost more than three-quarters of its value since the start of the year. This reflects the market’s lack of appetite for PEPE. The meme coin has temporarily found support at $0.0000040 following a robust jobs report in the United States. Although the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a mild bullish divergence, the price still needs to climb above $0.0000055 to reverse its latest downtrend. PEPE may not hit zero after the news, as the website does not compromise the token’s smart contract. However, the lack of coordination from the lead team does favor a bearish outlook as Pepe’s community engagement seems weak. In contrast, a new c rypto presale inspired by the Pepe viral meme called Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has managed to raise nearly $2.3 million to launch its fun mine-to-earn (M2E) game. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Meme Coin Mining Fun and Hardware-Free Crypto mining has commonly been associated with expensive hardware, complex algorithms, and so on. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that by introducing an M2E model that allows users to easily launch virtual mining servers . By buying $PEPENODE, players can launch as many mining rigs as they want to earn points and compete to make it to the leaderboard. Top miners receive airdrops of popular meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) from the project’s rewards pool. In addition, they can upgrade their setup to increase their output by investing additional $PEPENODE tokens. Up to 70% of the tokens used will be burned forever to reduce the circulating supply.

This technical weakness would supposedly allow node operators to have a say on what happens with users’ tokens. He clarified that the funds locked up in the L2 and delegated to third-party Hydra Heads (validators) are fully in control of the latter, not the owner. In theory, if Hydra Heads collude and introduce false transactions, they would be able to sign them without necessarily having access to the private keys of the original owner of the ADA tokens. “Every update requires signatures from all Hydra Head operators. Those signatures are made using the private keys of the operators, not the users,” YODA emphasized. He added: “If they collude, they can ALL sign a malicious snapshot that splits all the funds between them.” Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Finds Support at $0.40 But Bearish Trend Persists Aside from Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) has been one of the worst-performing top 10 tokens this year, with total losses now reaching 49%. Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the token has found support temporarily at $0.40. However, ADA has been on a strong downtrend and is not yet showing signs of a trend reversal.

A crucial on-chain metric is flashing a warning sign that seasoned investors watch closely. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno, buying pressure from a key investor cohort—addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC—has slowed significantly. This slowdown has broken a long-term upward trendline, suggesting a pivotal change in market dynamics. For anyone tracking the Bitcoin bear market potential, this data point is impossible to ignore. What Does the 100-1,000 BTC Wallet Data Reveal? Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, has pinpointed a concerning trend. The cohort of wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, which importantly includes addresses for Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries, is showing weakened demand. Their cumulative annual purchases have fallen sharply. Peak Purchase: 965,000 BTC at the all-time high. Current Purchase Level: 694,000 BTC. This represents a substantial drop. Moreno concludes that this decline in demand from such a significant player group is a strong indicator that the market may have entered a bear market phase. This isn’t just retail sentiment; it’s a signal from some of the market’s largest and most informed entities. Why is This Investor Cohort So Important? You might wonder why this specific group matters more than others. The answer lies in their profile and influence. Addresses in the 100-1,000 BTC range are typically not held by everyday retail investors. Instead, they represent: Institutional Capital: This includes Bitcoin ETF holdings and corporate treasury allocations (like those from MicroStrategy or Tesla). Sophisticated Whales: High-net-worth individuals or investment funds with a deep understanding of market cycles. Market Stability: Their consistent buying has historically provided a foundation of support during corrections. When these deep-pocketed investors slow their accumulation, it removes a major source of buy-side pressure. This can leave the market more vulnerable to downward moves, reinforcing the Bitcoin bear market thesis. How Does This Signal a Potential Bitcoin Bear Market? The technical breakdown of the long-term trendline is the critical chart pattern. Think of this trendline as a measure of consistent institutional faith. For months or even years, this group’s buying activity formed a reliable upward slope on the chart. The recent break below this line is a technical confirmation of the weakening fundamental data. Therefore, it’s not just that purchases are down. The pattern of support has been violated. This combination of factors—reduced buying volume from key players and a broken technical structure—creates a compelling argument for a shift in the market cycle. It suggests a period of consolidation or decline, a hallmark of a bear market , may be taking hold. What Should Investors Do With This Information? This analysis serves as a crucial data point, not a crystal ball. However, it provides actionable context for your strategy. First, understand that on-chain analytics like this offer a view into the actions of major holders, which often precede price movements. Second, this signal suggests increasing caution may be prudent. Consider reviewing your portfolio’s risk exposure and ensuring you have a plan for different market scenarios. Remember, a Bitcoin bear market phase, while challenging, also creates opportunities for long-term accumulation at lower price points for those who are prepared. Conclusion: A Vital Metric Demands Attention The slowdown in buying from 100-1,000 BTC wallets is a stark warning from the blockchain itself. When the market’s most substantial and presumably well-informed participants pull back, it’s a trend that demands respect. While no single indicator guarantees the future, this breakdown in institutional accumulation pressure is a powerful piece of evidence supporting the bear market entry thesis. Investors should monitor this and other on-chain metrics closely to navigate the potentially shifting tides ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this signal guarantee a Bitcoin price crash? A: No single metric guarantees future price action. This is a strong warning sign of weakening demand from a critical cohort, but it must be considered alongside other market factors like macroeconomic conditions and broader adoption trends. Q2: Who is Julio Moreno and why should I trust this analysis? A: Julio Moreno is a Senior Analyst at CryptoQuant, a leading provider of on-chain data and analytics for cryptocurrencies. His analysis is based on transparent, verifiable blockchain data rather than opinion. Q3: What other signs should I look for in a bear market? A: Other signs include sustained price trading below key moving averages (like the 200-day), negative funding rates in perpetual futures markets, and a general decline in market sentiment and trading volume. Q4: Can a bear market be a good thing for investors? A: For long-term, disciplined investors, bear markets can present opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices, a strategy often referred to as “dollar-cost averaging.” However, it requires a strong stomach for volatility. Q5: How long do Bitcoin bear markets typically last? A: Historically, Bitcoin bear markets have varied in length, often lasting several months to over a year. They are part of the natural market cycle. Q6: Do ETF flows still affect this wallet cohort? A> Yes, significantly. A large portion of the BTC in this 100-1,000 range is held by custodians for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Slowing purchases by this cohort directly reflects slowing net inflows into these ETFs.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are down by just under 2% in 24 hours, while XRP and Solana have suffered falls of around 4%. Yet the market’s total capitalization ($3.2 trillion) has risen by 5.5% since Tuesday and by 7% since November 23, as the mood warms after a period of AI-bubble-related fears. Now may therefore be a very good time to buy again, just as coins begin regaining strength, but before they rise too much. We’ve therefore picked the best altcoin to buy now, a new ERC-20 token called PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) that’s aiming to make mining much more accessible. Best Altcoin to Buy Now – 5 December PEPENODE’s approach to mining is simple: give users the ability to build their own virtual mining rigs, which they can run in order to earn rewards in external tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe (it will add other coins in the future). Upgrading Nodes is like leveling up in life. Suddenly everything feels easier. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/FHs8HwglBs — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 5, 2025 Users can build their rigs by spending PEPENODE tokens to buy more virtual nodes, which they can upgrade and combine in order to earn more mining rewards. The more nodes they have and the more they’ve upgraded them, the more rewarding PEPENODE’s mining system will be for users. This creates a huge incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, which users can also stake for a passive income, with its current APY at 570% . Demand for the new token could therefore be substantial, pushing its price up over time. What’s also attractive about PEPENODE’s mining system is its flexibility: users can make their mining rigs as large as they like, but they can also sell off their nodes if they wish to scale down. Such features help to explain why the coin is already proving so popular, with its presale having raised $2.27 million . This is a very positive figure for such a new token and offers some sign of its future potential. How to Join the PEPENODE Presale Before It Ends Investors can tap into this future potential by going to the official PEPENODE website , where the coin is currently selling $0.0011778. This price will rise later today and will continue to rise until the sale enters its final phase, just before PEPENODE lists. Potential buyers should therefore act quickly, since the available signs suggest that PEPENODE has the potential to be one of 2026’s biggest new alts. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with allocations divided between node rewards, liquidity, development, marketing, and its treasury. Its unique mining system is the main reason why it’s our best altcoin to buy now, and its upcoming launch could coincide with a major market recovery and rally.

However, he believes they will come in too late. He expects their FOMO to set in once the asset reaches much higher levels. Weak Sentiment as XRP Struggles to Hold Support XRP has been dealing with a difficult period, moving lower along with the rest of the crypto market. Since October, the token has fallen by close to 30% and is trading near $2.06. Sellers have continued to push the price down , and the $2 level has become an important support that buyers are trying to keep in place. This decline has led to a more negative mood among many holders . Near the end of last month, a community researcher shared data showing that whales sold about $400 million worth of XRP in only two days. Most of these sales came from wallets that hold between 1 and 10 million XRP, suggesting that large holders were reducing their positions as the asset’s price struggled. Many will FOMO when #XRP hits $5.85 & then $10 shortly after. They will be the next group to deal with, like the ones FOMO’d at $3.66. Ohhh one one one. — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 3, 2025 The Price That Could Draw People Back Despite the current pressure on the market, Dark Defender has continued to hold a positive long-term view. He believes that many people who are leaving now will return, but only after the token rises to higher levels. He says this behavior change will likely begin once XRP reaches $5.85. He has previously predicted that XRP will reach $5.85 , and this level represents a climb of almost 184%. He has pointed to long-term chart signals that support the idea of a strong move once momentum shifts. He has also explained that XRP has held a long-term pattern that remains in place and could push the price toward this first major target.

Dark Defender has also said that XRP can reach $10 after it moves past $5.85. This would be a larger jump of about 385% from today’s price. He believes that if XRP reaches these higher levels, many investors who exited earlier will rush back, even though they would have missed the largest gains. He pointed out that this has occurred before. When XRP rose from around $0.5 to its all-time high of $3.66 in July , many people bought in only after a large part of the rally was already complete. Raoul Pal, who once advised investors to look for alternatives, later admitted he was wrong after XRP’s rally in late 2024. Although XRP is showing weakness in the short term, Dark Defender remains bullish. He believes interest will return once the token begins to rise.

Blockchain data reveals a dormant Bitcoin whale address, inactive for a staggering 14 years, suddenly transferred 1,000 BTC—worth approximately $89 million. This event isn’t just a large transaction; it’s a message from Bitcoin’s ancient past, prompting urgent questions about market impact and holder behavior. What Does a Dormant Bitcoin Whale Transfer Mean? When a dormant Bitcoin whale moves funds, analysts pay close attention. This specific address, beginning with “1Au1uZ,” received its Bitcoin in 2010, when the asset was worth mere cents. The holder watched silently through multiple bull and bear markets. Therefore, their decision to act now is highly significant. It could signal a change in long-term conviction, an estate planning move, or preparation for a major market shift. Why Are These 14-Year-Old Coins So Important? Coins from this era are legendary. They represent the earliest days of Bitcoin, held by pioneers who believed in the technology before it had monetary value. The sheer willpower to hold through 14 years of volatility is extraordinary. When such coins move, it often affects market sentiment. Here’s why: Supply Shock Potential: These coins were effectively removed from circulating supply. Their movement back into active wallets can increase sell-side pressure. Psychological Signal: If a holder with diamond hands for 14 years decides to move coins, some investors interpret it as a potential local market top. Technical Analysis: On-chain metrics track these movements closely, using them to gauge overall holder sentiment and predict potential volatility. What Could This Whale Do Next? The immediate destination of the 1,000 BTC was another address, not a known exchange. This suggests the holder is not selling directly at this moment. However, the possibilities are vast. The whale might be: Consolidating wallets for security or estate purposes. Preparing to use the Bitcoin as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Transferring ownership, perhaps to a next-generation custodian or a family member. Simply testing wallet functionality after more than a decade. Until the coins reach an exchange or are used in a visible transaction, their ultimate purpose remains a fascinating mystery. How Does This Impact the Broader Bitcoin Market? While $89 million is a large sum, it’s a fraction of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume. The direct price impact is often minimal. The real impact is psychological. News of a dormant Bitcoin whale awakening can create short-term FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) among retail traders. Conversely, it can also be viewed as a sign of an aging market where early adopters are finally taking profits, a natural evolution for any asset class. Ultimately, it underscores Bitcoin’s core narrative: the ability to store life-changing value securely over immense periods. Conclusion: A Testament to Bitcoin’s Promise The awakening of this dormant Bitcoin whale is a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency’s unique properties. An individual held a digital key securely for 14 years and unlocked $89 million. This event validates Bitcoin’s original promise as a sovereign store of value. While the market watches the next move, the story itself—of patience, belief, and newfound wealth—is the true headline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “dormant Bitcoin whale”? A: A dormant Bitcoin whale is a cryptocurrency address holding a large amount of Bitcoin (typically 1,000 BTC or more) that has not made any outgoing transactions for a very long time, often several years. Q2: Why is a 14-year dormancy period so significant? A: Bitcoin was launched in 2009. Coins from 2010 are among the oldest in existence, mined or purchased when Bitcoin had almost no monetary value. Holding them this long demonstrates extreme conviction. Q3: Does this mean the whale is selling their Bitcoin? A: Not necessarily. The transfer was to another private address. Selling usually involves sending coins to a cryptocurrency exchange. This could be a preparatory step, but it is not a direct sale. Q4: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Glassnode, or CryptoQuant. These tools monitor large wallet movements and exchange flows. Q5: Should I be worried about my Bitcoin investment when this happens? A: Single whale movements rarely dictate long-term market trends. Bitcoin’s price is influenced by macroeconomics, adoption, and institutional flows. View such events as interesting data points, not sell signals. Q6: What’s the largest dormant whale wallet ever seen? A: The famous Satoshi-era wallets, believed to belong to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, hold over 1 million BTC and have never moved. They represent the ultimate in dormancy. Did this story of a sleeping giant fascinate you?

55405398,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=873750,1764978303,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55405398.jpeg,Strive challenges MSCI’s proposal to exclude companies whose Bitcoin holdings exceed 50% of total assets,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/strive-challenges-mscis-50-bitcoin-threshold/,"Strive, a structured-finance company listed on Nasdaq and one of the world’s largest public corporate holders of Bitcoin, is fighting MSCI’s proposal to exclude Bitcoin-heavy companies from major global equity benchmarks. The firm sent a letter this week to Henry Fernandez, MSCI’s CEO, stating that the proposed exclusion would violate the “long-established principle of index neutrality.” Strive said such benchmarks need to be based on the market for digital currency and not contain special rules around considerations when companies hold digital assets. Strive now has over 7,500 BTC. This makes it one of the largest public companies in the world to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The firm said its heritage provides it with a unique understanding of how Bitcoin-treasury companies operate, and why blanket exclusions would distort markets. Strive argues the 50% threshold is flawed Strive’s response emphasized matters of methodology and fairness. The 50% digital-asset threshold is unjustified, overbroad, and unworkable, according to the firm. It argued that the rule does not account for the broad category to which the Bitcoin treasury has become. Many are also companies that do more than hold Bitcoin. A few run companies with proven businesses in AI-driven data centre infrastructure, structured finance, and more general digital asset financial services. Additionally, others, particularly large miners such as Marathon Digital , Riot Platforms, Hut 8, and CleanSpark, have diversified beyond the mining sector. Today, they lease out surplus power, computing capacity, and data-centre space to cloud and hyperscale customers. Strive contends that these companies are bigger than their Bitcoin treasuries, and excluding them would result in the elimination of real economic activity from global benchmarks. The company also identified a technical challenge: accounting standards are vast. Under U.S. GAAP, digital assets must be recorded at fair value every quarter. Under IFRS, which is used by many countries, companies can carry digital assets at their cost. That means two companies with the same Bitcoin exposure could appear to be assuming different concentrations of the digital asset. Strive cautioned that the rule would lead to disparate and unfair treatment between companies based solely on where they report their financial statements. Strive presented an alternative that seemed far more sensible. Rather than rewriting broad-index eligibility criteria, MSCI could create add-ons in the form of optional “ex-digital-asset-treasury” index variants. Investors wishing to avoid Bitcoin-treasury companies could then opt for those versions, without compelling everyone else to suffer the same exclusion. MSCI already offers “ex-energy,” “ex-tobacco,” and other screened index versions along these lines. Index shift threatens billions in market flows The answer could hinge on how the market perceives the insights gained through their research. If MSCI goes with the 50% rule, the implications could be enormous. Strategy — the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin — would be excluded from indexes that track trillions of dollars in global assets. Analysts estimate passive outflows of up to $2.8 billion from MSCI-tracked funds alone. Given that other index providers may copy MSCI, the amount could increase to nearly USD 9 billion. Market observers note that the impact may already be reflected in Strategy’s volatile share price. Some analysts contend that being dropped from an index would not compel the firm to dispose of its Bitcoin. Still, it may reduce passive demand for the cryptocurrency from institutional investors tracking MSCI benchmarks. Strive has also experienced its own share of volatility since earlier this year, when it debuted its Bitcoin treasury play via a reverse merger adoption. Its stock price soared from about 60 cents to more than $13 after it announced the Strategy, then fell back below $1. MSCI is expected to publish its decision on January 15, 2021, before the February index review. The result is being closely monitored throughout the cryptocurrency, financial indexing, and institutional investment worlds. Get seen where it counts.

Yoodli, an AI-powered communication training platform founded by former Google X engineer Varun Puri, has just achieved a staggering valuation milestone – tripling to over $300 million in just six months. This remarkable growth story isn’t about replacing humans with machines, but about using AI to enhance what makes us uniquely human: our ability to communicate effectively. What Makes Yoodli’s AI Communication Training So Revolutionary? The Seattle-based startup’s recent $40 million Series B funding round, led by WestBridge Capital with participation from Neotribe and Madrona, represents more than just financial success. It signals a growing recognition that AI can be a powerful tool for human development rather than a threat to human employment. Yoodli’s platform uses sophisticated AI to create simulated scenarios for sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions, providing users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills. The Vision Behind Yoodli: From Personal Struggle to Global Solution Varun Puri’s journey to founding Yoodli is deeply personal. After moving to the U.S. at age 18, he experienced firsthand how communication challenges could hold back talented professionals from countries like India. “I became aware of how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals,” Puri explained in an interview. This insight, combined with his experience at Google’s X division working on special projects for Sergey Brin, led him to co-found Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi in 2021. Initially focused on helping people overcome the fear of public speaking – a skill two out of three people struggle with according to internal data – Yoodli quickly evolved as users began using the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations. This organic shift pushed the company from consumer-focused training to enterprise solutions. How Yoodli’s Series B Funding Will Accelerate Growth The $40 million Series B funding represents a significant acceleration for Yoodli, coming just months after a $13.7 million Series A round in May. Puri noted that the startup hadn’t planned to raise more funding so soon but was compelled by unexpected investor interest. Several factors contributed to this investor enthusiasm: 900% growth in average recurring revenue over the last 12 months 50% increase in role-plays run on the platform between funding rounds Expansion of enterprise customer base including Google, Snowflake, and Databricks Strategic executive hires from Tableau, Salesforce, and Remitly Enterprise Adoption: Why Major Companies Choose Yoodli Yoodli’s transition to enterprise training has been remarkably successful. The platform now offers AI role-plays and experiential learning tools for go-to-market enablement, partner certification, and management coaching. Puri contrasts this approach with traditional corporate training methods: “In the old world, companies would train people using static, long-form content or passive videos that we’d all watch at 4x-5x speed, just to get the thing done. But that doesn’t actually mean you’ve learned it.” The platform’s enterprise adoption includes: Company Type Examples Use Case Technology Companies Google, Snowflake, Databricks Employee communication training Sales Organizations RingCentral, Sandler Sales Sales pitch practice and coaching Coaching Firms Franklin Covey, LHH Customized training frameworks The Technology Behind Yoodli’s AI Communication Training Yoodli’s platform stands out for its technical sophistication and flexibility. The system works with multiple large-language models, allowing users to choose between Google’s Gemini, OpenAI’s GPT, or other models based on preference. This multi-model approach ensures optimal performance across different use cases and languages. Key technical features include: Support for major languages including Korean, Japanese, French, and multiple Indian languages Enterprise integration capabilities for embedding into existing software systems Web-based access without requiring mobile apps (a deliberate choice to streamline training) Customization options that allow companies to tailor the system to their specific methodologies Human-Centric AI: Yoodli’s Philosophy of Augmentation, Not Replacement Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Yoodli’s approach is its philosophical commitment to human-centric AI. “I philosophically believe that AI can get you from a zero to an eight or a zero to nine,” says Puri. “But the pure essence of who you are and how you show up, and your authenticity and vulnerability that a human gives you feedback on will always exist.” This philosophy manifests in several ways: The platform is designed to complement human coaches rather than replace them AI provides scalable practice opportunities while humans deliver personalized guidance The system focuses on measurable improvement while preserving individual communication style Market Differentiation and Competitive Advantages While Yoodli operates in a growing market for AI-based communication tools, Puri emphasizes several key differentiators. The startup focuses on deep customization and specific training verticals, allowing companies to tailor the system to their unique use cases and coaching methods. This vertical specialization, combined with enterprise-grade integration capabilities, has helped Yoodli secure and retain major corporate clients. The company’s leadership team has been strengthened with strategic hires including: Josh Vitello (former Tableau and Salesforce executive) as Chief Revenue Officer Andy Larson (former Remitly CFO) as Chief Financial Officer Padmashree Koneti (former Tableau CPO) as Chief Product Officer Future Growth Plans and Market Expansion With approximately 40 employees and fresh capital from WestBridge Capital and other investors, Yoodli is poised for significant expansion. The company plans to use the Series B funding to: Enhance AI coaching, analytics, and personalization tools Expand presence in enterprise learning and professional development markets Grow the team across product, AI research, and customer success functions Enter Asia-Pacific markets while deepening U.S. market penetration FAQs About Yoodli and AI Communication Training Who founded Yoodli? Yoodli was co-founded by Varun Puri , a former Google X engineer who worked on special projects for Sergey Brin , and Esha Joshi , a former Apple engineer. Which companies use Yoodli for training? Major companies using Yoodli include Google , Snowflake , Databricks , RingCentral , and coaching firms like Franklin Covey . Who led Yoodli’s Series B funding round? The $40 million Series B round was led by WestBridge Capital , with participation from Neotribe and Madrona. What makes Yoodli different from other AI training platforms? Yoodli focuses on human-centric AI that augments rather than replaces human coaches, offers deep customization for enterprise clients, and supports multiple large-language models including Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. Where is Yoodli headquartered? Yoodli is based in Seattle, Washington, and has approximately 40 employees. Conclusion: The Future of Human-Centric AI Development Yoodli’s remarkable valuation surge to over $300 million represents more than just financial success – it validates a crucial approach to artificial intelligence development. In a landscape often dominated by fears of automation and job displacement, Yoodli demonstrates that AI can be a powerful force for human enhancement rather than replacement. The startup’s focus on communication skills, one of the most fundamentally human capabilities, combined with its enterprise-grade technology and human-centric philosophy, positions it at the forefront of a new wave of AI applications designed to make us better at being human. As companies worldwide grapple with the challenges of remote work, global teams, and increasingly complex communication environments, tools like Yoodli offer a compelling solution.

The discussion featured Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver, who described a pattern he believes is unfolding quietly in elite financial circles. According to Claver, multiple family offices with substantial multi-generational wealth are now building meaningful positions in XRP, a trend he argues has been largely overlooked. Claver referenced an account relayed to him by a friend, involving a prominent family connected to a major U.S. food brand that was overheard during a private ride in Orlando discussing the size of their XRP holdings. While the anecdote was secondary in nature, he said it aligns closely with conversations he has held recently with several major family offices that are allocating capital to XRP at a faster pace than the general market realizes. Claver emphasized the contrast between the small size of most existing XRP wallets and the volume of assets controlled by these large private investors. He pointed out that although XRP has roughly 7 million wallets globally, a significant portion of them hold under 100 XRP. He argued that this level of concentration, combined with growing institutional participation , could create conditions for stronger price performance if broader adoption accelerates. Why Billionaires Are Looking at XRP In explaining the motivation behind these secretive allocations, Claver stated that extremely wealthy families are approaching crypto not as short-term speculation. He stressed that these groups have already accumulated their wealth and are focused on safeguarding it. Their interest, he said, is driven by strategies focused on preservation rather than aggressive risk-taking. He reiterated that these investors “aren’t rolling the dice”; instead, they are using digital assets as long-term hedges. Claver also highlighted that only about 38% of global family offices are even considering digital asset exposure at this stage. He believes the remainder are beginning to examine assets such as XRP in response to concerns arising from macroeconomic developments, including the reverse carry trade. As traditional financial institutions increasingly validate the digital asset sector, Claver maintains that large investors will eventually maintain at least some exposure, and he described the current moment as the early stage of that transition. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP ETFs Absorb Over 400 Million Tokens in Nine Days The same Good Evening Crypto segment also referenced recent remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who said the newly listed XRP ETFs remain “underappreciated.” The program noted that more than 400 million XRP have been absorbed by these ETFs through OTC channels and exchanges within their first 15 days of trading. The funds have seen inflows exceeding $887 million, with total assets reaching more than $906 million as of Wednesday. Despite this rapid accumulation, XRP’s market price has continued to struggle below what many investors describe as a firm resistance level near $2. Nonetheless, analysts appearing on the program suggested that ongoing institutional accumulation could eventually trigger a market separation from broader price trends if demand from ETFs continues to build. Ripple’s Global Positioning Strengthens the Thesis Host Abs expanded on why affluent families may be turning their attention to XRP at this moment. He pointed to Ripple’s established relationships with governments, central banks, and major institutions, describing XRP as one of the few digital assets positioned for large-scale financial integration. Claver added that XRP’s enterprise-grade functionality sets it apart in an evolving global financial system. The host also suggested that the confirmation of interest from major American family lineages signals a possible shift toward early-stage mainstream recognition. In closing, Claver restated a principle he believes applies in the current environment: “You should only have to get rich once.” He argued that many of these families view XRP as one of the strategic components that can support long-term stability.

55407314,640808,1764979252,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55407314.jpeg,"Top Dogecoin Wallets Begin Rapid Accumulation As Price Struggles, Is A Surge Coming?",https://bitcoinist.com/top-dogecoin-wallets-accumulation/,"Dogecoin has spent the past few days rebounding after a downturn to the mid-$0.13s, and its on-chain activity is beginning to tell an interesting bullish story. Data from Santiment shows a quiet accumulation trend of hundreds of millions of DOGE tokens taking place among some of the asset’s larger holders, even as the price continues to struggle for momentum. This change in wallet behavior is unfolding at a time when Dogecoin’s recent performance offers very little excitement for bullish traders, making the quiet accumulation all the more notable. Dogecoin Whales Accumulation: What the Numbers Show The data from Santiment highlights a quick climb in holdings among Dogecoin addresses holding between 1 million DOGE to 100 million DOGE tokens. Particularly, the data shows that the collective holding of this cohort has grown from 27.79 billion on December 3 to 28.34 billion DOGE at the time of writing. That equates to an increase of about 550 million DOGE in roughly 48 hours, a meaningful inflow even for a large-cap crypto like Dogecoin. This trend shows that these mid-size and large holders view current prices as favorable entry points. Broad accumulation by this “whale tier” often precedes consolidation phases or, in some cases, precedes upward moves, especially if retail sentiment is weak and fewer coins are being sold into the market. Interestingly, this accumulation, which kicked off after Dogecoin fell to the mid-$0.13 range on December 3, contributed to a rebound at this level that contributed to the meme coin reaching an intraday high of $0.1504 in the past 24 hours. Is A Surge Coming For Dogecoin? Accumulation by larger wallets can reshape market conditions in subtle but meaningful ways. First, it reduces the circulating supply available to typical retail traders, which can tighten availability and potentially support price stability or upward pressure. Second, it reflects conviction. Large holders are showing confidence in DOGE’s long-term value, even when price action is not yet bullish. Furthermore, this recent buying represents the first clear shift in sentiment among whale cohor s after weeks of steady distribution. Santiment’s data shows that these wallets had been decreasing their balances since mid-October, and the trend coincided with a drop in large transactions that pushed activity to a two-month low. While accumulation may set the stage for a rally, there are still structural challenges that Dogecoin must face. T echnical analysis suggests that $0.138 is a critical level for confirming whether a firm bottom has formed. Sustained trading above that zone in the coming weeks would strengthen the case that the worst of the downturn is over. At the same time, crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus outlined a possible upside target in the $0.70 to $0.75 region as the peak of the current cycle. This price target aligns with other technical projections for the meme coin.",Dogecoin|Bitcoinsensus|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|meme coin|Santiment,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 00:00:52

Dogecoin Has A Large Supply Cluster Present At $0.20 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where resistance lies for Dogecoin based on Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). The CBD is an indicator that tells us about the amount of DOGE supply that was last acquired at the various price levels that the memecoin has visited in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Echoes 2022 Bear Start, Glassnode Warns Below is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the recent CBD heatmap for Dogecoin. As is visible in the graph, the Dogecoin CBD has flagged the zone around $0.20 as one where investors did some heavy buying. More specifically, over 11.7 billion tokens have their cost basis at this level. Considering that DOGE is trading notably under the mark right now, all this supply would naturally be in the red. The asset rising to this level could cause a strong reaction from the investors, as these tokens will get back to their break-even. Generally, holders in loss can be desperate for the price to reach back to their cost basis. Once the asset does rise to their acquisition level, some of these investors choose to sell, fearing that the rebound is only temporary. This can make large cost basis levels above the asset’s price potential zones of resistance. Between the current price and $0.20, there aren’t any other regions in the CBD that are as dense with supply. Based on this, Martinez has noted, “$0.20 is the key resistance for Dogecoin.” It now remains to be seen whether DOGE will retest this level anytime soon. In some other news, the memecoin has seen a spike in network activity recently, as the analyst has pointed out in another X post. In the chart, the indicator shown is the Number of Active Addresses, which measures, as its name suggests, the daily number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the Dogecoin network. It would appear that this indicator has registered a surge recently, with a peak 71,589 addresses making transfers on the blockchain. This is the largest spike that the metric has observed since September.

This announcement creates immediate buzz and signals potential new avenues for traders and investors. But what does this roadmap addition truly mean for you? Let’s explore the implications. What Is the Coinbase Listing Roadmap and Why Does It Matter? First, let’s clarify the process. The Coinbase listing roadmap is a public, forward-looking document the exchange uses to signal which assets it is actively exploring for potential future listing. It is not a guarantee of listing, but a strong indicator of interest. This transparency is a key part of Coinbase’s effort to build trust and manage market expectations. When a token appears on this roadmap, it often leads to increased visibility and trading interest in that asset across other platforms. Who Are IMU and SENT? A Closer Look at the Newcomers Understanding the projects behind the tokens is crucial. While specific details about IMU and SENT will require your own research (always DYOR—Do Your Own Research), their inclusion on the Coinbase listing roadmap suggests they have passed initial technical and compliance reviews. IMU (imu) : This token likely represents a project in the decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, or infrastructure space. Its presence on the roadmap indicates Coinbase sees growing ecosystem relevance. SENT (sent) : This asset is often associated with decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) or data oracle services. Its consideration points to Coinbase’s interest in expanding beyond pure currency tokens. The key takeaway? Coinbase is continuously scouting for innovative projects that add value to the broader crypto ecosystem. How Does This Benefit Crypto Investors? For the average investor, a Coinbase listing roadmap update is more than just news—it’s a strategic signal. Here’s why it matters for your portfolio: Early Awareness : The roadmap gives you a heads-up on assets Coinbase is seriously considering, allowing for earlier research. Validation : Earning a spot on the roadmap acts as a layer of validation for a project, as Coinbase’s compliance checks are rigorous. Liquidity & Access : If listed, these tokens gain access to Coinbase’s massive user base, typically boosting liquidity and stability. However, remember this is not financial advice. Roadmap inclusion does not equal a successful investment. Market volatility remains high, and prices can react unpredictably to listing news. What Are the Next Steps After a Roadmap Announcement? So, Coinbase added IMU and SENT to its Coinbase listing roadmap . What happens now? The journey from roadmap to live trading involves several stages: Further Evaluation : Coinbase engineers conduct deep technical reviews of the asset’s blockchain. Legal & Compliance Review : Teams ensure the asset meets regulatory standards. Integration : The asset is integrated into Coinbase’s trading systems. Final Announcement : Coinbase will make a separate, official announcement if and when IMU and SENT are approved for trading. This process underscores the importance of the roadmap as a planning tool for both the exchange and the community. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for a Growing Ecosystem The addition of IMU and SENT to the Coinbase listing roadmap is a significant development. It highlights Coinbase’s ongoing mission to diversify its offerings and support the growth of the crypto space. For investors, it serves as a valuable research prompt and a reminder of the dynamic nature of this market. By paying attention to these roadmap updates, you can stay informed about potential new trends and opportunities shaping the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does being on the Coinbase listing roadmap guarantee a listing? A: No. The roadmap indicates exploration and interest, but it is not a guarantee. Final listing depends on successful completion of technical, security, and legal reviews. Q: When will IMU and SENT start trading on Coinbase? A: There is no set timeline. Coinbase will make a separate announcement if and when the assets are approved for trading. The roadmap only signals the evaluation phase. Q: Should I buy IMU or SENT now because of this news?

This is no longer a distant dream. Plume, a blockchain built for regulatory-compliant real-world assets (RWA), has just announced a pivotal move to bring its institutional-grade real-world asset yields to the Solana network. This integration bridges a crucial gap, offering crypto natives a trusted gateway to yields backed by real economy assets. What Are Real-World Asset Yields on Solana? Simply put, real-world asset yields are returns generated from tangible, off-chain investments like government bonds, corporate credit, or receivables. Traditionally, these are accessed through banks or brokers. Plume’s initiative tokenizes these assets, allowing them to be held and traded on-chain. By bringing this to Solana, users can now tap into these yields with the speed and low cost the network is famous for. This is a significant step for decentralized finance (DeFi), moving beyond purely crypto-native yields to include those from the broader global economy. Which Vaults Are Coming to Solana? Plume isn’t starting small. The project is onboarding five established “Nest” vaults to the Solana ecosystem, each backed by major traditional finance names. This provides immediate credibility and a diverse range of yield sources. Here are the vaults making the leap: nBASIS & nALPHA: Backed by assets from Hamilton Lane and BlackOpal, focusing on institutional private credit. nTBILL: Collateralized by short-term U.S. Treasury bills, offering a government-backed yield option. nWISDOM & nOPAL: Featuring assets from WisdomTree and Securitize, providing access to a basket of institutional investment strategies. Each vault represents a different slice of the real-world economy, from private equity to secure government debt, all now accessible with a Solana wallet. How Can You Maximize These Real-World Asset Yields? Accessing the yield is just the beginning. The Solana DeFi ecosystem is poised to amplify the utility of these tokenized RWAs. Notably, the Solana-based protocol Loopscale has plans to launch a feature that will let users employ leverage using their Nest vault tokens. This means you could potentially use your nTBILL tokens as collateral to borrow and amplify your position, seeking greater returns. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage increases risk alongside potential reward. This native integration showcases how Solana’s composability can create new financial primitives around real-world asset yields . Why Does This Matter for the Future of Crypto? This move is more than just another protocol launch. It represents a maturation of the crypto space. By offering compliant, tangible yields, projects like Plume address a major criticism of DeFi: the lack of sustainable, non-inflationary income streams. For Solana, it strengthens the network’s value proposition as a home for serious financial innovation beyond speculation. For the average user, it provides a compelling reason to hold assets on-chain, knowing they can generate steady real-world asset yields from a diversified portfolio. This bridges the gap between TradFi reliability and DeFi efficiency. Conclusion: A New Era for On-Chain Finance The arrival of Plume’s RWA vaults on Solana is a landmark event. It signals a shift towards a more robust, diversified, and sustainable financial ecosystem built on blockchain technology. Users gain access to institutional-grade yield sources with the permissionless access of crypto. While navigating regulatory compliance remains key, this partnership paves the way for a future where the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur, all powered by the pursuit of genuine real-world asset yields . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly are real-world assets (RWAs) in crypto? A: RWAs are tangible, off-chain assets like real estate, bonds, or commodities that are tokenized (represented as digital tokens) on a blockchain. This allows them to be traded, owned fractionally, and integrated into DeFi applications. Q: How do I access Plume’s yields on Solana? A: You will need a Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom). Once the vaults are live, you can visit Plume’s or a supported partner’s interface to deposit into the specific Nest vault (nTBILL, nALPHA, etc.) of your choice. Q: Are these yields safer than typical DeFi yields? A: They are backed by different underlying assets. While no investment is risk-free, yields from government bonds (like nTBILL) are generally considered lower risk than yields from untested crypto farming pools, as they are backed by sovereign entities. Always do your own research. Q: What is the role of Loopscale? A: Loopscale is a Solana protocol planning to allow users to use their Nest vault tokens as collateral to take out loans. This “leverage” feature lets users potentially increase their exposure and returns, but it also significantly increases risk. Q: Is my investment in these vaults liquid? A: Liquidity will depend on the specific vault and the secondary markets that develop for their tokens. The involvement of major firms suggests efforts will be made to ensure reasonable liquidity, but it may not be as instant as trading major cryptocurrencies. Q: Why is Solana a good network for this? A: Solana offers high transaction throughput and very low fees, which is essential for making small, frequent yield payments economically viable and for ensuring a smooth user experience when managing positions.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has plummeted five points to a score of 23, officially re-entering the “Extreme Fear” territory. This sudden shift signals rising anxiety among investors and can often precede significant price volatility. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and is extreme fear always a bad sign? Let’s break down the data and uncover the opportunities hidden within the panic. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a crucial barometer for investor emotion. Created by Alternative.me, it compiles multiple data points into a single, easy-to-understand number. A score of 0 represents maximum fear, while 100 signals extreme greed. The current reading of 23 is a clear warning sign that negative sentiment is dominating the market. This drop didn’t happen in a vacuum; it reflects a combination of recent price swings, social media chatter, and search trends all pointing toward caution. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This index isn’t just a guess. It’s a data-driven formula designed to capture the market’s pulse. Understanding its components helps you see beyond the headline number. The calculation is based on six key factors: Volatility (25%): Recent price swings, especially sharp downturns, increase the fear score. Market Volume (25%): High trading volume during sell-offs amplifies fear signals. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of mentions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls and community sentiment checks. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s market share rises, it often indicates a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like “Bitcoin crash” or “crypto bear market.” Therefore, the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score synthesizes all these real-time signals into one digestible metric. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Extreme Fear? It’s natural to feel nervous when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes red. However, seasoned investors often view extreme fear through a different lens. Historically, prolonged periods of fear have created some of the best long-term buying opportunities. When everyone is selling in panic, asset prices can disconnect from their fundamental value. This doesn’t mean you should blindly buy the dip, but it’s a signal to start paying closer attention. The key is to have a plan and not let emotion dictate your actions. Actionable Insights for Trading in a Fearful Market Navigating a market governed by fear requires discipline. Here are practical steps to consider: Review Your Strategy: Does your plan account for high volatility? Stick to it. Practice Risk Management: This is not the time for high leverage. Ensure your positions are sized appropriately. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Use the quiet time to research projects you believe in. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Spreading purchases over time can reduce the impact of buying at a peak. Remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool for context, not a crystal ball. It tells you what the crowd is feeling, not what will happen next. The Bottom Line on Today’s Market Sentiment The drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 23 is a significant shift in market psychology. It confirms that the current environment is risk-averse and emotionally charged. While this presents challenges, it also separates impulsive traders from strategic investors. By understanding the metrics behind the fear, you can make informed decisions rather than reactive ones. Market cycles always turn, and sentiment indicators are often most useful at their extremes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 23 mean? A: A score of 23 falls into the “Extreme Fear” zone (0-25). It indicates that current market data and sentiment are overwhelmingly negative and fearful. Q: Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a good predictor of price? A: It is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. However, sustained extreme fear has often coincided with market bottoms, while extreme greed has marked tops. Q: How often is the index updated? A: The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time snapshot of market emotion. Q: Should I sell when the index shows extreme fear? A: Not necessarily. Selling during extreme fear often means selling at a low. Many investors use it as a contrarian indicator to look for potential entry points, always within their risk tolerance. Q: Does the index only track Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin dominance is a component, the index aims to measure sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market.

According to data from Onchain-Lenz, these digital vaults, untouched since the early days of Bitcoin, transferred a colossal 2,000 BTC—worth approximately $178.29 million—to a new address. This event is not just a transaction; it’s a piece of blockchain history coming to life, prompting urgent questions about market impact and the motives behind this monumental shift. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Whale Movement Mean? When Bitcoin whale addresses of this vintage stir, the entire market pays attention. These specific addresses received their Bitcoin in 2013, a time when the network was in its infancy and the price was a fraction of today’s value. The sheer scale of this transfer, moving nearly $180 million in a single action, represents a significant potential supply shock. Analysts are now scrambling to interpret the signal. Is this a strategic sell-off, a portfolio reorganization, or simply the movement of assets to a more secure modern wallet? The intent behind the move from these specific Bitcoin whale addresses will dictate its short-term impact on liquidity and price sentiment. Why Are Dormant Coins So Significant? The movement of long-dormant coins is a rare and powerful on-chain metric. Think of these Bitcoin whale addresses as digital time capsules. Their inactivity for over a decade suggests the holders are original, patient investors—often called “HODLers.” Their decision to act now can be interpreted in several ways: Market Timing: The holder may believe a market top is near and is preparing to realize historic gains. Estate Planning: After 13 years, this could involve transferring wealth to heirs or a trust. Security Upgrade: Moving funds from an older, potentially vulnerable wallet to a new, more secure address. Institutional Action: The coins could be moving to a custody solution for a fund or corporate treasury. Each scenario carries different implications for whether these Bitcoins will hit the open market or simply change hands privately. How Could This Affect the Bitcoin Price? The immediate fear with any large movement from Bitcoin whale addresses is a sell-off that pressures the price. However, a transfer does not equal a sale. The key is tracking the destination address. If the 2,000 BTC moves to a known exchange deposit wallet, it strongly signals an impending sale, which could create downward pressure. Conversely, if it goes to another private, cold storage address, the market impact may be neutral or even positive, as it demonstrates continued long-term holding by a major player. This event serves as a crucial reminder of the power held within a few key Bitcoin whale addresses and their ability to influence market psychology. What Can Everyday Investors Learn From This? While most of us aren’t moving nine-figure sums, there are actionable insights from this whale activity. First, it highlights the incredible long-term value creation possible with Bitcoin. Second, it underscores the importance of secure, future-proof storage solutions. Finally, it teaches us to monitor on-chain data not for day-trading signals, but for understanding the behavior of the market’s most influential participants. Watching these Bitcoin whale addresses provides context, not a crystal ball. In conclusion, the awakening of these two dormant giants is a fascinating chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story. It connects the crypto present directly to its pioneering past. Whether this leads to market volatility or simply becomes a footnote, it reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value that can be preserved across decades. The movement from these historic Bitcoin whale addresses is a powerful testament to the asset’s resilience and the patience of its earliest believers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a “Bitcoin whale”? A: A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of Bitcoin that their transactions can potentially influence the market price. There’s no official threshold, but addresses holding thousands of BTC are universally considered whales. Q2: Why were these addresses dormant for 13 years? A: The holders likely acquired Bitcoin very early (around 2013) and chose a “HODL” strategy, meaning they bought and held through multiple market cycles without selling, possibly believing in its long-term potential as a digital gold. Q3: Does moving coins mean they are selling? A: Not necessarily. A transfer between private wallets is just a change of storage address. The key indicator of a sale is if the coins are sent to a deposit address at a cryptocurrency exchange. Q4: How can I track whale activity myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com or Etherscan for Ethereum, or dedicated on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode or IntoTheBlock, which often highlight large and unusual transactions. Q5: Should I be worried about whale sales? A: While large sales can cause short-term price dips, Bitcoin’s market is now more liquid and institutionalized than ever. Whale movements are one factor among many, including macroeconomic trends and adoption rates. Q6: What’s the largest Bitcoin whale transaction ever recorded? A: Some of the largest involve transfers between wallets controlled by exchanges or institutional custodians. Single movements of tens of thousands of BTC have occurred, often related to internal reorganizations rather than individual sales.

In a market note published on Dec. 5, CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, said the latest solvency concerns “look misplaced,” pointing to Tether’s most recent attestation, which shows a headline surplus of assets over liabilities. Butterfill argued the numbers do not, at present, indicate a systemic vulnerability for USDT. The recent pushback follows Hayes’ recent warning that as Tether increases its exposure to Bitcoin and gold, it will also make it increasingly likely that a steep pullback in these assets could undermine its cushion on equity. He sai d a roughly 30% decline in those assets could, in theory, wipe out Tether’s equity buffer and render USDT “theoretically insolvent.” That argument quickly spread across crypto news sites and social media feeds. Butterfill replied with a short assessment of the data. The most recent attestation by Tether shows $181 billion in reserves and approximately $174.45 billion in liabilities, resulting in a surplus of nearly $6.55 billion. The study note also noted Tether’s abnormally strong profitability this year, with a year-to-date profit of more than $10 billion, and found that the available data at present does not imply a systemic weakness. CoinShares says Tether’s profits and surplus reserves blunt volatility risks CoinShares acknowledged that there are risks associated with stablecoins and should not be overlooked, but still stated that the current Tether data have not shown signs of systemic vulnerability. “Tether is still one of the most profitable companies in the sector, generating $10 billion in the first three quarters of the year — an unusually high figure on a per-employee basis ,” CoinShares’ head of research wrote. Tether’s Q3 disclosures — confirmed in an attestation it issued and widely reported by industry press — break down substantial portions of its reserves as large holdings of U.S. Treasuries (roughly $135 billion), along with approximately $12.9 billion of gold and $9.9 billion of Bitcoin. Those gold and Bitcoin positions are exactly the ones Hayes named as potential sources of volatility; CoinShares recognised the exposure, but added that the headline reserve — liability gap and strong profitability mitigate near-solvency risk. Tether counters solvency fears as critics target high-risk assets Although speculation about Tether’s financial health is hardly new — media outlets have been tracking its reserves and asset backing for years — the latest flurry of solvency concerns appears to have arisen thanks to Arthur Hayes. Last week, the BitMEX co-founder said it was “in the early innings of running a massive interest-rate trade,” claiming a 30% drop in its Bitcoin and gold holdings would “wipe out their equity” and leave its USDt stablecoin technically “insolvent.” Both assets make up a substantial portion of Tether’s reserves, with the firm increasing its gold exposure in recent years. Tether is facing criticism from more than just Hayes. CEO Paolo Ardoino recently pushed back on S&P Global’s downgrade of USDt’s ability to defend its US dollar peg, dismissing the move as “Tether FUD” — shorthand for fear, uncertainty, and doubt — and citing the company’s third-quarter attestation report in its defense. S&P Global downgraded the stablecoin due to stability concerns, citing its exposure to “higher-risk” assets, including gold, loans, and Bitcoin. According to CoinMarketCap, Tether’s USDt remains the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with $185.5 billion in circulation and a market share of nearly 59%.

This pivotal development could unlock a new wave of mainstream investment into the SUI token, directly bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative Sui blockchain. What Does Grayscale’s Sui ETF Filing Mean? Grayscale’s submission of an S-1 registration statement for a Sui ETF is a formal request to create a publicly traded fund. Therefore, if approved, investors could buy and sell shares of this ETF on traditional stock exchanges, gaining exposure to SUI’s price without managing private wallets or crypto exchanges. This process mirrors the path taken by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, marking a significant maturity milestone for the Sui network. Why Is This a Game-Changer for SUI? The filing is more than just paperwork; it’s a powerful endorsement. Grayscale, a titan in digital asset management, sees long-term value in Sui. Consequently, a Sui ETF would provide several key benefits: Accessibility: Opens SUI investment to retirement accounts and traditional brokers. Legitimacy: Enhances regulatory clarity and institutional trust in the asset. Liquidity: Potentially increases trading volume and market stability for SUI. However, the journey is just beginning. The SEC’s review will be thorough, focusing on market manipulation concerns and custody solutions. What Challenges Lie Ahead for the Sui ETF? Approval is not guaranteed. The SEC has historically been cautious with crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. Key hurdles include: Regulatory Scrutiny: How will the SEC classify SUI? Is it a security or a commodity? Market Surveillance: The SEC requires a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size. Custody: Providing proof of secure, compliant asset storage is paramount. Grayscale’s experience and resources give this Sui ETF proposal a strong foundation, but patience will be essential. How Does This Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs paved the way. Now, the race is on for the next generation of single-asset crypto funds. A Sui ETF would place SUI in an elite category alongside Ethereum, signaling its perceived importance in the smart contract platform arena. This move could pressure other asset managers to file for similar products, creating a competitive and innovative landscape. What Should Investors Do Now? For now, this is a development to watch closely. The filing is a profoundly bullish long-term signal for the Sui ecosystem. Investors should: Research the Sui Network: Understand its technology and use cases beyond the ETF news. Monitor SEC Announcements: The review process will provide critical updates. Assess Personal Strategy: Determine how a potential Sui ETF fits into a diversified portfolio. In summary, Grayscale’s Sui ETF filing is a landmark moment of validation. It represents a crucial bridge being built between Sui’s cutting-edge technology and the vast pools of traditional capital. While regulatory hurdles remain, this step forward illuminates a clear path toward mainstream financial integration for SUI, potentially reshaping its market trajectory for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Sui ETF? A Sui ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) would be an investment fund traded on stock exchanges. Its value would be tied to the price of the SUI cryptocurrency, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly buying or storing the token. Has the Sui ETF been approved? No. Grayscale has only filed the initial registration paperwork (Form S-1) with the SEC. Approval is not guaranteed and will likely take several months, if it happens at all. Why is Grayscale filing for a Sui ETF important? It signals serious institutional interest and could pave the way for easier, regulated investment in SUI for a much wider audience, including through retirement and brokerage accounts. What is the difference between Grayscale’s Sui Trust and a Sui ETF? Grayscale’s existing Sui Trust (if it exists) is a private, closed-end fund often trading at a premium or discount to the asset’s value. An ETF is more efficient, typically trades closer to the net asset value, and offers creation/redemption mechanisms to keep prices in line. How long does the SEC ETF approval process take? The timeline is unpredictable. It can range from several months to over a year, depending on the political climate, regulatory concerns, and the completeness of the application. Can I invest in the Sui ETF now? Not yet. You cannot invest until the SEC declares the registration statement “effective” and the ETF launches on a national stock exchange like NYSE Arca or Nasdaq.

Solana (SOL) remains to be one of the hardest-hitting altcoins in the marketplace, recognized for speed, scalability, and heightened liquidity, although the latest developments in this project have left investors wondering whether it still has what it takes to top past explosive growth milestones. In light of this prevailing uncertainty, many investors are naturally gravitating toward those assets that have higher asymmetry ratios and are at the early stages of development and showing real-world use and rapid adoption. And in this developing scenario, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the latest and hottest digital currency at just only $0.035, has naturally topped the list of the current best cryptos to invest in due to its nearly sold-out presale Phase 6, over 18,300 holders, and its upcoming V1 launch. Solana Remains at Crucial Levels as Market Participants Look for Breakout Points Solana (SOL) remains at the doorstep of a strong level of support in what has obviously been a period of consolidation, and traders are eagerly observing whether or not it anticipates breakout action that will allow it to finally push on towards the $200 to $280 level and beyond, particularly when taken in the context of strong levels of volatility that continue to be such an important defining factor for this asset class at this point in time. In an era in which investors are attempting to survey every possible opportunity on the market, this change in direction is naturally of much interest in relation to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which remains a brand-new addition to the world of cryptocurrencies at this point in time. Mutuum Finance Presale Speeds Up Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at just $0.01 per token. Since then, it has continuously increased in value to the current level of $0.035, showing a 250% appreciation in token value prior to launch. Each of the preceding stages sold out rapidly, showing steady and rising enthusiasm for this project amongst the international crypto community at large. Currently, Stage 6 is nearing completion and is amongst the most exciting stages of the presales. Investors are well aware that after the end of this phase of the presale, the token values are soon about to approach the expected launch price of $0.06, making this the ideal moment to acquire MUTM at just less than $0.04. Having raised in excess of $19.15 million thus far, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself at the top of the list for the very best crypto to invest in and amongst the top picks for emerging crypto sites of 2025. Effective Security Framework and Risk Management System Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is based on the Loan-to-Value (LTV) model that balances risk on the asset side via collateralization, transfer, and liquidation functions. MUTM also employs a reserve factor and market condition buffer for extra protection in case of unexpected changes in the market. High-risk assets are carefully handled in a way that prioritizes the safety of both MUTM and the users. Protocol Mechanics and Interest Rate Model MUTM protocol uses interest rates that fluctuate in accordance with the market rates and liquidity. If liquidity is high in the market, the rates for borrowing are lowered to attract borrowing. However, when liquidity in the market is low, the rates are raised to ensure solvency and promote additional deposits. In this case, for those borrowing in order to create stability, fixed-rate borrowing also exists, and this rate is normally higher compared to those that are variable and can only be accessed in highly liquid collateral. Mutuum Finance uses strong risk management methods for protecting the system. Some of the important features are: Efficient liquidation systems for under-collateralized positions Over-collateralization of loans for protecting the lenders and the protocol Cascading Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios to control exposure Liquidity ceilings together with reserve factors for solvency in case of difficult markets Liquidation fees and risk buffers for covering losses and ensuring stability In this manner, several forces align together in order to create an enduring and secure borrowing and lending marketplace that can resist and overcome extreme changes in the markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has garnered over $19.15 million in funding with 18,300+ investors in its presale phase and the token is up 250% from 0.01 to 0.035. In the midst of Solana network consolidation, this makes for very promising early investment potential and genuine DeFi applications. Lock in those investments now before the end of phase 6 when values are expected to get to $0.06 at launch. Participate in the presale today and gain access to this emerging crypto asset and enjoy the best crypto to invest options in the current market.

55407316,640822,1764982826,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55407316.jpeg,Bitcoin Treasury Company Is About To List on The New York Stock Exchange,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-treasury-company-nyse/,"On 3rd December, official filings and press releases announced Twenty One Capital’s upcoming debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), positioning the company as one of the largest Bitcoin treasury firms ever to enter public markets. The listing brings a dedicated Bitcoin balance sheet into Wall Street’s core ecosystem, signaling a structural shift in how institutional investors can gain long-term BTC exposure. A Bitcoin Treasury Giant Steps Onto The NYSE Stage Twenty One Capital’s NYSE entry is anchored by its business combination with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) , the SPAC serving as the public-market vehicle for the transaction. CEP shareholders have already approved the merger, and the deal is expected to close around December 8. Once completed, the combined entity will operate as Twenty One Capital, Inc. and begin trading on December 9 under the ticker XXI. The original announcement, released through official press channels and SEC-related filings, emphasized CEP’s central role in enabling the listing and establishing the company’s public-market structure. CEO Jack Mallers also highlighted the milestone on X, noting the company’s readiness for its debut. According to this press announcement, Twenty One Capital will debut with an estimated 43,500 BTC , a reserve valued near $4 billion at recent market levels. This immediately places it among the top corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally . Unlike companies that hold Bitcoin as a secondary reserve, Twenty One is specifically engineered around a Bitcoin-native model. The firm intends to report “Bitcoin-per-share,” providing investors a transparent look at how much BTC each equity unit represents. It also pledges full, on-chain proof-of-reserves, positioning itself as a high-transparency asset custodian at launch. This model effectively transforms Twenty One into a regulated balance-sheet wrapper for Bitcoin . It lowers operational friction for institutional allocators who want direct BTC exposure without the complexities of crypto custody, self-storage, or exchange-based acquisition. By listing on the NYSE rather than relying on ETFs or derivatives, Twenty One creates a regulated public equity vehicle that holds, safeguards, and transparently tracks Bitcoin for institutional and retail investors alike. Wall Street’s New On-Ramp To Institutional BTC Exposure The market impact of Twenty One’s listing reflects the accelerating integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial architecture. The company’s backers—including Tether-linked entities, Bitfinex-aligned interests , SoftBank-connected capital, and Cantor’s public-markets network—provide a cross-sector foundation aimed at bridging crypto-native philosophies with institutional liquidity channels. Under this structure, Twenty One aims to become a long-term institutional treasury vessel —a regulated balance sheet that accumulates BTC and gives investors an equity-linked way to participate in Bitcoin’s upside without engaging directly with crypto custody or trading infrastructure. As the NYSE debut approaches, Twenty One Capital embodies a pivot point where BTC’s role in capital markets shifts from speculative asset to institutional treasury instrument. If XXI attracts sustained flow, it could set a new blueprint for how corporate entities engage with Bitcoin—anchoring Wall Street’s next phase of digital-asset adoption.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-06 01:00:26

He pointed to weakening selling pressure and growing underlying activity as reasons for cautious optimism. Related Reading: A New Era Begins: CFTC Approves Spot Bitcoin On Regulated US Markets Market Sentiment May Be Near A Turning Point According to Lee, mood on the street turned darker after October, with many investors showing fatigue after steady losses. He said the current selling looks closer to exhaustion than to the start of another major decline. Trading desks have cut back. Volume has thinned. Sentiment is low. Lee argued that often, when pessimism peaks, conditions for a reversal begin to form. Bitcoin Drawdowns Are Not Uncommon Based on reports, Bitcoin has fallen about 36% from its all-time high in the recent retreat. That size of drop has happened in prior cycles, including 2017 and 2021, and has been followed by rallies that reached new records. “Crypto prices likely bottomed. The best years of growth are still ahead: there is 200x adoption to come.” – Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine pic.twitter.com/fPWbWdaosO — Binance (@binance) December 4, 2025 Lee pointed to long-term returns for bitcoin and ether compared with some traditional assets over the last decade, saying crypto’s gains were larger. He used that history to support the idea that patient holders have been rewarded after past stress. Tokenization Could Be A Major Story In 2026 Lee also presented tokenization as a key theme for the future. He said large institutions are preparing to move more financial products on-chain and that, if real estate joins the shift, close to a quadrillion dollars in assets could eventually be tokenized. Stablecoins were cited as an early example of why tokenized instruments can attract demand. He suggested that a broader institutional push could add steady interest to the market over time. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Was Highlighted As A Signal Reports have disclosed that BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF has become one of the firm’s top fee-earning products, a fact Lee used to show growing involvement from legacy finance. That kind of institutional participation, he argued, points to deeper engagement from big players who were previously on the sidelines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Fails To Shake Ripple CEO — He Still Calls For $180K Adoption Gap Suggests Large Upside According to Lee, only 4.4 million bitcoin wallets hold more than $10,000 in BTC, while nearly 900 million people globally have more than $10,000 in retirement savings. He said that gap shows how early the market still is and argued that if just a fraction of those savers put money into bitcoin, adoption could expand by as much as 200 times. The figure is speculative, he acknowledged, but he used it to show the potential scale for future demand. What This Means For Investors Now Lee questioned whether the old four-year cycle should be used as a strict guide. He suggested recent moves were driven more by de-leveraging and structural shifts than by the halving rhythm that shaped earlier cycles.
