The recent price decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking by investors after the rally. However, despite this dip, the blockchain continues to attract significant interest from major holders. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend in a Wednesday tweet, revealing that the dip has triggered a wave of accumulation among Cardano whales . “Cardano whales took profits on the way up from $1.15 to $1.33, but after $ADA dropped to $0.91, they started buying again. In fact, they’ve bought 160 million ADA since the dip,” Martinez wrote. Further data reveals that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA, often called “sharks,” have seen a significant increase in activity during this accumulation phase. While frequently overlooked, this investor tier wields substantial influence in the market. Their cumulative buying or selling activity can notably impact price trends, often shaping broader market dynamics and signaling potential shifts in momentum. The continued accumulation of ADA reflects growing confidence in the Cardano ecosystem, which has been gaining momentum across multiple areas. Data from crypto analysis platform Taptools reveals that, over the past 30 days, the ecosystem has seen a substantial inflow of more than 3.78 million ADA into the market. During this period, Cardano has consistently maintained over 50,000 active daily traders on its decentralized exchanges (DEXs), underscoring its rising liquidity and expanding user base. Additionally, the surge in liquidity and active addresses signals a strong influx of new investors, further strengthening Cardano’s market position. Furthermore, as per data from DefiLlama, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has seen remarkable growth this year, reaching approximately $708 million earlier this month and surpassing previous all-time highs. Cardano has also been steadily gaining prominence in the cryptocurrency space, driven by its advancements in sectors such as DeFi, smart contracts, and scaling solutions like Hydra, attracting significant interest from larger institutional investors. On the price front, the accumulation of ADA by whales during market dips is a positive signal for retail investors. It suggests that the perceived “floor” price is around $0.90, which has recently been breached as a key support level, indicating the potential for a price rebound. ADA was trading at $0.85 at press time, reflecting a 0.14% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:23:21

According to the data , MakerDAO reached a peak of $40.86 million in fees, a key metric of user activity, and $26.77 million in revenue, reflecting retained earnings, between December 1 and December 31. A Historic Month for MakerDAO 2024 has also been the crypto lending protocol’s best year since its inception, making about $304 million in fees and over $174 million in revenue. At that time, the highest amount recorded for fees was in April, when the protocol received $32.62 million, while its best month in terms of turnover was November when it made $18.91 million. However, December’s numbers beat both those figures by $8.24 million and $7.86 million, respectively, setting a new precedent for the platform. Interestingly, MakerDAO also saw its highest single-day performance on December 9, bringing in $1.67 million in levies and $1.18 million in income. These earnings have been driven primarily by interest payments on loans made on the protocol’s DAI stablecoin, reflecting the increasing demand for its lending services. In August, the platform announced it would rebrand to Sky after two years of development aimed at adding new functionalities and improving user interactions. It also introduced two new cryptocurrencies: USDS, a stablecoin that users could convert from their existing DAI holdings, and a new governance token named SKY. USDS has also been launched on Solana as a DeFi-native stablecoin. The network has the second-largest decentralized finance ecosystem after Ethereum, with about $8.5 billion locked into its DeFi projects. MKR’s Market Performance Elsewhere, Maker’s native asset MKR experienced a less-than-impressive December. According to data from CoinGecko, the token lost 16.8% of its value over the last 30 days, with its worst performance coming in the previous two weeks, where it dipped by more than 21%. In the last 24 hours, its price fluctuated between $1,488 and $1,547, finally settling at $1,522. The current price is 1.1% below its previous level from yesterday and remains more than 75% below its all-time high, recorded in May 2021. However, it still shows healthy market activity, with its latest one-day trading volume of $113.1 million helping it maintain a significant value with a market cap of $1.37 billion.

Despite a fabulous rally in November, the entire market pulled back, and BTC now trades at around $93,000. Altcoins have dominated the headlines recently with continued gains as we near the altcoin season. Large-cap altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Stellar (XLM), grabbed attention for their immense gains in November and have the market on their toes as to what will happen with their prices when we finally enter the altcoin season. Join us as we explore the top gainers and potential winners as the altcoin season inches closer. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is another major gainer since Donald Trump’s election victory. On-chain metrics show Cardano’s weekly active addresses elevated since the crypto market rally triggered by Trump’s win on November 6 began. The surge in network usage and whale buying activity has resulted in a bullish outlook for ADA. ADA further surged after the Cardano blockchain developers, the Cardano Foundation, released an updated proposal for the Cardano Constitution to improve network governance. The revised proposal includes changes to constitutional workshops, social media discussion, and expert and community feedback. The changes aim to “improve the accessibility and clarity of the Cardano governance framework,” shifting its focus to a less technical audience. Interest in Cardano (ADA) surged after its founder, Charles Hoskinson, revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) made headlines in recent months for its massive gains. The Stellar network is similar to the Ripple (XRP) network - a decentralised payment platform and cryptocurrency that facilitates quick and low-cost cross-border payments, promoting financial inclusion for individuals and businesses globally. The Stellar network was created to support digital representations of any currency but has its native token called Lumens (XLM). Developed as a fork of the Ripple protocol, Stellar aims to create a global network connecting financial institutions, payment processors, and individual users, making cross-border money transfer easier and providing access to essential financial services. XLM, in conjunction with XRP, is expected to play a significant role in the new global financial system. XRP is uniquely designed to optimize institutional liquidity for cross-border transactions. At the same time, XLM’s infrastructure was built to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and retail-level remittances efficiently. Financial experts envision a two-tiered monetary framework using XRP and XLM at different levels for specific purposes. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $12.4 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 230%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Expected Surge Upon Exchange Listing As BTC trades at around $93,000 and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this powerful blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $680,000 and will soon reach its fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

While established tokens like Shiba Inu have already made waves, new contenders like BTFD Coin and SLERF are emerging with massive potential. BTFD Coin’s presale has been particularly impressive, raising over $4.6 million within its first month, and analysts are already predicting major gains. This all reminds us of the 1973 economic collapse when the world faced a significant downturn, but smart investors who bought during the chaos later reaped huge rewards. Is history repeating itself? If you’re wondering which meme coins offer the best investment opportunities right now, you’re in the right place. In this article, we’ll take a close look at BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and SLERF, comparing their presales, potential returns, and future prospects. We’ll also highlight BTFD Coin’s recent performance, which is turning heads as it continues to break records. With its exciting presale, community-focused features, and an all-new P2E game , BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin – it’s a movement. Meme coins have come a long way, from being niche crypto jokes to becoming a dominant force in the market. Over the years, we’ve seen projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu make waves, and now BTFD Coin and SLERF are looking to take that momentum even further. BTFD Coin, in particular, is building on this wave, offering not just meme coin appeal, but a gamified experience, staking rewards , and a referral program that could take it to the next level. Investors are flocking to it, and it’s easy to see why – it’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolutionising Crypto As the 13th stage of the presale unfolds, the coin is available for $0.000142. With over $4.6 million raised, the presale reached impressive milestones, including $1 million in under 10 days and $2.5 million in less than 14 days. The project boasts a vibrant community of 7,000+ holders, with more than 60 billion coins sold so far. What sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins is its focus on building a vibrant community and offering utilities like a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a referral program. This isn’t just about buying coins and waiting for a pump; it’s about engaging with the platform and earning rewards as you go. And with a killer bonus code – BIG50 – you can grab 50% extra coins . Looking back to the 1973 economic collapse, it’s easy to see how BTFD Coin’s current presale mirrors that kind of opportunity. When markets were down in the ’70s, those who bought into undervalued assets found themselves in a prime position when the economy recovered. Today, we’re seeing a similar scenario with BTFD Coin, where smart investors are buying in early to take advantage of the low presale price. And with the presale tally already crossing $4 million, it’s clear that this meme coin is gaining serious traction. BTFD Coin offers one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential , and if you’re not on board yet, now’s the time to act. As the presale progresses, the price will only rise, so getting in with the BIG50 bonus code is a no-brainer. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity – it’s only going to get better from here. Don’t miss the BIG50 festive bonus! Use code BIG50 to earn 50% more tokens. For example, purchasing 100 coins will reward you with 150. Secure $BTFD now and set yourself up for success. Shiba Inu: The King of Meme Coins Shiba Inu is often regarded as the “Doge killer” for its rapid rise in popularity and its reputation as one of the top meme coins on the market. Since its launch, Shiba Inu has seen massive growth, making early investors some serious profits. However, while Shiba Inu’s community and ecosystem are impressive, its potential for exponential growth is starting to plateau as the market matures. At its peak, Shiba Inu saw a massive surge in price, with people scrambling to get in before it skyrocketed. But now, its price has stabilised, and while it still has a large and loyal community, many investors are looking for the next big thing. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. With its innovative approach, including a P2E game, staking rewards, and an aggressive presale strategy, BTFD Coin is challenging the status quo and could easily surpass Shiba Inu in terms of growth potential. Just like Shiba Inu, BTFD Coin has captured the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts, but it stands out because of its unique offerings that provide value beyond just holding coins. This focus on utility, community engagement, and rewards is a key differentiator. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $4 million, and its trajectory shows no signs of slowing down. It’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, and if you’re still hanging on to Shiba Inu, now might be the time to diversify and add some BTFD to your portfolio. SLERF: The Underdog with Serious Potential SLERF is another up-and-coming meme coin that’s gaining traction in the crypto world. While it hasn’t yet reached the same level of recognition as BTFD Coin or Shiba Inu, its presale has been steadily growing, attracting a loyal following. Like BTFD Coin, SLERF offers a community-driven approach, with an emphasis on decentralisation and rewards for holders. SLERF has made a strong start in its presale, but it still has a long way to go before it can catch up with the kind of explosive growth that BTFD Coin has seen. With a similar low entry price and early-stage promise, SLERF presents an interesting option for investors looking for a meme coin with 100x potential. However, when comparing SLERF to BTFD Coin, it’s clear that BTFD’s presale strategy, utility offerings, and community-driven incentives put it in a prime position to outperform SLERF in the coming months. Both projects have a lot of potential, but BTFD Coin’s presale has already proven itself to be one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, thanks to its early success and growing community. It’s hard to deny that BTFD Coin is the front-runner in this race. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to get in on the action?

Bitcoin Reserves on Exchanges Shrink To New Lows,https://zycrypto.com/btc-skyrocketing-rally-bitcoin-reserves-on-exchanges-shrink-to-new-lows/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price faces a potentially massive rally as on-chain factors remain positive. Whales and institutional investors have repositioned assets to favor an uphill narrative ahead of 2025. This year, the crypto market dominated financial spaces with multiple all-time highs for some assets. Bitcoin Reserves Plunge to 2.4 Million BTC On-chain data shows declining Bitcoin reserves across exchanges, tipping a higher price action. This year, reserves on centralized exchanges dropped to 2.4 million from 3 million in January. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January led to declining numbers. Sequel to the approvals, the BTC price rose to new highs above $7k. Most whales withdrew assets from exchanges as funds trickled into the ecosystem. Outflows from exchanges point to an increased price action due to whales considering long-term holdings. Conversely, inflow to these platforms leads to sell pressure because of the popular sentiment associated with the transfers. Crypto analyst KriptoBaykusv2 explained that the presence of institutional investors sparked the status quo, seeing rapid inflows as a sign of more gains. Most traditional investors bought the dip and have maintained a hodl strategy. On the other hand, retail investors tend to move tokens on slight price changes, leading to BTC redistribution. “ This shift is particularly evident among institutional investors, who have increasingly embraced the “hodl” approach, demonstrating strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. As reserves dwindled, Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge. Starting the year around $40K, the price accelerated in November, surpassing the $100K milestone and setting a new peak at $104K.” As exchange balances drop, Bitcoin miner reserves spike following the price surge. The last bear market saw miners sell reserves to stay afloat. High prices result in a hodl strategy to maximize gains. Bitcoin Bulls Expect Massive Price Upticks Bitcoin enthusiasts have projected a massive price surge next year due to bullish industry and on-chain factors. The transfer of assets to other custodians shows a supply shock, which could be the catalyst for the needed price action. Several whales have also ramped up accumulations alongside top firms releasing their 2025 market outlook. In a new release, Bitfinex analysts noted that the market is positioned to see a price upswing, hitting $200K due to institutional activities. Similar firms have projected the same price range for the asset, citing favorable United States policies, among others.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:38:22

Rumors about a customer repayment plan for January 2025 have been dismissed by one of its major creditors, causing even more confusion. The news had circulated over the weekend. Many claimed that FTX would begin repayments on January 3 and distribute $16 billion to creditors within 60 days. However, a key creditor, Sunil, denied these claims, saying the timeline and payout were inaccurate. Sunil Clears the Air on January Repayment Plan In a recent X post, Sunil, an FTX creditor advocate, denied claims about a January repayment date. He explained that the date was wrong and provided an update on FTX’s recovery. He revealed the exchange has recovered $13 billion from debtors, potentially reaching $14 billion by March 2025. However, he warned creditors not to expect an immediate payout as the situation remains uncertain. The confusion stems from FTX’s plan to keep half the recovered funds. Sunil explained that FTX will hold 50% of the $13 billion for future needs, leaving just $7 billion for the first round of payouts. This means the repayment will be slower and smaller than expected, with creditors initially receiving only part of their claims. FTX Debtors to Receive Full Reimbursement in 2-3 Years For those hoping for full compensation soon, Sunil added more caution. He said that reimbursing creditors could take two to three years, much longer than the earlier promise of quick repayment. This has left many customers questioning the truth behind FTX’s recovery plans. Amid the confusion, many users are looking for a clearer repayment schedule. Earlier this month, a tweet from the official FTX account suggested repayments would start in January. This led a user to ask Sunil about the conflicting information. With no clear answers yet, these uncleared questions fuel ongoing frustrations. Legal Hiccups and Missed Opportunities To add another layer to the ongoing controversy, earlier decisions in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings have left many creditors feeling cheated. Earlier, presiding judge John Dorsey made a notable ruling. He allowed the exchange to repay creditors based on the monetary value of a user’s balance at the time of the bankruptcy filing. This meant creditors missed out on the potential profits from the rise in cryptocurrency prices, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, Bitcoin was priced at $16,871 and Solana at $16.25. This is much lower than their values as of writing.

In that time frame, monthly volumes totaled $182 million, $167 million, and $135 million in October, November, and December, respectively. The network’s popularity among retail users is rising due to its efficiency and cost. Institutions have also played a part as inflows lead to more market transactions. According to the analysts, the decline of TON enabled Tron to take the top spot, coupled with Tether’s activity. In previous months, Telegram-based games took over the ecosystem, with the network being a huge beneficiary. Inflow to the ecosystem began to decline as momentum shifted to other networks. Furthermore, Tron’s USDT volume is another driver of bullish activity. This comes on the heels of retail crypto traders ramping up gains on the back of the market surge. What Next For TRX Price? Amid huge inflows, TRX surged to new highs, recording huge community activities. The asset’s rise was linked to its transaction volumes, and gains were seen in wider crypto events. The United States election was a major driver of crypto prices this quarter. After the polls, the asset hit a new all-time high above $0.45 before sharply declining. It should be noted that Justin Sun’s announced of a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance. However, the wider market crash saw the asset record a 40% correction, although the bull signal increased on-chain data. According to CryptoQuant, a custom indicator based on the combination of RSI and MACD points to a move away from the overbought zone. This is a sign of incoming bull activity with healthier conditions from investors. Ahead of next year’s projected rally, institutional investors are repositioning assets and whales ramping up tokens. “ The next steps are crucial. If we see an “oversold” signal in the coming days, it could present a solid buying opportunity for those aiming to capitalize on the continuation of Tron’s bullish momentum. For now, patience is key. Monitoring this custom indicator and staying updated on market trends will be vital to identifying the right moment to re-enter Tron,” the report added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|TON,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:54:37

Now, Nvidia is reportedly going to open-source the software. Run:ai posted the latest news on its website and revealed Nvidia’s plans to open source its software. Regulators from both sides of the Atlantic probed Nvidia on antitrust grounds While neither of the companies explained the intention, Venture Beat suggests this might not be hard to figure out as Nvidia has ballooned to be the most valuable company in the world at $3.56 trillion. Despite its size, it also becomes difficult for the chip-making giant to acquire companies because of antitrust oversight. The acquisition faced some hurdles after the EU Commission indicated in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the proposed transaction would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to Reuters , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks, but eventually concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. The Department of Justice also investigated Nvidia over the transaction on antitrust grounds. Now, after finally sealing the deal, a Nvidia spokesperson only said in a statement: “We’re delighted to welcome the Run:ai team to Nvidia.” However, Run:ai founders Omri Geller and Ronen Dar indicated in a statement that open-sourcing the software will help the community build better AI, faster. “While Run:ai currently supports only Nvidia GPUs, open-sourcing the software will enable it to extend its availability to the entire AI ecosystem.” Geller and Dar. The Israeli startup founders also added that this will continue to help their customers get the most of their AI infrastructure and offer the ecosystem maximum flexibility, efficiency, and utilization for GPU systems, whenever they are. The Nvidia – Run:ai transaction to help customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure The two founders also revealed that they will continue to strengthen their partnerships and work alongside the ecosystem to give customers various AI solutions and platform choices. “True to our open-platform philosophy, as part of Nvidia, we will keep empowering AI teams with the freedom to choose the tools, platforms, and frameworks that best suit their needs,” said Geller and Dar. The Israel-based startup revealed that its goal when it started in 2018 was to be a driving force in the AI revolution and empower organizations to unlock the full potential of their AI infrastructure. According to VB , the company helps its customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure, enhance efficiency, and utilization as well as boost the productivity of their teams. “We are thrilled to build on this momentum, now as part of Nvidia. AI and accelerated computing are transforming the world at an unprecedented pace, and we believe this is just the beginning,” the Run:ai founders said. “GPUs and AI infrastructure will remain at the forefront of driving these transformative innovations and joining Nvidia provides us an extraordinary opportunity to carry forward a joint mission of helping humanity solve the world’s greatest challenges,” they added. While Nvidia has for long been making graphics chips that have become useful in running AI software, the company is also now emphasizing software. Nvidia controls about 80% market share of AI graphics processors. The Run:ai acquisition therefore now relates to giving their customers efficiency and flexibility for GPU orchestration software. The two companies have been collaborating since 2020 and have joint customers. Nvidia first announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). This delayed the conclusion of the transaction as it was under probe before it got approved earlier this month. When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources.

This Engineer Thinks So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/will-bitcoin-enter-its-most-massive-bull-cycle-this-engineer-thinks-so/,"Although Bitcoin is having a rough moment this week, with prices oscillating between $93k and $96k, at least one popular crypto commentator is predicting a massive price run soon. According to Ted Boydston, the market should prepare for a manic bull run in the coming days, with Bitcoin’s price targeting $225k. Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset? CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move Boydston highlights the price oscillator on M2, which offers real-time buy and sell signals for traders and investors. He then explained that the tool recently displayed a buy signal. And if history repeats itself, Boydston expects Bitcoin to begin its price surge, benefitting holders and investors. Bitcoin And Its M2 Price Oscillator Chart Boydston, a popular crypto commentator and engineer, offers a fascinating insight into Bitcoin’s recent price action. Although Bitcoin’s price has recently slipped, he sees a potential price surge soon. Except for the 2016 Bitcoin cycle, a price oscillator on M2 has provided well timed buy and sell signals.

Since the M2 money stock considers liquid cash circulation, including checking deposits, physical cash (M1), money markets, and savings, the chart provides an interesting perspective on an asset’s possible direction. As such, this technical chart and indicator offer helpful insights into the possible performance of assets, including those in the crypto niche. A Bitcoin Bull Run Soon?

Investors can expect increased volatility and Bitcoin price appreciation if this scenario plays out. Traders and investors have relied on this technical analysis for years, offering correct predictions, except in 2016. The chart didn’t flash the buy signal then, but the price went up after the Bitcoin halving event. Bitcoin’s Future Price Action Crypto analysts targeted the $100k mark for Bitcoin a few months ago. Now that this was already achieved in December, many analysts are setting their sights on new targets. Some analysts claim that Bitcoin’s short-term target is $150k, while others speculate that the asset could hit $1 million.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 23:08:00

The debate gained momentum following public statements from Rick McCracken, a prominent figure in the Cardano community, who raised issues about leadership and organizational transparency. This has sparked widespread discussions about community oversight and the future of Cardano’s ecosystem governance. Charles Hoskinson Addresses Cardano Foundation Oversight Charles Hoskinson has been keen to assert the Cardano Foundation ’s commitment to the principle of decentralisation and, in particular, the need for community supervision over the foundation. He pointed out that the Foundation is not affiliated with IOHK (Input Output Global) or Emurgo, the other two main stakeholders in the ecosystem. Hoskinson said, “This isn’t a Charles versus CF debate… This is a discussion on the issue of whether the community foundation should be answerable to the community. He noted, however that the Cardano Foundation’s $600 million ADA treasury has no direct representation of the community regarding its utilization. In his view, the Foundation’s lack of enthusiasm in supporting grants and funding for projects like Catalyst can hinder the growth of the ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson also pointed out that this approach may lead to future problems in the ecosystem sustainability, especially in the case when major contributors like IOHK are expected to work without proper motivation. Rick McCracken’s Concerns About Transparency and Leadership Rick McCracken, a Cardano supporter, raised some questions about the transparency of IOHK, which he said is evident by the negative reviews published on Glassdoor. McCracken raised issues over decision making within leadership and the overall direction of the ecosystem, and advocated for change in governance. Charles Hoskinson’s reply to McCracken’s statement was that the comments made were quite “distasteful” and “disappointing”. He pointed to the fact that IOHK has had some issues, such as the need to cut down on its workforce during bear markets, but has always remained focused on the ecosystem. Hoskinson apologized for McCracken’s words and said, “I’m sorry that your ego got hurt, Rick; you are not doing any good to the community with your actions.” CIP-1694 and Cardano Constitution Updates Charles Hoskinson has recently provided updates on Cardano’s governance initiatives. He highlighted the progress made since the launch of the governance workstream during the Age of Voltaire conference in late 2022. This initiative has resulted in CIP-1694, which outlines processes for decentralized governance, and a draft Cardano Constitution. The governance proposal aims to bring an end to the technical bootstrapping phase of Cardano’s on-chain governance. If enacted, it will establish a framework for decentralized decision-making, allowing the community to have a greater role in governance. Charles Hoskinson reiterated that the governance process has involved extensive community discussions over the past two years As governance discussions continue, ADA price has experienced fluctuations amid broader market trends. Over the past two weeks, ADA price has dropped significantly from $1.3264 to lows of $0.7620. However, some analysts believe the decline may have reached a bottom. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Consulting, has suggested that ADA price could bounce back from the $0.7460 support level. He noted that the token’s performance in 2024 suggests potential for further growth, with possible resistance near $1.2430. At press time, Cardano price was trading at $0.854, a 0.11% decline from the intra-day high of $0.8962. Despite this, Van de Poppe expressed optimism about ADA’s long-term growth potential, citing its recent 300% rise from November lows as part of a broader bull market cycle.

Per El Pais , “digital” alternatives are now displacing the “gray dollar” for Venezuelan citizens. Venezuelans Still Keen on Crypto The report’s author noted that while the “crypto accepted here” signs that were “once prominent in shops, hotels, and restaurants in Venezuela” have long disappeared, “this does not mean that Venezuela’s crypto economy is not flourishing.” The media outlet wrote that Venezuelans are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and other coins to make easy transactions, receive remittances, and “take refuge from the devaluation of the [fiat] bolivar.” The newspaper added that while crypto exchanges are “not illegal” in the country, they are also “unregulated.” The Government of Nicolás Maduro reportedly “tolerates” unregulated crypto exchange “because it has become a way to bring foreign currency into the country.” The Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro with the late US President Jimmy Carter. (Source: Nicolás Maduro/Facebook) Maduro claimed victory in elections earlier this year. However, the United States has claimed that the elections were marred by “electoral fraud.” As a result, the newspaper explained, Maduro’s inauguration on January 10, 2025, has become “a date that is generating political and financial tension.” Maduro once pursued an aggressively pro-crypto policy, and even spearheaded the launch of a state-operated cryptoasset, the Petro (PTR). Reuters: Venezuela Opposition Adviser Holed Up in Argentine Residence Calls It 'Prison' https://t.co/j2EeDllp2h — nuprizm (@nuprizm) December 29, 2024 Mass Arrests However, this policy fell victim to widespread corruption, and led to mass arrests and the PTR’s eventual shutdown. But Maduro has recently spoken of “returning” to the crypto “path.” And the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis noted that “in the second quarter of 2024,” the Venezuelan Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) , and USDT markets grew by “an impressive 110% compared to the same period last year.” Chainalysis claims this rate is “higher than in any country in the [LATAM] region.” UN orders Venezuela not to destroy election vote tallies https://t.co/aE3KPPNJ0L — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) December 4, 2024 $20 Billion Inflow The media outlet explained that in 2024, an “estimated volume of $20 billion” has “entered the Venezuelan ecosystem” through crypto markets. This represents a sizeable chunk of the nation’s estimated $100 billion 2024 Gross Domestic Product. Despite its well-documented financial woes, Venezuela has battled against hyperinflation with some success. But the economy remains highly dependent on oil exports, and the specter of inflation refuses to vanish entirely. Inflation rose by around 4% in October, shooting up from under 1% in September. Some estimate that November ushered in a steeper rise yet. Venezuela's monthly inflation rate returned to double digits in November: 12.5%, a figure that had not been recorded since the beginning of 2023, according to the Venezuelan Financial Observatory (OVF). pic.twitter.com/l3rNCbxZPj — BowTiedMara (@BowTiedMara) December 6, 2024 And this, like elsewhere in LATAM, has driven many citizens to the stablecoins markets. Chainalysis claimed that between July 2023 and July 2024, 47% of crypto transactions worth under $10,000 involved stablecoins. “Stablecoins have become popular because they are pegged to more stable fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. They offer a hedge against the volatility of the Venezuelan bolivar. They play a crucial role in daily transactions and remittances.” Dan Cartolin, Enterprise Account Executive, Chainalysis. Guyana’s economy is the fastest-growing in the world, driven by a booming oil sector. But Venezuela is laying claim to its neighbor’s oil-rich region and the threat of a “resource curse” looms large.

The newspaper quoted a Venezuelan citizen named Vanesa as explaining that she provides crypto exchange services to her countrypeople using platforms like Binance. However, Vanesa lamented that the crackdown on crypto exchanges and the government’s own crypto operations have left people like her in limbo. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Latin American crypto exchange as stating that it had tried to apply for a virtual asset service provider license in Venezuela. But this platform said that it had given up because it was “impossible to deal with sudden changes” in the regulatory guidelines. In the wake of the crackdown, crypto-related “posters” have been “taken down” everywhere. Operations involving crypto are “becoming more discreet,” Vanesa added, concluding: “Everything is in the grey zone here. It is impossible to know if I am laundering someone’s money [when I am exchanging crypto for clients].” The post Venezuelans Ditching the Dollar in Favor of Crypto – Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Adoption|Venezuela,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-30 23:30:00

According to market data, the MSTR stock is down by 2.46% in After Hours trading after closing Monday’s session at 8.19% to $302.96. This stock price turnout has driven many debate on the cause despite the alleged correlation it maintains with the US Dollar. MicroStrategy Stock and the Bitcoin Levered Play Global industry commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter provided insights into what is happening with MicroStrategy and Bitcoin. Kobeissi noted that the decoupling in MicroStrategy stock and Bitcoin started about a month ago. Within that time, Bitcoin price has inked a mild 2% growth with MSTR down by more than 20%. While MicroStrategy is considered a levered Bitcoin play, the stock price’s divergence is to much. The Kobeissi Letter pointed out the firm’s business model which is to take on debt to buy more BTC. At the moment, the business intelligence firm has maxed out its debt funding sources including its shares. As reported by Coingape, MicroStrategy acquired 2,138 BTC on December 30, valued for $209 million. In order to keep making these purchases, it proposed raising its share count by 10 billion. This way, The Kobeissi Letter noted that MicroStrategy can continue borrowing against the stock to buy more Bitcoin. This will ultimately push BTC price higher and give its shares an allowance for growth. However, the current share slump hinges on how investors perceive the 10 billion share count proposal. If approved, it would dilute MSTR stock too much and if not, MicroStrategy will get stuck with its Bitcoin funding strategy. If the plan is approved, bears will say that this is a highly dilutive move for existing shareholders. However, if it is not approved, then MicroStrategy will be unable to continue buying #Bitcoin on leverage. Buying Bitcoin is obviously an integral part of $MSTR ‘s strategy. pic.twitter.com/D6qcb6fNoG — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 Despite this dilemma, The Kobeissi Letter hinted that Michael Saylor alone has a 46.8% voting power. With just 4% needed, chances are this stock count will gain the board’s approval. Here’s What The Future Holds Barring the funding challenges of the past week, MicroStrategy stock remains one of the best performing in the market this year. According to market data, MSTR is up 342% Year-to-Date (YTD) as compared to the S&P 500 Index that is up 24.54%. In the new year, MicroStrategy is poised to stabilize the best funding strategy to keep up with its treasury reserve agenda. Meanwhile, MSTR’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 might reboot the stock’s attractiveness overall. With Bitcoin also likely to rebound ahead of the pro-crypto Donald Trump inauguration, the stock’s big rebound is also possible. As MicroStrategy navigates its levered Bitcoin play, it is arguably setting a precedent for firms like Riot Platforms .

Table of Contents XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential Toncoin Shiba Inu Sui Hedera Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with some digital coins poised to make significant leaps. Several lesser-known cryptocurrencies are showing remarkable potential to climb the ranks. These altcoins are gaining momentum and could soon break into the top echelons of the market. XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential XYZ is emerging as a serious contender for a top 10 position. This sports-driven, meme-powered project is breaking barriers, looking to combine the viral appeal of meme coins with the global fervor of sports betting. With its unique approach and massive growth potential, XYZ is gearing up to redefine the altcoin landscape. XYZ isn’t just another altcoin — it’s a project built to thrive at the intersection of two explosive trends: meme coins and sports. Picture the excitement of a billion-dollar sports betting market infused with the viral momentum of crypto memes. XYZVerse will create a unique ecosystem where sports enthusiasts and crypto degens unite, unlocking massive potential for growth and community engagement. Recognized among the best new meme projects, XYZ has proven it has what it takes to dominate this niche. The XYZ presale is where the action begins. With a projected 7,400% surge by the Token Generation Event (TGE), early adopters have a golden opportunity to secure their position before the token explodes. XYZ stands leagues ahead with a solid foundation: audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for listings on major CEX and DEX platforms. With its unique value proposition and a rapidly growing community, XYZ is perfectly positioned to climb the ranks of the crypto market. The combination of transformative use cases, strong fundamentals, and an active user base makes this token a prime candidate for top-tier status. As XYZ continues to build momentum, it’s not just a hidden gem — it’s a shining star in the making. With its presale stages selling out at record speed, investors are looking to get in before XYZ cements its place among the top 10 altcoins. Interested investors can grab XYZ tokens and be part of the next crypto championship. Toncoin Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized and open-source blockchain. It was originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the ‘Gram’ token. However, Telegram discontinued the project in May 2020 due to regulatory issues. Since then, the non-commercial TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over its development. Based on historical price movements, Toncoin’s price could reach as high as $30.30 by 2025. This represents a potential gain of 348.18% compared to today’s price. By 2030, it could hit up to $26.04, a potential gain of 285.24%. Toncoin’s ambitious goals and strong technology make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Its focus on speed, security, and low fees sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. With strong community support and ongoing development, Toncoin might become a significant player as the crypto market evolves. You might also like: XYZVerse prepares to dominate 2025 with a 25,000% surge, leaving SOL and AVAX behind Shiba Inu Shiba Inu was inspired by Dogecoin’s success but runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, show its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB’s approach sets it apart from other meme coins. Sui Sui is a blockchain platform designed for global use, offering security, power, and scalability. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model. This allows for efficient transaction processing. It also employs the Move programming language, known for its security features. Moreover, Sui focuses on user experience, aiming to remove common barriers in blockchain interactions with features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions. In a market where coins like Ethereum face high fees and slow speeds, Sui offers a promising alternative. Its technology could make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Hedera Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses something called hashgraph. This makes transactions really fast, cheap, and good for the environment. There’s no mining involved, so it uses less energy. HBAR is used to pay for transactions and to keep the network secure through Proof of Stake. Hedera’s technology promises quicker and more secure transactions than many other coins. Its low fees and high speed make it attractive for businesses, especially in finance. While some worry that its patented technology might limit community involvement compared to open-source projects like Ethereum, big companies are backing Hedera. As the crypto world looks for more efficient and eco-friendly options, HBAR could stand out as a promising choice for the future. Conclusion Though TON, SHIB, SUI, and HBAR are promising in the 2024 bull run, XYZ is the first all-sport meme coin, aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans globally.

The Gold Ticket from BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a standout option, delivering not only the best chances to win $1M USDT but also significant BDAG coin rewards, attracting both experienced participants and newcomers. While promising projects like Aave and Aptos navigate their own obstacles—Aave with market downturns, and Aptos trying to keep up its growth—BlockDAG’s approach of blending real incentives with a solid presale offers a richer value proposition to those taking part. BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket: Your Top Shot at $1M USDT BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket shines as the top pick in the $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, presenting the best chance to win the grand prize of $1 million.

In conclusion, within BlockDAG’s New Year campaign, the Gold Ticket stands out as the most advantageous option. It is designed for those who appreciate both the opportunity and strategic planning, making it the optimal choice for entering the new year poised for success and the best possible outcome. Aave Faces Steep Price Drop Amid Market Sell-Off Aave, a top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is undergoing a significant price correction as market participants cash in on recent rises. Following a sustained increase, Aave’s price is now experiencing heavy pressure, with indications of a looming sharp decline. This pattern is typical in the crypto market, where swift price increases often lead to large-scale sales, increasing market unpredictability. This downturn mirrors broader difficulties across the DeFi landscape, underscoring the importance of prudent trading practices. Analysis of Aave’s technical indicators also points to potential additional losses, with vital support levels endangered. However, such downturns may provide entry opportunities for those wishing to join the market more affordably. Aptos Eyes $19 as TVL Reaches $1.29 Billion Aptos is gaining traction as its Total Value Locked (TVL) reaches $1.29 billion, indicating strong growth in its ecosystem and user base. This increase reflects the platform’s rising role in the decentralized finance sector, bolstered by new user acquisition and strategic alliances. Aptos’ blockchain, celebrated for its scalability and efficiency, enhances confidence, suggesting a bullish outlook. With the price of APT nearing $19, market sentiment is bullish, fueled by broader adoption and solid platform fundamentals. Market analysts note the increasing DeFi activities on Aptos and its technological improvements as significant factors in its positioning as a prominent crypto player. As Aptos progresses on its developmental goals and enriches its ecosystem, it remains a key project to consider for sustained growth potential. The Bottom Line In today’s fluctuating market, BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket presents an appealing mix of strategic benefits and concrete incentives. As Aave navigates price volatility and Aptos advances its ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out by syncing market dynamics with user rewards. The Gold Ticket offers enhanced chances of winning and BDAG coin bonuses, providing a realistic option for both seasoned participants and newcomers. Focusing on substantial rewards and a solid structure, BlockDAG offers a focused and beneficial route for those seeking immediate and enduring value in the cryptocurrency market.

Solana Memecoins: Fading Hype Amid Market Challenges Solana memecoins have captured the imagination of the crypto world with their vibrant communities and potential for exponential gains.

While cryptos like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have made waves globally, newer tokens are looking to make their mark. One coin in particular, BTFD Coin, is drawing a lot of attention in th e meme coin community . This post is going to dive into some of the biggest best meme coin presales to Invest in December 2024 you should be keeping an eye on this December. We’ll compare BTFD Coin with two other meme coins: Pepe Coin and Just a Chill Guy. So, buckle up, because you might just find your next big investment. Meme coins have been a major part of the crypto landscape for years, but they’ve gained an even stronger following recently. Some investors are jumping into meme coins simply for the fun of it, while others see a serious opportunity for returns. But here’s the thing: you have to know which ones to invest in. BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin—it’s a token that combines community power, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , staking rewards, and an intriguing referral program. Plus, it’s already making waves in its presale stages. The rise of meme coins over the past few years has been nothing short of spectacular, but BTFD Coin is positioning itself to take things to the next level. With its already massive presale success, BTFD has become one of the most talked-about coins in the meme sector. Let’s dive deeper into BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Just a Chill Guy and see how they compare. BTFD Coin: A Strong Contender in the Meme Coin Space When you think about meme coins, you might envision a quick surge in price followed by a crash. But BTFD Coin is different. This token has shown incredible growth, and analysts are already predicting it could outperform many other meme coins in the long run. The presale is now in its 13th phase, with the token priced at $0.000142. So far, it has raised $4.6 million, surpassing milestones of $1 million in the first 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days. The project proudly counts over 7,000 holders, with 60 billion coins sold already. But what makes BTFD stand out? It’s the combination of community support, rewarding mechanisms, and its unique presale structure. The coin offers a referral program, staking rewards, and a P2E game that’s likely to bring in new users and maintain investor interest in the long term. It’s not just about memes; it’s about building a loyal, engaged community. Now, let’s talk about the economics behind this surge. Back in 1973, the global economy faced a catastrophic collapse, sparking a series of recessions worldwide. Investors who managed to buy during the chaos made massive profits when the economy rebounded. Today, the crypto market is a similar beast. With the presale stages advancing, this is the perfect time to get in before BTFD Coin hits the market. A lot of investors have been comparing this moment to the opportunity of buying during a market crash—buying the dip when prices are still low to maximise future returns. With the BIG50 bonus code available during the presale, investors can get 50% more coins, making this an even more enticing opportunity. The BIG50 bonus adds extra value! Use code BIG50 to receive 50% more tokens on every purchase. For instance, buy 100 coins, and you’ll get 150. Take advantage of this opportunity to invest in $BTFD today. Pepe Coin: A Familiar Meme Coin with a Loyal Following Pepe Coin has built a reputation as one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market. Drawing inspiration from the infamous Pepe the Frog meme, it quickly became a fan favourite in the crypto space. The meme coin has garnered a solid community of supporters and investors who believe in the potential for long-term gains. Unlike BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin’s presale has not seen the same astronomical numbers. However, it’s still holding strong, with a clear focus on maintaining a vibrant online community. Pepe Coin’s value is often driven by its meme status and viral marketing campaigns, so it tends to experience short bursts of growth followed by corrections. While Pepe Coin has its advantages in terms of visibility and community engagement, it lacks some of the innovative elements that BTFD Coin brings to the table. For example, while Pepe Coin might offer community-based rewards, it doesn’t offer the same staking options or referral programs that are built into BTFD Coin’s ecosystem. Moreover, like any meme coin, Pepe Coin’s price volatility makes it a risky investment. However, the community is loyal, and if the token continues to gain popularity, there’s a chance that it could see more significant growth in the future. But for those looking for a coin with more stability and a proven presale success, BTFD Coin might be the better option. Just a Chill Guy: A New Player with Potential Just a Chill Guy is the new kid on the block, offering a unique take on the meme coin space. With a catchy name and an easy-going vibe, it’s certainly got the attention of investors looking for something fresh. But, much like Pepe Coin, Just a Chill Guy’s presale has yet to match the explosive growth of BTFD Coin. The coin’s community is growing steadily, and its developers are focused on creating a relaxed, welcoming environment for investors. The concept is cool—who doesn’t want to invest in something called “Just a Chill Guy?” But while it’s an interesting project, it’s still in the early stages compared to BTFD Coin. Where Just a Chill Guy stands out is its laid-back marketing approach. Instead of focusing heavily on hype, it’s building a community based on inclusivity and fun. However, when it comes to features like staking, P2E games, and referral programs, Just a Chill Guy is still playing catch-up. For those who like the idea of meme coins with a lighthearted theme, Just a Chill Guy might be a good option. But if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious presale potential and rewards, BTFD Coin should be your go-to.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 00:23:00

Dogecoin Has Been Trading Inside A Long-Term Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez discussed a long-term pattern in which the weekly price of Dogecoin has been trading inside. The pattern in question is the Ascending Parallel Channel from technical analysis. A Parallel Channel refers to a consolidation pattern that forms when the price of an asset moves inside two parallel trendlines. The upper line is made by joining together successive tops, while the lower one connects bottoms. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators While the asset is inside the channel, it’s likely to face resistance at the top line and support at the bottom one. A break out of either of these levels could imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are three types of Parallel Channels: those parallel to the time axis, those with a positive slope, and those with a negative slope. The first type doesn’t have a specific name, but the latter two do; they are known as the Ascending and Descending Parallel Channels, respectively. Given how these two types have slopped trendlines, they correspond to phases of consolidation in the asset occurring to the upside or downside. Dogecoin has appeared to have been traveling inside one such pattern over the past decade, as the chart shared by the analyst shows. From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has been stuck inside this Ascending Parallel Channel throughout its history. The most recent retest occurred just earlier in the year when DOGE found a rebound off the bottom line. As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, DOGE’s current trajectory is reminiscent of the trend witnessed during the last two bull cycles. In each of those bull runs, the cryptocurrency saw an initial upward burst followed by a small decline that led to the bull rally proper. Over the last few weeks, Dogecoin has been going down, perhaps indicating that it’s in that stepping-stone decline phase right now. Going by what happened next in the past cycles, it’s possible the meme coin would soon start a rally that would find its top at the upper level of the Ascending Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals Based on how far away the channel’s upper level currently is, the analyst has noted that it would take Dogecoin a rally of 6,770% to reach there. It now remains to be seen if the Ascending Channel would continue to hold for the meme coin and if anything similar as in history would take place this time around as well.

Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Dogwifhat: The next big meme coin Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Conclusion The development of the cryptocurrency marketplace carries on as new opportunities for significant growth appear. While there is a lot of talk about Bitcoin’s potential to hit $150,000, investors’ attention is now shifting to emerging tokens likely to give returns as high as 10,000% in a shorter time. Among these tokens, Rexas Finance (RXS) , Dogwifhat (WIF), and Hedera (HBAR) stand out. Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Rexas Finance seeks to shift the blockchain paradigm through transformative tokenization methods, bridging physical assets to the digital ecosystem. Starting at $0.03 when RXS began its presales, it now stands at $0.175 in stage 11. $33 million has been raised, with 381 million tokens sold so far, indicating high market confidence and investor interest. The Rexas ecosystem is about transformation, with tools such as the Rexas Token Builder, which will allow users to create tokens without programming knowledge. The QuickMint Bot will enable the community to build tokens on platforms like Telegram and Discord, allowing a broader audience and adoption. Rexas Finance’s listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has significantly increased its visibility and credibility. With an ongoing $1 million giveaway to attract a community and reward early adopters, RXS is set for significant growth. Its unique ecosystem and positioned approach make it a strong contender for the top crypto positions. You might also like: XRP, DOGE to lose their dominance to $0.175 crypto poised to turn $800 into $32,000 Dogwifhat: The next big meme coin Dogwifhat is taking the meme coin spotlight, having gained considerable traction with its branding and community backing. Currently, WIF is trading at $1.80 and has a market capitalization of $1.79 billion. Dogwifhat stands out through its roadmap, which includes plans for developing utility-driven applications and staking features. These aspects will provide an avenue for real value creation for meme coin holders while maintaining the essence of memes. Its community-oriented approach may help sustain demand and foster further adoption. Price forecasts for WIF suggest potential volatility. Analysts say the token can hit $15 within two years as it matures and its ecosystem thrives. This prediction aligns with its community growth and roadmap. Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Hedera has captured a significant market share through its cutting-edge Hashgraph consensus technique, offering high speed, security, and scalability. Currently valued at $0.2655 with a market cap of around $10.15 billion, HBAR has gained a significant position as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution provider. Hedera’s credibility, potential for global adoption, and recognition as one of the most powerful platforms are further enhanced by alliances with Google, IBM, and Boeing. Such partnerships will most likely circumvent the limitation of a lack of leverage in using Hedera’s platform in supply chain management, finance, and healthcare. There is optimism regarding the price of HBAR, with some analysts believing that by the year 2025, its value could rise to between $3 and $5. Such growth is anticipated as enterprises adopt Hedera and it continues to develop. Conclusion As Bitcoin continues its climb toward the $150,000 milestone, tokens such as RXS, WIF, and HBAR show relatively high potential for returns in shorter timeframes. In asset tokenization, Rexas Finance stands out with the development of new tools and its successful presale. Dogwifhat, as a memecoin with application utility, offers early investors a chance for significant returns. Coupled with enterprise solutions and industry partnerships, Hedera presents a compelling case for growth in the long term. RXS, WIF, and HBAR are all poised to generate massive gains before Bitcoin sets another record, with each having unique systems and robust market momentum.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s got his eye on Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), a memecoin that was created by an anonymous developer referencing the “ideal memecoin” suggested by the artificial intelligence (AI) large language model Truth Terminal. Altcoin Sherpa says he’s looking to accumulate FARTCOIN even if it drops to as low as $0.65. “I’m filling a bit around $0.80ish, approaching my buys. Total buys = some at $1, more at $0.80, and I also moved some other buys to $0.65 in case they come. I want my average to be around $0.80 or lower though. Still think this is a good meme and I’m hopeful it doesn’t pull a goat/act/etc after being listed… Frankly, I am a bit scared that this trade is a bit too consensus to be honest. It’s a fantastic meme and hits many incredible narratives but it seems almost ‘too’ obvious. But still gonna fire and add.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, FARTCOIN is trading at $0.86, still within the trader’s accumulation zone. Besides FARTCOIN, the trader names two other altcoins on his radar for potential rallies. They include the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) and ai16z ( AI16Z ) – which claims to be an AI agent-staffed venture capital fund. Altcoin Sherpa also thinks that the bullish conditions in crypto will eventually return to rescue traders who are now trapped amid the market pullback. “If you’re underwater, all you have to do is wait a few more weeks and you’ll be saved by the market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and ADA holders shift to XYZ, a crypto gem ready for 9,600% growth. Table of Contents XYZ as the next big crypto contender Shiba Inu Cardano Conclusion Investors who once championed Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are eyeing a new cryptocurrency that could deliver astounding returns. This up-and-coming token is stirring excitement with projections of a possible 9,600% increase in value. XYZ as the next big crypto contender Unlike the short-lived hype of many meme coins that have buckled under selling pressure, the XYZ token is designed with staying power. Backed by a robust roadmap and a community of dedicated supporters, it has everything in place to not just survive but thrive in the competitive crypto market. XYZ is currently in its presale phase, offering early participants a chance to secure significant discounts before its price skyrockets. Starting at $0.0001, it has already reached $0.001333 in its current stage, delivering impressive returns for those who got in early. With a final target price of $0.1, the projected 7,400% growth is more than just speculation — it’s a calculated opportunity for massive profits. XYZVerse isn’t just about hype — it’s about delivering real value. Unlike many meme coins that falter after their initial surge, this project is built on a foundation of strong fundamentals. Audited smart contracts, a detailed roadmap, and upcoming listings on major exchanges ensure that this token has a clear path to success. For those looking to break away from the stagnation of SHIB and ADA, this gem offers a chance to be part of a new wave of growth. Interested investors can take the XYZ side via presale . You might also like: 5 altcoins on the verge of joining the top 10 with massive growth Shiba Inu Inspired by Dogecoin’s success, Shiba Inu runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange showing its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for an NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB’s approach sets it apart from other meme coins. While Dogecoin relies mainly on community and celebrity endorsements, SHIB aims to build a robust ecosystem. This makes it an interesting player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Cardano Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible, scalable blockchain designed for smart contracts. This means it can support decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. Its structure is also divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This boosts capacity, with the goal of potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. In the current market, ADA looks attractive due to its sustainable technology and growth potential. As more investors seek eco-friendly crypto options, Cardano stands out. While Ethereum is still dominant, Cardano’s advancements may position it as a strong alternative in the crypto landscape. Conclusion While SHIB and ADA remain solid choices, XYZVerse’s unique mix of sports and memes positions it for remarkable growth in the 2024 bull run.

Table of Contents Early Rollblock investors set to earn huge XRP sees progress Sui could benefit from Trump’s inauguration Rollblock stands out Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as a dominant crypto force, potentially surpassing XRP in 2025. Unlike SUI, Rollblock stands out with its play-to-earn online casino and robust tokenomics. Backed by a deflationary RBLK token model and growing popularity, Rollblock seeks to offer both immediate rewards and long-term potential. With analysts predict exponential growth for Rollblock, its unique blend of utility and earning potential positions it as a top contender in the crypto market. Early Rollblock investors set to earn huge Rollblock is the first Ethereum-based play-to-earn casino. The platform will host over 7000 casino games and thousands of players daily. Rollblock will feature traditional casino games, unique Web3 options, and live sports betting across dozens of countries, providing something for everyone. The RBLK token will power the Rollblock ecosystem. The platform’s deflationary model will use casino revenue to buy back and burn tokens weekly, reducing supply while redistributing a portion as staking rewards. This model strengthens tokenomics and ensures real utility. RBLK is priced at $0.044 in presale stage 9, and it’s generating excitement among investors as analysts anticipate an 800% value appreciation. Rollblock’s presale increases liquidity for its online casino and offers a sensational opportunity for early investors. Once the presale ends and the token is listed, holders will receive weekly dividends. You might also like: AI predicts this new altcoin to mimic XRP and Solana’s success XRP sees progress XRP is gaining momentum on the charts after a recent market correction. Its value has increased by 11.6% in the past week, mirroring the broader crypto market as Bitcoin climbs towards $100k. Analysts suggest that XRP could reach $3 if this momentum continues. A prominent analyst, XRP Whale, forecasts that XRP’s price might rally to $3.3 in the coming weeks. Their chart analysis shows XRP trading within an asymmetrical triangle, with the $2.5 level being a critical breakout point. Another expert, Mikybull Crypto, shared a bullish outlook, suggesting XRP’s next target could be $4. Technical indicators support these bullish predictions. The Hull Moving Average and VWMA both display buy signals, pointing to a potential surge. Beyond price action, Ripple’s XRP Ledger has hit a significant milestone. The ledger count exceeded 93 million and is set to surpass 100 million in the future. This milestone shows the adoption and utility of XRP within the crypto ecosystem. Sui could benefit from Trump’s inauguration SUI has been making significant strides, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) hitting $1.8 billion. Investors remain confident, reflecting “Extreme Greed” in market sentiment and maintaining consistent on-chain volumes between $400 million and $600 million. Currently trading near $4.13, analysts expect SUI to surge to $23.77 by 2030, driven by its adoption in DeFi and gaming. Recent market corrections caused SUI to drop by about 13% in the last week, mainly due to profit-taking and holiday-related withdrawals. This dip presents an opportunity to buy SUI at a lower price. Many believe that SUI is an ideal investment, especially with the upcoming inauguration of a pro-crypto US president on January 20th. This event could fuel the crypto bull run and push the market to new heights. Rollblock stands out The market is preparing for a bull run, and altcoins are suitable investment choices. Sui, XRP, and Rollblock could provide diversification and growth potential to crypto portfolios. Rollblock, in particular, offers a unique opportunity. Investors can purchase Rollblock directly from the platform’s website for $0.044. With its promising features and affordability, Rollblock stands out as a valuable addition for those seeking long-term crypto investments.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 01:52:00

Table of Contents Avalanche to hit $75 by February Sui about to overtake Shiba Inu Lunex Network raises over 5.6M in funding Top altcoins to watch A top analyst has predicted the value of Avalanche (AVAX) could reach $75 by January, which indicates a very bullish move. At the same time, Sui (SUI) might outshine Shiba Inu (SHIB) in terms of market cap in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the most exciting project analysts are bullish about is Lunex Network (LNEX) . They have tagged it the next 10x coin given its unique features and low market cap. Avalanche to hit $75 by February The ongoing market correction has affected Avalanche pushing it to former lows. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the crypto’s price has dipped by 8.50% on the weekly chart. AVAX is currently consolidating between $33.90 and $42.50. Nevertheless, analysts like Lucky predict the Avalanche price could reach between $150 and $200 in the coming months. AMCrypto told his followers the ongoing correction in the market was almost over. He forecasts the price of AVAX might rally to $75 by February 2025. Most of AVAX’s technical indicators are in the neutral zone. The relative strength index is currently moving close to the midline. Crossing this level could set Avalanche for a massive price rally. Sui about to overtake Shiba Inu The Sui coin is among the fastest-growing altcoins in the market right now. Sui has remained range-bound around its record high of $4.93 set last week. This rally pushed the market cap of the altcoin to $12 billion. The sustained increase in the Sui coin price has made it a contender to overtake Shiba Inu in terms of market capitalization. This close proximity makes Sui among the top crypto coins. CoinMarketCap data shows SUI’s value has dropped by 12.80% on the weekly chart. However, it is up 18.45% on the monthly level and 396.52% on the yearly timeframe. Ash Crypto forecast the value SUI could skyrocket to between $6 and $8 in the coming weeks. Another analyst called Mags noted the Sui crypto price might rally to $40 this cycle.

Solana Network Activity & LINK Price Rises,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-ama-reveals-major-plans-for-2025-solana-network-activity-link-price-rises/,"Solana’s network activity has reached unprecedented levels, with a transaction count of 67.77 million in a single day, showcasing robust user participation. At the same time, activity from Chainlink whales has increased significantly, with substantial transactions indicating a strong belief in its long-term value. In the middle of these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) remains a focal point. The latest AMA in December shared vital updates, such as new community initiatives and strategic plans for 2025. The presale for BDAG has been notably successful, gathering $174 million with 17.6 billion BDAG coins distributed to over 170,000 unique holders. As a top crypto coin to watch, BDAG is recognized for its innovative solutions to blockchain scalability and engaging its users effectively. Solana Network Activity Peaks with Record Transaction Volumes Transaction activity on the Solana network has demonstrated resilience, reaching a 12-month high with 67.77 million transactions processed in 24 hours. This surge in Solana network activity has sparked expectations of a positive market shift, especially as SOL’s price finds support within a crucial Fibonacci retracement range between $192.56 and $175.74. The Total Value Locked (TVL) has also hit an impressive 56.05 million SOL, indicating strong engagement within the ecosystem. Analysts believe the increasing Solana network activity could foster more natural demand, possibly aiding in SOL’s price recovery. With derivatives funding rates turning favorable and reduced spot market outflows, the enhanced network performance combined with supportive technical indicators suggests Solana might be setting up for an upcoming breakout. Are Chainlink Whales Preparing for a Significant Price Increase? Chainlink whales are on the move, undertaking substantial transactions that hint at an upcoming price surge. The latest figures show that nine new whale accounts have moved 362,380 LINK tokens, valued at over $8.19 million, from Binance in just two days. This move corresponds with a technical formation known as a double-bottom at $20.12, suggesting a bullish turn. Market watchers are targeting the $30 mark, predicting a 35% rise from its present valuation. On-chain dynamics are favorable, with rising transaction volumes and dwindling exchange reserves pointing to diminishing selling pressure. The accumulating actions of Chainlink whales, along with positive technical signs, reinforce the anticipation of a notable price recovery soon. BlockDAG’s AMA Showcases Project’s Success BlockDAG’s recent AMA session strengthened its commitment to a clear, community-focused approach. This session spanned topics such as sponsorships, upcoming exchange listings, improved support systems, and an official mainnet launch set for 2025. This user-oriented strategy is visible through community-led governance, where thousands contribute to key decisions. The project’s frequent AMAs foster a clear and open environment, enhancing trust and participation within the BlockDAG ecosystem. BlockDAG’s presale achievements are impressive, raising over $174 million and distributing more than 17.6 billion BDAG coins. Early adopters have seen substantial returns, achieving a 2240% ROI. With the current price at $0.0234 in batch 26, it presents an attractive opportunity for newcomers. As the presale approaches the next batch, the growing interest underscores BDAG as a top crypto coin to watch. Continuing with the tradition of community-driven AMAs, the latest in December highlights BlockDAG’s dedication to integrating community feedback into critical decisions. This approach, along with a successful presale, positions BlockDAG as a standout among crypto coins to watch. As the project nears significant exchange listings and unveils more of its ecosystem potential, the increasing excitement hints at a promising future for the platform and its expanding community. Top Crypto Coins to Watch Now Solana’s network activity illustrates the blockchain’s robustness with peak transaction numbers, while Chainlink whale movements suggest heightened interest from key players. Concurrently, BlockDAG keeps drawing attention with its presale surpassing $174 million and over 17.6 billion BDAG coins sold. The latest AMA spotlighted community-centric strategies and the awaited Mainnet launch in 2025, securing BlockDAG’s spot as one of the top crypto coins to watch . For those seeking a project with growth potential and strong community support, BlockDAG presents a compelling chance. With accelerated adoption and presale batches selling quickly, now might be the perfect time to secure BDAG before prices escalate.

Despite already being underperformed in the recent bull run, Ethereum has now experienced a notable correction, dropping to as low as below the $3,500 price level in recent weeks. While this price performance from ETH might have led investors to lose interest in Ethereum for now, recent data from the CryptoQuant platform suggests a possible turnaround, with key indicators pointing towards renewed market confidence. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Ready To Break Out? Key Indicators Suggest Strong Market Confidence Funding Rates Indicate Renewed Confidence Among Traders A CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanBTC, highlighted Ethereum’s futures market developments in a recent analysis titled “Ethereum Futures Market Signals Potential Rebound After $3K Correction.” The analysis from Shayan reveals that the futures funding rates, which act as a sentiment gauge for traders, have shown signs of stabilization after the price drop, hinting at a potential recovery. According to the analyst, Ethereum funding rates have shown an increase after the recent sharp correction, indicating a higher appetite among traders for long positions. Notably, funding rates are a mechanism in perpetual futures contracts where traders holding long positions pay short sellers, or vice versa, depending on market sentiment. When funding rates rise, it typically suggests that traders are leaning towards a bullish outlook. Shayan disclosed that the spike in funding rates implies increased demand for Ethereum at its current price level, signaling that traders expect a bounce-back from the $3,000 region. The analyst further explained that such behavior often precedes significant upward price movements, particularly when combined with a period of market consolidation. In his words: The recent spike in funding rates suggests an influx of buyers, which, if sustained, could drive a substantial bullish rebound. This renewed buying pressure has the potential to push Ethereum toward the crucial $4K resistance in the short to mid-term. Ethereum Market Performance After weeks of consistent decline, Ethereum currently trades at a price of $3,310, at the time of writing down by 1.5% in the past day. This market price marks a 32.2% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Interestingly despite the drop in ETH’s price, the asset has still managed to see a slight increase in trading volume in the past day.

On Binance, the token reached an intraday low of $1.99, showcasing the strong selling pressure currently endured by the crucial support level. XRP, which rallied 230% since November on hopes of Trump’s victory securing the regulatory free pass for the US crypto companies, has been seemingly stuck in a consolidation phase since the beginning of December after exhausting the bullish momentum from post-election euphoria. The rally, initially fueled by speculation around the possible resolution of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, can no longer be sustained in the absence of positive regulatory and policy development, and retesting the levels below $2 may not be out of the table for XRP in the near perspective. Not even Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin debut could drastically improve the situation, only resulting in a short-lived pump that failed to hold. For context, RLUSD launched XRP Ledger and Ethereum on December 17 and currently sits at a modest market cap of $53 million. Despite the early stage of adoption, RLUSD saw a sharp rise in trading volume that soared 191% over the last 24 hours. While RLUSD is enjoying the spotlight, XRP faced significant liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $4.46 million of long and $3.34 million worth of short positions wiped out as the price briefly dipped below $2 and then bounced back. The price decline coincides with a decrease in open interest, which currently stands at $1.9 billion, a far cry from $4.3 billion at the beginning of December, as per CoinGlass data. The combination of low XRP price and low OI suggests that traders are closing their positions, seemingly confirming the suspicion that the current price drop is driven by liquidations and profit-taking rather than bears betting against XRP. Should this be the case, the XRP price is likely to stabilize soon in the absence of sustained selling pressure. The exchange volume dropped as well to $3 billion over the past 24 hours, a 50% decline from a week ago. This reduced exchange volume, combined with shrinking open interest, points to waning interest from both bulls and bears amid the holiday-induced slowdown. As fever traders are active, there’s more room for potential volatility, since even modest buying or selling activity would be amplified by reduced market depth. While current indicators point to a rather short-lasting price slip, crypto analyst Dom maintains a rather bearish outlook, describing XRP's recent price action as “incredibly weak.” In their post on Twitter/X, the analyst explained that XRP risks a much more drastic drop in price if it falls into one of the so-called “liquidity voids,” the weak spots left behind if the price of an asset moves too quickly. During a strong bull run that XRP experienced in November, it didn’t have much time for the process of creating value, which happens when the price consolidates for some time at specific levels. The resulting areas of higher trading activity form “volume nodes” that often act as support or resistance. The current support at $1.90 for XRP holds the price from slipping into the liquidity void. However, it becomes weaker every time it is retested, so a slow grind-down through this key level may send XRP as low as t $1.60, the analyst estimates. Conversely, reclaiming the $2.40 resistance will likely trigger a new rally for the cryptocurrency. According to Dom, should BTC fall below $95,000, the odds of XRP breaking below $1.90 increase significantly. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $92.3k, down 1.33% over the last 24 hours. What does 2025 hold for XRP? Looking ahead, XRP’s next move will likely depend on renewed trading activity in early January, with Bitcoin’s performance shaping the direction for the altcoin till the Inauguration Day on January 20. After this date, traders’ attention will be focused on the policy changes brought by the new administration and developments in the Ripple vs SEC case. Among other potential catalysts for XRP price growth are Ripple’s IPO, XRP ETF approval, and the growing adoption of RLUSD. Ripple’s potential IPO, once postponed indefinitely due to the prolonged legal battle with the regulator, can be on the table again once the case is settled, which could boost both the company’s valuation and XRP’s credibility as a reliable investment. Similarly, the approval of an XRP-backed ETF would provide non-crypto-naive investors with hassle-free access to the asset, potentially driving billion inflows into the XRP market cap. Finally, the demand for RLUSD will strengthen the role of XRP as a bridge currency and allow the DeFi ecosystem of XRP Ledger to flourish.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 02:24:26

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. PropiChain (PCHAIN) predicted to outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) through its transformative platform. Table of Contents Dogecoin slides, liquidates long traders Analyst: PCHAIN will grow exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN could outperform DOGE in 2025 After an explosive rally starting in early November, Dogecoin (DOGE) is losing momentum after reaching a local high. This has prompted an analyst to pick PropiChain (PCHAIN) as one of the few altcoins that will surge in 2025. PropiChain is a real estate tokenization platform. The project is attracting investors eager to maximize profits in Q1 2025. One of its major selling points is its ability to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. With Dogecoin losing momentum, PCHAIN offers early investors potentially sustainable growth through its unique features and investor-driven tokenomics. Dogecoin slides, liquidates long traders Dogecoin has lost the momentum that took it to a high of $0.4759. The meme coin has lost 23.3% in the last 24 days. This has resulted in total liquidation reaching $11.18 million, with long position traders contributing $9.90 million. The waning momentum stems from low trading volume and market-wide decline. Analysts claim that Dogecoin could slide below $0.25 in Q1. With Dogecoin losing ground in the past weeks, holders are booking profits as they take a cautionary approach. Analysts say Dogecoin could underperform in 2025 if the altcoin season fails to kick in. Analyst: PCHAIN will grow exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN is a strong contender to earn investors substantial returns in 2025. The real estate altcoin is on course to surge 20,000%. At $0.011 during its ongoing token presale, early investors have a unique opportunity to earn massive returns. The altcoin has already raised over $1 million, a clear sign of its growing appeal. Investors are choosing PCHAIN, drawn by its approach to real estate tokenization . As a tokenization platform, PCHAIN will enable fractional ownership, allowing investors to own pieces of property. This model will democratize the market while allowing more investors to build wealth through real estate investments. Another key reason for PCHAIN’s growing appeal is its incorporation of AI features. With its AI-driven predictive market analysis, the platform will offer users valuable insights into future market trends, providing users with a competitive edge. You might also like: XRP price declines, but PropiChain gains momentum with its AI-powered real estate features Additionally, PCHAIN’s AI will be used in smart contract automation. This is an important feature that removes manual checks and intermediaries, making transactions faster and more efficient. It has made property management easier and is appreciated by property managers, landlords, and tenants. To keep the platform safe, BlockAudit has independently audited PropiChain’s smart contract. This builds trust among users and adds to its credibility. PCHAIN also ventures into the metaverse, seeking to offer users virtual property tours, staging, and meetings. This immersive technology will allow investors to scout properties remotely, saving users time and money. Furthermore, PCHAIN will turn to automated valuation models to offer AI-driven property appraisals. This feature will provide highly accurate, fair valuations free from human errors or bias. PropiChain’s users will benefit from receiving valuations that align with the current market conditions. PCHAIN could outperform DOGE in 2025 Dogecoin has enjoyed impressive gains in Q4 but has seen its momentum wane as the entire market goes into a downward correction. This is evidenced by Dogecoin losing 22% of its value in the past month. On the other hand, PCHAIN is just beginning its upward trajectory. Early investors gained 200% when its presale progressed from the first round to the second. That is not all. The project’s tokenomics and transformative features will help early investors potentially earn 20,000% gains, prompting whales and smart money to invest in its ongoing token presale. PCHAIN has been listed on CoinMarketCap. This has played a key role in showing investors that the project can be trusted. Analysts boldly claim that the project is set to hit its major milestones.

Today, December 31, 2024, alongside XRP, the majority of assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), seem to be bleeding and raising concerns about when the price decline will pause. XRP Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has recently broken out of a descending triangle price action pattern and has shifted market sentiment. Meanwhile, the daily chart shows that XRP has successfully retested the breakdown level, potentially confirming that its price decline could continue until support is found. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment remains unchanged, XRP could drop another 10% to 12%, reaching the support level at the $1.83 mark. Hundred Million Worth XRP Outflow Despite this bearish outlook, traders’ and investors’ interest in the asset remains optimistic, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP’s spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of XRP tokens over the past few days. Source: Coinglass The outflow is an on-chain metric that reveals how much of the asset is being transferred from exchanges to unknown wallets, potentially indicating buying pressure and an ideal buying opportunity. Combining this on-chain metric with technical analysis, it appears that XRP is bearish in the short term. However, investors seem to be accumulating, indicating that they view this price decline as an opportunity to buy the dip. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.03, having experienced a price decline of over 4.5% in the last 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume surged by 90%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid the price decline.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-31 03:09:33

As of December 25, 2024, Cardano’s ADA token is trading at approximately $0.911857 USD, reflecting a slight decrease of 3.38% from the previous close. Latest Developments Cardano has recently implemented several Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) aimed at enhancing the network’s functionality. Notably, CIP-33 introduces reference scripts that can be attached to outputs, streamlining the validation process and reducing transaction sizes. Additionally, CIP-40 introduces collateral outputs, a new type of output designed to improve the overall scalability of the network. Why Did This Coin Make it to This List? Cardano’s continuous development and commitment to scalability and sustainability make it a strong contender for investment in December 2024. 3. Litecoin (LTC): The Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold Litecoin has long been considered the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, offering faster transaction times and a more efficient mining process. As of December 25, 2024, Litecoin’s LTC token is trading at approximately $108.46 USD, with a slight decrease of 1.37% from the previous close. Latest Developments Litecoin has recently seen increased adoption, with several major exchanges listing LTC and offering trading pairs with various fiat currencies. This increased accessibility has contributed to a rise in trading volume and market cap. Additionally, Litecoin’s integration into various payment platforms has enhanced its utility as a medium of exchange. Why Did This Coin Make it to This List? Litecoin’s established presence in the market, combined with its recent developments and increased adoption, solidify its position as a top cryptocurrency to consider for investment in December 2024. Conclusion Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics, Cardano, and Litecoin each present unique opportunities for investors in December 2024. Qubetics’ innovative solutions to blockchain interoperability, Cardano’s commitment to scalability and sustainability, and Litecoin’s established market presence and recent developments make them worthy considerations for your investment portfolio. As always, it’s essential to conduct thorough research and consider your financial goals before making investment decisions.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 03:17:00

Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Seen A Decline Recently The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst This metric takes into account for the data of five factors in order to calculate its value: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. When the value of the index is greater than 53, it means the sentiment shared by the majority of the investors is that of greed. On the other hand, it being under 47 implies fear is dominant in the sector. Naturally, the indicator being between these two cutoffs suggests a net neutral mentality. Now, here is how the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is like at the moment: As is visible above, the latest value of the indicator is 65, which implies the investors share a sentiment of greed. This is a sharp decrease from where the metric was yesterday, as the below chart shows. Even ignoring the decrease in the past day, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been going downhill for a while now. The reason behind this worsening in the sentiment is the price decline that BTC has been going through lately. The index’s value was 73 yesterday, which is quite close to a special region known as the extreme greed. The market is said to be holding this sentiment when the index is at 75 or higher. For most of this month, the indicator has actually been inside this zone, as a result of the hype of the cryptocurrency exploring new highs above the $100,000 mark. Historically, Bitcoin has actually tended to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting, with the probability of such a contrary move occurring only growing the more the investors become sure about a side. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators Extreme greed is a territory where tops have often occurred for the BTC price as this likelihood is the strongest there. There is a similar region for the fear side as well, called extreme fear and occurring at 25 or lower. With the Bitcoin sentiment seeing a notable decline recently, the asset’s price may no longer be at risk of seeing another major correction. The sentiment is still that of greed, however, so another rally may also not be too likely to happen. BTC Price Bitcoin has furthered its drawdown in the last 24 hours, with its price now dropping to $91,900.

38330046,https://square.htx.com/?p=42272,1735616674,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,Launch of the HTX DAO Forum: A New Dawn for Exchange Governance,https://square.htx.com/launch-of-the-htx-dao-forum/,"In December 2024, HTX DAO announced the official launch of its governance forum, ushering in a new era of innovation for global crypto community governance. This move represents more than just a new feature; it also marked a historic step for exchanges, transitioning from traditional centralized management towards decentralized autonomous governance model. *Forum Link: https://htxdao.discourse.group/ The Significance and Features of the HTX DAO Forum The forum serves as a vital bridge between community members and the decentralized governance structure. Key functions include: 1. Platform for Proposals and Discussions: The forum provides a public platform for users to submit governance proposals and engage in discussions. 2. Transparent Governance Mechanisms: By keeping a record of all proposals and discussions, the forum ensures a fully transparent governance process. Users can review the context and rationale behind every decision to ensure fair governance. 3. Development of HTX Improvement Proposals (HIPs): The forum acts as the breeding ground for proposal drafts. This is where users exchange ideas, build consensus, and refine proposals before they are put to the vote. In short, the HTX DAO Forum is the central hub of the decentralized governance ecosystem, seamlessly integrating users with the governance system. This fosters a transparent, efficient, and user-driven environment for HTX DAO’s growth. HTX DAO Reshapes the Relationship Between Exchange and Users The HTX DAO Forum is more than just a tool; it marks a paradigm shift in the relationship between the HTX exchange and its users. By granting decision-making power to $HTX token holders, the platform transitions from a pure financial service provider to a collaborative community governed hub. Exchange governance evolves from a one-way service model to collaborative participation, where user proposals and needs are embedded into the platform’s operations. This shift from a “service provider” to a “co-governor” repositions the exchange as a genuine Web3 organization, which leverages decentralized technology to build an open, transparent, and community-driven ecosystem. Unlike traditional institutions, Web3 prioritizes user autonomy, collective decision-making, and equitable sharing, allowing every participant to share in the ecosystem’s growth. This represents the nascent stage of a crypto finance hub in the metaverse, a future financial ecosystem belonging solely to the crypto ecosystem. Diverse Possibilities for Exchange Governance The launch of the HTX DAO Forum opens doors for community collaboration and multifaceted innovation. From proposing governance initiatives to steering ecosystem development, every user can play a pivotal role. This bottom-up approach will unleash the community’s collective wisdom and creativity. Potential Application Extensions 1. Ecosystem Incubator : Forum members can initiate proposals for new project incubation, such as launching a meme coin mining campaign on a specific blockchain or developing a feature deeply integrated with GameFi. Once approved through community voting, HTX DAO can provide startup capital or technical support for these projects. 2. Inter-Community Collaboration : The HTX DAO Forum can serve as a bridge for collaboration beyond the HTX ecosystem. For instance, it can facilitate joint proposals among various DAOs to tackle industry challenges or develop innovative financial tools. 3. Public Welfare and Social Responsibility : HTX DAO community members can propose allocating a portion of trading fees to blockchain education or environmental protection projects. These philanthropic initiatives not only improve the platform’s social image but also allow users to feel a sense of involvement. Envisioning the Future of Crypto Exchanges The launch of the HTX DAO Forum marks just the beginning of a new era of exchange governance. Here’s a glimpse into how HTX DAO will evolve: 1. Feature Optimization and Expansion : More governance modules will be introduced, such as smart proposal screening, real-time community feedback, on-chain decision visualization tools, and a more democratic token-based voting mechanism, to enhance user experience. 2. Ecosystem Development : HTX DAO is rooted in the exchange and built upon future ecosystem players like TRON and HTX. With highly scalable businesses, the ecosystem will gradually explore more utility-driven services. 3. Global Community Expansion : It actively attracts users from various cultures and regions, offering multilingual support and fostering an environment conducive to cross-regional collaboration. Through these initiatives, the exchange will gradually transition from a traditional financial intermediary to a digital economic ecosystem where users jointly govern and share in benefits. Possible Future Scenarios: 1. A Fully Autonomous Exchange : In the future, the role of the exchange’s management team could diminish, with most operational decisions made autonomously by the community. HTX DAO would become a fully decentralized ecosystem where all rules are transparently executed via on-chain governance. 2. Users as Governors : Every user could earn “governance credits” based on their contributions, building up governance capacity and decision-making power within the community. This mechanism encourages deeper user participation for continuous platform optimization. 3. AI-Assisted Governance Decision-Making : The integration of AI will enable the HTX DAO Forum to incorporate AI analysis tools to support governance decisions. For example, AI can simulate the potential outcomes of proposals based on market data, helping users make more informed voting choices. Conclusion: Starting a New Chapter in Decentralized Finance The launch of the HTX DAO Forum is not just a functional update but a groundbreaking leap forward in the governance model for the crypto industry. It outlines a vision for decentralized, transparent, and user-centric governance for exchanges. This initiative by HTX DAO sets a precedent for the industry’s future development, leading the crypto world toward a new era of more democratic and efficient governance. The future of exchange governance will no longer be dictated by a select few, but driven by every user. This transformation is not just technological but a fundamental shift in mindset and power dynamics. And it all begins with the HTX DAO Forum.

MicroStrategy announced the acquisition just an hour before Nasdaq trading began at 2:30 pm UTC. Within the first hour, its shares dropped 5.3%, falling from $318.89 to $302.09. While partially recovering during the session to close at $302.96, the stock declined another 3.19% in after-hours trading, settling at $293.59, according to Google Finance data. Bitcoin Purchases and Stock Dilution MicroStrategy funded the Bitcoin acquisition by selling 592,987 shares earlier that week, according to a regulatory filing. This marked the eighth consecutive week the company bought Bitcoin, adding 194,180 BTC to its holdings since Oct. 31. Concerns are growing about the company’s financial strategy, with The Kobeissi Letter noting in a Dec. 30 post on X that MicroStrategy’s plan to increase authorized shares by $10 billion has raised alarms. The firm’s heavy reliance on convertible notes and debt issuances leaves it needing to issue more debt or equity to sustain its Bitcoin buying spree. “The problem is, it has left the company in a ‘lose-lose’ situation for now,” Kobeissi added. Market Reactions and Predictions Despite a 20.18% decline in MSTR’s price over the past 30 days, the stock remains up 342.15% since Jan. 1. Hartmann Capital founder Felix Hartmann suggested in a Dec. 30 post that MicroStrategy’s stock could “eventually implode,” though he acknowledged the possibility of significant short-term gains. Unchained head of market research Joe Burnett described the company’s strategy as “hyperbitcoinization,” highlighting its use of leverage to grow Bitcoin-per-share. On Dec. 23, MicroStrategy was added to the Nasdaq-100 index, joining Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise as new additions to Nasdaq’s largest stocks by market capitalization.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 04:13:28

A tweet from the WallStreetBets community captured the debate surrounding XRP’s recent performance and potential trajectory. The tweet stated , “XRP just pulled a 250% glow-up, eyeing $8 if crypto hits $5T.” This optimistic prediction elicited mixed responses from the crypto community, highlighting both bullish enthusiasm and skepticism. $XRP just pulled a 250% glow-up, eyeing $8 if crypto hits $5T — wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) December 27, 2024 Current State of XRP At the time of the tweet, XRP was trading at $2.19, reflecting a significant $0.86 increase in the last 24 hours. While the gain is notable, it falls short of the 250% growth suggested in the tweet. To achieve a 250% increase, XRP has to rise from approximately $2.19 to $7.66—a scenario that has not occurred within this recent cycle. The discrepancy between the actual performance and the claim underscores the importance of fact-checking in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency speculation. Crypto Community Reactions The responses to the WallStreetBets tweet provide insight into the diverse perspectives within the crypto space. Silence Dogood, a responder, outright dismissed the notion of XRP reaching $8 soon. They wrote , “No it’s not… at all. It’ll never hit 8. Not this cycle or the next.” This reflects a sentiment shared by many who view XRP’s growth potential as limited due to its historical performance and market dynamics. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Mr. NTWEK, responded with humor, stating, “Nice! Thanks for the laugh.” Such comments highlight the skepticism and often playful nature of discussions within the cryptocurrency community, particularly regarding bold predictions. A user named Amer provided a more grounded perspective, noting , “No it did not. It’s currently at $2.19. Nowhere near its all-time high and has largely been a poor performer unless you invested back in November.” This response emphasizes XRP’s performance in the broader context of its historical price trends and market cycles. XRP Path to $8 For XRP to reach $8, it would require a substantial shift in market dynamics, including an overall crypto market capitalization of $5 trillion, as suggested in the original tweet. While the global crypto market has experienced rapid growth, reaching $5 trillion would depend on widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and continued innovation in blockchain technologies. Historically, XRP’s price has been influenced by market sentiment, legal challenges its affiliated company faces, and its utility as a digital asset. Although XRP has seen considerable adoption in cross-border payments, its performance has often lagged behind other major cryptocurrencies, limiting its appeal to some investors.

He said Hong Kong could use foreign exchange funds to acquire and hold BTC in the long term. BTC as Reserve Asset in Hong Kong Jiexhuang told Wen Wei Po that adding BTC to Hong Kong’s fiscal reserves could encourage the development of the local crypto industry, attract talent and investment, and increase transaction stamp tax revenue. Taking advantage of China’s one country, two systems policy, including BTC in Hong Kong’s reserves, could offer the region a first-mover advantage and help authorities reduce economic disruptions caused by broader adoption of the asset in traditional markets. “If major economic powers take the initiative to include Bitcoin in strategic reserves, the value of Bitcoin will be more stable, causing more and more other countries to follow suit and reduce their holdings of traditional assets. This will result in the fall of the price of traditional assets and will shrink the government’s fiscal reserves holding traditional assets,” Jiexhuang said. While the politician noted the benefits of buying and holding BTC, he also noted the risks associated with investing in the asset. He advised Hong Kong authorities to allocate a small percentage of the national reserves to the asset, starting with Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He urged the government to study the impact of the United States’ spot Bitcoin ETF market on the country’s finance industry and act accordingly. Notably, Hong Kong already has a spot Bitcoin ETF market; however, its inflows are pale in comparison to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Following Trump’s Steps Jiexhuang is not the first lawmaker to propose including BTC in Hong Kong’s reserves; another legislative council member, Johnny Ng, did the same in July 2024. Ng’s suggestion followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s vow to create a national Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year. Both politicians believe Trump’s proposal to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States could have a major impact on traditional markets and insist Hong Kong could be positioned as a financial hub promoting such technological advancements. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Germany are also proposing the adoption of BTC as the country’s reserve asset.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 04:35:00

Meanwhile, in Europe, MoonPay has become one of the first crypto firms to secure a license under the European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, signaling a new era of regulatory clarity and compliance for crypto businesses operating in the bloc. New York Judge Delays CFTC v. Gemini Trial, Raising Stakes Amid Political Transition A New York judge has postponed the start of the civil trial between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Gemini Trust Company. Initially set for Jan. 13, 2025, the trial will now commence on Jan. 21, according to a Dec. 30 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Alvin Hellerstein emphasized that “no further adjournments will be granted.” The decision places the trial’s opening under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, raising questions about potential shifts in regulatory attitudes toward the crypto industry. The case, filed in June 2022, centers on allegations that Gemini provided false or misleading statements to the CFTC during its 2017 bid to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. The CFTC has accused Gemini of violating the Commodity Exchange Act and has sought substantial penalties, including disgorgement of alleged ill-gotten gains, civil monetary fines, and injunctive measures to prevent further violations. This trial represents a pivotal moment for the CFTC’s enforcement strategy in the crypto space. Over the past year, the agency has aggressively targeted major players in the industry, securing over $17 billion in monetary relief during the 2024 fiscal year, primarily through enforcement actions against firms like FTX, Celsius, and Binance. Judge Hellerstein provided no specific rationale for the six-day delay, though its timing aligns with two significant political events: the inauguration of President-elect Trump on Jan. 20 and the start of the new session of Congress on Jan. 3. Both developments could influence the regulatory and legislative landscape surrounding the crypto industry. The shift in presidential administrations brings the potential for a change in tone at the CFTC. Current Chairman Rostin Behnam, appointed during President Biden’s tenure, is expected to serve until June 2026. However, reports suggest that Trump may consider replacing Behnam with a more crypto-friendly appointee. Such a move could significantly impact not only the CFTC’s approach to the Gemini case but also the broader regulatory framework for digital assets. The CFTC, alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been at the forefront of crypto regulation in the United States. While the SEC has focused on defining digital assets as securities, the CFTC has asserted jurisdiction over commodities, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The outcome of the Gemini trial could set a critical precedent for how regulators enforce compliance in the nascent crypto industry. Additionally, Congress may play a key role in clarifying the respective roles of the SEC and CFTC through proposed legislation. Such clarity could empower the CFTC to expand its influence, especially if Trump’s administration adopts a more favorable stance toward crypto innovation. What’s at Stake for Gemini? For Gemini , founded by the Winklevoss twins, the stakes are high. The exchange has positioned itself as a trusted player in the crypto market, emphasizing regulatory compliance and user security. A loss in court could result in substantial financial penalties and reputational damage, undermining its efforts to distinguish itself in a highly competitive industry. However, a favorable outcome could bolster Gemini’s standing as a compliant and innovative platform, potentially paving the way for broader adoption of its services, including Bitcoin futures contracts. The delay of the CFTC v. Gemini trial adds another layer of complexity to an already intricate legal and regulatory landscape. With Trump’s administration poised to take office, industry observers will be closely monitoring whether his appointments and policies signal a shift toward a more accommodating environment for crypto firms. The trial’s outcome could reverberate across the industry, influencing the strategies of both regulators and market participants. As the US grapples with how to balance innovation with consumer protection, the case shows the importance of clear and consistent regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The postponement of the CFTC v. Gemini trial sheds light on the interplay between legal proceedings, regulatory oversight, and political dynamics in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry. With billions of dollars and the industry’s credibility at stake, all eyes will be on the courtroom come Jan. 21, as the trial unfolds against the backdrop of a new presidential administration and potentially shifting regulatory priorities. MoonPay Secures MiCA License in the Netherlands: A Major Milestone for Crypto Regulation in the EU MoonPay, a leading provider of crypto payment solutions, has announced a significant regulatory milestone: the company has been approved to operate as a licensed cryptocurrency business in the Netherlands under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. The announcement, made on Dec. 30, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of crypto regulation within the EU. In its Dec. 30 statement, MoonPay revealed that the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets had granted the firm a license in accordance with MiCA regulations. With this approval, MoonPay will continue to provide fiat-to-crypto on-ramps and crypto-to-fiat off-ramps, reinforcing its role as a critical infrastructure provider for the crypto ecosystem. Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and CEO of MoonPay, celebrated the development as a “pivotal step in solidifying the crypto industry’s role in the global economy.” The approval positions MoonPay as one of the first crypto firms to operate under the MiCA framework, setting a precedent for other companies navigating the complex regulatory environment. MiCA: Transforming the EU’s Crypto Landscape The European Union’s MiCA framework represents one of the most comprehensive regulatory efforts globally to address the crypto industry. First adopted in 2023, MiCA aims to harmonize regulations across the EU’s member states, providing a unified framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs). Dec. 30 marked the end of MiCA’s implementation phase, ushering in an 18-month transitional period. During this transitional phase, companies already compliant with existing local regulations may continue operating while awaiting their MiCA licenses. These ”grandfathered” firms can maintain operations until July 2026 or until national authorities make final decisions regarding their licenses. MiCA’s regulatory scope includes provisions for stablecoins, asset-backed tokens, and crypto service providers. As of June 2024, stablecoins have been under scrutiny, leading some exchanges to delist Tether’s USDT in response to compliance requirements. MoonPay’s license approval signals the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry and its integration into traditional financial systems. By obtaining a MiCA license, MoonPay strengthens its foothold in the European market, building trust with users and regulators alike. The license not only ensures compliance but also opens doors for MoonPay to expand its offerings. The company has already gained prominence for its fiat-to-crypto infrastructure, partnering with major players like PayPal to provide seamless services to users in the US, UK, and EU. Reports of MoonPay’s discussions to acquire Helio Pay for $150 million further highlight its ambitions to scale operations and diversify its service portfolio. This move could potentially enhance MoonPay’s position as a leading provider of crypto payment solutions globally. The introduction of MiCA signals a new era for cryptocurrency regulation in the European Union. By establishing clear and consistent rules, the framework aims to foster innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market stability. MiCA’s impact is already evident. Stablecoin issuers and exchanges have had to adjust to its requirements, while firms like MoonPay are leveraging the framework to demonstrate compliance and build legitimacy. The transitional period until mid-2026 offers a window of opportunity for companies to adapt, but it also places pressure on regulators and businesses to align with the new standards. MoonPay’s achievement in obtaining a MiCA license suggests there is an increasing globalization of crypto regulations. As jurisdictions like the EU take the lead in establishing comprehensive frameworks, other regions may look to MiCA as a model for balancing innovation with regulatory oversight. The regulatory clarity provided by MiCA could encourage more institutional participation in the crypto market, as firms gain confidence in a well-regulated environment. For MoonPay, this represents not just a regulatory victory but also a strategic advantage as the firm continues to expand its services and partnerships. MoonPay’s MiCA approval in the Netherlands marks a significant milestone for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry. As the EU embarks on its transitional phase under MiCA, the framework’s success could serve as a blueprint for global crypto regulation. For MoonPay, the license solidifies its position as a key player in the European crypto market and sets the stage for future growth. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, MoonPay’s proactive approach to compliance could position it as a leader in driving innovation and trust in the crypto space.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 04:39:42

This regulatory framework, which took effect on December 30, 2024, has profound implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Europe and potentially beyond. Here, we analyze Williams’ claims, provide context, and assess his suggested solutions. What is MICAr? MICAr is the European Union’s comprehensive regulation governing cryptocurrency markets. The regulation establishes a licensing regime for cryptocurrency businesses and introduces stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. It is part of the EU’s broader effort to provide clear legal frameworks for digital assets, ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and market integrity. Key provisions include: Travel Rule Compliance: Cryptocurrency businesses must collect and share identifying information about both the sender and recipient of all transactions, regardless of their size. Universal Wallet KYC: Both hot and cold wallets will require identity verification, providing authorities with complete visibility into user transactions. Stablecoin Delisting: Certain stablecoins, including USDT , will be delisted from many EU exchanges, likely due to non-compliance with regulatory standards. Implications for Crypto Users Williams emphasizes the far-reaching consequences of MICAr, particularly its impact on user privacy and the foundational principles of cryptocurrency. The mandatory sharing of personal data across exchanges raises significant concerns about data security, as centralized data pools become increasingly vulnerable to leaks and misuse. Additionally, the requirement to link identities to non-custodial wallets undermines the decentralized and private financial control that cryptocurrency was designed to offer. Furthermore, the delisting of USDT introduces the risk of disrupting trading and liquidity for European users, effectively steering them toward compliant alternatives like USDC . Williams also criticizes the narrative driving these regulations, arguing that they serve traditional financial institutions by discouraging decentralized alternatives. He claims that offline wallets do not inherently increase risks of criminal activity, as they lack fiat on-ramps, making these measures excessive and invasive. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Workarounds and Recommendations Williams suggests practical solutions for users to maintain control over their assets: Non-KYC Exchanges: Moving funds to non-KYC platforms like Toobit can help users avoid the new regulatory restrictions. However, users should exercise caution when using lesser-known platforms to ensure security and compliance with applicable laws. Offline Wallets: Utilizing fresh, unlinked cold wallets gives users more control over their privacy, although this may require additional steps to manage funds effectively. Mike Williams’ insights underscore the transformative and controversial nature of MICAr. While the regulation aims to bring transparency and accountability to the crypto industry, it also raises legitimate concerns about privacy, data security, and user autonomy. As the regulatory landscape evolves, crypto users must stay informed, adapt their strategies, and carefully consider how best to safeguard their assets and privacy. For now, Williams’ thread serves as both a wake-up call and a guide for those navigating the shifting tides of cryptocurrency regulation in Europe and beyond.

Judge Alvin Hellerstein announced on December 30 that the trial will now start on January 21, emphasizing that “no further adjournments will be granted.” The six-day delay pushes the trial into the new presidential administration, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office on January 20. Delay Could Benefit Crypto Firms The shift could have implications for the CFTC’s stance on Gemini and other cryptocurrency firms, as regulatory priorities may evolve under new leadership. Judge Hellerstein did not provide specific reasons for the date change. The case, filed in June 2022, accuses Gemini of providing false or misleading information to the CFTC regarding its 2017 bid to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. The commission is seeking financial penalties, the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and other measures to prevent future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The trial’s timing coincides with heightened discussions in Washington about cryptocurrency regulation. A new Congress convenes on January 3, and pending legislation could further define the roles of the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in overseeing the crypto industry. Crypto in the court, more trial date movements, in CFTC v. Gemini Trust Company, the trial previously scheduled to begin on Jan 13, 2025 is hereby adjourned to Jan 21, no further adjournments will be granted. Inner City Press on the case(s) pic.twitter.com/TzEWE8tnZW — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) December 30, 2024 The CFTC’s current chairman, Rostin Behnam, whose term ends in 2026, could face replacement under the Trump administration, potentially influencing the regulator’s approach to crypto enforcement. The CFTC has been active in pursuing crypto firms for alleged violations, including actions against FTX, Celsius, and Binance. In its 2024 fiscal report, the agency disclosed over $17 billion in monetary recoveries, largely from enforcement efforts targeting cryptocurrency companies. Gemini Gains Preliminary Approval From Singapore Regulator In October, Gemini secured in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s financial regulator. The preliminary nod allows Gemini to offer cross-border money transfer and digital payment token services. “While the US remains our largest market and global headquarters, Asia and Singapore in particular play a crucial role in our global strategy,” Saad Ahmed, who oversees Gemini’s operations in the Asia-Pacific region, said. With a footprint in around 70 countries, Singapore stands out as Gemini’s second-largest market by customer base. It trails only the US. The expansion efforts come as regulatory pressures have intensified in the domestic market. Ahmed said that Singapore is important in Gemini’s regional ambitions, noting that the city-state will serve as the company’s Asia-Pacific hub. “We are building the required capabilities here to drive operations across the region,” he added. In 2022, the Singapore regulator said that Gemini Trust Company had an exemption from licensing . At the same time, Genesis Asia Pacific, a subsidiary of Genesis Group, was granted an in-principle approval to offer DPT. Furthermore, Gemini was awarded a crypto license by the French watchdog Autorite des marches financiers in January.

Here’s What Experts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-poised-for-a-bullish-q1-2025-heres-what-experts-say/,"Ethereum (ETH) – the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – may finally seize its moment in Q1 2025. Crypto experts have taken to X to share their analyses of a potentially bullish start to the new year for ETH. Ethereum Bullish Price Action In Q1 2025? Although Ethereum is up by almost 43% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, its performance pales in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC) which has appreciated by more than 115% in the same period. In addition, various alternative Layer-1 blockchains, such as Solana (SOL) and SUI have vastly outperformed ETH throughout 2024. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs Witness Unbroken 16-Day Inflow Streak: New ETH ATH Soon? However, the momentum may soon shift in ETH’s favor, as experts suggest that Q1 2025 could mark a bullish phase for the world’s leading smart contract platform. According to crypto analyst Crypto Bullet, ETH appears to be forming a bullish pennant on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $6,000 expected by March 2025. Similarly, cryptocurrency expert Anup Dhungana highlighted another bullish pattern forming on the weekly chart. He pointed to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern – a widely recognized bullish indicator that suggests an impending price surge. Based on Dhungana’s analysis, ETH could soar to as high as $8,000 by May 2025. However, he also warned that the digital asset may first experience a dip to $2,800 before reaching new all-time highs (ATH). Veteran crypto analyst Quinten Francois also shared an interesting perspective. He noted that ETH has historically recorded exceptional gains during Q1 of the year following a US presidential election. If this historical pattern holds, Q1 2025 could be extraordinarily bullish for Ethereum. ETH Staking To Create Supply Crunch? In addition, Galaxy Research shared some price predictions about Ethereum heading into 2025, saying that the digital asset will trade above $5,500 in 2025 due to potentially favorable regulations surrounding staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory Galaxy Research also projected that Ethereum’s staking rate will surpass 50%, creating a supply crunch that could trigger a sharp price increase. The firm explained: The Trump administration is likely to offer greater regulatory clarity and guidance for the crypto industry in the U.S. Among other outcomes, it is likely that spot-based ETH ETPs will be allowed to stake some percentage of the ETH they hold on behalf of shareholders. Demand for staking will continue to rise next year, and likely exceed half of Ethereum circulating supply by the end of 2025, which will prompt Ethereum developers to more seriously consider changes to network monetary policy. Additionally, Galaxy Research suggested that the ETH/BTC trading pair will close 2025 trading above 0.06, buoyed by anticipated regulatory tailwinds. A rise in this trading pair from its current lows of approximately 0.03 could serve as a catalyst for the much-awaited altseason. Recent analysis by crypto analyst Carl Runefelt also foresees a big move for ETH at the beginning of the new year. At press time, ETH trades at $3,345, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

Investors worry that the company will take on too much debt for these purchases. The Bitcoin purchase happened just an hour before the Nasdaq opened at 2:30 pm UTC. In that hour, MicroStrategy’s stock fell 5.3% from $318.89 to $302.09. Source: Google Finance Some stocks recovered during the day but closed at $302.96. According to Google Finance data , the shares then fell another 3.19%, ending at $293.59. Concern is growing about MicroStrategy’s plan to raise its number of authorized shares According to the recent filing, the company disclosed its sale of 592,987 to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. It’s the eighth consecutive week that MicroStrategy has bought Bitcoin. According to the firm, it has spent 194,180 BTC since October 31, bringing the total amount to 2,093,180 BTC. There is growing concern about MicroStrategy’s plan to raise its number of authorized shares by $10 billion. In a December 30 X post, the Kobeissi Letter shared that the market was uneasy with this move. Something doesn't add up here: MicroStrategy, $MSTR , has been known as the most popular ""levered"" #Bitcoin play of the year. Meanwhile, over the last month Bitcoin has gained +2% while $MSTR is currently down nearly -50%. What is happening? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 MicroStrategy has also borrowed a lot of money from convertible notes and debt issuances, explains Kobeissi. The company may need to borrow even more money or issue even more shares to keep buying Bitcoin. If the proposal is approved, the total number of shares could rise from 330 million to 10.33 billion. This is a difficult situation for the company, with risks on both sides.

In an article dubbed “ Trump Truth,” Hayes outlined his bearish outlook, saying that the crypto market had high expectations about the Trump Presidency. However, the administration would likely not enact policies as quickly as the market anticipated. “The market will instantly wake up to the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th. This realization will lead to a vicious sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades,” Hayes stated. According to the analyst, the US political landscape could also curtail the speed at which the Trump administration fulfills its campaign promises. This is because if Republicans fail to maintain the majority during the 2026 mid-term elections, it could cripple the efforts of the Trump administration. Past policies might hinder change Hayes also noted that the US administration was still dealing with the effects of poor monetary policies. Therefore, if friendly crypto policies fail to come into effect as fast as the market anticipates, traders could begin to dump. Furthermore, the issues that led to Trump and the Republican party getting overwhelming support during the November 5 elections were still in play and could not be solved immediately. “I don’t believe the markets realize how little time Trump actually has to accomplish anything,” he added. “The issues that gave rise to Trump’s popularity are decades in the making. As such, there are no immediate solutions regardless of what Elon Musk tells you on X.” Due to these factors, Hayes believes the market will dump around the inauguration on January 20. However, if the market continues to rally beyond this date, this bearish thesis will be defeated, and the current bull market will extend. Plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve While speaking during the 2024 Bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set up a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a bill to set up this reserve. Hayes has opined that it is unlikely that the US will directly purchase Bitcoin. However, if these purchases were to happen, it could bode well for BTC’s fiat price. “If the US government creates more dollars via a gold devaluation and uses some of those dollars to buy Bitcoin, its fiat price will rise. This will in turn spur competitive sovereign purchases by other nations who have to play catchup with the US,” he added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 05:08:14

This follows recent bullish price projections above $250 as traders align for positive movement next year. More institutional investors have rolled out Solana products with expectations of spot SOL ETF approvals in the United States. Crypto asset manager Bitwise has launched a Solana Staking Exchange Traded Product (ETP), adding to its growing list of institutional solutions. The product was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra venue and is set to provide institutional-grade exposure to the network’s native crypto, SOL. Trading under the ticker BSOL, the product will give more rewards than previous options, going as high as 6.4%. Staking has become popular among institutional investors in search of more gains in the ecosystem. This year, several traditional investors tipped Ethereum for having the most potential due to its staking features. “ Bitwise today announced the listing of its new Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (Ticker: BSOL, ISIN: DE000A4A59D2) on Xetra, providing institutional-grade total return exposure to Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL. With an innovative staking mechanism engineered to deliver significantly higher rewards compared to other Solana staking ETPs, BSOL reaffirms Bitwise’s position as a leader in the fast-growing crypto asset market.” Bitwise Set Sights On Expansion According to the release, BSOL offers low-cost ownership and high staking returns. While it offers 6,48%, 21Shares, its EU competitor, gives 5.49%. The product also has a management fee lower than the competition. Its fees stand at 0.85%, while others are slightly higher. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted the company’s vision to expand its products for more opportunities in the crypto market. This is the company’s third staking ETP this year, with previous Ethereum and Aptos products launched in February and November. Bitwise has seen significant success growth with over $12 billion in assets as institutional investors pour into the space. Meanwhile, all eyes have turned to anticipated Solana ETFs in the United States. Solana’s price projection continues above old levels with more adoption and whale accumulations. This year, the asset outperformed altcoin rivals like Ethereum after it recorded a string of weekly inflows. Solana meme coins have also played a huge role in the ecosystem’s surge, with tokens dominating the space.

Crypto bulls and market participants highly anticipate next year’s run, citing macro factors and increasing institutional appetite. Most users also tip favorable United States catalyst as the biggest driver next year. A new Bitfinex report on the crypto market outlook for 2025 points to a bullish Bitcoin price soaring up to $200,000. The exchange highlights institutional demand as a key metric for price action. This year, institutional flows tapped new highs with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. So far, these funds have attracted over $37 billion, with mounting prospects in 2025. Per the report, cycle indicators like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) show the bull cycle is still on. However, like previous cycles, giant peaks may not be expected in the short term. Still, bulls expect a reasonable jump in price next year between $150k to $200k. The exchange cites a minimum price estimate of $145,000 in June which could extend to $200,000 on the back of favorable conditions. Market Expects a Post-Halving Year Rally Traditionally, BTC prices have surged after each halving, with significant gains recorded for the next year. This bull case scenario in Q1 2024, ahead of the halving, led to miners repositioning holdings. Next year, market participants expect the effect to swing alongside tightening global financial conditions fully. Furthermore, inflationary trends are expected to attract more users to Bitcoin as a store of value to protect assets. This has been a recurring macro trend in the past 12 months. “ Inflation remains a central focus, with core CPI steady at 3.3% YoY reflecting persistent pressure in vehicle prices and durable goods. The Fed’s restrictive stance, despite planned rate cuts, underscores the difficulty in achieving its 2% inflation target. Strong economic growth, including a projected 3.8% Q4 annualized rate, supports cautious monetary easing but leaves room for recalibration should inflation persist.” Finally, the market expects positive crypto laws in the United States to shape the global sentiment. This is expected to attract more institutional investors, taking BTC prices to new all-time highs. The price of the crypto leader soared past $107K before slight corrections due to volatility. Similarly, whales have recorded large accumulations signaling long-term holdings.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 05:21:59

Crypto All-Stars Rallies Following CEX Listing Announcement,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/best-low-cap-meme-coin-to-buy-crypto-all-stars-rallies-following-cex-listing-announcement/,"The post Best Low-Cap Meme Coin to Buy? Crypto All-Stars Rallies Following CEX Listing Announcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After raising over $26 million during its presale, Crypto All-Stars (STARS) saw its first DEX listing and an immediate soar from its listing price of $0.001681 to $0.002740, representing a 62% jump just an hour into its launch. The gains were even greater for those who secured their share of the coin during the early rounds of the presale. Over the week, the token’s price fell below its listing level as investors took profit. However, STARS has recorded 30% gains today as its holder count increased following a CEX listing announcement and the second round of its “Last Meme Standing” competition. STARS Sees a 33% Soar Over The Past 48 Hours On December 28th, STARS price dropped to $0.0003315, an all-time low for the coin. However, following the potential CEX listing announcement by STARS’ developers, the token’s holder count increased by over 3,000, and its price shot up to $0.0005954 by December 29th, representing a 79% soar. Although the price of STARS fluctuated to $0.0004291, it has remained up 33% since the CEX listing announcement, with the potential for further gains as more details surface. STARS is currently sitting at an $18 million market cap, which falls into the acceptable range for centralized exchanges that have previously listed low-cap meme coins that immediately delivered impressive returns. For example, Neiro (NEIRO) was just a month old when it had a $14.4 million market cap and scored its Binance listing, which immediately saw its price soar by over 2,500%.

Depending on the exchange that lists it and the market sentiment, STARS could outperform PEPU and SLAP, which saw gains of over 600% and 5,500%, respectively. Last Meme Standing Showcases MemeVault’s Potential As STARS Teases a Second Round Crypto All-Stars is preparing to release the MemeVault, a cross-chain, multi-token staking protocol for meme coins that seeks to unify all meme coin holders under a single roof. Although the STARS team hasn’t confirmed its release date, they’ve hosted a Last Meme Standing competition, which saw investors stake their Pepe, Milady, Shiba Inu, Floki, and Turbo, with a $20,000 worth of STARS on the line for the winning coin’s backers. The competition rules were straightforward – staking a coin places it on top of the leaderboard, and it wins if another coin doesn’t dethrone it before the countdown finishes. The event was a massive success, with over $100,000 worth of meme coins staked, and Pepe’s holders took the prize. Last Meme Standing was such a success its got us thinking…. Round 2 and higher stakes anyone? pic.twitter.com/99iXecMHKW — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 29, 2024 Besides rewarding the community, Last Meme Standing has showcased the project’s multi-token staking capabilities, which the MemeVault is expected to deliver on release. According to the project’s website, the MemeVault will support 11 tokens once it goes live. The list includes the tokens that appeared in the first Last Meme Standing event and BONK, COQ, BRETT, TOSHI, DOGE, and MOG, which could appear in the second event. STARS Could See Gains of Over 290% if It Keeps Its Momentum With a CEX listing, Last Meme Standing 2, and the MemeVault release in the works, STARS is on track to increase its visibility and potentially return to its listing price, which would represent a 290% surge and could help drive its price further. The bullish sentiment is further bolstered by the project’s steady increase in its follower base, which now numbers over 27,000 users across X (Twitter) and Telegram . Plus, the token is seeing increasing large-volume purchase activity today, with two separate wallet owners buying $13,692 and $10,265 worth of STARS over the past few hours. Regarding investor security, the project enjoys a 99/99 reliability score on DexTools, which confirms there are no critical issues with its smart contract’s code and that no new coins can be minted or wallets blacklisted. Additionally, the project has shared proof of locked liquidity, which ensures a safer trading environment. Liquidity is now LOCKED! Link to proof: https://t.co/EZwZKedHsQ — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 23, 2024 Although the STARS price fell after delivering solid returns to early investors, the token seems ready for a breakout once MemeVault releases and further details regarding its CEX listing are announced. Thanks to the MemeVault, STARS is designed to be held, as it will act as a reward multiplier within the staking protocol. MemeVault’s release could create scarcity as more meme coin holders add it to their portfolios, which would positively impact its price, making this the best time to purchase and hold it.

Technology has progressed faster because of conflicts around the world, most notably the war in Ukraine. According to a recent report, Financial Times’ Vertical Research Partners predicts that in the next five years, the top 15 defense contractors will have $50 billion in free cash flow, double what they had together at the end of 2021. There will be more deal-making, and more prominent companies will continue to spend the money on buying back shares and paying out higher dividends. Michael Sion at Bain & Co. expects mergers and acquisitions in aerospace and military to rise. That also means he sees more money coming from private equity and venture capital firms. He said, “Many companies are looking to expand what they offer to get ready for advanced technologies.” Venture capital deals in the defense sector have increased by 18 times over the past 10 years Larger firms will target fast-growing military areas such as space and defense electronics. A new Bain report also states that the value of venture capital deals in the military sector has increased by 18 times over the past 10 years. Much of this is attributable to the blending of commercial and defense technologies. Investors, especially in Europe, have been hesitant about investing in this sector because of ethical concerns. However, their outlook has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago.

According to Arkham Intelligence , Tether’s Bitcoin wallets received two separate transfers on December 30, amounting to approximately 8,404.5 BTC. With Bitcoin trading around $92,500, the addition brings Tether’s total holdings to 83,759 BTC, valued at nearly $7.75 billion. Tether Remains Committed to Bitcoin Purchases This move aligns with Tether’s commitment, announced in May 2023, to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward Bitcoin purchases. The last significant addition occurred on March 31, when Tether acquired 8,888.88 BTC shortly after Bitcoin surpassed the $70,000 mark. Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled in 2024, reaching an all-time high of $108,000 in mid-December, though it has seen some recent declines. Tether now holds the second-largest Bitcoin reserve among private companies, trailing only Block.one, which owns 140,000 BTC. Overall, Tether ranks third when both private and public companies are considered, behind software giant MicroStrategy, which leads with an impressive 446,400 BTC. JUST IN: Tether buys 7,629 #bitcoin worth $705 million for its reserves, now owns $7.7 billion in bitcoin pic.twitter.com/0K2KTjCM2Z — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 30, 2024 Corporate Bitcoin treasuries have gained traction in 2024 as the cryptocurrency’s value surged. Companies like KULR Technology Group and Quantum BioPharma have recently added Bitcoin to their reserves. KULR’s $21 million purchase of 217.18 BTC on December 16 drove its stock price up over 40%, hitting a record high. Similarly, Quantum BioPharma announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other digital assets to diversify its treasury on December 20. Last week, Tether made its first foray into venture capital by investing $2 million in Arcanum Capital’s Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund II. The fund is a tokenized investment vehicle focused on supporting decentralized Web3 projects aimed at advancing blockchain-based technologies, including remittances, privacy, and financial inclusion. Furthermore, Tether recently invested $775 million in Rumble , a video-sharing platform known for its free speech ethos. US States Consider Adding Bitcoin To Reserves Ohio has become the latest US state to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. The initiative mirrors recent moves by Texas and Pennsylvania to establish Bitcoin reserves. On 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings (MARA) has also bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. Likewise, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further.

Solana Gears Up While Lunex Rockets Into the Game,https://timestabloid.com/bnb-mooning-after-revolut-listing-solana-gears-up-while-lunex/,"As the Bitcoin-led market continues to decline, BNB price is bucking the trend, having recently been listed on Revolut. Meanwhile, SOL is poised for significant gains fueled by the growing interest in its ecosystem. However, the real buzz centers around Lunex Network (LNEX), lauded as one of the fastest-growing cryptos in the current cycle. With its entry into the game, Lunex Network is shaping up to be on strong footing alongside these established giants. This article examines the dynamics behind these assets and their prospects in the current market. Lunex Network Launches DeFi Solutions In One Swoop The difficulty of managing multi-chain portfolios often leaves traders juggling complex tools. Lunex Network’s unified asset tracker changes the game by integrating data from over 40 blockchains into a single dashboard. This innovation simplifies portfolio analysis, helping users make informed decisions without toggling between platforms. Liquidity fragmentation has long plagued decentralized exchanges, but Lunex’s aggregation protocol takes a novel approach. It bridges liquidity gaps across chains, enabling users to access competitive rates effortlessly. By optimizing liquidity pathways, Lunex eliminates inefficiencies that hinder fast and cost-effective trading. Another highlight is its non-custodial wallet, which offers more than just secure storage. This wallet functions as a gateway to decentralized trading and staking, ensuring users retain full control of their funds at all times. Transactions are cryptographically signed by users, reinforcing Lunex’s commitment to decentralization and security. Additionally, regular token burns steadily reduce the supply of $LNEX , creating scarcity while aligning the platform’s growth with long-term value. For traders and investors navigating the volatile crypto market, Lunex provides tools and systems that combine simplicity with powerful functionality. This balance positions it as a formidable force in the market. BNB Price Beats The Odds After Listing on Revolut Binance Coin ( BNB ) has experienced a notable surge following its listing on Revolut, a prominent fintech platform with over 40 million users. This development has increased BNB ‘s accessibility, contributing to its recent price appreciation. BNB is practically the only top 10 crypto with some increase during the ending days of December. The RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting strong BNB- buying momentum. The markets are optimistic, with CoinCodex predicting a potential rally above the $800 mark in early 2025. This surge is driven by increased institutional adoption in the US and positive BNB sentiment. SOL Gears Up After For Rally After Bullish Signal Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading around $190, reflecting a slight decline of 6%. Despite this downturn, SOL maintains a strong bullish trend, supported by over 90% of signals from moving averages. With an FGI of 73, SOL continues to trade above its 200-day SMA. The formation of a bull flag pattern on the daily chart suggests the potential for a breakout, with SOL analysts projecting a target of $320 in the near term. However, recent SOL price corrections indicate the possibility of increased volatility. Conclusion Lunex Network is pioneering the future of DeFi one LNEX token at a time. The Lunex Network presale edges closer to listing, with tokens selling for $0.0049 apiece. By staking LNEX tokens for at least 1 month, presale investors can secure up to 18% APY.

Rollblock emerges at the intersection of DeFi and iGaming, with analysts projecting significant growth during its presale and beyond. Table of Contents Rollblock offers the perfect blend of DeFi and iGaming Ripple sees 7% decline in 7 days Cardano sees a major December dip Sui drops 5% in 5 days Rollblock continues to gain momentum 2024 has been a huge year for both the DeFi and iGaming spaces. With the market expanding as 2025 approaches, investors are wondering where to focus their efforts. While Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Sui (SUI) have been strong investments historically, an exciting new project has been tipped to outperform them all: Rollblock (RBLK). This project has emerged from the intersection of iGaming and DeFi, blending the two together to create a decentralized gaming experience. The project is currently seeing major attention from across the investing spectrum, with analysts predicting an 800% increase during the presale and further gains post-launch. Rollblock offers the perfect blend of DeFi and iGaming A casino with a broad offering Rollblock is a Hybrid GambleFi platform that blends traditional casino entertainment with decentralized finance. As the world’s first community-backed casino and Play-to-Earn token, Rollblock empowers users to earn, play, and invest in a secure and transparent ecosystem. The platform offers a range of over 7000 games, including the best of both casino and virtual games, and accepts cryptocurrency deposits. In addition, there is a comprehensive sportsbook, and a range of exciting player-vs-player options on offer for those with a competitive nature. The native token: RBLK At the center of the Rollblock platform is the project’s native token, RBLK. This token differentiates itself from the rest with some appealing benefits for holders. A significant 30% of Rollblock’s weekly profits are used to buy back RBLK tokens, and of these tokens, 60% are burned permanently to introduce scarcity and boost the value of the token. The remaining tokens are rewarded to users who have chosen to stake RBLK, with generous APY rates offering a lucrative passive income stream for token holders. Hybrid infrastructure: Built for functionality The platform’s hybrid infrastructure model combines the best of both worlds: decentralized, on-chain transparency, but with the robust functionality of a traditional casino. With its decentralized approach, AI tools, and passive income potential, Rollblock is the perfect destination for Gen-Z bettors and crypto enthusiasts who want autonomy, transparency, and profitability in their gaming experience.

Despite Ripple’s strong annual performance, XRP could now see a harsh corrective price action. Ripple lost 7% of its value in the last 7 days, and XRP’s price dropped even more significantly over the last 24 hours. Having held a value of $2.15 at midday on the 29th December, it dropped down to $2.03 by the same time on the 30th December. Cardano sees a major December dip Cardano performed poorly through 2024 despite a broader crypto space expansion. With 2025 around the corner, Cardano’s value dropped 18% in the last month. Cardano now looks like it could fall below the $30 billion mark, causing some Cardano holders to sell up. Cardano sank from $0.94 on 24th December to $0.85 on the 29th, marking a disappointing end to the year for Cardano. Sui drops 5% in 5 days Sui had a strong year overall with a 421% increase, though it has dropped 5% in the last 5 days, raising questions as to how Sui might perform in 2025. The Sui developers have been focused on improving accessibility this year. Sui’s mainnet is now supported by over 100 validators, so there is a glimmer of hope for Sui holders. Rollblock continues to gain momentum Sporting more than 7000 games, AI-powered betting tools, and community projects, Rollblock is an entertaining gaming destination for all. Today, with the presale in its ninth stage, RBLK tokens are trading at $0.0044, and analysts expect 800% growth pre-launch and 100x growth post-launch. With this in mind, there is no better time than now to join a platform likely to shape the future of DeFi and iGaming. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials .

The scam that was mainly identified on YouTube, are comments that are created to attract users with seed phrases to wallets holding thousand-dollars of cryptocurrencies. How Crypto Scams Are Exploiting Seed Phrases to Lure Victims The process looks simple to do but is actually anything but simple. These hackers regard themselves as skilled traders posing as beginners trying to find a way to trade from wallets with high volumes of stablecoins such as USDT in the Tron blockchain. They even expose the seed phrase of the wallet so that all the undesirables get lured into getting a hold of the wallet. Inside the store, the “lucky” thief finds a wallet with up to $8, 000. But to withdraw the funds a small amount of Tron (TRX) is payable as gas fees which are charged in the network. When the thief wants to send TRX to the wallet, all their tokens are diverted to another wallet owned by the scammers. Understanding the TRX Gas Fee Trap: A New Fraud Tactic This is yet another sophisticated trap connected with the use of multi-signature wallets for which several approvals are needed for outgoing transactions. The gullible thief simply tries to withdraw the money and the poor guy ends up making the scammers even richer. Kaspersky, a cybersecurity firm; said the operation was a sting operation aimed at immoral people and not ‘crypto users.’ .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Tips to Stay Safe Though individually this may result in relatively small losses per incident, but the overall operation shows that the crypto scams are becoming increasingly more complex, using mechanics inherent in the blockchain combined with psychological tricks to encourage and reward unethical behaviour. Cybersecurity specialists advise crypto users who are interested in digital assets to refrain from usiing unknown seed phrases and generally have no interaction with wallets belonging to strangers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 05:55:00

XRP’s price is down 2% in the last 24 hours, while the won continues to trade below 1,470 per dollar. The arrest warrant issued against former President Yoon Suk Yeol has exacerbated market fears both locally and globally. On Tuesday, the Seoul Western District Court issued a search warrant for Yoon’s residence and an arrest warrant for his attempts to impose martial law during a live televised address on December 3. South Korea issues arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon https://t.co/yYqMG3U8qs — Financial Times (@FT) December 31, 2024 This marks the first time in South Korean history that an arrest warrant has been issued against an incumbent president. The warrants followed Yoon’s repeated refusals to comply with the summons from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is investigating him for treason and abuse of power. Yoon’s televised imposition of martial law, justified by claims of addressing “anti-state elements” and “North Korean threats,” drew sharp criticism. South Korea’s parliament quickly overturned the move on December 4, but the political fallout has been severe. The ripple effect on cryptocurrency markets South Korea’s political crisis has extended its influence to the cryptocurrency sector. Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, experienced a brief slump of up to 4% during Yoon’s short-lived martial law declaration. Domestically, crypto trading spiked to its second-highest level this year, with retail traders actively pursuing “high-momentum” altcoins such as XRP and Dogecoin. Although the crypto market recovered after parliament overturned the martial law order, recent price movements continue to reflect volatility. Bitcoin fell below $93,000, currently changing hands at $92,500, a 0.6% decline over the past 24 hours, with its trading volume surging by 62% to go past $55 billion. Ethereum dropped 2.4%, trading slightly above $3,300, while its trading volume increased by 56%, reaching $25.52 billion at press time, per Coingecko data . XRP, closely tied to South Korean retail trading trends, saw its price decline by 2% in the last 24 hours on the country’s largest digital currency exchange Upbit . It is currently trading below 3,000 won, going down 12% over the past week. XRP/KRW Upbit chart. Source: TradingView. The downturn coincides with broader market sentiment, as the global cryptocurrency market cap decreased by 1.3% to $3.22 trillion. However, trading volumes surged by 40%, and investors could be looking to cash in on profits as 2024 nears sunset. Won hits 16-year low as political tensions amplify economic struggles South Korea’s Won has taken a significant hit during this period of political instability. The won fell below 1,470 per dollar, marking its lowest levels in 16 years, according to market data from Trading Economics. The currency’s value has declined by over 12% this year, making it the weakest currency in emerging Asia. The economic downturn has been fueled by political tensions, concerns over economic mismanagement, and fears of US tariffs. The Bank of Korea’s decision to reduce its benchmark interest rate to 3% in December, following inflation levels dropping to 1.9%, has done little to offset the won’s decline. The central bank’s plans for further rate cuts next year aim to stabilize the monetary system, though challenges remain with a strong dollar driven by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies and the incoming US administration’s outlook.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2024 expects a maximum price of $2.8. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention late last year with the launch of its proprietary blockchain. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $1.46 Market Cap $611.61M Trading Volume $36.99M Circulating Supply 643.93M dYdX All-time High $4.53 All-time Low $0.8067 24-hour high $1.47 24-hour low $1.45 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $1.46 Price Prediction $ 5.72 (223.31%) Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 17.43% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $ 1.194069 200-Day SMA $ 1.4366 14-Day RSI 72.34 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faces a bearish pressure around $1.5 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX is facing selling demand. Resistance for dYdX is present at $1.59 Support for dYdX/USD is present at $1.27 The dYdX price analysis for 31 December confirms that dYdX faces increased selling pressure as the price drops toward $1.5. Currently, there’s a strong domination from both buyers and sellers. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price drops toward $1.5 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows that the token is facing bearish pressure as it aims to hold on to its momentum. In recent hours, the price of dYdX declined toward $1.5; however, it faces minor buying pressure from bulls. The 24-hour volume declined to $16 million, plunging interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $1.46, dropping by over 1.4% in the last 24 hours. dYdX shows bullish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and trades below the midline at 42, hinting that bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they hold the price below the EMA trend lines. Bulls are maintaining buying confidence as the dYdX price aims for further surges. dYdX price chart The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.18, showing that long-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 1.450985 BUY SMA 5 $ 1.535278 BUY SMA 10 $ 1.518048 BUY SMA 21 $ 1.401292 BUY SMA 50 $ 1.194069 BUY SMA 100 $ 1.070799 BUY SMA 200 $ 1.4366 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.368526 BUY EMA 5 $ 1.263628 BUY EMA 10 $ 1.139506 BUY EMA 21 $ 1.047047 BUY EMA 50 $ 1.012846 BUY EMA 100 $ 1.130664 BUY EMA 200 $ 1.485763 BUY What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $1.5953, it will fuel a bullish rally to $1.9434. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.2743, beginning a bearish trend to $1.0678. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Today, dYdX faced intense selling pressure as it failed to surge above $2.2. However, buyers are defending further declines and aiming for a quick recovery. Will dYdX price recover? If buyers hold the buying momentum of dYdX and send it past the $2.5 mark, we might see a significant recovery in the coming hours. The current low might be a good time to buy and this might create a strong support level for dYdX’s price. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiments, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX, and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX announced a 35% cut in staff strength The decentralized trading platform dYdX, based in Switzerland, has announced a 35% cut in its core workforce. CEO Antonio Juliano shared the initial news in a short post on X, describing the decision as “sad” and committing to share a more detailed explanation later. dYdX price prediction December 2024 November was a bullish month for dYdX as the altcoin made robust surges following Donald Trump’s victory. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $2 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $2.6 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $1.5. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction December 2024 $1.5 $2 $2.6 dYdX price prediction 2024 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $2.61 by the end of 2024.

Meanwhile, MicroStrategy also expanded its Bitcoin portfolio with a $209 million purchase. Hong Kong lawmakers proposed incorporating Bitcoin into national reserves due to its potential to improve financial stability and attract global investment. As 2024 ends, Bitcoin's inability to sustain its recent all-time high also sparked some concerns, and technical analysts warned of a potential dip to $78,000 that could impact its trajectory into 2025. Tether Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has made a big addition to its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves by transferring close to $780 million worth of BTC to its corporate treasury. This was the company’s largest Bitcoin purchase since March and aligns with its May 2023 announcement to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward acquiring Bitcoin. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Tether’s Bitcoin reserve wallets received two large transfers on Dec. 30, totaling approximately 8,404.5 BTC. As Bitcoin was trading at around $92,500, the latest additions are valued at about $777.4 million. This brought Tether’s total holdings to 90,083 BTC, which is worth nearly $8.3 billion. Private companies holding Bitcoin (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) This latest move happened after Tether’s previous purchase on March 31, when the firm bought 8,888.88 BTC shortly after Bitcoin passed the $70,000 mark. Bitcoin’s price doubled over 2024 and gained more than 108% year-to-date despite recent declines from its mid-December all-time high. Tether now ranks as the second-largest private Bitcoin holder, with its holdings trailing only the 140,000 BTC held by blockchain software firm Block.one. In the overall rankings, including public companies, Tether holds the third position, with MicroStrategy leading the list with a staggering 446,400 BTC. The surge in Bitcoin’s price certainly encouraged more corporations to add the cryptocurrency to their treasuries. KULR Technology Group also recently invested $21 million in Bitcoin by buying 217.18 BTC. This led to a 40% increase in its stock price. Similarly, Quantum BioPharma recently announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other crypto assets to diversify its own treasury. MicroStrategy Expands Bitcoin Portfolio Again MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm and prominent Bitcoin investor, also recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 2,138 BTC for $209 million. The company announced that it made the purchase between Dec. 23 and 29, and paid an average price of about $97,837 per BTC. The acquisition was funded by selling 592,987 shares during the same week. The firm’s Bitcoin yield has shown great performance, with a year-to-date increase of 74.1% as of Dec. 30 and a quarterly yield of 47.8% for the period from Oct. 1 to Dec. 29. This was the eighth consecutive week that MicroStrategy added Bitcoin to its holdings as the company purchased BTC weekly since Oct. 31. Over this period, the firm acquired a total of 194,180 BTC. However, the volume of Bitcoin that was bought has declined compared to November when MicroStrategy purchased over 100,000 BTC. Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, teased the latest acquisition on Dec. 29 by hinting at “disconcerting” patterns on Saylor Tracker, a platform monitoring the company’s Bitcoin investments. Saylor also once again reiterated that MicroStrategy is still very much committed to purchasing Bitcoin at any price, even if it reaches $1 million per coin. In addition to its latest acquisition, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its capacity to issue shares. A Dec. 23 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that the company plans to raise the number of authorized Class A common stock from 330 million shares to 10.33 billion shares and authorized preferred stock from 5 million to over 1 billion shares. This move will provide better flexibility for the company to issue additional shares and potentially fund more Bitcoin purchases in the future. Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Gains Traction in Hong Kong A Hong Kong legislator proposed integrating Bitcoin into the special administrative region's national reserves to boost financial security and attract new investment. Wu Jiexhuang, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, suggested leveraging China’s “one country, two systems” policy to explore Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset. Speaking to state-owned newspaper Wen Wei Po, Jiexhuang talked about the strategic steps smaller nations like El Salvador and Bhutan have taken by incorporating Bitcoin into their reserves, as well as proposals by US President-elect Donald Trump to make Bitcoin a strategic asset. Jiexhuang argued that Hong Kong could initially include Bitcoin in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to evaluate its market impact before considering a broader integration into its reserves. He also pointed out Bitcoin’s potential to attract global talent and investment while still providing financial stability amid market volatility. He also believes that holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could mitigate the risks associated with its growing adoption in traditional markets, giving Hong Kong a first-mover advantage. The legislator stated that major economic powers adopting Bitcoin in their reserves could stabilize its value and encourage other nations to follow suit and shift away from traditional assets. This, he suggested, could lead to declining values for traditional assets and affect governments’ fiscal reserves. Hong Kong’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau is expected to develop crypto regulations under the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules,” aligning with broader global standards. The region’s focus on Bitcoin aligns with China’s large Bitcoin holdings, which amount to about 190,000 BTC that was acquired through confiscations, placing it second only to the United States in terms of national Bitcoin reserves. This proposal was made after earlier discussions by another Legislative Council member, Johnny Ng , who announced plans to explore Bitcoin’s feasibility as part of Hong Kong’s financial reserves. Ng pointed to the growing global recognition of Bitcoin as a critical factor in its integration into traditional financial systems. Market Awaits Bitcoin’s Next Move Into 2025 As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto market is fixated on Bitcoin's price trajectory heading into 2025. Despite achieving a new all-time high earlier this month, Bitcoin has since dipped below that mark, and raised concerns among market participants. It seems like the leading cryptocurrency's inability to sustain its peak is being interpreted as a sign of market weakness. The broader crypto market, buoyed this year by institutional interest from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and pension funds due to the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has not been immune to year-end declines. These downward trends dampened hopes for Bitcoin to close the year with a six-figure price. Veteran trader Peter Brandt added to the conversation with a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price chart. According to Brandt, a head-and-shoulders pattern is forming, which suggests a potential drop to $78,000 per Bitcoin if the pattern plays out. While he acknowledges the possibility of the pattern failing or morphing, he still warned traders to act on the pattern as it currently stands. A decline like this would represent a 15+% drop from current levels but could also serve to close a big price gap on the CME that has been unresolved for nearly two months. For some analysts, addressing this gap could provide a cleaner slate for Bitcoin as it moves into 2025, and could also potentially offer a foundation for future upward momentum.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 06:02:18

The comeback of the Blockchain Bandit highlights, at the same time, the crypto vulnerabilities that are an inevitable part of the blockchain ecosystem. In a report from onchain security firm Cyvers, the total amount of money stolen in 165 security incidents in 2024 was around $2.3 billion, which was a 40% rise from the previous year. 81% of the total lost money, or $1.9 billion, was the result of access control breaches on the centralized exchanges and custodial platforms, with major focus on pig butchering scams.

That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

According to the forecast and technical analysis, Polygon’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $2.07 in 2026. The maximum price projection is $2.39, with an average value of $2.12. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2027 In 2027, one Polygon is anticipated to reach a minimum price of $3.03.

We anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024 to range between a minimum of $0.9012 and a maximum of $1.03, with an average trading price of around $0.9298. However, its future market sentiment entirely depends on the SEC’s stance, global regulation, and investor interest.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Yeti Ouro emerges as a standout in the crypto space, blending gaming utility with deflationary mechanics, as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu regain market attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin analysis: Is a rally on the horizon Shiba Inu forecast: Whale activity explodes Yeti Ouro: The new gaming sensation Here’s what investors love about Yeti Ouro: Why Yeti Ouro stands out Final thoughts Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are back in the spotlight. Dogecoin rallies while Shiba Inu reactor whales exodus sparks interest. But the most interesting find is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), the new altcoin transforming the gaming world. Its unique model and successful presale are gaining a lot of buzz. Crypto investors are keeping a close eye on these three tokens, but Yeti Ouro is a dark horse with massive growth potential. Dogecoin analysis: Is a rally on the horizon Dogecoin price has been on a tear recently. And market indicators suggest that it may be setting itself up for another big rally. It comes as activity in the DOGE community grows and trading volumes leap. Dogecoin rallies have often been inspired by community backing and social media attention. Analysts now suggest that DOGE price will break its recent resistance level. And with renewed interest in the rest of the crypto space, Dogecoin could surge again. Couple this rise with some positive sentiment for long-term holders. However, DOGE’s capacity to engage with mainstream media still arguably makes it a superior older meme coin. Shiba Inu forecast: Whale activity explodes Whale activity for Shiba Inu is once again riding a huge wave. In the last 24 hours, SHIB orders have increased by 265%, according to IntoTheBlock. This means that whale activity has increased the volume of large transactions to 375 trillion SHIB tokens. When there is whale activity, however, it often means a big move is coming to a token. Now, investors are left wondering what could be behind this latest next rush. This may be due to recent Shibarium upgrades or new happenings in the SHIB ecosystem. As SHIB struggles to reclaim old prices, those large transactions indicate growing confidence among institutional participants. If the trend is maintained, SHIB price may drop another zero and please its faithful holders. Yeti Ouro: The new gaming sensation Dogecoin and Shiba Inu slightly dominate the meme coin space, but Yeti Ouro promises to take things to a whole new level. Yeti Ouro pairs gaming and real utility — something fun, unlike traditional meme tokens. It drives a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game called Yeti Go, based on Unreal Engine.

YETIO staking: Investors can stake YETIO for passive income and high APY. Deflation: There is a regular burning of a percentage of tokens, resulting in a decrease in supply. Mass appeal: The game’s chaotic, fun-filled gameplay draws in gamers and crypto investors. Yeti Ouro is already sitting on a presale of over $1.4 million, a sign of investor confidence. Most of the previous altcoin projects storming or following the trail have ignored the monetization of super-quality gameplay and token utility. Meanwhile, the Yeti Ouro meme contest has wrapped up, with some of the participants sharing their innovative creations.

It has a solid advantage thanks to its combination of Play-to-Earn mechanics and community-driven additions. Yeti Ouro offers a physical product, unlike popular community tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its P2E model allows players to enjoy themselves while making money. These two inextricably linked purposes bring casual gamers and serious investors on board. Moreover, the presale of Yeti Ouro has proven that the Yeti Ouro can draw attention. YETIO represents one of the most promising prospects for investors searching for the next big thing, with potential 100x returns. Final thoughts As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu storm the hubs, their competition is catching up. DOGE signals a rally, while SHIB`s whale movements indicate volatility. Yeti Ouro, however, is leveraging its gaming utility and presale hype. With the growth of the crypto market, projects like Yeti Ouro are blazing trails. Its blend of gaming, incentives, and community involvement uniquely positions it. Yeti Ouro is quickly rising and is a no-brainer for long-run investors. Keep an eye on this rising star.

The surge in incidents has shed light on systemic vulnerabilities and emphasized the urgent need for robust security measures in the blockchain space.

So far, it has raised $4.6 million , surpassing milestones of $1 million in the first 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days . The project proudly counts over 7,000 holders , with 60 billion coins sold already. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): A Quirky Twist on the Meme Coin Scene If you’re looking for something a little different in the meme coin market, Non-Playable Coin (NPC) might be what you’re after. This coin stands out by embracing the idea of “non-playable” as a theme, incorporating the concept of “non-playable characters” (NPCs) from the gaming world. NPC’s approach is all about leaning into the idea of gaming and digital worlds in a tongue-in-cheek, meme-driven way. It’s the type of coin that might make you scratch your head and laugh at the absurdity of it all—exactly the kind of humour that meme coins thrive on. But don’t let the quirky concept fool you. NPC is rapidly gaining traction among those who love the idea of meme coins with a gaming twist. The coin’s presale has seen some decent momentum, and analysts predict that NPC could see some serious growth as the gaming and meme coin sectors continue to collide. However, it’s still in its early stages, and much of the hype is based on the meme coin market’s overall growth rather than its immediate utility. The big question for NPC investors is whether its community will be strong enough to carry it to the moon or remain a niche meme coin for diehard fans. While it has some unique appeal, it still lacks the expansive ecosystem and utility BTFD Coin offers with its P2E game and rewards programs. So, if you’re eyeing the best new meme coins to invest in today, it’s worth keeping an eye on NPC, but it’s hard to compete with the excitement BTFD Coin is generating. Andy (ANDY): Meme Coin with a Dash of Personality Let’s talk about Andy, a meme coin bringing personality and attitude to the meme coin world. This coin’s charm lies in its distinctive character-driven branding, which taps into the meme-driven culture that has made cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu household names. The idea behind Andy is simple: to create a coin that resonates with people through humour, pop culture references, and a playful attitude towards crypto. While Andy is still in its early stages, it’s worth noting that it’s taking a more traditional meme coin approach. The project’s roadmap doesn’t offer as much utility as BTFD Coin’s gaming platform or staking rewards, but its community is strong, and that’s a huge factor in the meme coin market. With its fun vibe and easy-to-understand concept, Andy has much potential, especially as it develops further. One clear thing is that Andy’s meme-driven approach has already built a strong fanbase. Its tokenomics and growth potential will depend heavily on the success of its community and whether it can keep pace with the more innovative meme coins like BTFD Coin. It’s a fun coin to hold, but will it deliver long-term value for its investors? Only time will tell.

They believe the US crypto space will particularly lead crypto innovation next year with favorable ETF regulations. The company remarked, “ 2025 will mark a shift from speculation to utility, as crypto’s foundational technologies become integral to global financial and operational systems.” Franklin Templeton expects friendlier crypto regulations Franklin Templeton anticipates that the U.S. will lead in crypto innovation by implementing more accommodating regulations for ETFs and tokenized assets in 2025. They believe favorable regulations will drive the industry’s growth, expecting traditional finance players and the crypto infrastructure to converge. The firm also projects for the establishment of a stablecoin regulatory framework in the US which they believe will allow for many other financial institutions to launch their own stablecoins. Moreover, Templeton believes tokenized products and stablecoin adoption will continue to expand and be major drivers of decentralized finance (DeFi) growth globally. They also expect to see many countries starting their own Bitcoin reserves, and for BTC to grow into a global financial asset driven by increased institutional adoption. Franklin Templeton says AI and crypto interactions will increase Franklin Templeton added that they expected decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) to see growing demand due to their application in practical areas such as logistics and the Internet of Things (IoT). They also predict that artificial intelligence and crypto will merge faster, utilizing blockchain technology for transparency and verification. The investment company also said that AI agents would likely employ blockchain infrastructure to streamline on-chain transactions, manage portfolios, and connect digital content and social media with blockchain ecosystems. They added that stakeholders needed to monitor regulatory changes, and institutional strategies, and advance AI-crypto integration to remain competitive in this dynamic field. However, they recognized that digital assets are still tied to underdeveloped technologies, potential security vulnerabilities, intellectual property disputes, exchange credit risks, regulatory uncertainty, value instability, limited global adoption, and susceptibility to manipulation and fraud.

Ethereum Gains Ground Against Bitcoin Ethereum’s recent surge against Bitcoin in the ETH/BTC pair suggests a potential breakout, a historical precursor to altseason—a period where altcoins typically outperform Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index hit a high of 88/100 earlier this month (December 4) but has since settled at 47, indicating mixed sentiment regarding altcoin performance. Market dynamics further support this narrative. ETH gains against BTC often trigger broader altcoin rallies, reflecting growing investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. This shift in focus could pave the way for increased market activity in altcoins as 2025 approaches. Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin: Altseason on the Horizon?

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

Here’s a roundup of the biggest crypto news that made headlines throughout the year. Bitcoin ETF Approvals: A Milestone for the Industry The year kicked off with a historic move for Bitcoin as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first US-listed Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This approval marked a pivotal moment for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, opening the doors to a broader range of investors who were previously hesitant to buy Bitcoin directly. In total, 11 Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, offering a simpler entry point into the crypto market for traditional investors. SBF Sentenced: The Fall of FTX’s Founder In March, the crypto world was rocked by the sentencing of Samuel Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture for his involvement in fraudulent schemes. The sentencing followed his conviction for misappropriating billions of dollars of customer funds. Despite his conviction, Bankman-Fried has appealed his 25-year sentence, leaving the legal saga far from over. MicroStrategy’s Big Move: Nasdaq 100 Debut Amidst the turbulence, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, made waves in the market by debuting on the Nasdaq 100 in 2024. This move solidified MicroStrategy’s profile as a major player in the world of Bitcoin, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin Halving: Reduced Block Rewards In April, Bitcoin’s third halving event of the year occurred, reducing miners’ block subsidy rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event had a significant impact on the network’s economic dynamics, although the drop in mining rewards was accompanied by a surprising decrease in average transaction fees. This halving event laid the foundation for a strong remainder of the year, with many anticipating a new price surge. Ripple vs. SEC: Legal Battle Continues One of the year’s most high-profile legal battles continued in 2024 with Ripple’s ongoing conflict with the SEC. In August, Ripple secured a major victory when the court ruled that it should only pay $125 million in fines, a far cry from the $2 billion originally sought by the SEC. However, the battle didn’t end there: in October, the SEC announced its intention to appeal the ruling, ensuring that the legal showdown between the two entities would continue into the next year. Binance CEO Sentenced: Zhao’s Legal Troubles In a surprising turn of events, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US money-laundering laws. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, had faced increasing scrutiny throughout 2024, and this sentencing marked a big move in the ongoing crackdown on crypto platforms that do not comply with regulations. WazirX Hack: $235 Million Stolen In a major cybersecurity incident, Indian crypto exchange WazirX was hacked, resulting in the theft of $235 million worth of various cryptocurrencies. The breach led to the exchange freezing transactions and working with forensic experts and law enforcement agencies to trace the stolen funds. This hack served as a reminder of the risks associated with crypto trading and the importance of enhanced security measures. Trump’s Win Boosts Crypto Prices The crypto market experienced a major surge following Donald Trump’s re-election as US President. His victory brought renewed optimism to the market, and cryptocurrencies saw sharp gains in the months that followed. The market was further influenced by the news that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would step down, adding to the sense of regulatory change and potential relief for the crypto industry. Bitcoin Breaks $100,000: A New All-Time High 2024 ended on a high note as Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high (ATH), surpassing the $100,000 price level for the first time. This was much-awaited and with Trump’s takeover, Bitcoin is expected to soar more.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-31 07:26:28

South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has announced that trading support for DAD will officially end on January 31, 2025. This decision was made after DAD was marked as a “trading alert asset” on December 10, 2024. Upbit stated that the DAD project team did not provide a satisfactory explanation regarding the exchange’s requests for transparency and important disclosures.

Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, calls it “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Per a recent Bloomberg report , the Bitcoin ETF, launched on January 11, 2024 , is the most successful ETF ever. BlackRock’s IBIT has amassed over $50 billion in assets under management (AuM) in the past 11 months, the report added. This is the first time an ETF is making a massive debut. According to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and at Strategas Securities, IBIT’s AuM was equivalent to over 50 European market-focused ETFs combined. Some of those European ETFs were more than 20 years old. “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented,” noted Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. “It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.” Seyffart forecasted that IBIT could earn about $112 million a year, given an expense ratio of 0.25% and with the current asset level. This comes a day after the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a remarkable $35.66 billion net inflows in 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows. Further, BlackRock’s $11 trillion in assets under management has helped drive Bitcoin’s price past $100,000 for the first time. BlackRock’s IBIT Could Outshine Gold Shares While BlackRock’s IBIT leading the charge, Gold ETFs, with a current market size of $274 billion, are experiencing significant outflows for the first time in six months. Additionally, there is speculation that IBIT could outperform the largest gold ETF – SPDR Gold Shares, provided Bitcoin price remains strong. Nate Geraci recently shared a chart that makes a notable comparison between spot gold ETFs and bitcoin ETFs in the US. For reference, Gold ETFs were launched in 2004, while Bitcoin ETFs were launched in 2024. One of the more ridiculous charts you’ll ever see… Assets in spot gold ETFs vs bitcoin ETFs.

Zerebro, with its decentralized AI content system, is capitalizing on innovative use cases across blockchain ecosystems, while ai16z price movements reflect strong activity in the AI meme coin space, driven by its unique venture-focused DAO framework.

Supporting this growth, ai16z has been integrated into Ethereum validators through strategic partnerships, enhancing network scalability and reliability. The introduction of USDT-margined perpetual futures on OKX offers traders up to 50x leverage, boosting market engagement. As the AI meme coin space continues to expand, the ai16z price remains a key metric to watch, highlighting its position as an emerging force in the AI and blockchain crossover.

However, there are two new crypto assets that have outpaced the XRP price rise. Hyperliquid launched in November and was up 8X before a slight correction. The bull run has extended to those in presale too, with Rollblock , a next-gen GambleFi platform whose price is up over 400%, and of course, with its launch to come, 2025 might just turn out to be an incredible year for its investors. New Crypto Rollblock Presale is Taking the Market by Storm Rollblock is no doubt one of the hottest new crypto projects, with its presale surprising many during the Q4 bull run . The presale, now in stage 9, has already raised over $7.7 million, and seen a token price surge well over 400%. What is it about Rollblock that’s rocking the market at such an early stage? Well, it boasts strong utility and an ambitious vision of bringing DeFi innovation to the lucrative $500 billion online gambling industry. One of its key DeFi features is the Rollblock Revenue Sharing Model. This ensures all token holders earn a percentage of the platform’s revenues, and it’s paid out automatically to their wallets. It’s a great way to earn a passive income, and for those interested in that, there’s an even more lucrative staking mechanism built into Rollblock. To take advantage of this, token holders need to stake their tokens, which means locking them up for a certain period. This will help the platform with security and liquidity, and for their troubles, investors will be rewarded with up to 30% APY. There are many other standout features to this exciting new crypto asset, and analysts are predicting continued success for Rollblock. The bull run is expected to get crazy in 2025, and after it launches, even the most bullish Rollblock analysts’ predictions might seem a bit conservative. XRP Up Almost 400% in Q4 Bull Run XRP has been one of the standout performers in the recent bull run , with the price up nearly 400%. The token has benefited from the Trump factor after hints of it being included in the new government’s policy. The most likely utility for XRP would be cross-border payments, and there’s talk of a new USD stablecoin, which the Trump administration is known to want, being built into the XRP network. Hyperliquid Skyrockets 8X as Bull Run Gains Momentum Hyperliquid has been one of the biggest benefactors of the Q4 bull run, with the HYPE price skyrocketing 8x in value in a few short weeks. Not even a month old, Hyperliquid is a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain that’s looking to revolutionize DeFi thanks to its decentralized perpetual exchange services. Analysts are bullish on HYPE , and momentum suggests further gains ahead as the bull run garners pace again. Conclusion The Q4 bull run has been exciting to be part of. Even “Dinocoins” such as XRP have caught a bid. As the bull continues into 2025, we should see even more gains, and new crypto assets such as Hyperliquid and Rollblock might just take center stage. After all, it’s the newest cryptos that bring in the biggest gains of any bull run. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

His post highlighted the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern, commonly associated with bullish momentum in technical analysis. Pantoja stated, “Some $XRP holders are crying about consolidation, when it’s obviously forming a symmetrical triangle (bullish). Breakout to $3.20-$4 will come out of nowhere.” The symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines, indicating a period of price consolidation. It typically resolves with a breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend—in this case, upward momentum, as suggested by XRP’s prior rally. Based on Pantoja’s analysis, XRP’s current price action supports the possibility of a breakout , with a price target between $3.20 and $4. Some $XRP holders are crying about consolidation, when it's obviously forming a symmetrical triangle (bullish). Breakout to $3.20-$4 will come out of nowhere. #XRP pic.twitter.com/wAdPznO1aL — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) December 29, 2024 Community Sentiments and Reactions The post received significant engagement from the cryptocurrency community, sparking discussions about XRP’s price trajectory. Some users expressed optimism about the pattern, while others voiced skepticism based on past price performance. One commenter, Val, pointed out the recurring formation of symmetrical triangles in XRP’s history, which have not always resulted in the anticipated upward breakout. Val wrote, “Okay and how many times has it formed a symmetrical triangle in the past only for people to say it’s bullish & an indication that the price is going to rise, only for it not to have ended up pumping? Too many times. The price of XRP as of right now should be $5, but it’s not.” This sentiment reflects the frustrations of long-term XRP holders who have yet to see sustained price increases align with their expectations. Another user, RippleMeThis, took a different stance, commenting , “Crying with a $2 floor lol. They never would have lasted when it was $0.30.” This viewpoint highlights the substantial growth XRP has already achieved, emphasizing resilience amid market volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Indika Torres contributed an optimistic perspective, stating , “Absolutely! Probably this week. Don’t understand the crying. We have buying opportunities right now. The people that are in fear, they lack knowledge. 2025 will be massive for ISO tokens.” ISO tokens mentioned by Torres refer to cryptocurrencies compliant with ISO 20022, a financial messaging standard gaining traction among global financial institutions. Current Market Context At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.09, representing a 2.55% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite this slight dip, the broader market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with investors eyeing a potential breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern. Outlook While technical analysis suggests a bullish scenario, investors are advised to exercise caution. Market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments can significantly impact XRP’s price movements. As the cryptocurrency approaches the apex of the triangle, traders will closely monitor trading volume and price action for confirmation of a breakout. If Pantoja’s projection materializes, XRP holders could witness substantial gains, potentially solidifying the asset’s position as a leading cryptocurrency.

Everyone’s predicting it: investors, researchers, analysts, CEOs. Donald Trump’s return to the White House in November set the stage for what many are calling Bitcoin’s most explosive growth era yet. Why? Simple: Trump loves crypto. During his campaign, he promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the guy the crypto community sees as their biggest enemy, and create a national Bitcoin strategic reserve funded by selling off the Federal Reserve’s gold for it. A new narrative for Bitcoin The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 was a game-changer. Forget the drama of 2023—the FTX collapse, Binance scandals, and Sam Bankman-Fried in prison—because ETFs brought legitimacy. With Bitcoin ETFs on the table, institutional investors who’ve been sitting on the sidelines had a clean, regulated way to get in on the action. This isn’t just about Wall Street suits buying Bitcoin. It’s about your 401(k) eventually having a slice of it, thanks to those ETFs. So what’s the word on 2025? James Butterfill at CoinShares thinks Bitcoin could swing between $80,000 and $150,000 depending on Trump’s follow-through. “It’s all about the regulatory environment,” he said. If Trump delivers, the upper end of that range looks solid. If not? We’re looking at a dip to $80k. Institutional flows and the $200k prophecy Institutional money is flowing into Bitcoin like never before. Standard Chartered estimates that institutional inflows have already reached 683,000 BTC this year, much of it driven by ETFs and purchases from companies like MicroStrategy . The firm predicts Bitcoin will double to $200,000 by 2025, thanks to reforms that could allow U.S. retirement funds to allocate small portions of their $40 trillion pool to crypto. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and corporate balance sheets are all looking at Bitcoin . And the incoming Trump administration might make that easier by tweaking rules to let traditional finance (or “TradFi,” as the cool kids say) allocate more to crypto. Kendrick even pointed out that a tiny slice of the $40 trillion U.S. retirement fund market could push Bitcoin through the roof. Matrixport is playing it a little safer but still bullish, with a $160,000 target. Markus Thielen says Bitcoin’s base of buyers has expanded to the point where it can handle corrections without tanking. “Corrections will still happen, but not like the old days,” he said. Matrixport nailed its 2024 call of $125,000, so folks are now paying some serious attention to their 2025 prediction. Then there’s Galaxy Digital, which expects Bitcoin to hit $185,000 in Q4 2025. They’re betting on adoption from nations and corporations alike. Five Nasdaq 100 companies and at least five countries are expected to add Bitcoin to their reserves next year, according to their research. “Bitcoin is outpacing gold and stocks,” said Alex Thorn, their head of research. Big players, big bets Carol Alexander, a finance professor who called Bitcoin’s $100,000 surge early on this year, sees the price hitting $200,000, possibly even by summer. But she’s not blind to the risks. Alexander points out that unregulated crypto exchanges can drive insane volatility, thanks to leveraged trades. “It could hit $150,000 and swing $50,000 either way,” she said. Still, her track record makes her voice one to watch. Youwei Yang at Bit Mining also has high hopes, with a range of $180,000 to $190,000. But he’s quick to add that Bitcoin could dip as low as $80,000 during market shocks, like a major stock market crash or geopolitical tensions. “Overall, though, the trend is bullish,” he said. Sid Powell at Maple Finance shares the optimism with a dose of caution. He’s targeting $180,000 to $200,000 by year-end 2025, based on ETF inflows and Trump’s rumored Bitcoin reserve. But Powell knows the game—crypto loves its cycles. “Corrections are part of the process,” he said, but added that institutional flows should act as a safety net, preventing the 70%-80% drawdowns of the past.

This development has sparked market optimism over future movements. On-chain data on Tuesday indicated that a whale bagged nearly $77 million worth of the second-largest crypto by market cap as the asset’s price flirted around the $3,300 mark. As a response, market enthusiasts now eye a $10,000 price target for ETH as 2025 is set to kick off. Ethereum Whale Bags Heavily Signaling Remarkable Gains Ahead According to an X post by Lookonchain on December 31, an Ethereum whale was recorded accumulating 22,919 ETH, worth $77.2 million, amid the coin’s recent volatile action. As per the data , the wallet address 0x6c.. was recorded to have made the massive accumulation. Notably, this massive buying took place at an average ETH price of $3,368. Meanwhile, the trading strategy has garnered additional attention, primarily in light of the trader’s previous profit-making strategies. Data indicated that since August 12, the same whale was recorded as making 25 swing trades in ETH and WBTC. Moreover, 21 of these proved highly profitable, underscoring a win rate of 84% and a profit of $4.57 million. In light of these past profit-making strategies, market watchers are now eyeing the $3,300 price mark as the Ethereum whale bagged heavy amounts at this level, with investors expecting gains in the top crypto’s price as soon as next year. What’s Next For ETH? At the time of reporting, ETH price was down by roughly 2% intraday and is currently trading at $3,353. Its 24-hour low and high were $3,298.80 and $3,425.80, respectively. Notably, the waning price action aligns with the broader trend and a holiday sentiment brewing across the broader landscape. Nevertheless, market participants remain optimistic about the asset’s long-term prospects. A recent ETH price analysis by CoinGape indicated that the token could rally and hit a $10,000 price level ahead. This bullish prediction comes against the backdrop of historical trends and strong market technicals. As a result, market watchers anticipate phenomenal gains in the asset’s price, with bullish sentiments further supported by the massive Ethereum whale accumulation. However, despite the positive predictions, the investors also remained cautious amid the recent developments in the market. For context, Justin Sun has recently deposited 29,153 ETH to HTX, sparking discussions over the potential reason behind the transfer.

Data released on Dec. 30 revealed that December marked the highest monthly trading volume for DEXs, continuing the momentum from November. In November, the DeFi space recorded a volume of $374 billion, spurred by optimism surrounding a potential crypto-friendly regulatory regime in the United States after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Top DEXs by Trading Volume Uniswap remained the top decentralized exchange by volume, recording $106.4 billion over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama. PancakeSwap followed with $96.4 billion in trading volume for the month. Solana’s largest DEX, Raydium, claimed third place, registering $58 billion in monthly volume. This surge coincided with an increase in Solana-based decentralized application (DApp) revenue. On Dec. 17, research platform Syndica reported that Solana DApps generated $365 million in revenue during November, largely fueled by memecoins launched on the Solana platform Pump.fun. Aerodrome and Orca took the fourth and fifth spots, with volumes of $31 billion and $22 billion, respectively. Lifinity, Curve Finance, and Hyperliquid collectively recorded $43.6 billion in trading volume. Memecoin Market Declines Despite Early Surge While DeFi trading volumes climbed, the memecoin market faced a significant correction in December. CoinMarketCap data showed that the memecoin market cap peaked at $137 billion on Dec. 9 but dropped sharply to $92 billion by Dec. 23. At the time of writing, the total market cap for memecoins stood at $95 billion, reflecting a 20% decline since Dec. 1.

The cost of these options is going down, showing optimism for the March period. BTC is on track to end December down 4%, its worst since 2021, as both retail investors and long-term holders cash out positions after a 117% yearly surge. Elsewhere, readings of the U.S. Chicago PMI indicate an economic slowdown, adding pressure on the market that tends to be correlated to such data. In what looks to have been its final purchase of the year, Bitcoin development company MicroStrategy increased its BTC stash for the eighth consecutive week on Monday, adding another 2,138 BTC for $209 million in the week ended Dec. 29. That brought its total holdings to 446,400 BTC. But news of the buying did little to stem losses. BTC prices slumped in the hours following MicroStrategy’s announcement, while shares of the company fell 8% to their lowest since early November. The fall spread over to majors, with ether (ETH), XRP, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA falling as much as 3% before recovering. BNB Chain’s BNB was little changed, while memecoins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) fell 5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, lost 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

Fidelity’s FBTC lost $154 million to lead outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC at $130 million and BlackRock’s IBIT at $36 million. The products have recorded more than $1.5 billion in net outflows since Dec. 19, pausing an impressive run in the first half of the month that saw nearly $2 billion in net inflows.

According to Russian news outlet Tsargrad TV , Delimkhanov stated that starting from Jan. 1, 2025 cryptocurrency mining will be deemed illegal in the Chechen Republic. Therefore, anyone found mining crypto in the region will be punished severely. “We will equate them with terrorists, since their actions harm the whole society,” the deputy said, adding that he was relaying the words of Chechen Head of State Ramzan Kadyrov. Delimkhanov explained that crypto mining could lead to problems with the stability of electricity in certain region, affecting the daily lives of citizens. This is due to the large demand of electricity needed to power crypto mining systems, he said, which could disrupt the flow of electricity. He warned that if crypto mining activities are found to result in electricity problems in Russian districts, villages or cities, then the authorities will respond quickly and put crypto miners behind bars.

It also extends to areas in the Irkutsk Region, Buryatia, and Zabaikalsky during peak hours. Lawmakers claim crypto mining has caused significant electricity deficits, making it impossible to provide large power capacities until at least 2030. The ban is said to take effect in November and will remain effective until March 15, 2031. The crypto mining ban follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s signing of a crypto circulation bill that gives Russian lawmakers the power to ban cryptocurrency mining in specific regions.

Van de Poppe tells his 169,000 YouTube subscribers that he expects Bitcoin to rally by approximately 60% over the course of 2025. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is primed to enjoy an extended bullish cycle over the coming months. “I do not expect Bitcoin to peak in 2025 because I expect that there’s way more money needed to actually move Bitcoin upwards or to move it into the markets. That’s why I think that the cycles are going to extend and they are more based on macro perspectives rather than the four-year cycle with halvings. So I think that within this year, we’re going to see Bitcoin breaking through $150,000 and stay there for a little while until we can start expanding into 2026.” According to Van de Poppe, Bitcoin’s rally will be partially driven by the macro-economic catalysts. “We can see that the global money supply starts to increase while the US money supply is just lagging behind. There’s still a lot to come from the US and I think that in 2025, the labor markets are going to be weaker, the chances of having a recession have increased and through that the US money supply will quickly expand through which Bitcoin [will] continue to have its momentum.” The crypto analyst and trader, however, says that Bitcoin will not have a smooth ride to the cycle peak. “That said I also expect to see significant corrections in between. I do assume that at the end of Q1 of 2025, we’re going to have a correction of 30%, very much comparable to what we’ve seen in 2024.” Bitcoin is trading at $93,790 at time of writing.

Top Expert Predicts Big Rally,https://coingape.com/will-xrp-price-surge-to-11-top-expert-predicts-big-rally/,"XRP price has continued to stay in the red, as investors appeared to have taken a pause amid the holiday sentiment. However, as the crypto still holds above the brief $2 mark, the experts remained optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin. A top expert has recently predicted a potential rally for Ripple’s native crypto in 2025, which could push the crypto to a new high of $11. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $11 The XRP price is likely to end the ongoing year on a low note after a robust rally over the past few months. However, despite that, the experts have maintained a bullish outlook for the crypto, showcasing their growing confidence towards the asset amid a flurry of positive market developments. For context, top expert Ali Martinez recently said that the crypto is gearing up for a massive rally ahead. In a recent X post, Martinez said that “one of the most promising setup” for XRP appeared as we are entering the New Year. Besides, he predicted that this setup indicates a potential rally for Ripple’s native crypto to $11 over the next few months. Source: Ali Martinez, X This comes in tandem with other expert’s forecasts, which also indicate a potential rebound in the crypto’s price ahead. For context, popular crypto market expert EGRAG CRYPTO recently said that Ripple’s coin could target the $4 next if it holds above the brief $2 support. On the other hand, other positive market developments also suggest a potential rally for the asset. For context, a flurry of market participants anticipates the dismissal of the XRP Lawsuit under the incoming US SEC Chair Paul Atkins. If this holds true, this could significantly boost the investors’ sentiment, which in turn could also push the price higher. Market Sentiment Remains Strong For Ripple’s Coin XRP price today slumped about 1.2% and exchanged hands at $2.03, while its one-day trading volume rose 47% to $6.11 billion. Notably, the crypto has maintained the $2 over the last 24 hours, while touching a high of $2.14 in the same timeframe. Besides, Future Open Interest for Ripple’s coin was up 2% despite the recent dip in price, according to CoinGlass data . Simultaneously, a flurry of market experts also remained confident about the future trajectory of the coin. In a separate X post, Ali Martinez said “The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the XRP daily chart”, which suggests a “big price movement” ahead. Source: Ali Martinez, X On the other hand, another top expert Dark Defender recently said that as long as Ripple’s native crypto holds above the $1.95, “a breakout is imminent.” Besides, he has also set an initial target of $5.85 for the crypto. In addition, he also said that the crypto could face a correction in the daily charts for around 10 days. Source: Dark Defender, X However, he also noted that a “bull flag” appeared for the XRP price. This indicates that once the correction phase for the crypto is over, it could potentially rally to $8.65 next. Despite that, investors should remain cautious, as a recent Ripple price analysis hints at a potential crash to $1 ahead, before a strong recovery. The post Will XRP Price Surge to $11?

Reiterating its long-held anti-crypto stance , the RBI highlighted the various risks involved with digital assets in its Dec. 30 Financial Stability Report for 2024. While crypto adoption flourished at the grassroots level in India this year, the RBI raised a red flag, warning that unchecked use of digital assets, including stablecoins, could loosen monetary reins, open backdoors for capital flight, and “divert resources available for financing the real economy.” According to the regulator, while the crypto market in India “remains small,” the narrowing gap between decentralized and traditional finance could pose systemic risks, with stablecoins carrying the added danger of potential run risks . Citing the International Monetary Fund – Financial Stability Board report, the RBI added that stablecoin issuers are becoming significant holders of mainstream financial assets, such as government securities and other collateral, raising concerns about their impact on economic stability. Stablecoins also pose unique challenges, particularly in emerging markets where “country-specific macroeconomic and demographic factors” have led to increased usage, the report stated, adding: “These developments can undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy, circumvent capital controls, strain fiscal resources, and threaten financial stability.” You might also like: India risks losing $2b in tax revenue as crypto traders shift to offshore platforms: report Over the years, India’s central bank has pushed central bank digital currencies as a more reliable alternative to stablecoins. During the G30 39th Annual International Banking Seminar in October, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das labeled stablecoins as private money, which could undermine government sovereignty by allowing private issuers to dominate the payments market. Tokenization is another area that concerns the RBI due to the sector’s potential to “deepen the interconnectedness between the traditional financial system and the decentralized financial system.” Although the market for tokenization remains in its early stages, the RBI is worried about the risks it could introduce, including “liquidity and maturity mismatches,” excessive borrowing or debt built on tokenized assets, “asset price and quality risks,” and “operational fragilities.” The report stressed that these vulnerabilities could spill over into the broader financial system, amplifying systemic risks. The RBI’s warning comes as India’s cryptocurrency sector continues to drift in regulatory limbo. Despite calls for regularity clarity, the government recently admitted that there is “no fixed timeline” for introducing a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets. Meanwhile, India’s crypto market remains burdened by a tax regime seen as overly harsh, with a 30% capital gains tax, a 1% TDS on every transaction, and no provision to offset losses. According to a recent report , this is triggering capital flight, yielding considerable revenue losses for both the government in the form of uncollected taxes and domestic crypto service providers due to declining trading activity as traders shift to offshore exchanges.

Cardano and Dogwifhat are on the road to recovery, both these coins and ICO star DTX Exchange are must-haves for any growth portfolio in 2025. Table of Contents Cardano gains 8.5% in weekly charts Dogwifhat trying to revive the meme coin hype DTX Exchange: Investors gain 17% overnight Conclusion As Christmas week comes to an end, the markets are optimistic, and the Dogwifhat (WIF) and Cardano (ADA) charts turn green. Many other coins also saw green phases but could not sustain it for long. As the markets resume their positive movements and there is a bullish trend overall, experts predict there will be a more cautious approach to crypto investment. The predictions are also more muted, and upward projections are revised. Both Cardano and Dogwifhat have different things going for them. While Cardano is a technically strong and high utility, scalable network with PoS support, Dogwifhat is a popular meme coin that is supported by a robust community. While both these coins have positives, experts predict that the new hybrid trading platform DTX Exchange (DTX) is also poised for phenomenal growth in 2025. It is already listed on the aggregator platform CoinMarketCap. It is also gaining attention for its Phoenix Wallet, which offers non-custodial transaction support. Cardano gains 8.5% in weekly charts ADA has recovered 8.5% in the weekly charts and gained over 3.5% in the daily charts. Issues with the network and internal conflict have raised concerns about the financial management of investors’ funds and other governance issues. This had caused some negative movement. Source: CoinMarketCap The Cardano price touched $1.3 in early December before dropping to the $1.2 range. It eventually fell to the $0.77 low after the FOMC meeting and has recovered to its current range of $0.89. Market volume is up 24% to $855.67 million, while the market cap is currently $31.6 billion, up by almost 4%. Dogwifhat trying to revive the meme coin hype Dogwifhat is one of the cutest meme coins, with its Shiba Inu dog with a pink knitted hat symbol. The altcoin is built on the Solana blockchain and keeps a light-hearted approach that matches its fun-loving origins. Like most meme coins, the Dogwifhat price is usually volatile and reflects the market and external pricing influences effectively. With a strong community making the meme coin exciting, Dogwifhat (WIF) is a good choice for its big rewards and risks. Source: CoinMarketCap The WIF is trading around $1.89, up by over 2% in the daily charts. Community sentiment is bullish, while the market volume is up 3% to $248.88 million, and the market cap is currently $1.88 billion, up by almost 2%.

It has raised $10.69 million in its 7th round of public presales. The project attracts attention with a CoinMarketCap listing, a phenomenal transaction speed of 0.04 seconds, and a potential price increment of 1,000%. With its advanced trading features, DTX allows traders to trade in multiple asset markets. The platform supports trades in over 120,000 trading instruments, like stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex, and bonds. The team has also used a hybrid layer-1 blockchain and a non-custodial Phoenix Wallet, already available on Apple and Android. DTX Exchange is set to see significant growth with its DTX tokens, which are currently priced at $0.14 in the ongoing presale and expected to rise to $1 once the platform launches live trading. Investors gained 17% as the DTX token rose from $0.12 to $0.14 Conclusion DTX is the best crypto investment now with its mix of efficiency, accessibility, and creativity. The objective of DTX Exchange is fundamentally security and user control. The platform guarantees traders have total control of their assets by using non-custodial storage and wallet-based trading, establishing a safe environment unlike those of conventional exchanges. Investors will do well to include it, as well as Cardano and Dogwifhat in their 2025 portfolio. To learn more about DTX, visit the presale website , the official website , and join the community.

As is known, the cryptocurrency market grew incredibly under the leadership of Bitcoin in 2024, and the BTC price exceeded $ 100,000, leaving behind the psychological barrier that was once considered insurmountable. However, some altcoins broke records in terms of the number of daily active addresses on their blockchain networks in 2024. The list contains some surprising rankings in terms of size. It is particularly noteworthy that the Ethereum network did not make it into the top 10 on the list, and instead, many layer 2 protocols were on the list. Here are the blockchain networks with the highest number of daily active addresses and their average user numbers in 2024: Near (NEAR) – 2.7 million Solana (SOL) – 2.6 million Tron (TRX) – 1.9 million BNB Chain (BNB) – 1 million Polygon (POL) – 855 thousand Base – 655 thousand Sui (SUI) – 519 thousand Bitcoin (BTC) – 496 thousand The Open Network (TON) 414 thousand Arbitrum (ARB) – 413 thousand The reason why the layer 2 protocols on the list are so popular is that they are much faster and lower cost than the layer 1 protocol Ethereum. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that Bitcoin, which does not have many DeFi features, is also at the bottom of the list. *This is not investment advice.

DOGEN rises in the Solana ecosystem, aiming for a $10 milestone by year’s end, outpacing rivals BONK and WIF with its bold vision and explosive potential. Table of Contents DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for true alphas BONK faces volatility Dogwifhat dips Conclusion An exciting shift is happening in the Solana ecosystem with the emergence of DOGEN. Predictions suggest this new token could climb to $10 by the year’s end, outpacing competitors like BONK and WIF. This potential surge has caught the attention of the crypto community, sparking curiosity and speculation about DOGEN’s future impact on the market. DOGEN: The ultimate meme token for true alphas DOGEN is set to explode with a 700% surge expected before the presale even ends, and that’s just the start. This token is heating up for the kind of thousand-fold gains that define meme coin success. Traders can get in early to see gains. DOGEN is the new alpha of the Solana blockchain, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with heavyweights like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, all of which hit 1000% gains at their peak.

This token isn’t just a cryptocurrency, it’s a lifestyle. From exclusive perks to record-breaking gains, DOGEN is a ticket to the top. Interested users can grab DOGEN today. BONK faces volatility BONK is a Shiba Inu-inspired memecoin on the Solana blockchain, created to redistribute power within the ecosystem by moving away from venture capital dominance. It gained widespread recognition after a 100% surge following its Coinbase listing, solidifying its position as a community-driven token. A hallmark of BONK’s approach was the airdrop of 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors, further integrating it into the blockchain’s ecosystem. BONK is currently trading at $0.00003108, reflecting a 3.9% decrease in the last 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $2.36b, it ranks #42 among cryptocurrencies. The 24-hour trading volume stands at $309.74m, indicating growing investor interest. Dogwifhat dips Dogwifhat is a dog-themed memecoin on the Solana blockchain, inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme. As a meme coin, WIF prioritizes community engagement and viral appeal, aiming to capture attention through fun and relatability rather than traditional utility. Joining the trend of dog-themed tokens, WIF brings its unique character to the ever-popular meme coin space. Over the past week, WIF has shown a 4.8% loss, currently priced at $1.82. Ranked at #63, its market cap has reached $1.81b supported by a trading volume of $390.22m over 7 days. Conclusion DOGEN emerges as a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. With BONK and WIF showing less short-term potential, DOGEN is building a community of market leaders. It offers real benefits like exclusive campaigns for early adopters. Following successful tokens like Popcat, DOGEN aims for record-breaking success this altcoin season. For more information, visit the official DOGEN website and join the community on X and Telegram .

Barron referred to the recent surge in activity as a “perfect storm” for XRP and its underlying technology. According to Barron’s, trustlines on XRPL have seen a dramatic increase since December as more users begin to realize the network’s potential. Trustlines allow users to establish lending relationships on XRPL, and their growth is often seen as a sign of expanding adoption and usage. “In December, trustlines started to explode because people started to realize what was going on,” Barron said. According to the analyst, this increase in Trustlines was accompanied by two other key indicators of XRPL’s growing ecosystem: DEX Volume: Decentralized exchange (DEX) activity on XRPL has been on the rise, reflecting increased trading and token issuance. Active Addresses: The number of active addresses continues to increase, indicating continued user participation and network activity. Related News: Onchain Data Reveals: This Cryptocurrency Whale Made $49 Million in Profits on One Altcoin Today, Now Buys Another Altcoin Barron’s also noted a wave of profit-taking by former XRP holders earlier in the year, following a period of significant price appreciation. However, this trend changed in December as new participants entered the market, resulting in a revival in activity. “A lot of old holders basically sold their XRP because they saw that they were making a profit for the first time. So what happened here in early December? Boom, trust lines started to explode,” he said. Barron emphasized that these developments pave the way for something much bigger: “What you have here is a perfect storm that is starting to form with XRP and where this technology is going.” *This is not investment advice.

A Comprehensive Review,https://thecoinrise.com/is-now-wallet-safe-to-use-in-2025-a-comprehensive-review/,"As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve, users attach immense importance to security, transparency, and reliability of crypto solutions. In this review, we’ll delve into the security features of NOW Wallet , a self-custodial wallet developed by its parent non-custodial exchange ChangeNOW , along with its trustworthiness as revealed by user feedback. Security Features of NOW Wallet 1. Non-Custodial Structure By design, NOW Wallet is a self-custodial wallet, meaning users maintain complete control over their private keys and digital assets. The NOW Wallet’s non-custodial feature grants users complete control over their funds. Everything is stored on the user’s devices. No private keys, backup files, or any user data are stored on the server. Also, no third party can access private information. 2. Mnemonic Phrase Encryption Users are provided with a 12 or 24-word mnemonic recovery phrase. This comes in handy in case users lose access to their wallet and need to recover it. 3. Three-Layer Encryption NOW Wallet features a three-layer encryption process to safeguard sensitive data like private keys in addition to biometric authentication. NOW Wallet users can pair the traditional pin-based access with fingerprint or facial scans for extra protection. 4.

As Bitcoin fell to the $92,000 price level in the past 24 hours, altcoins followed suit, turning red as well. However, an analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Jason Marks, suggests a bullish turn for altcoins may be on the horizon. He identified a fractal that could send the altcoins soaring. Altcoin Fractal Hints at Significant Growth According to Marks’ chart , the fractal could push the altcoin market cap to $1.85 trillion. Currently, the total altcoin market valuation stands at $925 billion. However, the ongoing altcoin correction needs to end before such gains are possible.

One of his biggest promises to the American people is to improve the country’s economy, and his sights are well set on the banking sector, which happens to be at the center of a controversy dubbed “debanking.” More than a year after Nigel Farage spoke about debanking in the United Kingdom, debates are heating up in the United States. Popular voices, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and tech magnate Elon Musk, have raised concerns about individuals and businesses losing access to the banking system, allegedly due to political affiliations or ties to cryptocurrency. Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Netscape and influential investor, highlighted the issue during a late-November interview with podcast host Joe Rogan. Andreessen alleged that banks are targeting individuals on the political right, labeling them as “politically exposed” and severing financial ties. He further claimed that banks, under pressure from the Biden administration, have been systematically shutting down accounts tied to cryptocurrency-related businesses. US Banks’ tense relationship with crypto: Voices rise in volumes “ In the past four years, I know 30 tech company founders who have been debanked ,” Andreessen stated, igniting a wave of anecdotes from social media users reporting similar experiences. His comments added fuel to the fire, prompting widespread discussion about the politicization of banking practices. Elon Musk weighed in on the matter via X, calling debanking an example of government overreach. Musk argued that politically motivated account closures should be considered a federal crime.

Reports that her son Barron was also denied a bank account have added to the financial bias “allegations.” On the political right, these actions have been collectively dubbed “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” referencing an Obama-era initiative that sought to limit banking access for controversial industries such as payday lending. David Sacks, the incoming AI and cryptocurrency czar for the Trump administration, has vowed to examine the issue. He gave his sentiments on the matter, saying, “ There are too many stories of people being hurt by Operation Choke Point 2.0 .” Is there something like too much bureaucracy? Critics of debanking argue that bureaucratic hurdles and regulatory pressures are driving banks to sever ties with certain clients. Since the financial crisis of 2008, banks have faced thousands of pages of new regulations and billions of dollars in fines, leading to a more risk-averse approach. When banks terminate client relationships, the reasoning is often vague, fueling speculation that they are making politically motivated decisions. Regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), insist that they do not direct banks to drop specific customers. However, in 2022, the FDIC advised banks to inform them of any plans to engage with cryptocurrency businesses, which begs the question of whether account closures are a matter of choice or coincidence. Edward Fishman, a former State Department official and author of Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare , stated, “ With crypto becoming more intertwined with the formal financial system and banking sector, banks are petrified of running afoul of sanctions .” AI and crypto adoption growth is slow: Is Biden responsible? The debanking debate is just one aspect of broader concerns about government overreach. Critics of the Biden administration argue that its actions have stifled emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency, by exploiting regulatory chokepoints . Marc Andreessen revealed that he was warned against funding AI startups during a meeting with White House officials earlier this year. Administration aides allegedly indicated plans to create a “regulatory moat” around select AI companies they could control. Some officials reportedly went as far as suggesting that certain areas of mathematics could be classified, echoing Cold War-era restrictions on physics research. These claims have raised alarm about the potential politicization of technological development. In 2022, the Biden administration reportedly issued an executive order supporting the exploration of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Accompanying this move was a white paper advocating for policies to “limit or eliminate” Bitcoin mining . By 2024, the administration implemented a 30% excise tax on electricity used by Bitcoin miners and imposed mandatory energy audits on large mining operations. These measures sparked lawsuits from crypto companies, which ultimately succeeded in court. Critics argue that these actions were designed to centralize control over digital assets and restrict miners’ access to essential resources such as energy. “Unplugging,” as it has been termed, mirrors the alleged debanking strategy to control cryptocurrency through indirect means. Trump’s administration promises reforms President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration has vowed to address the debanking scandal and related issues. David Sacks has called for an investigation into regulatory agencies, including the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Reserve’s prudential regulatory division. Forward this video to friends & family to understand just how evil the government has been pic.twitter.com/XgRnikMK6J — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) November 29, 2024 Former Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks has also suggested revisiting “fair access” rules that would require banks to provide services unless they have a legitimate financial reason to terminate a relationship. The Trump team proposed reforms that aim to ensure neutrality in banking practices and safeguard access to financial services for lawful activities. Critics of debanking hope these measures will prevent further weaponization of the banking system and foster an environment of fair access for all industries, regardless of political or regulatory pressures.

The asset management giant anticipates a shift from speculation to utility as crypto technologies become integral to global systems. Crypto ETFs, US Regulations and More Prediction by Franklin Templeton US SEC Likely to Approve More Crypto ETFs Analysts at Franklin Templeton believe that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the leadership of Paul Atkins will bring favorable crypto regulatory rules approving more crypto ETF products in the market. The Bitcoin ETFs have hit multiple milestones in 2024, recording more than $500 billion in cumulative trading volume since January 2024. The spot Bitcoin ETF launch has been pretty successful with total AUM crossing $100 billion in the first year itself. Of these, BlackRock’s IBIT alone contributes to more than $52 billion in AUM. This ETF has surpassed the size of nearly 50 European market-focused ETFs that have been active for over two decades. Moreover, $IBIT has recorded an impressive average daily notional options volume of $1.7 billion over the past three months. Bloomberg strategist James Seyyfart wrote: “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter Following this success, Franklin Templeton analysts believe that other Crypto ETFs for Litecoin , XRP, Solana, HBAR etc. will see approval. The approval of the spot XRP ETF could trigger a massive surge to double digital and beyond for the Ripple cryptocurrency. Apart from crypto ETFs, Franklin believes that 2025 could be the year for tokenized securities. Favorable policies could reestablish the U.S. as a global hub for crypto innovation, it added. Stablecoin Frameworks and TradFi Integration Franklin Templeton foresees a stablecoin regulatory framework in the U.S., paving the way for major financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Top market players like Ripple are already in the race to launch its RLUSD stablecoin while Tether looks to further consolidate its position in the expanding stablecoin market. Banks in the United States and Europe are accelerating plans to issue stablecoins, driven by increasing regulatory clarity and rising market demand. The rollout of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and a growing global appetite for blockchain-based payment solutions have pushed traditional financial institutions to challenge established crypto players like Tether Holdings. This development will drive growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and foster convergence between traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto infrastructure, reported Franklin Templeton . Bitcoin Penetration, DePin, AI and Crypto Convergence Bitcoin’s Growing Dominance in Global Finance Analysts at Franklin Templeton believe that Bitcoin will further solidify its status as a global financial asset, with sovereign nations and institutions adding BTC to their reserves . As a result, financial players are launching new ETF products having links to Bitcoin. Earlier this week, Bitwise applied for a Bitcoin Standard Company ETF which will track companies like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Metaplanet, holding Bitcoin in its treasury. This ETF will track crypto firms holding at least 1,000 BTC, with a market cap of at least $100 million, and average daily liquidity of $1 million. Additionally, Franklin analysts believe that decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) will gain traction, addressing real-world applications in logistics and IoT through decentralized solutions. AI and Crypto Convergence The integration of AI and blockchain technology will accelerate, with blockchains providing transparency and verification in the AI-driven economy. AI agents are likely to leverage blockchain for automating on-chain transactions, portfolio management, and merging digital content with on-chain activities. Top AI crypto Near Protocol (NEAR), The Internet Computer (ICP), and Render (RNDR) will be on investors’ radar very soon. Franklin Templeton concludes that 2025 will mark a pivotal transition, as regulatory clarity and technological advances position crypto as a cornerstone of global finance and operations.

Meta has been improving its artificial intelligence tools since last year. It introduced new AI products across different platforms like Facebook. This includes hundreds of thousands of characters created in July when they launched AI character-creation tools. These AI characters are currently private, but Meta expects them to be a standard feature on the platform in the years ahead. The profiles will operate very much like regular user accounts, Meta’s vice president of product for generative AI Connor Hayes told the Financial Times . He added that users would “have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform.” Meta plans to launch AI-generated text-to-video tools For the next two years, Meta will prioritize investments in AI development to make its platforms more engaging and fun. At the moment, users can use Meta’s AI for photo editing or creating an AI assistant. Furthermore, Meta is planning to launch new text-to-video tools that will enable content creators to be on AI-generated videos. However, experts are worried about the fast growth of the number of people using AI. They believe strong protections are needed to keep these AI accounts from spreading false information. Becky Owen, who was chief marketing officer at Billion Dollar Boy and previously head of Meta’s creator innovations team, warned, “Without robust safeguards, platforms risk amplifying false narratives through these AI-driven accounts.” She also fears that there will be too many AI profiles on the platform, which may attract less genuine content. As Owen pointed out, AI personas don’t have real-life experiences or emotions and are far less relatable than human creators. A Meta spokesperson pointed to the benefits of AI tools to Fox Business . He said its AI Studio allows anyone to create and have AI characters based on their interests. These characters can be “used for utility, fun or support,” helping in cooking, giving fashion advice, or providing daily affirmations. At the same time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in April that it may take a few years to realize the full potential of their AI technology. He believes it’s been a wise investment, both for the company and its investors, as the “initial signs are quite positive here.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",AI|Meta,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-31 09:21:19

Gemini Case Delayed to January 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/trial-in-cftc-v-gemini-case-delayed-to-january-2025/,"The highly anticipated trial between the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Gemini Trust Company has been delayed, marking another turn in the ongoing legal battle. Originally scheduled for January 13, 2025, the trial will now commence on January 21, according to a December 30 filing by Judge Alvin Hellerstein in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Hellerstein stated that no further delays would be permitted. Impact of Political Changes on Crypto Regulation The rescheduling places the trial just after the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, an event that could significantly influence the CFTC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The political transition comes amidst heightened scrutiny of the crypto industry and raises questions about whether the new administration will adopt a more industry-friendly stance. Trump is reportedly considering replacing CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam with a pro-crypto figure, a move that could reshape the regulatory landscape. Behnam, whose term is set to expire in June 2026, has overseen significant enforcement actions against crypto entities, including FTX, Celsius, and Binance. The CFTC’s aggressive approach has already resulted in more than $17 billion in monetary relief during the 2024 fiscal year, primarily from actions against digital asset firms. The case against Gemini, initially filed in June 2022 , alleges that the company made false or misleading statements to the commission during its 2017 application to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. The CFTC seeks disgorgement of alleged ill-gotten gains, monetary penalties, and injunctions against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. A Crucial Moment for Crypto Regulation The timing of this trial could mark a critical juncture for the crypto sector. The composition of the CFTC, led by a five-member panel serving staggered terms, might gain additional authority if Congress passes legislation clarifying its jurisdiction over digital assets. With Trump’s administration signaling potential changes in leadership , the trial may serve as a barometer for the regulatory climate under the new government. As the crypto industry watches closely, the outcome of this case may set a precedent for how regulatory bodies like the CFTC navigate the balance between enforcement and fostering innovation.

Unlike speculative assets, Lightchain AI’s utility-driven approach, which integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain, offers real-world applications that appeal to high-net-worth investors. The platform’s standout feature, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), enables scalable and efficient AI computations, creating opportunities across diverse sectors like healthcare, logistics, and finance. This aligns with the whales’ strategy to diversify into projects with long-term potential and practical utility. Furthermore, the presale price of $0.004 presents an irresistible entry point for those seeking substantial returns. Cardano whales view Lightchain AI not only as a lucrative investment but also as a technological innovator poised to lead the next phase of blockchain adoption and growth. Presale Hype and Future Expectations The buzz surrounding Lightchain AI’s presale is undeniable, with expectations of an unprecedented 800x growth from its initial valuation captivating investors. This hype is fueled by the platform’s innovative use of blockchain and artificial intelligence, offering practical applications across multiple industries, including logistics, healthcare, and decentralized finance. The presale price of $0.004 has drawn attention from both retail investors and institutional whales, presenting an early opportunity to gain exposure to a token with immense growth potential. Analysts foresee Lightchain AI becoming a pivotal player in the crypto market, thanks to its unique utility-driven approach and strong community backing. As the project continues to gain momentum, expectations are high for significant returns, making the current presale a critical phase for those looking to be part of the next big wave in blockchain innovation. Can Lightchain AI Live Up to the Expectations? The buzz surrounding Lightchain AI has set high expectations, with investors and analysts eagerly speculating on its potential to deliver massive returns. While projections of an 8,000x hike might seem ambitious, the fundamentals backing Lightchain AI provide a solid foundation for such optimism. Its innovative integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain through features like the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) sets it apart in a crowded market. Additionally, its utility-driven focus targets real-world applications across industries such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, ensuring long-term relevance and adoption. The presale success, with tokens priced at $0.004, has already drawn significant interest from whales and retail investors alike. While the path to meteoric growth is challenging, Lightchain AI’s robust roadmap, strong community support, and technological edge make it well-positioned to meet, if not surpass, these lofty expectations. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The analyst, who has amassed an audience of over 190,000 followers on X, highlighted several projects that he believes have the potential to dominate in the potential coming altseason. Best Altcoins In 2025 He begins with Render (RNDR), describing it as a decentralized GPU rendering platform for AI, metaverse, and creative content. He maintained that “Render is poised to become a key player in the virtual future,” pointing to its $3.66 billion market capitalization as evidence of investor confidence. Following closely is Virtual, an AI-driven avatar initiative that is pegged at $3.41 billion in market cap, with Wacy touting Virtual as “the growth leader in 2024 in the virtual avatar sector” and predicting increasing adoption for metaverse, gaming, and social media applications. Wacy also turns his attention to SEKOIA, mentioning its focus on identifying and mentoring emerging AI talent. Although smaller in scale at a $94 million market cap, this autonomous AI investment agent uses advanced pattern recognition and quantifiable predictions to gain a foothold in a competitive space. Related Reading: Altcoins To Explode In Early 2025: Analyst Says “Grand Finale” Is Around The Corner Next in line for the best altcoins in 2025 is Pengu, which he calls “the official coin of Paddy Penguin, a major force in crypto.” Its substantial community and cultural traction reflect a hefty $2.28 billion market valuation, and its omnipresence in ETF ads combined with over 90 billion visits appear to confirm its cult-like following. The list of best altcoins continues with Clearpool (CPOOL), a Decentralized Capital Markets Ecosystem valued at $341 million that provides insured loans to institutional borrowers in the DeFi arena through a dynamic interest model. The analyst noted that Clearpool’s approach to decentralized lending could offer a unique avenue for strategic investors. He also spotlights Bittensor (Tao), a project intent on decentralizing AI solutions through an open ecosystem, weighed at $3.48 billion, and Hyperliquid (HYPE), a decentralized perpetuals exchange living on its own L1 with a $9.23 market cap. He describes Hype’s vision as “a high-speed, low-cost, transparent solution for perpetual futures,” though he advises caution, remarking that prospective investors should “research to understand its risks and potential.” Io.net, which sits at $397 million, is categorized as a decentralized GPU network that reduces costs for AI developers, while CFG (Centric) aims to bridge DeFi with real-world assets. This $162 million project focuses on stable returns generated from real fiat value rather than solely leveraging volatile crypto. Akash Network (AKT), valued at $746 million, is labeled by Wacy a “supercloud” that transforms cloud computing through a decentralized marketplace, and Ethena (ENA), at $2.69 billion, provides a synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum, touted as “a crypto-native, bank-free solution for money.” Wacy’s list also featured Helium (HNT) with a $1.13 billion market cap, identified for its decentralized IoT network, and Griffain in the Solana ecosystem, with a $211 million market cap, delivering scalable DeFi solutions for token swaps while upholding transparency. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 The analyst also highlights Grasso (GRASS) in his list of the best altcoins for 2025 and its $683 million market cap, describing its decentralized data collection network for AI training as both functional and user-friendly. VitaDAO (VITA) is in Wacy’s focus because of its community-governed DAO funding longevity research. Its compact $54 million market cap appears poised for growth as members actively engage in decision-making and ownership, signifying a communal approach to biotech research in crypto. Spectral, carrying a $194 million market cap, offers on-chain agents for easier application creation and includes a syntax tool that transforms natural language into Solidity. ETIGEN, or Energy Layer, at $170 million, extends novel concepts of restorative energy on Ethereum, and ONDO, with an impressive $2.83 billion market cap, aims to open up institutional-grade DeFi services and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Wacy further singles out AIXTB, at $377M, which monitors crypto-related discussions via a proprietary engine to uncover high-sentiment opportunities, and Ether.fi (ETHFI), priced at $446M, which supports non-custodial ETH staking and DeFi integration. Throughout his breakdown, he underscored the cyclical nature of the crypto market, stating that these best altcoins “could see significant growth in 2025” once capital flow rotates away from Bitcoin and into high-potential altcoin narratives. His overall thesis hinges on what he perceives as a predictable pattern in every major market cycle. “Altcoins typically pumping when BTC Dominance starts a strong downtrend,” the analyst wrote. He cited the example from 2021, when Bitcoin’s dominance fell from around 73% to 40%, triggering a monumental rally for altcoins like SOL, ADA, and DOGE. Pointing out that current BTC dominance is about 55%, which he calls a “significant resistance zone,” he predicts a swift drop to 40% if a breakdown occurs. “As I mentioned before, my bet for the altseason is in the spring of 2025,” he said, while admitting that he also shares the common sentiment of disbelief that surrounds every cycle. “That’s okay, it means the market is doing a good job of ‘smoking people out.’ Patience friends, patience always pays off,” he concluded. At press time, the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) stood at 58.02%.

Will the Token Unlock Harm the SOL Price in 2025?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/is-it-a-good-time-to-buy-solana-will-the-token-unlock-harm-the-sol-price-in-2025/,"The post Is It a Good Time to Buy Solana? Will the Token Unlock Harm the SOL Price in 2025? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana’s price has been juggling within a narrow range after dropping from the threshold at $200. Meanwhile, support levels have risen from $175 to $186, suggesting the buyers are slowly gaining control over the rally. This may further help the price maintain a healthy ascending trend. Besides, the volume continues to drain, which suggests the traders are looking for the right entry range. The current trade setup propounds that the SOL price is in a demand zone. Therefore, accumulating within the range may attract massive gains. The top fourth crypto, Solana, gains momentum with the new ETF filings, potentially boosting mainstream adoption and regulatory dynamics. In the last 24 hours, the price has been fighting extreme bearish heat while the plunge is minimal even in the past 7 days. Hence, the SOL price looks promising, with a potential breakout above $300 before the end of Q1 2025. Meanwhile, the Solana platform is about to face a major hurdle in Q1 2025, which could delay the possibility of a new ATH. SOL Token Unlock in March: How Will the Price Reach $300? After gaining centre stage in the crypto markets, Solana is about to mark a significant milestone in March 2025. The platform is about to unlock over 112 million SOL tokens worth over $2.14 billion. These are the tokens that were held by the FTX exchange and sold at a discounted price to firms like Figure Markets and Pantera Capital, which rather displayed a huge institutional interest in the token. Therefore, by unlocking nearly 23% of the circulating supply, a major impact on the SOL price rally is expected, hence placing the token within a decisive phase. Meanwhile, the price is currently within the same phase, which is expected to remain for another few days until it reaches the edge. The daily chart of Solana suggests the price is trading within an ascending triangle on a small scale within a decisive symmetrical triangle in a wider landscape. The price is trading along the ascending trend line and the technicals suggest a rise to the immediate resistance zone between $197 and $200.22 in a short while. After rising above the range, the price could achieve an important resistance at the 50-day MA at $205.13 before testing the major resistance of the decisive symmetrical triangle close to $210. There are fewer chances of a bearish pullback as the MACD levels display a drop in the selling pressure while the levels are about to undergo a bullish crossover. Besides, the token is experiencing a massive volume squeeze. Hence, a massive breakout in the buying volume could eventually elevate the levels to the crucial resistance at $216. Once these levels are secured, the upper resistance zone between $224 & $228 and $242 and $246 could be triggered, followed by a rise beyond the current ATH. The Solana chain has swelled heavily in 2024, offering tough competition to the big chains like Ethereum. Although Ethereum dominated public token sales, raising $552 million with 559 projects launched, Solana followed with $324 million and 152 projects. Despite this, Solana managed to outperform Ethereum in terms of transaction volume and count. The platform faced numerous outrages and regardless of this, the market participants remain bullish on Solana. As a result, the SOL price is expected to maintain an elevated trend and mark new highs in 2025.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-31 09:34:05

However, analysts and public figures predict a significant rally, with targets ranging from $340,000 to $1 million. Shiba Inu announced a 44-episode podcast for 2025, but some doubt its launch due to past unmet promises. Cardano (ADA) plunged to $0.84, but recent whale purchases hint at a potential price recovery and bullish momentum. BTC Price Explosion Incoming? Despite its brief spike to almost $100,000 around Christmas, Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a downtrend in the past few weeks. On December 30, its price dumped to a one-month low of around $91,300. Shortly after, the bulls managed to recover some of the losses, pushing the valuation to nearly $95,000. However, the past several hours offered another retreat, with BTC currently trading at around $93,700 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The asset’s latest pullback occurred shortly after MicroStrategy made another crypto purchase. As CryptoPotato reported , the company spent over $200 million to buy 2,136 BTC. Thus, its stash reached 446,000 BTC, which, at current rates, equals more than $41 billion. It is worth noting that this was the eight consecutive Monday MicroStrategy announced a Bitcoin purchase. While, in theory, the company’s actions reduce the asset’s supply on the open market, in many cases, the disclosures were followed by immediate corrections. Contrary to BTC’s shaky performance as of late , numerous industry participants and well-known figures remain optimistic that another bull run could be in the cards. For instance, the X user 0xNobler suggested that the asset’s next rally could start next month. “BTC has just reached its second breakout, and the next target is $340,000,” the analyst envisioned. The NBA legend Scottie Pippen was even more bullish, setting a target of $1 million. Interestingly, in September, he said that he had a dream with the anonymous creator of BTC, Satoshi Nakamoto, who told him that the cryptocurrency’s price would hit $84,650 on November 5 this year. The valuation surpassed that mark just a week later. SHIB to Start 2025 With a Bang Earlier this week, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, revealed their intentions to launch a podcast next year. It will consist of 44 episodes and touch upon various aspects of the meme coin’s ecosystem. There will be no streaming on Wednesdays or Sundays, while the rest of the days of the week will be dedicated to particular topics. Mondays will focus on meme coins, Tuesdays on the Treat (TREAT) token (used as rewards in the ecosystem), Thursdays on tech discussions, Fridays on “shoutouts and follows ,” and Saturdays will be “all about spirituality.” “Next year will be epic, and I am so excited to share what we’ve built,” the developer said. Multiple users commenting on the post welcomed the idea. However, others cast doubts that the podcast will see the light of day, maintaining that the SHIB team made a similar promise years ago. What About ADA? Last but not least, we will touch upon Cardano’s ADA, whose price has slumped by 6% in the past week to its current $0.84. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the underperformance, some factors suggest that a resurgence could be just around the corner . On December 29, the popular X user Ali Martinez claimed that whales purchased over 20 million ADA in 48 hours. Continuous efforts in that field will leave fewer tokens available on the open market, which, combined with non-declining demand, should push the price up. Additionally, the whales’ actions could encourage smaller investors to hop on the bandwagon, thus triggering an upward momentum for ADA.

Pro-crypto policies could boost innovation and investment in the U.S. Skepticism exists about adopting a Bitcoin reserve due to U.S. dollar dominance. Donald Trump’s win in the 2024 U.S. Presidential election has sparked optimism in the crypto community. The new administration appears committed to positioning the U.S. as a global leader in the crypto market. In a recent statement, Trump declared : “Instead of attacking industries of the future, we will embrace them, including making America the world capital for crypto and Bitcoin.” This bold vision suggests a shift in U.S. economic strategy, with pro-crypto measures potentially on the way.

Issued by the Dutch financial regulator AFM, this license positions MoonPay among the first companies to gain MiCA compliance , marking a major step for the integration of cryptocurrency into the broader financial system. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation officially takes effect today, offering a standardized approach for crypto-related services across EU member states. While some major players like Binance and Tether have faced challenges with MiCA’s strict compliance requirements, MoonPay views it as a strategic opportunity for growth. The platform will now expand its fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat services throughout Europe without regulatory friction. CEO Ivan Soto-Wright described the achievement as more than just a license, calling it a “pivotal step in solidifying the crypto industry’s role in the global economy.” He emphasized MoonPay’s commitment to fostering collaboration with regulators, businesses, and users to advance the adoption of digital assets. This approval comes amid a transformative period for the crypto sector in Europe. With exchanges already being directed to delist Tether’s USDT , platforms like Coinbase are preparing for significant operational changes. However, MoonPay is now well-positioned to navigate these shifts smoothly without requiring additional regulatory investments, such as opening new offices for compliance purposes. In addition to securing MiCA approval, MoonPay has been pursuing strategic growth initiatives. Reports suggest that the company has been in discussions to acquire Helio, a DeFi payments service, for $150 million. This acquisition aligns with MoonPay’s broader ambition to strengthen its foothold in the digital payments ecosystem. The company’s recent partnerships have also contributed to its upward momentum. In October, MoonPay announced a major collaboration with Ripple, which has already shown positive results following the approval of RLUSD in the US. November further reinforced MoonPay's growth trajectory as it surpassed its 2023 trading volume records. Looking ahead, MoonPay plans to capitalize on MiCA’s regulatory clarity to scale its operations across Europe. By aligning with the new legal framework, the company aims to lead the region in digital asset services, setting a benchmark for compliance and innovation in the crypto payments space. For MoonPay, this milestone represents not just regulatory success but a gateway to becoming a dominant force in one of the world’s largest regulated crypto markets.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-31 09:38:32

In a recent analysis, Van Straten highlighted Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s letter to congressional leaders warning that the U.S. could reach its debt limit between January 14 and 23, 2025. Yellen called on Congress to take immediate action to “preserve the full faith and credit of the United States,” noting that “extraordinary measures” may be needed to prevent a federal default. The looming debt ceiling has already caused market unease. Following the announcement, U.S. stocks closed lower, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones Industrial Average losing around 1%. Bitcoin also fell, falling as much as 4% from its intraday high. Historically, debt ceiling increases have coincided with bearish signals for Bitcoin. Over the last five cycles, BTC has either declined or underperformed in the days following debt ceiling adjustments. Related News: It Was Hacked This Year: Developers of Binance-Listed Altcoin Release Statement on the Latest Situation Van Straten drew parallels between Bitcoin’s current price action and its performance during previous market cycles. Since the November 2022 low triggered by the FTX crash, Bitcoin has returned nearly 500%, closely mirroring its trajectory during the 2015-2018 and 2018-2022 cycles. However, both previous cycles have seen significant declines at this stage, which, combined with the broader economic uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling, points to potential challenges ahead for Bitcoin, according to the analyst. Adding to the uncertainty is the political transition period, which will see Donald Trump take office as President on January 20, 2025. Van Straten suggested that this date could mark a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. “It is possible that Trump’s inauguration could signal a bottom for Bitcoin,” he said, citing historical cycles and current market conditions. *This is not investment advice.

On-chain analyst Ali Martinez has drawn significant attention with his projection that XRP could rally to $11, citing key technical signals that suggest a major price move next year. “The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the $XRP daily chart, indicating a big price movement is underway!” Martinez noted in a December 31 update.

As we approach 2025, $XRP is showing one of the most promising setups, with a projected target of $11 pic.twitter.com/y5oYioHnTC — Ali (@ali_charts) December 30, 2024 Current XRP market landscape Despite the bullish outlook, XRP’s recent performance has raised eyebrows among skeptics. The token is currently trading at $1.98, down 8% over the past week, with its market capitalization slipping by $10 billion to $118 billion. These declines highlight the volatility XRP continues to face, even as it maintains its position as one of the leading cryptocurrencies. Technically, XRP is clinging to its $1.86 support level while eyeing resistance at $2.26. The $2 psychological level remains a key battleground, and a decisive break above this point could pave the way for renewed upward momentum, with XRP currently changing hands at $2.07. XRP 1-week price chart. Source: Finbold However, a drop below $1.86 could trigger additional downside, with some analysts pointing to $1.60 as the next potential floor. Notably, XRP is still trading above its 200-day simple moving average, a critical indicator of long-term bullish sentiment. The token has recorded 15 green days in the past 30, reflecting a 50% positive performance rate. While these metrics underscore XRP’s resilience, the near-term outlook remains uncertain, with traders awaiting confirmation of the next major move. XRP historical parallels Javon Marks, another crypto analyst, has drawn parallels between XRP’s current price structure and its historic 2017 bull run. “XRP’s current 3-day timeframe is looking extremely similar to that 2017 run. Prices right now may only be getting ready to come out of an ‘Intermission Phase’ before yet another ‘groundbreaking’ bullish rally!” he remarked. If this analogy holds true, XRP could be on the cusp of a major breakout. The $11 target: Realistic or ambitious? Reaching $11 would represent a nearly 6x increase from current levels, requiring a significant influx of capital and market participation and a 431% price increase. XRP’s inflationary supply dynamics and recent bearish pressures suggest that achieving $11 will not be without challenges.

The funds, untouched since 2018, have sparked concern among experts who speculate the move could signal intentions to liquidate, launder, or fund new cyber exploits . Blockchain investigator ZachXBT revealed that all the addresses involved in the transfer were last active in 2018. For newer crypto enthusiasts, the name “Blockchain Bandit” might not ring a bell, but in 2018, it was one of the most feared names in the crypto world. This hacker systematically exploited Ethereum wallets secured by weak private keys, stealing millions by simply guessing them. The attacker targeted wallets with poorly generated or non-random private keys, often caused by programming flaws or faulty cryptographic libraries. By running automated scripts, the hacker scanned the Ethereum network, identified vulnerable wallets, and swiftly transferred funds. Victims often didn’t realize they had been hacked until days later. In total, the Blockchain Bandit is believed to have stolen over 50,000 ETH from 10,000 wallets . The nickname was first coined in a 2019 WIRED article that detailed the attacker’s methods. Security analyst Adrian Bednarek was one of the first to uncover the pattern, explaining that some wallets used embarrassingly weak private keys, such as simple phrases or even the number ‘1.’ The Bandit also exploited weak passphrase-based wallets, known as brain wallets, and misconfigured Ethereum nodes. These vulnerabilities allowed the attacker to remain nearly unstoppable in their operations. The recent activity raises significant questions. Moving funds into a multi-signature wallet suggests preparation for major transactions. These could involve laundering funds through cryptocurrency mixers, decentralized exchanges, or other anonymization tools. Alternatively, the hacker might be planning to liquidate the assets, though selling such a large volume of ETH could impact its market price. Another possibility is that the hacker is waiting for market conditions to improve. A surge in Ethereum’s price would allow for maximum profits upon liquidation. However, the most troubling scenario is that the funds could be used to finance future attacks, cover transaction fees, or support new exploits across blockchain networks. This isn’t the first time the Blockchain Bandit has shown signs of activity in recent years. Some funds were moved back in January 2023 and converted into Bitcoin. However, the recent transfer marks the largest consolidation of stolen funds to date. The crypto industry is already grappling with massive losses from cyberattacks. In 2023 alone, losses reached $2.3 billion, marking a 40% increase from the previous year , with Ethereum being the hardest-hit network. The return of such a notorious hacker is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities still present in the blockchain ecosystem. Whether the funds are destined for liquidation, laundering, or further attacks, the reappearance of the Blockchain Bandit has put the crypto community on high alert.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-31 09:41:32

Most altcoins are also quite sluggish at the end of the year, with ETH losing the $3,400 mark and LINK continuing its recent downfall. BTC Eyes $94K The micro-scale at the end of the year is quite painful for BTC. The cryptocurrency stood above $108,000 two weeks ago, adding $40,000 since Trump’s landslide victory in the US presidential elections. However, the Fed’s hawkish words for 2025 reversed the asset’s trajectory, and it started losing value fast. It dumped to $92,000 that Friday and tried to recover some ground in the following week. It managed to jump toward $100,000 on a couple of occasions but was stopped at each attempt and pushed south hard. This retracement culminated yesterday as the bears initiated a notable leg down that resulted in BTC tapping a monthly low of $91,300 (on Bitstamp). As the fears of a potential breakdown beneath $90,000 went viral, the bulls managed to intervene and pushed the asset north of nearly $94,000 as of now.

This is one of several transfers he has made this year. In response, Ethereum has declined by 2%, approaching $3,300. According to data from Spot on Chain , in the past 11 hours, Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, has made substantial deposits in the crypto exchange HTX. The transfer of an additional 29,153 ETH valued at $96.7 million is one of many. Source: Spot On Chain Since November 10, the Tron founder has deposited a total of 227,000 ETH, valued at approximately $807 million, to HTX at an average price of $3,556 per ETH. Sun acquired the preponderance of these holdings in 2024 at a cost basis of approximately $3,036 per ETH. Additionally, Sun has initiated the unstaking of 96,580 ETH, which has translated to $322.7 million from platforms like EtherFi and Lido Finance. Analysts contend that these assets are likely to be used for additional deposits to HTX, which suggests that the crypto magnate is continuing to manage liquidity and engage in activity. Sun, however, has explained that it is a routine part of Ethereum wallet transfers. Interestingly, Sun’s ETH movement coincides with the drop in ETH prices.

The 24-hour liquidations have soared to $38.3 million, with $27.52 million in long liquidations Ethereum price in 24 hours – Source: CoinMarketCap Ethereum and the broader crypto market have experienced some selling pressure as the year comes to a close. ETH investors have been unable to surpass the price above the critical resistance of $3,500, which has paved the way for a decline in the price of ETH below $3,000. This decline is expected to continue until the next support level of $2,800. The first quarter of 2025 could serve as the catalyst for a substantial Ethereum rally. In support of this, crypto analyst Rover anticipates that the Ethereum rally will commence on January 1, 2025. This coincides with the peak of Bitcoin’s dominance, as indicated by historical trends. However, a popular analyst, Charting Guy, anticipates that the ETH price will surge to $7,080 by April 2025 in response to this recent action from Justin Sun. Also, according to Binance, the $4,000 mark will not be achieved immediately after Trump’s inauguration. Ethereum ETFs experienced net outflows Yesterday, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a net outflow of $55.41 million. This represents the initial net outflow following four consecutive days of net inflows. In particular, the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF experienced a single-day net outflow of $17.36 million, with a historical cumulative net outflow of $3.634 billion. On the other hand, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF experienced a single-day net outflow of $13.75 million. This is despite its historical cumulative net inflow remaining at $591 million. Currently, the total net asset value of Ethereum spot ETFs is $12.275 billion. This represents 3% of Ethereum’s total market cap. The historical cumulative net inflow is $2.621 billion. Notably, according to reports, alternative ETFs achieved a milestone in November by surpassing $400 billion in net assets. Additionally, the alternative ETFs recorded the highest year-over-year asset growth rate of all asset classes, at 93%. Also, digital assets, trading-leveraged equity, and derivative income ETFs account for the majority of the total alternative ETF market share, which is approximately $325 billion, or 80% Still, financial advisors reported a mere 3.6% allocation to alternatives in 2024. However, this figure is anticipated to rise. The firm discovered that 14.4% of extant alternative allocations are implemented through the utilization of ETFs .

He vows to repay the losses suffered by affected wallets. In a recent X post , Chen told his followers that he had launched what he referred to as a “test token” called ZERO on the Solana ( SOL ) meme coin launch platform, pump.fun. The description of the token warns traders that its value will fall to zero and it is guaranteed that anyone who buys ZERO will lose all the money they invest in it. The description even outright tells traders not to buy it because “it does nothing and never will. It is worth zero.” Unfortunately for Chen, people still bought ZERO. According to DEX Screener , the Solana-based token has gone up by 178% since its launch on Dec. 30 at 22:00 UTC. The recent data shows that a whale bought $208,900 worth of ZERO tokens, making it the biggest ZERO purchase. At the time of writing, the token already has a trading volume of $32 million.

Overall, ZERO has accumulated a market cap of more than $710,000 and a fully diluted volume of the same value. Chen took to X to explain what happened with ZERO. He said he only launched the token as an experiment to see if anyone would buy it. Chen claimed he was surprised when people still invested in ZERO despite the warning. “I didn’t expect everyone to just be able to see it [the description] and buy it – I thought it’s something I would have needed to tweet about. Then I panic sold 40% of supply and made about 444 SOL,” wrote Siqi Chen, adding that he bought back tokens with the 444 SOL and burned everything. so i launched a test token called zero, with the description: “this is going to zero … do not buy it” thinking that people would read it and not buy it. i didn’t expect everyone to just be able to see it and buy it – i thought it’s something i would have needed to tweet about.… pic.twitter.com/bH4b0PIlJH — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 30, 2024 You might also like: Crypto traders doxx 13 year-old-boy who rugged two pump.fun tokens In a separate post , he apologized on behalf of the MIRA and Solana communities and vows to restore “every single wallet that has lost money as a result of my actions.” “I will do this out of my personal funds, not the $MIRA wallet. I don’t know how exactly yet, but will try to figure out details soon with the help of the community. I will airdrop losses directly to affected wallets,” said Chen. Who is Siqi Chen? Formally, Siqi Chen is known as the co-founder and CEO of a company called Runway. Though, to the crypto community he is known as the father of a four-year old girl named Mira who was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor called craniopharyngioma. After Chen posted about his daughter’s diagnosis, the crypto community rallied together to raise funds for research to find a cure for the brain tumor. A trader with the username @shawmakesmagic and the ai16z community created a token called MIRA, named after Chen’s daughter, to raise funds for the research. The developer sent Chen 50% of the MIRA token supply, to which he hesitated on selling them because he did not want to rug-pull anyone. Eventually, Chen decided to sell 10% and use 5% of the tokens to fund the Hankinson Lab research, which was worth $49,263 at the time. “I just want to say that whoever said crypto has no legitimate use cases, you can tell them that funding for rare disease research is a pretty legitimate use case,” said Chen. At the time of writing, MIRA fell by nearly 20% in the past 24 hours according to data from DEX Screener . It is currently trading hands at $0.015 and holds a market cap of $15 million.

Despite Ethereum’s achievements, including ETF approval and significant software upgrades, it underperformed against its faster, more agile competitors. The report highlights the growing momentum of tokenization, DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), and scaling solutions , marking them as critical sectors for growth. These areas have consistently shown strong performance and remain among Grayscale’s top investment focuses. Grayscale, a leading Bitcoin ETF issuer and a subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group (DCG), outlined its ""Top 20"" crypto investment opportunities in the report. Smart contracts, in particular, are described as the most competitive segment in the digital asset market. While Ethereum remains a key player, platforms like Solana and Sui have been capturing significant market share. The report explains that the value of smart contract platforms largely depends on their ability to generate network fee revenue. Networks capable of generating high fees can pass value back to users through mechanisms like token burns or staking rewards. Grayscale’s ""Top 20"" smart contract platforms for this quarter include ETH, SOL, SUI, and OP. Interestingly, Ethereum’s challenges aren’t technical but rather competitive. Despite being the first mover, its market dominance is being eroded by newer platforms offering faster transactions and lower fees. Solana, in particular, has emerged as a strong contender, showcasing rapid growth and adoption. Tokenization remains another focal point in Grayscale’s analysis. The process of converting real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens continues to gain traction, promising increased transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in traditional finance sectors. DePin , which focuses on decentralized infrastructure networks, is also gaining attention. These systems use blockchain technology to manage and incentivize physical networks, such as internet connectivity and data storage, offering decentralized solutions for critical infrastructure. Scaling solutions, aimed at improving blockchain transaction efficiency, remain another priority in Grayscale's outlook. These technologies are essential for maintaining network performance as adoption and usage increase. While Grayscale played a pivotal role in securing approval for the Bitcoin ETF in early 2024, it quickly lost its dominant position in that market. Nevertheless, the firm has remained influential, particularly in advancing Ethereum ETF approvals and other innovative financial products. Interestingly, Grayscale's latest report makes only brief mentions of ETFs, focusing instead on broader market fundamentals and emerging trends. This suggests that the firm views ETFs as supplementary rather than central to the future growth of the crypto industry. Overall, Grayscale’s analysis paints an optimistic picture of the crypto market’s future, emphasizing the dynamic energy within smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized infrastructure. The competition within these sectors is expected to drive significant innovation and growth as the market enters Q1 2025.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-31 09:46:39

Could MicroStrategy be slowly losing its heat? The MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) is down by 46% from its all-time high in November. This comes as the company’s bid to increase its stock shares by billions of dollars in order to back its funding strategy of $42 billion . According to Google Finance statistics, the firm’s shares fell for the second consecutive day, and the price level reached a whopping low of $ 302.96, meaning a loss of 8.2 % in the stock value. Late-hour trading resulted in a further decrease of the stock price by three percent to $293.59. MicroStrategy’s debt structure reveals $7.26 billion in total debt with an average interest rate of 0.476%.

Last week, MSTR acquired 2138 BTC, which increased the total amount to 446400 BTC . Additionally, its shares were added to the index of Nasdaq 100 on Dec. 23, after which its shares surged by 402% .

This fact, however, does not take away the focus from the fact that the firm reported 342% growth for the year so far due to the aggressive accumulation strategy of Bitcoin ( BTC ) that MSTR has been undertaking alongside the gained high price surge of 121% of the cryptocurrency. Is MicroStrategy losing its momentum? MSTR’s BTC amassing approach has been challenged by Martin Shkreli , who co-founded the hedge funds Elea Capital. He called Michael Saylor an “overzealous” and “not credible” supporter of BTC. “The worst vote I’ve ever seen in the history of proxy voting,” he said, referring to MSTR’s shareholder vote on Bitcoin treasury allocation that garnered just 0.5% support on Dec. 24. Shkreli said that market sentiment has changed and that it is now “a little bit hard to see the bull case” for the price of BTC, implying that Saylor’s aggressive multibillion-dollar purchases had underperformed. Markets appear to be concerned over the potential approval of raising authorized share count by 10 billion. Total share could would rise from 330 million to 10.33 BILLION if it is approved.

The rally was fueled by heightened trading activity, with its daily volume doubling over the past day to $330 million. Zooming out to its weekly and monthly charts, the gains were significantly higher at 156% and 383%, respectively, making it one of the best-performing assets among the top 100 cryptocurrencies during these periods. Why did AI16Z soar today? Several catalysts drove ai16z’s recent rally, with the standout being its plans to launch an open-source Layer-1 blockchain tailored for AI applications, marking a major step in its tokenomics revamp. Additionally, the project will introduce a token launchpad in Q1 2025 Q1 2025, which would become the primary platform for deploying AI projects built on the Eliza framework—the project’s AI operating system. The launchpad is expected to include features such as launch fees, staking requirements for access, and liquidity pool pairings to drive value to the ai16z token. The token will play a dual role, functioning both as a governance token within the DAO and as a utility token for platform activities.

Increased whale accumulation over the past week also helped extend the AI crypto’s rally. According to a Dec. 31 X post by Lookonchain, two wallets likely owned by the same whale have purchased 2.62 million of AI16Z tokens for 22,641 SOL worth around $4.34 million following the recent developments surrounding ai16z. Additionally, another whale acquired 1.19 million AI16Z tokens for 1.65 million USDC at an average price of $1.39 per token. Some of the big players are already sitting on massive profits. A few weeks earlier, a separate whale made a profit of $5.66 million after spending 10 million USDC to purchase 13.16 million AI16Z tokens, which later appreciated to a value of $15.66 million. Additionally, demand for ai16z among derivatives traders has jumped massively over the past day. According to data from CoinGlass, the open interest in ai16z’s futures market has risen by a massive 256% to over $22.5 million at press time. Such a sharp upward move typically means traders are highly confident about the current rally’s potential to persist. According to some market experts, ai16z could surpass other AI heavyweights like Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ). Daniel Cheung, a partner at crypto VC Syncracy Capital, projects that recent developments have positioned ai16z to surpass VIRTUAL, the largest AI agent creation tool by market cap. At the time of writing, VIRTUAL had a market cap of $3.68 billion, while ai16z stood at $1.79 billion.

With over $425 million in options trading on its first day , IBIT has set an unmatched benchmark for market demand. Boasting an expense ratio of 0.25%, it is projected to generate $112 million annually , further cementing its financial strength. Since its launch in early 2024, following SEC approval, IBIT has rapidly climbed to become one of the most successful ETFs globally. Industry experts have hailed it as the fastest-growing ETF across all asset classes, outpacing competitors that have been active for decades. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted IBIT’s incredible rise, emphasizing its speed in surpassing key milestones compared to other global ETFs. By December, IBIT had already outperformed many well-established European ETFs, some in operation for over 20 years. Nate Geraci described IBIT’s rise as unprecedented, calling it the greatest ETF launch in history. Analyst James Seyffart supported this sentiment, pointing out the ETF's financial strength and its potential to generate over $112 million annually based on its current expense ratio and asset level. Another major achievement for IBIT came after the OCC approved Bitcoin ETF options trading in late 2024. On the first day alone, IBIT options trading volume soared past $425 million, reflecting immense interest and liquidity in the market. BlackRock’s dominance in this space isn't limited to the ETF’s success alone. The firm has also been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, surpassing other ETF issuers to become one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally. This strategy not only enhances IBIT’s credibility but also reinforces BlackRock’s influence in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Despite occasional market corrections in Bitcoin’s price, BlackRock remains confident about the asset’s long-term potential. Some executives predict Bitcoin’s market will eventually grow into the trillions, positioning IBIT as a key vehicle for mainstream adoption. Over the past decade, BlackRock has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin, and this investment strategy has clearly paid off. With IBIT's monumental success, BlackRock is now firmly established as a leader in both traditional finance and the rapidly growing crypto investment market.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-31 09:52:29

Despite ongoing market uncertainty, the company remains firm in its long-term Bitcoin vision, with Michael Saylor hinting at more purchases in 2025 rather than a pause. According to an SEC filing, MicroStrategy acquired Bitcoin at an average price of $97,837 per BTC. This marks the firm’s fifth purchase in December and the eighth consecutive week of acquisitions. The move aligns with Saylor's earlier advice encouraging investors to use a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach when buying Bitcoin. Saylor confirmed via social media that MicroStrategy now holds 446,400 BTC, acquired for approximately $27.9 billion at an average price of $62,428 per Bitcoin. The company has achieved a quarterly BTC yield of 47.8% and a yearly yield of 74.1%. Earlier this month, MicroStrategy invested $561 million in Bitcoin following Saylor’s public support for the concept of a US Bitcoin Reserve. Additionally, he called a shareholder meeting to discuss issuing more company shares, with the proceeds directed towards further Bitcoin purchases. Despite its bold acquisition strategy, MicroStrategy remains heavily leveraged. The firm has used debt financing, equity sales, and 0% convertible bonds to fund its aggressive Bitcoin buying spree. While this approach has led MicroStrategy’s stock to outperform Bitcoin’s growth over the past year, it also leaves the company highly exposed to market volatility. The recent market correction has sparked rumors of a potential pause in MicroStrategy’s buying activity in January. However, Saylor's public statements suggest the opposite. He has consistently indicated plans for continued acquisitions rather than slowing down. Bitcoin has faced strong price resistance, with analysts predicting possible market turbulence ahead. However, Saylor seems undeterred, showing no clear signs of halting purchases despite speculation. He remains confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value and continues to view it as a cornerstone of MicroStrategy’s financial strategy. The company’s ongoing investments demonstrate its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as a primary store of value. As 2025 approaches, all eyes remain on Saylor and MicroStrategy to see whether their relentless buying strategy will persist in the face of market uncertainties.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-31 09:57:32

This crypto whale activity reflects a growing market belief in this AI token’s potential, suggesting a possible sustained rally for the cryptocurrency. The focus on AI agents and recent crypto whale accumulation indicate increasing interest and confidence in its future price within the AI sector. Crypto Whale Buying Spree Fuels AI16Z’s Price To Rally 30% Recent whale activity has catalyzed the robust surge in AI16Z price. On December 31, Lookonchain reported that two whale wallets, “6ZFcxR…JkZV” and “HRQXKj…bVFr,” purchased 2.62 million tokens for $4.34 million. This activity demonstrated significant confidence in the token. Additionally, wallet “FU9b2c…fHyc” acquired 1.19 million tokens for $1.65 million earlier in the day. A day prior, Solscan highlighted multiple large purchases, including 869K tokens bought for $1.09 million by wallet “B6FsUN…XzDV.” Another whale, identified as “AVLKwK…x1Mv,” purchased 998K tokens for $1.22 million. These transactions highlight a growing appetite for the token among high-net-worth investors. Such consistent accumulation reflects optimism in the project’s potential and strategic developments, particularly as AI gains increasing focus within the crypto landscape. AI16Z Performance and Market Context AI16Z price was up 30% in 24 hours and exchanged hands at $1.632. It touched a high of $1.771 during the period. The market cap stands at $1.8 billion, and trading volume reached $250 million. The rally follows a trend of positive price movements, with crypto whales reportedly making $5.66 million in profits in the past two weeks. Top AI coins have been on investors’ radar due to advancements in the technology sector, driving renewed interest in AI tokens and their ecosystem. Crypto analysts attribute the rally to the growing focus on AI-related projects and ecosystem developments. Raoul Pal commented on the AI space’s untapped potential, highlighting future advancements in AI agents. The excitement surrounding the AI token aligns with the broader industry trend, positioning it as a potential leader in decentralized AI innovation. I’m not sure what you all think AI agents are, but they aren’t what we are seeing on X currently…those are just bots. In a year or two you’ll see the difference… — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 31, 2024 AI Token’s Rally To Sustain? The recent AI16Z rally underscores investor confidence in the token, fueled by its robust tokenomics discussions and whale activity. The project has proposed introducing a launchpad for AI-driven projects using its Eliza framework, which could drive sustained value accrual to the token. Additionally, making the primary currency for agent-to-agent transactions and incentivizing developers could enhance its ecosystem. With its growing market position and increased focus on AI adoption, the token is well-poised to maintain upward momentum.

In South Korea, the arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol rattled the crypto market. Meanwhile, Malaysia intensified its crackdown on unregistered crypto exchanges by ordering Bybit to cease operations in the country. Treasury Breach Sparks Tensions Between US and China A recent cybersecurity breach at the United States Treasury was attributed to a Chinese state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, though the Chinese government denied responsibility for the incident. The breach was reported to lawmakers on Dec. 30, and was first detected by BeyondTrust, a third-party software provider, on Dec. 8. According to Assistant Secretary for Management Aditi Hardikar, the incident allowed unauthorized remote access to certain unclassified documents on employee workstations. However, she assured that there is no evidence suggesting continued access to Treasury systems or information. China very firmly denied the accusations, and stated that it opposes what it called baseless claims by the US government. The US Treasury has since taken the compromised service offline and is collaborating with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), intelligence agencies, and forensic investigators to probe the matter further. BeyondTrust revealed that it identified the security issue in its Remote Support product on Dec. 2 and confirmed anomalous activity on Dec. 5, immediately revoking the compromised API key and notifying impacted clients. The company is cooperating with a number of law enforcement and investigative agencies to understand the full extent of the attack. This breach happened after another major cybersecurity incident earlier this year that was dubbed the Salt Typhoon breach. During this attack, attackers reportedly accessed phone calls and text messages of lawmakers. For now, the Treasury committed to providing a detailed supplemental report within 30 days as required under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. A classified briefing on the incident is also planned for staffers of the House Financial Services Committee. Total annual fund loss (Source: Cyvers ) The crypto industry also faced a surge in cyberattacks as over $2.3 billion worth of digital assets were stolen in 2024 across 165 incidents. This was a 40% increase from 2023. The rise in access control breaches, especially targeting centralized exchanges and custodial platforms, has been a major factor in this sharp uptick, according to blockchain security firm Cyvers . Vietnam Police Foil Major Crypto Scam Meanwhile, Vietnamese authorities successfully prevented 300 potential victims from falling prey to an elaborate crypto scam that was orchestrated by a company known as Million Smiles . The scam already defrauded approximately 30 billion Vietnamese dong, or $1.17 million, from around 100 businesses and 400 people. Million Smiles promoted an in-house cryptocurrency called QFS, or Quantum Financial System, through deceptive advertising that falsely linked it to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims. The company also promised unrealistic returns and claimed that owning QFS would grant access to a financial ecosystem with benefits like funding without collateral or interest. Raided Million Smiles HQ (Source: VTV ) Hanoi City Police intercepted a planned meeting by Million Smiles to recruit 300 additional investors, where participants were expected to invest amounts ranging from 4–5 million dong ($190) to as much as 39 million dong ($1,350) for businesses. Law enforcement raided the company’s headquarters, seizing documents, computers, and other materials. Investigations revealed that the QFS token was completely fictitious and not recognized under Vietnamese law. This operation is part of Vietnam’s bigger goal to combat crypto fraud. In October, police in Nghe An province dismantled a Laos-based scam network that was led by offshore actors specializing in fraudulent wire transfers and crypto investment schemes. One victim from Ho Chi Minh City was deceived into investing in a fake app called “Biconomynft,” which resulted in losses of more than 17.6 billion dong ($700,000). South Korea Issues Arrest Warrant for Impeached President South Korea’s political and financial landscape has been shaken after the issuance of an arrest warrant for President Yoon Suk Yeol. The Seoul Western District Court approved the warrant on Dec. 31 after Yoon, who was impeached and suspended from office earlier in December, failed to appear for questioning for the third time. The request was made by a joint investigation taskforce comprising the Korean National Police Agency, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), and the Criminal Investigation Command of the Defense Ministry. The warrant was issued after Yoon tried to impose martial law during a live television address on Dec. 3 due to threats from North Korea and a need to eliminate anti-state elements. His actions were widely condemned, which led to his impeachment and suspension by South Korea’s parliament on Dec. 14. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok is currently serving as interim leader. Yoon’s martial law declaration caused immediate turmoil in the crypto market. On South Korean exchanges like UpBit, Bitcoin prices plummeted by as much as $30,000 in just six hours thanks to a liquidity crisis that was exacerbated by the abrupt disappearance of key market players. Internationally, major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, saw large price dips in response to the news. The crypto market was able to quickly recover after the parliament forced Yoon to lift martial law on Dec. 4. The martial law order came during a period of increased retail crypto trading activity in South Korea. On Dec. 2, the country recorded its second-highest retail trading volume of the year, driven by interest in high-momentum altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Stellar. Malaysia Orders Bybit to Shut Down Operations Malaysia also recently took some serious legal steps by ordering cryptocurrency exchange Bybit to cease operations in the country. The Malaysian SC accused the exchange of operating an unregistered digital asset exchange (DAX). The regulator directed Bybit to disable its website, mobile applications, and other digital platforms within 14 business days starting Dec. 11. Additionally, the regulator mandated the termination of Bybit’s Malaysian Telegram support group and the cessation of advertisements targeting local investors. The SC confirmed that the directives were followed as of Dec. 27. The enforcement action is part of Malaysia’s tightening regulatory environment for cryptocurrency operations. The SC pointed out that operating a DAX without registration as a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) under Section 7(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 is a criminal offense. The SC also urged Malaysian investors to use only licensed DAX platforms, which undergo rigorous vetting to protect users and mitigate risks like money laundering and fraud. Bybit’s exit from Malaysia happened after its announcement that it will stop operations in France due to increased regulatory scrutiny by French authorities. Starting Jan. 8, 2025, the exchange will no longer offer withdrawal or custody services for French users.",News|Security,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 10:05:16

The decision, made on December 31, follows Yoon’s suspension from office after his controversial attempt to impose martial law earlier this month. This marks the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced such legal action, underscoring the severity of the political crisis gripping the nation. Political and Market Chaos President Yoon’s announcement of martial law on December 3 during a televised address stunned the nation. Justifying the move as necessary to eliminate “anti-state elements” and address perceived threats from North Korea , the action was met with swift backlash. Within hours, South Korea’s parliament intervened, leading to Yoon’s impeachment on December 14. Yoon’s declaration of martial law also triggered turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin prices on South Korean exchanges like UpBit plummeted by as much as $30,000 in just six hours. The steep decline was attributed to a liquidity crisis exacerbated by the sudden disappearance of key market players. Globally, major cryptocurrencies, including Ether and XRP, saw declines of up to 4%, reflecting international investor jitters over South Korea’s escalating political instability. The crypto market rebounded once parliament forced Yoon to lift martial law on December 4. However, the event left lasting impressions on both domestic and global traders, highlighting the interconnectedness of political and financial systems. Leadership Transition in South Korea The arrest warrant, approved after Yoon failed to attend three investigative hearings, was requested by a joint task force comprising South Korea’s National Police Agency, Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), and the Defense Ministry’s Criminal Investigation Command. The warrant, valid for seven days, could be extended if necessary. In the interim, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok has assumed the role of acting president, tasked with steering the nation through a turbulent period. Yoon’s attempt to impose martial law came on the heels of a record-breaking day for retail crypto trading in South Korea . High-momentum altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Stellar were dominating the market just before the announcement, illustrating the volatility that can arise when political events intersect with financial markets.

The token burn raised questions about the direction of the crypto market. Tether, Inc. burned 1B Tether (USDT), with no explanations on technicalities. The burn decreased the USDT supply from 138B to 137B, arriving after a series of smaller liquidity withdrawals. Tether (USDT) supply climbed for most of 2024 but switched direction in the last weeks after it peaked at 140B. | Source: Coingecko The removal of $1B liquidity followed 10 days of gradually decreasing the supply, causing one of the first supply contractions since 2022. The recent removal of USDT was the biggest single burn for the past week, increasing the rate of reversal of USDT growth for the past year. The leading stablecoin expanded its supply constantly for the past 12 months. The supply of USDT peaked above 140B tokens, becoming one of the supporting factors for the peak Bitcoin (BTC) rally. The recent burn coincided with a market-wide dip, which briefly sent BTC under $93,000. After the recent token burns, the overall supply of stablecoins decreased from its peak of 200.2B, down to 198.5B. The contraction mostly affected USDT, while synthetic or crypto-backed stablecoins grew independently or retained their supply. Tether removes USDT from TRON The recent removal of USDT liquidity affected the tokens on the TRON network. The supply on Ethereum remains at more than 76.9B tokens, while TRON-based TRC-20 stablecoins were burned. Tether Treasury sent out a single transaction to destroy 2B USDT on the TRON network. The burn is part of the policy to move more USDT to its Ethereum version, the most widely used one for both centralized trading and DeFi. On TRON, the supply of USDT is down to 59.75B tokens, spread to more than 58K holders. On-chain analysts noticed some centralized exchanges tried to move out of TRON-based USDT, both through swaps and redemptions, which may be the cause of the token burn. TRON-based USDT is also used for retail and peer-to-peer activities and often carries the most valuable transactions of over $100K. However, whales and exchanges remain more influential than retail. Bitfinex and Binance have attempted redemptions of TRON-based USDT. In the case of Bitfinex, more than 743M USDT were redeemed. The redemptions, swaps or other ways of moving away from TRC-20 stablecoins are still not leading to more mints on Ethereum. TRC-20 USDT is predominantly held by whales in comparison to Ethereum’s stablecoin. More than 85% of all TRON-based stablecoins are in whale wallets or held by exchanges, hence the more coordinated shift to a new type of stablecoin. The rapid divestment of TRC-20 stablecoins led to a short-term loss of the $1 stability, as USDT dipped to $0.9987. The difference is small, but it showed shifting pressures on USDT reserves. Previously, Tether has redeemed and burned tokens from other networks, including TRON, with no major effects on the market. The current shift in holdings may boost Ethereum-based DeFi. The USDT stablecoin is one of the most active smart contracts, producing the biggest daily fees among all chains. Will the Euro area still use USDT? One of the hypotheses for the decreasing USDT supply is the expectation for lowered usage in the European Union after the removal of non-compliant stablecoins. There are already signs that the European market is shifting to compliant stablecoins like USDC. The European market ranks high in terms of crypto activity, although it still lags behind the USA. The upcoming regulation of USDT may further slow down usage and innovation, with the rationale of higher security. Tether, Inc. is yet to acquire a license for EU-based banking, to provide the requisite reserves for making USDT compliant. EU-based services still swapped the token, but exchanges like Binance may remove some of its products and trading pairs, especially if using leveraged positions.

On whales’ watchlists are promising tokens, notably top altcoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH). DTX Exchange (DTX) is another ERC-20 compatible cryptocurrency on whales’ radars. Its unique offering—a hybrid trading platform—and massive growth prospects make it an investor favorite. At the same time, it is massively undervalued below $0.5. DTX Exchange (DTX): On Whales Watchlists The Ethereum-based altcoin DTX Exchange (DTX) is the latest on whales’ radars. The up-and-coming cryptocurrency stands out for its novel approach to trading—a hybrid exchange protocol—and huge growth prospects. It makes this list alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) but unlike these top crypto coins, it has plenty of room to run. As a low-cap DeFi gem, its upside potential is staggering. Currently priced at $0.14 in the seventh ICO round, it has skyrocketed over 500% in the past months. Another 40% gain is anticipated by the launch date at the estimated price of $0.20. With a projected 70x upswing after debuting on Tier-1 exchanges, it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in. Further, its innovative approach to trading cannot be overemphasized. Unlike conventional trading platforms, it will present the best of CEX and DEX while offering diverse assets across traditional and decentralized finance. This contributes to the rising demand, pushing early funding above $11 million and wallet addresses over 300,000. Shiba Inu (SHIB): How Many Zeros Can It Cancel This Cycle? Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading memecoin on Ethereum (ETH), is set to be one of the biggest gainers this cycle. It changes hands around $0.000021, with plenty of room to run before retesting its all-time high of $0.00008. Its significant upside potential remains one of its biggest attractions, alongside its budget-friendly price—no need to break the bank before positioning for huge gains. Key technical indicators like the Shiba Inu price trading above the 200-EMA and 200-SMA hint at a bounce in the coming days. At the same time, experts are bullish. CW, a top analyst on X, has $0.000027 as a short-term SHIB price target. Meanwhile, PugaRip, another expert, sees Shiba Inu (SHIB) hitting $0.0003 this cycle. However, for higher ROIs, DTX Exchange (DTX) might be a more compelling option as a low-cap DeFi coin, contributing to the rising demand. Ethereum (ETH): On Whales’ Radars Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin, is set for a big jump. It recently reclaimed $3,400, resuming its upward charge. The Ethereum price trading above the 10-SMA ($3,384) and 100-EMA ($3,221) hints at further upswings, positioning it among the altcoins to watch. Crypto analyst FrozenChill predicts the altcoin would hit $10,000 in 2025—about a 3x increase from the current market price. JavonTM1, another top analyst on X, suggests it is poised to climb to $11,865, positioning it among the best cryptos to buy. Despite this, Ethereum (ETH) has limited upside potential, making it less appealing to investors seeking life-changing gains. In contrast, DTX Exchange (DTX), a new DeFi coin, is teeming with potential, tipped for a 70x upswing after listing on Tier-1 exchanges. DTX Exchange (DTX): On Whales Radars Alongside Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) All eyes are on the ETH ecosystem as Q1 2025 begins. Ethereum (ETH), the native utility token; Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading meme; and DTX Exchange (DTX) , the new hybrid trading protocol, are set to skyrocket. But given DTX’s projected 70x jump, it is a new DeFi project to watch out for.

According to local media, the Hanoi police have apprehended the general director and seven key suspects involved in a cryptocurrency fraud scheme involving the sale of a fake token created and operated by a company whose name translates to “Million Smiles.” The scammers promised exorbitant returns on investments in the Quantum Financial System coin, which they claimed were backed by assets and treasures that were said to have been preserved by ancient family dynasties for hundreds of years. Victims were also lured in with promises of access to an exclusive financial ecosystem, where they would receive capital support for business ventures without the need for collateral or interest payments. Of course, those claims were false, and the QFS coin, as is the case with similar scams , was backed by nothing, the investigation revealed. During a raid on the company’s headquarters, police seized documents, computers, and other evidence, uncovering the extent of the fraud. Police also managed to intervene just before a planned conference with 300 potential investors, preventing the scammers from further promoting the QFS coin and luring in more victims. The scheme targeted individuals with investment amounts ranging from 4–5 million dong (approximately $190) and businesses with demands of up to 39 million dong (around $1,350) per coin.

The illicit funds were used to procure luxurious office spaces in upscale villa areas, creating an illusion of legitimacy to draw in more victims. This was the second major crypto-related bust in Vietnam this quarter. In October, the police took down a major crypto romance scam network that tricked victims into making investments in a fake investing app called “Biconomynft.” Meanwhile, incidents of crypto-related investment fraud made headlines multiple times this year. In January, the Metropolitan Police in the United Kingdom seized over 61,000 Bitcoin from Chinese scammers running dubious schemes. More recently, two UK men were prosecuted for their involvement in a £1.5 million crypto investment scam. Per a Sept. 9 report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, investment scams accounted for 71% of total losses incurred from crypto-related scams and frauds in 2023. As investment fraud schemes grow increasingly sophisticated and deceptive, it’s more crucial than ever for individuals and businesses to stay informed, exercise caution, and thoroughly investigate opportunities before committing.

Though, it also mentions former Binance CEO CZ and his plans to ‘engage with projects on a personal level.’ In a recent post on the last day of 2024, Binance Labs announced that it will soon be operating under a different name and plans to invest in more projects in 2025, specifically naming crypto, blockchain , AI and Biotech as main areas of focus. Binance Labs will also be expanding its investment scope outside of primary market deals to include other dealings, such as liquidity in secondary markets, and over-the-counter transactions among others. Though, the venture capital arm of Binance ( BNB ) also expects sectors that were “underperforming” in 2024, such as gaming , ZK tech and privacy solutions, will make a comeback in 2025 as they move on to more advanced stages compared to the previous year. In addition, Binance Labs predicts that emerging sectors such as decentralized science, real-world assets, stablecoins and AI agents will continue to perform well in 2025 as these sectors are already poised to develop even further than what they are now. At Binance Labs (soon to be rebranded), we’re laser-focused on fundamentals, aiming for long-term impact. Going into 2025 and beyond, we’ll continue to provide evergreen support to founders who share our vision of building for the long term.

Although it is not confirmed by Binance Labs, many users took this as a sign that CZ might be returning to the exchange in a less formal setting. However, it is possible the exchange simply alluded to CZ’s involvement in the crypto industry’s emerging sectors, such as AI and Biotech, strengthening their chances of levelling-up in 2025.

In 2024 alone, Binance Labs has invested in a total of 46 projects, 14 of which are projects built on the BNB Chain and from incubation programs. The VC arm stated that 20% of their investments come from BNB-based projects. Meanwhile, the other 32 projects are from direct investments. Out of the 46 projects that Binance Labs has invested in, 10 projects fall under DeFi, 7 projects from AI, 7 from the Bitcoin ( BTC ) ecosystem, 4 in restaking, 3 from the gaming sector, 2 in ZK technology, 2 in RWA and 2 more in consumer apps.

Rexas Finance, priced at $0.175 in presale, emerges as a DeFi powerhouse with 10,000% growth potential, outshining Sei and Dogecoin this festive season. Table of Contents Sei Blockchain: A game-changer in speed and efficiency Dogecoin’s historical patterns signal major upside potential Rexas Finance: A game‑changer in the DeFi space Technological innovations and real-world integration CertiK Audit and strategic listings 2025 Vision: Competing with leading cryptos Rexas Finance could be the best crypto to buy now, this Christmas. RXS is priced at $0.175 in presale, with potential to increase up to 10,000% while outpacing competitors like Sei and Dogecoin. Its NFT creation and real estate tokenisation via its AI powered solution make it a huge DeFi game changer. Sei wins for speed, Dogecoin for speculative potential and Rexas Finance is the ultimate choice for investors looking to explode this festive season. Sei Blockchain: A game-changer in speed and efficiency Since mainnet has launched, Sei has exploded to become one of the top stand-out blockchains with more than $200 million of Total Value Locked (TVL). Due to the tremendous speed and cost efficiency, it is already outpacing staples like SUI, Solana, as well as Aptos. It’s positioning itself as the leader in blockchain scalability with a roadmap that promises a 50x performance boost, dubbed “Giga Sei.” Furthermore, its EVM compatibility is making it a home to an increasing number of developers who bring development to its ecosystem. Sei, backed by the likes of Circle, Multicoin Capital, and Coinbase Ventures, is making waves by processing over 2,185,747,391 transactions and 343,877 daily active addresses. Sei v2 updates upcoming will make the blockchain a stronger contender amongst others as a top-tier blockchain. Even though it has a market cap of $2 billion, Sei is thought by many to still be undervalued given its rapid adoption. Sei processes over 4 million daily transactions proving itself to be a formidable force in the blockchain space. Dogecoin’s historical patterns signal major upside potential The crypto community is still rooting for Dogecoin as it completes its historic cycle-based price movements. Many analysts track its consistent tendency to break through the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level in past cycles. Repeating this pattern could mean DOGE hits a dizzying 570% rally to a groundbreaking $2.28 price. Such growth only boosts Dogecoin’s special appeal, both as a speculative asset and as a community phenomenon that makes the former cryptocurrency stand out. The trajectory of cycle three also matches DOGE’s previous explosive growth stages, where there is strong momentum and mass enthusiasm by investors. It also has grassroots support to add to this bullish sentiment as it continues to increase its utility. While its upward journey can be quite phenomenal, Dogecoin is a high-volatility crypto asset, and the natural risk is also high. Rexas Finance: A game‑changer in the DeFi space Rexas Finance’s presale was launched on 8 September 2024, and since then it has been plain sailing, with now at stage 11, over $33.6 million has been raised. The token started from $0.03 in stage one and reached $0.175 by stage 11, resulting in an attraction of 483% for early investors. RXS has the potential to explode on the scene, touted to make up to 10,000% after major exchange listings. Until now, over 383 million tokens have sold out, demonstrating extremely positive market reception and enormous demand.

Data from Google Finance shows that MSTR shares closed at $302.96 on December 30 after fluctuating between $301.75 and $320.01 throughout the day. Mounting Bitcoin Holdings Amid Stock Price Struggles The closing price was an 8.19% drop from previous levels, with another 3.19% scrapped off in after-hours trading, pushing the stock to as low as $293.59. However, the biggest dip was observed when comparing MSTR’s highest level of $473.83, achieved on November 20, to its current price, which shows a 36% difference. The all-time high came on the back of MicroStrategy achieving a record $21.8 billion in 24-hour trading volume as it ramped up its BTC accumulation at a time when the asset was breaking price records of its own in quick succession. The company is currently the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin after securing another 2,136 BTC, bringing its stash to an impressive 446,400 BTC, with an estimated value of $41.4 billion. Nonetheless, the continued buying spree seemed not to have pushed MSTR out of its lethargy, with the stock failing to go beyond $411 in December. That being said, across longer periods, MicroStrategy has still performed admirably. Over six months, it is up more than 121% while also gaining 342% year-to-date. Bitcoin itself has faced a turbulent few weeks, dropping as low as $91,330 shortly after reaching an all-time high of $108,135 on December 17. At the time of writing, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $93,800, just 0.1% above its level from yesterday. Across 30 days, it has lost nearly 3% of its value, although over the last 12 months, the price reflects a 121% improvement. Corporate Moves and Market Reactions Interestingly, there seems to be a correlation between MicroStrategy buying BTC and repeated market corrections. Each acquisition, usually announced on a Monday, has triggered a price pullback, raising questions about the firm’s impact on the crypto market. Critics like gold advocate Peter Schiff claim that the company’s purchases are no longer substantial enough to drive the cryptocurrency’s price higher. His comments coincided with BTC shedding 15% from its value, following hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve’s last FOMC meeting. However, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy seems undeterred. Its Bitcoin holdings, bought at an average cost of $62,428, now boast an unrealized profit of over $13 billion. Additionally, a recent announcement about a special shareholders meeting to propose increasing authorized shares and expanding financial options means the Virginia-based entity is preparing for future growth.

One subsection of the industry, however, is still prone to incredible amounts of volatility, which can see relatively small investments turn into fortunes overnight — or even in the span of a couple of hours. The subsection in question is, to little surprise, meme coins . In one such instance, a savvy trader loaded up on millions of Kekius Maximus (KM), purchased for just a little over $4,000. Quite soon, the trade paid off — in a big and unexpected way. Per data retrieved by Finbold from Solscan on December 31 , the account in question made two transactions, roughly 12 hours before the time of publication. The first saw the purchase of 9.9 million KM worth $2,246 at the time, while the second trade was slightly smaller, encompassing the acquisition of 8.2 million Kekius Maximus for $2,566. All in all, the trader spent $4,360 to purchase 18.15 million KM tokens. The trader’s initial purchases of KM. Source: Solscan A stunt by Elon Musk made Kekius Maximus go parabolic Kekius Maximus is a riff on Pepe The Frog — in this instance, wearing Roman armor as a reference to the movie ‘Gladiator’. While variations of Pepe are quite popular memes and enjoy a lot of staying power, a unique catalyst drove the price surge. Namely, roughly nine hours after the purchase, Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) noted crypto advocate, and owner of social media site X , changed his account name to Kekius Maximus. In short order, KM prices soared by 13,362% — up from just $0.00040 to $0.05385, although prices have since receded to $0.02658. Still, the price of Kekius Maximus is still trading at levels some 6,545% higher than it was before Musk’s show of support KM price 1-day chart. Source: TradingView At the time of writing, the Kekius Maximus held by this address was worth $482,427 — at peak prices, it would have been worth somewhere in the ballpark of $977,377. Naturally, as the trade was so well-timed, X users immediately began speculating whether or not this was a stroke of luck or the action of an insider, perhaps even Musk himself. Unlike most accounts that make such significant profits on meme coins, this address has been making a reasonable number of trades since being opened — meaning that it is unlikely to be an automated system.

Public curiosity is by far not the only impact of such transactions. Let’s see how the whale transactions influence the market and why not everyone is happy about them. Table of Contents The whales’ transactions Christmas rampage When whales hold When whales sell Alleged market manipulations Crypto whales: friends or foes? The whales’ transactions Christmas rampage On Dec. 25, 2024, the Bitcoin wallet that was kept untouched for nearly 14 years moved 20.55 BTC to another address. During the years in the wallet, these coins gained over $2 million in value. The same day, a different wallet released 210 BTC after ten years of inactivity. This BTC stash grew by $20 million while being hodled. Two days later, someone moved 1,940 ETH from the pre-mine address to Coinbase. These ether tokens were dormant from the launch of the Ethereum network. The following days saw other huge transactions involving long-time sleepers. Read more: 200k Ethereum genesis whale awakens: $11.37m sent to Kraken For instance, on Dec. 29 it was reported that someone sent 7,000 BTC from the address that was inactive for seven years to several different addresses, splitting the sum into seven 1,000 BTC outputs. This chad held on to 7,000 BTC for 7 years, hodled from 62M$ to 663M$, the funds haven't been sold they just split them into 1,000 BTC addresses. https://t.co/1FhOHUjUOH — Sani | TimechainIndex.com (@SaniExp) December 29, 2024 Reporters share the opinion that these bitcoins weren’t sold; they just moved to other wallets. In seven years, the 7k BTC stash value grew by several hundred million dollars. On the same day, the address that had been silent since 2014 sent 357.4 BTC to other addresses. When whales hold As of Dec. 30, 2024, there are four wallets holding nearly 650k BTC, which is over 3% of the total supply. All of these addresses are the cold wallets of the crypto exchanges. According to the Bitinfocharts tool, less than 100 Bitcoin addresses hold around 15% of the entire supply; many of these addresses probably belong to individuals. If they decide to move their millions worth of crypto coins, it may trigger a bearish reversal even in the uptrend. When whales hold their crypto, they decrease its liquidity. Just think of billions worth of cryptocurrency that has not moved for years! Almost half of all bitcoins are held in wallets that have between 100 and 10,000 bitcoins on the balance. This group of whales impacts liquidity and value the most. Many of them haven’t moved crypto for years, sometimes over 10 consecutive years, effectively keeping large amounts of crypto out of the market. When whales sell When whales get rid of their crypto, they signal other investors that someone who held millions worth of the asset in question decided that the asset isn’t worth it anymore. And everyone sees it! The whales’ transactions don’t go unnoticed, as thanks to the Bitcoin network’s transparency, these addresses are known, listed, and monitored. Each massive transaction makes headlines and triggers much talk on the Internet. Some people, especially those who don’t follow the trading/investment strategy or even don’t have one, fall for emotions and start to panic. When many people panic simultaneously, they may flip the market or increase the price volatility – not necessarily for a long period, but still. The whales who don’t want to cause disturbance dump their crypto gradually. Most transactions described in the previous chapter seemingly have one goal–the owners move crypto from the legacy Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses to modern wallets that provide better privacy and security. They cannot be attributed to so-called “whale dumping” that serves as a bearish signal. Alleged market manipulations On Dec. 27, 2024, the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author, Robert Kiyosaki, took to X to accuse the BlackRock CEO Larry Fink of dumping Bitcoin. According to Kiyosaki, BlackRock is “suppressing Bitcoin price, so the whales can buy Bitcoin at under $100k.” Larry Fink dumping Bitcoin. VIVEK warned Larry Fink of BLACK ROCK is a Marxist. Vivek warned Fink & Black Rock are Share Holder Capitalist not Stake Holder Caplitist. Share Holder Capitalists are Marxist….like Klaus Schwab who state: “Someday you’ll own nothing and you’ll be… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 27, 2024 Although we don’t have evidence to support or dispute Kiyosaki’s claim, we must admit that institutions and individuals holding large amounts of crypto are often subjected to such claims. The alleged market manipulation conducted by Tether is one of the best-known cases. The battle for the truth continues as of December 2024. Why would someone accuse whales of intentional price manipulations? First off, whales really can impact the prices. Whales may sell a large amount of BTC, sending the price down, re-buy what was sold during retracement at a discounted price, and enjoy profit made out of the price differences. Other tactics available for whales include rug pulls and wash trading. Ripple Labs admitted having used trading bots in the past. However, it doesn’t outrightly agree with the accusations of using them to manipulate the XRP price. Read more: XRP enthusiast refutes claims of price manipulation by Ripple Crypto whales: friends or foes? Just like the natural whales in the oceans, crypto whales are not friends or foes. Rather, they are large bodies minding their own business. If we know how they impact the market when they spend crypto, we can react to the whale alerts accordingly and avoid trouble. The only exception is the whales consciously manipulating the prices.

Here's The Most Prominent Reason!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-spot-exchange-traded-funds-etfs-continue-to-exit-heres-the-most-prominent-reason/,"The cryptocurrency market experienced notable outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Dec. 30, signaling a continuation of the trend of year-end profit-taking and investor pullbacks amid market uncertainty. Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs See Significant Outflows as Year-End Approaches Bitcoin Spot ETF Outflows Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a total net outflow of $426 million, extending their consecutive daily outflow streak to two days. Among them, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reported a single-day net outflow of $135 million, contributing to a staggering total historical net outflow of $21.487 billion. Ethereum Spot ETF Exits Ethereum spot ETFs also saw significant investor withdrawals, with a total net outflow of $55.4 million on Dec. 30. This was the first net outflow after four consecutive days of net inflows. Similarly, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) reported a single-day net outflow of $17.4 million, signaling waning investor confidence as 2024 approaches. The outflows come amid heightened market volatility and a broader reallocation of assets as investors reassess their portfolios. While spot ETFs saw significant inflows during bullish periods earlier this year, the recent trend points to cautious sentiment in the crypto market. Analysts point to factors such as profit-taking, macroeconomic uncertainty and competition from alternative investment products as possible reasons for the withdrawals. The year-end period often sees portfolio adjustments, which could further exacerbate outflows in the coming days. As the market enters 2025, all eyes will be on the cryptocurrency world, with regulatory developments, institutional involvement, and macroeconomic conditions set to play a key role in shaping investor behavior. *This is not investment advice.

Its revival happened shortly after Elon Musk changed his profile picture on X with a frog dressed as a Roman soldier. PEPE on the Run The latest crypto market correction has severely affected the meme coin sector, with many tokens charting substantial weekly declines. For instance, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down 6%, while dogwifhat (WIF) has plunged 9%. The past 24 hours have also been painful for the bulls, with SHIB, BONK, PENGU, and many more heading south. However, Pepe (PEPE) defied the negative trend, recording a 6% price upswing. The frog-themed token also saw its market capitalization rising above $8 billion again, solidifying it as the third-biggest meme coin. PEPE Price, Source: CoinGecko PEPE’s resurgence could be linked to one of Elon Musk’s latest interactions on X. The owner of the social media platform changed his profile picture to Kekius Maximus – a frog that wears Roman armor. KEKIUS is a meme coin operating on multiple blockchain platforms, including Ethereum and Solana. It saw the light of day in mid-December and up until Musk’s post was trading sideways at approximately $0.01 . The endorsement from one of the richest people on the planet triggered a massive resurgence for KEKIUS, whose price skyrocketed by 550% in the past 24 hours. Nonetheless, its market capitalization remains below $100 million, meaning it is far from reaching the top 100 club (at least as of the moment). Musk and Memes This is not the first time the billionaire has made waves in the meme coin niche with his posts on X. Musk is known as a huge proponent of Dogecoin (DOGE), often praising its merits and endorsing it on the social media platform. Last month, the biggest meme coin experienced a 10% price increase after Tesla’s CEO talked about the establishment of a Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) should Donald Trump win the US presidential elections. The Republican emerged victorious and put Musk in charge of this division. D.O.G.E. will aim to streamline the US federal government by reducing wasteful spending and eliminating unnecessary regulatory agencies. Floki Inu (FLOKI) is another meme coin that has witnessed a price boost after comments from Elon Musk. In February 2023, he posted a picture of his dog dressed as the CEO of Twitter (as X was called back then). Musk’s pet is named Floki, which explains why the eponymous meme coin shot by over 40% shortly after the interaction.

This strategic move involved burning 800 million BGB tokens, effectively decreasing the total supply from 2 billion to 1.2 billion tokens. The burn process was executed by transferring the tokens to a designated burn address, ensuring their permanent removal from circulation. The distribution of the burned tokens was as follows: 19% originated from holdings by the core team, while the remaining 21% comprised tokens from both circulating supply and additional core team reserves. This action reflects Bitget's strategic approach to enhancing the value and scarcity of BGB, aligning with industry practices aimed at benefiting token holders. Looking ahead, Bitget has outlined a quarterly BGB burn mechanism set to commence in 2025. Under this plan, 20% of quarterly profits from exchange and wallet operations will be allocated to repurchase and burn BGB tokens. The profits considered for this mechanism encompass transaction fees from spot, futures, and margin trading on the Bitget exchange, as well as income from swaps, futures, and NFT trading on the Bitget Wallet. “This initial burn, with a substantial contribution from the core team’s holdings, is an example of our belief in attaining success with the interests of our community. With the reduction in supply; BGB signifies the foundation of a stronger and more resilient ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders,” said Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget. The buyback and burn process will occur quarterly, typically finalized at the beginning of the subsequent quarter. Following each buyback, the acquired BGB tokens will be destroyed by sending them to a burn address. Bitget commits to transparency by publishing the exact amount burned and providing on-chain records after each burn event. This initiative shows Bitget's dedication to enhancing the utility and value of BGB within its ecosystem. By systematically reducing the token supply, Bitget aims to create a more robust and sustainable environment for its users and stakeholders.

Despite its strong fundamentals, LINK has crashed by 35% from its December highs, mirroring the performance of Bitcoin and other altcoins. Chainlink Price Analysis: H&S Points To More Downside The 4H chart shows that the LINK price rallied and peaked at $31 in December as Bitcoin and other altcoins rallied. It has formed a head-and-shoulders chart pattern and is now hovering at its neckline. An H&S pattern is a popular reversal sign that comprises a head, two shoulders, and a neckline. In this case, the head was at $31, while the two shoulders were around the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $26.10. This pattern’s neckline is at the 50% retracement point and the weak, stop & reverse of the Murrey Math Lines. Chainlink price also formed a death cross on December 22 as the 200-period and 50-period Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) flipped each other. Also, the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO), which is a modified type of the MACD indicator, has moved below the zero line and is pointing downwards. Therefore, these patterns point to a big drop in the next few days. The distance between the head and the neck is about 35%, while a similar distance from the neckline points to a LINK price crash to $13.25. Chainlink Price Chart Conversely, a move above the major S&R pivot point at $25, which is along the right shoulder, will invalidate the LINK price forecast . Such a move will validate the slow formation of a falling wedge pattern between December 24. A wedge is a popular bullish reversal pattern. LINK Falls As Total Value Secured Slips Chainlink price retreat has coincided with the ongoing retreat of other DeFi tokens like AAVE, Uniswap, and Compound. At the same time, ecosystem data shows that the total value secured in the network has tracked downward in the past few days. This figure peaked at $41 billion earlier this month and then retreated to $35 billion. Most networks in its ecosystem, like Spark, Eigenpie, AAVE V2, and GMX have shed assets. Chainlink Open Interest More data by IntoTheBlock shows that the Chainlink open interest in the futures market has fallen in the past two weeks. The interest stood at $1.48 billion on December 30th from this month’s high of $2.8 billion. That is a sign that Chainlink is having soft demand in the futures market.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

38343166,https://finbold.com/?p=224542,1735645846,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Why MicroStrategy stock is crashing after another Bitcoin buying spree,https://finbold.com/why-microstrategy-stock-is-crashing-after-another-bitcoin-buying-spree/,"The share price of American business intelligence firm MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) is on a downward spiral as the company continues its aggressive Bitcoin ( BTC ) buying strategy. At the close of the last trading session, MSTR’s stock price was valued at $302.96, ending the day down over 8%. This decline extended losses seen on the weekly timeframe, with the equity plunging 15%. However, MSTR remains one of the best-performing stocks of 2024, rallying 342% year-to-date. Ahead of trading on the year’s final day, MSTR’s share price is up almost 3%, showing signs of recovery. MSTR one-day stock price chart. Source: Google Finance Why MSTR stock is down This plunge follows MicroStrategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition of 2,138 BTC for $209 million at an average price of $97,837 per Bitcoin. The company holds a total of 446,400 BTC, acquired for $27.9 billion at an average price of $62,428 per Bitcoin. While partly aligned with general market momentum, the stock’s ongoing short-term correction can be attributed to the company’s Bitcoin strategy. In this case, according to financial analysis platform The Kobeissi Letter in a December 30 X post , the market appears uneasy with MicroStrategy’s proposal to dramatically increase its authorized share count—from the current 330 million shares to a staggering 10.33 billion. If approved, this move would represent a significant shift in the company’s capital structure. It would enable continued Bitcoin acquisitions but dilute existing shareholders. Conversely, rejection of the proposal would limit the company’s ability to grow its Bitcoin holdings, a key component of its strategy. Amid this dilemma, The Kobeissi Letter observed that over the past month, MSTR shares have dropped nearly 50%, diverging sharply from Bitcoin’s modest 2% gain, as investors question the sustainability of MicroStrategy’s leveraged Bitcoin-centric model. MSTR stock’s optimistic and cautious outlook On the other hand, Felix Hartmann, founder of Hartmann Capital, expressed an optimistic yet cautious outlook in a December 30 X post . He projected that MicroStrategy stock could rise to become one of the world’s top companies by market cap before collapsing. “Within 5 years, MSTR will first become a top 5 company by market cap before eventually going bankrupt. We’re still early,” he warned. Hartmann cited several factors supporting the company’s near-term resilience. Much of MicroStrategy’s debt carries near-zero interest rates and matures between 2027 and 2030, minimizing immediate repayment pressures. Furthermore, while slowing Bitcoin purchases could unsettle markets, the company is unlikely to sell its holdings before 2025. He also emphasized Bitcoin’s inherent volatility, which creates cycles of skepticism during price dips and renewed confidence during rallies, ultimately boosting MicroStrategy’s valuation. However, he believes long-term challenges, such as maturing debt and unrealized losses on Bitcoin investments, will eventually undermine the company. Criticisms of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin plan MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, spearheaded by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has drawn praise and criticism . For example, American economist Peter Schiff has accused Saylor of gambling with investors’ money through the Bitcoin accumulation plan, warning that the firm is likely to dispose of its BTC holdings once the asset’s price plummets. Additionally, celebrity investor and author Robert Kiyosaki praised Saylor’s strategy as “genius,” commending the executive for creating wealth for MSTR investors. In conclusion, it remains to be seen how the Bitcoin strategy plays amid the mounting concerns despite MicroStrategy yielding significant gains.

Despite this, the cryptocurrency has several key support levels ahead, fueling optimism for a possible bullish recovery in the near future. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has recently faced a notable correction, with the price currently stabilizing at the ascending channel’s middle trendline near the $92K mark. This level acts as a critical support zone, historically representing a significant area of demand. Despite this support, sellers have exerted considerable pressure, threatening to break below this key threshold. In the event of a successful breach, Bitcoin could experience a cascade of long liquidations, potentially driving the price downward toward the 100-day moving average of $81K. This MA represents a robust dynamic support, likely to attract substantial buying interest and mitigate further downside momentum. Conversely, a rebound at the current level could see Bitcoin regain bullish momentum, aiming to retest the $108K upper boundary of the channel in the mid-term. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin has breached the middle trendline of its multi-month ascending channel, signaling increased distribution among participants. This bearish development coincides with growing market uncertainty as investors anticipate potential volatility surrounding President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025. Currently, Bitcoin hovers near a critical support range defined by the $90K threshold and the Fibonacci retracement levels at 0.5 ($87K) and 0.618 ($82K). This region is a formidable barrier to further selling pressure and is expected to trigger a market reversal. On-chain Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin market participants remain uncertain about the continuation of the bullish trend, with speculation revolving around whether higher prices are imminent or if the rally has concluded. A critical on-chain metric providing insight into this behavior is the realized price UTXO age bands, particularly for the 1-3 month (short-term) cohort. The realized price for this cohort acts as a dynamic threshold, reflecting the average price at which these recent buyers acquired their holdings. When BTC sustains above this realized price, it signals growing bullish momentum, indicating that new buyers are confident enough to hold despite elevated levels. On the contrary, a price drop below this threshold suggests a heightened risk of a sell-off, as these participants enter loss territory and may resort to panic selling, increasing downward pressure on the market. Currently, the realized price of the 1-3 month cohort resides at the $81K region, marking it as a critical support zone. This level is viewed as the primary defense line for buyers in the long-term outlook, with its ability to hold likely determining the broader market’s direction.

Bitcoin’s Support Levels Turn Into Resistance According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin’s price action on the weekly chart shows increasing signs of a shift towards a prolonged correction phase. The analyst points out that BTC has flipped old support levels into resistance, a bearish signal that could lead to further downside movement. “The weekly support has been lost.

Immediate resistance is noted at $95,234, followed by $96,860 and $98,361. On the downside, support levels at $92,103 and $89,613 are crucial for bulls to defend. Technical indicators suggest mixed momentum. Bitcoin is trading below its 50 EMA at $94,849, reflecting near-term bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, the RSI at 48.38 signals improving momentum, indicating potential for a bullish reversal if buying pressure increases. Analyst’s Outlook: Caution Amid Uncertainty Rekt Capital emphasizes that Bitcoin must reclaim the $94,250 level to prevent a sharper decline into the low $90,000s. However, the triple-bottom formation suggests resilience, with bulls likely to remain active near $92,000. Traders should monitor these key levels closely as BTC navigates this critical phase.

While the ETF approval provided the initial oomph for the 2024 rally, Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US elections helped overcome the 2021 high and hit $100,000. Let’s explore experts’ 2025 predictions for Bitcoin price. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago. This massive accomplishment comes after recovering from one of the biggest crypto market crashes caused by the collapse of FTX and its ripple effect, which caused a widespread financial crisis in adjacent institutions. Regardless, Bitcoin has emerged victorious. Trump’s victory and crypto-friendly regulatory promise, starting with replacing US SEC chairman Gary Gensler, helped Bitcoin’s 2024 bull run. This optimism can be witnessed in experts’ 2025 Bitcoin price predictions , which range from $150,000 to $300,000. The potential establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve will be a key event that could help propel Bitcoin to new highs in 2025. Another important shift in paradigm after the spot ETF approval is the institutional interest around BTC. On that note, MicroStrategy continues to accumulate BTC. The December 30 filings show the company acquired $209 million worth of BTC. The recent purchase brings their total holdings to 4,46,400 BTC, worth $42 billion. The cost basis for the total holdings hovers around $62,428 per bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Prediction For 2025: $150,000 to $300,000 According to Finder’s survey , the average Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 hovers around $113,364. Finder’s panel was conservative, expecting $113,364 by the end of 2025 and 282,238 by the close of 2030 Several CNBC’s panel members expect BTC to double and hit $200,000 in 2025, but the lower end of their 2025 prediction starts at $150,000. Regardless of these bullish predictions, Adrian Fritz, head of research at 21Shares, cautions investors about Bitcoin’s corrections. He adds that 20% to 40% corrections are “vital mechanism for reestablishing market equilibrium and are an integral part of bitcoin’s historical price patterns.“ Wall Street research firm and Brokerage giant Bernstein expects Bitcoin to hit $150,000 in 2025. Bitwise analysts expect Bitcoin to reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. CMT Analyst Adrian Zduńczyk is a firm believer that Bitcoin will peak at around $225,000 this cycle and is expecting BTC to transition from optimism to a belief phase. Standard Chartered expects BTC’s price to hit a peak of $250,000 in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, the bank’s head of digital asset research, noted that spot Bitcoin ETF flows could hit $50 to $100 billion by 2026. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee also shares this outlook. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya makes the most optimistic prediction. According to Palihapitiya, Bitcoin could hit $500,000 by October 2025 and is forecasted to be worth $1 million by 2040. What To Expect From Bitcoin Price In January 2025 Bitcoin’s 2024-2025 price is setting the stage for a massive rally to the upside if history rhymes. The ongoing BTC consolidation resembles that of 2023-2024, where the rangebound movement was met with a deviation to the downside, which was followed by a parabolic move to the upside, leading to new ATHs. Hence, if history repeats, BTC could sweep the range low of $90,799, leading to a quick rally and a breakout above the range high of $104,100. Such a development could propel BTC to set up a new ATH around $128,000 to $130,000. BTC/USDT 12-hour chart Although the outlook for Bitcoin remains predominantly bullish, a Tether-related FUD that leads to a depeg of the USDT stablecoin could have a significant impact on the markets. In such a case, a breakdown of the $90,000 support level could invalidate the bullish thesis and potentially trigger a crash to $78,000, as forecasted by veteran trader Peter Brandt .

Donald Trump, reelected in November 2024, frequently criticizes Powell. This raises questions about how the relationship between the White House and the Federal Reserve might evolve in the coming year. Throughout 2024, Trump publicly attacked Powell’s leadership, arguing that the president should have greater influence over Federal Reserve decisions. On the campaign trail, Trump claimed Powell had “gotten it wrong a lot” and suggested that his administration could reexamine the Fed’s independence. Federal Reserve spending under a ‘microscope’ After Trump’s reelection, Powell forcefully dismissed rumors of being removed from his position, emphasizing his intent to serve out his term, which expires in May 2026. However, even if Powell retains his position, analysts expect renewed friction between the administration and the Fed. The President-elect has appointed billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy to head the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.GE). The duo has pledged to overhaul federal spending, and their plans could include significant changes at the Federal Reserve. Musk recently called the Fed “absurdly overstaffed” on his social media platform X, hinting at potential workforce reductions. The Fed is absurdly overstaffed — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) December 23, 2024 According to a report from Yahoo Finance, the Federal Reserve employs approximately 24,000 individuals across the United States, with 86% of its workforce stationed in regional reserve banks. The headquarters in Washington, D.C., houses about 3,000 employees. Unlike most federal agencies, the Fed operates independently of taxpayer funding, financing itself through revenue generated by government securities. Despite its independence, critics do not see the Fed’s operational expenses as insignificant. In 2024, its net operating expenses were budgeted at $7.1 billion, roughly 0.1% of the federal government’s total budget. Historically, the Fed has sent excess revenue to the U.S. Treasury, transferring nearly $1 trillion between 2012 and 2021. Trump’s economic policies clash with the Fed’s plan Trump recently announced plans to impose steep tariffs: 10% on imports from China and 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada. These measures, aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, are projected to have significant economic repercussions. EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco warned that the tariffs could lead to stagflation , marked by slower economic growth and higher inflation. He estimates that the tariffs would reduce US GDP by 1.5% in 2025 while increasing inflation by 0.4%. Financial market volatility could also follow, adding pressure to an economy already grappling with persistent inflation. However, not all experts share Daco’s concerns about inflation. Former St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard, who served during Trump’s first term, argued that the growth-reducing effects of tariffs might offset any inflationary impacts. “ The detriment to the world economy would outweigh any price effects, ” Bullard noted, casting doubt on the notion that tariffs alone would drive inflation higher. Interest rates in question, again The Federal Reserve’s December 2024 meeting forecasts suggested a cautious path for interest rates. Markets anticipated that the federal funds rate would drop slightly to 3.9% by December 2025, compared to the current target range of 4.25-4.5%. However, these projections look rather too optimistic given the potential inflationary pressures from Trump’s economic agenda, including tax cuts, tariffs, and immigration policies. Financial analysts from the Financial Times noted that the Fed’s cautious stance could diverge from the more aggressive rate-cutting strategies of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England, further complicating the global economic landscape. Trump’s economic policies, combined with Musk and Ramaswamy’s cost-cutting initiatives, may pose significant challenges for the Federal Reserve. While the Fed has historically operated with substantial independence, tensions with the White House could test that autonomy.

VeChain (VET): Enhancing Supply Chain Transparency with Blockchain VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform that improves supply chain management. It assigns unique IDs and sensors to physical products, allowing detailed tracking through the supply chain. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, former CIO at Louis Vuitton China, VeChain moved to its own blockchain, VeChainThor, in 2018. It uses a dual-token system: VET for value transfer and VeThor Token (VTHO) for transaction fees. Partnerships with companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walmart China, and BMW highlight its practical use. VET ranks among the top 40 in market cap, showing significant adoption. In the current market cycle, VeChain’s focus on real-world applications and expanding partnerships makes it an attractive option. Ethena (ENA) A Synthetic Dollar Protocol on Ethereum Ethena ENA is a synthetic dollar protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a crypto-native solution for a stable currency that does not rely on traditional banking infrastructure. Ethena offers a globally accessible, dollar-denominated savings instrument known as the Internet Bond. This technology has the potential to address the need for decentralized stablecoins in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By eliminating dependence on banks, Ethena seeks to enhance financial accessibility and resilience. In the current market cycle, interest in decentralized finance solutions remains strong, and Ethena’s approach to synthetic assets could make it an attractive option for users seeking stability and yield within the crypto space.

This approach democratizes access to high-grade financial products, using blockchain to enhance financial infrastructure. ONDO’s structure includes an asset management arm creating tokenized financial products and a technology arm developing decentralized finance protocols to improve functionality and scalability. Collaborations with reputable partners like BlackRock and Coinbase underscore its commitment to quality and security. Notably, USDY offers stablecoin accessibility and yield, secured by U.S. Treasuries and bank demand deposits. In the evolving cryptocurrency market, ONDO’s focus on transparency, compliance, and real-world asset integration may position it as an attractive option, though individuals should assess its suitability based on current market conditions. Fetch.ai (FET): Decentralized AI and Machine Learning with Crypto Economy Founded in 2017 and launched on Binance in 2019, Fetch.ai (FET) is an AI lab building an open, decentralized machine learning network powered by a crypto economy. Fetch.ai aims to make AI technology accessible by allowing anyone to connect and share secure data using autonomous AI agents on its permissionless network.

Based on historical price trends and Bitcoin halving cycles, FET’s price could reach up to $1.024293 by 2025. The coin’s technology and practical applications suggest potential growth, making Fetch.ai an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion While ENA, ONDO, FET, and VET show less short-term potential, Catzilla shines as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale and triple utility features—governance, rewards, and staking—Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the battle against crypto villains and participate in a rewarding venture.

Earlier this month, on Dec. 22, Hoskinson had said 2025 will be ADA’s year . Now, many crypto enthusiasts believe delimited continuations might be the new technological addition that the co-founder had been hinting at. Although such a phrase does sound very hefty to consider, its impacts can indeed reflect a legitimate impression on the execution of Cardano ( ADA ) and the consequences of its developments and investments. Next year, Cardano is going to heights it's never been before. We got Bitcoin DeFi, Midnight, Patnerchains, all the DApp upgrades, Midgard, and some extra magic that we'll call ""the fire rises"" pic.twitter.com/ITI6S7mHun — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 What are Delimited continuations? Delimited continuations are a programming construct that allows a programmer to suspend an ongoing computation and later continue it. There is a potential for increased performance and customization in the running of ADA’s smart contracts programs designed to undertake actions fully automatically under certain conditions. I had a two hour discussion last night about adding delimited continuations to Cardano. Any opinions? — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 Hoskinson brought into the limelight two significant use cases of delimited continuations for the ADA ecosystem. First, they may allow differentiation of on-chain (stored on the blockchain) and off-chain (external) computations in zero-knowledge proofs , which are extremely important to the Cardano project Midnight. Second, they can provide a new way of thinking about classical state machine architectures, making it easier to write and execute smart contracts. You might also like: Unlock massive 1000x gains: Analysts favor new SOL meme coin over ADA and SUI for 2025 Why this matters to Cardano investors This exploration for investors means that ADA is innovating in the blockchain space. Improving smart contract capabilities, as Hoskinson has been focusing on, fits into the broader goal of getting more decentralized applications on the platform. A more developer-friendly platform could increase adoption, and this may lead to increased demand for its native cryptocurrency, ADA. You might also like: Crypto whales: Friends or foes? However, there are challenges. Speaking for his company, Hoskinson mentioned that delimited continuations aren’t an easy thing to implement. ADA uses the Plutus smart contract platform, whose computational rules are rigid than Haskell’s. This, Hoskinson says, might increase developmental costs and time, thus delaying the anticipated benefits by investors. The issue is that while haskell is a lazy language, plutus is strict. This greatly complicates the actual implementation. We do have DC support in Haskell since GHC 9.6 thanks to Alexis's hard work at @tweagio . I suspect we could use freer monads as a path to DC support. It… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 What the Cardano community thinks This crypto community has already been weighing in. Developers like @bitcodyy on X see delimited continuations to optimize complex computations, providing DApp developers with flexibility. While others are rather cautious of its unintended consequences, namely having an even higher cost or issues with maintaining decentralization. Delimited continuations on Cardano would open up some fascinating possibilities for optimizing complex computations and enhancing smart contract flexibility. Curious, what specific use cases or challenges were driving the discussion? — ₿itcody 📈 (@bitcodyy) December 31, 2024 What’s next for Cardano? For new investors, the answer is clear: ADA could stay ahead of time. This whole exploration into delimited continuations testifies to the blockchain’s ambition to at least stay parallel with platforms like Ethereum since the latter has an upper hand in its smart contract application. Whether these innovations pay off is yet to be seen, but for someone who wants to invest in a blockchain technology that will be of interest in the long term, Hoskinson’s vision for Cardano makes it a project to keep a close eye on. Meanwhile, the developments surrounding Midnight, Cardano’s zero-knowledge-proof solution, and delimited continuations could have an impact on the future of the platform’s ecosystem. The success or failure of Cardano’s pursuit of these cutting-edge ideas will probably define its place in the crypto market for years to come.

Here’s What to Expect Moving Into 2025,https://coingape.com/is-the-altcoin-correction-over-heres-what-to-expect-moving-into-2025/,"Following the Bitcoin price drop to $91,400 levels earlier today, altcoins faced even greater correction with Ethereum (ETH), XRP, BNB Coin (BNB), and others turning red today. However, market analysts predict that this could be the last leg of correction before a mega rally resumes in January 2025. As a result, analysts predict the alt market cap to hit $2.75 trillion during the next bull run. Is Altcoin Correction Is Coming To An End? Renowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has expressed optimism about the future trajectory of Bitcoin and altcoins, hinting at a significant bullish phase ahead. “The correction is almost over, and the time for ‘up only’ is on the horizon for Altcoins and Bitcoin,” van de Poppe stated. Earlier today, Bitcoin price took a dive to $91,300 level and has recovered the daily loss and currently trading 0.70% up $94,026 with a market cap of $1.862 trillion. The analyst highlighted $90K as an optimal entry point for Bitcoin longs, suggesting that the market is approaching these levels and positioning for substantial growth. Source: Michael van de Poppe On the other hand, the alt season index has crashed from a peak of 88 to a low of 49 as of date, per the data from Blockchain Center . Last week on December 26, the index had dropped to 43 and has recovered since then showing optimism as we move into 2025. Most of the top altcoins are showing double-digit losses on the weekly chart, however, analysts are hopeful for a strong recovery in early 2025. Source: Blockchain Center Will Ethereum Drive the Altseason? Throughout 2024, Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin. However, market analysts are optimistic about an Ethereum price rally ahead in Q1 2025 to lead the altseason. But ETH price might see a final dip under $3,000 before recovering to hitting fresh highs next year. Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio stands at 0.03583 but if Ethereum performs as it did during its breakout from December 2020 to its peak in November 2021, ETH/BTC could rise to 0.114, suggesting a target price of $10,600 for Ethereum at the current Bitcoin prices. Analysts predict that the ETH/BTC ratio can surge as high as 0.161, a nearly 4.5x increase. t the current Bitcoin price, this would push Ethereum’s value to as high as $15,200 per ETH. If Bitcoin’s price reaches $150,000, Ethereum could hit $21,900, based on this historical comparison. With Bitcoin potentially reaching $200,000 , Ethereum’s value could range from $22,800 to $32,000, a scenario that puts the ETH/BTC ratio in an interesting position. Correction: ETH/BTC would actually be 0.161 up from 0.03583 (~4.5x). Otherwise prices are correct though. Addition: If $ETH does just as well as from the final break out in Dec 2020 to its high in Nov 2021, ETH/BTC goes to 0.114, which would result in $10.6k $ETH at the current… — Mat (@materkel) December 30, 2024 This could potentially also trigger a broader altcoin season with other participants like XRP, BNB, SOL, and DOGE, joining the bandwagon. DeFiTracer has forecasted that the biggest altseason is set to begin in January, citing a key technical indicator known as the golden cross. The signal, which often suggests a bullish market trend, has prompted growing optimism among traders. As per the below chart, the analyst predicts the alt market cap to reach $2.75 trillion.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lunex Network rises as a top contender, with analysts predicting it could surpass XRP and TRON by Q1 2025 thanks to its trading solutions and soaring presale demand. Table of Contents Lunex Network promises huge gains XRP battles bearish pressure TRON price dips after ATH Lunex Network set to outpace XRP and TRON Lunex Network (LNEX) is quickly grabbing the interest of investors as Ripple (XRP) and TRON (TRX) deal with mixed signals. Analysts currently estimate Lunex Network may soon exceed XRP and TRX by Q1 2025 with its approach to crypto trading and massive investor demand for the limited LNEX token supply. Though XRP and TRX have great promise, why are seasoned investors beginning to diversify into Lunex Network? Read on to discover the creative elements of Lunex Network and the reasons it might well be the next big thing in cryptocurrencies. Lunex Network promises huge gains Within a perfect, user-friendly application, Lunex Network provides a unique crypto wallet that improves the maintenance, trading, and exchanging of over 50,000 cryptocurrencies across 40+ blockchains. Perfect cross-chain swaps from Lunex Network give users a better and more reasonably priced trading environment than those of single-blockchain decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and PancakeSwap. Though it also helps companies to safely accept crypto payments globally, this ultra-low-fee, non-custodial platform is quickly attracting high-frequency traders and investors searching for a faster and more reasonable approach to trade and handle their crypto assets. From its starting $0.0012 presale price to the current $0.0049 pricing, the Lunex Network presale has seen an amazing rise; the LNEX token has risen by over 300% in just a few months. Having already sold more than 2.4 billion LNEX tokens, this shows great investor interest and increasing faith in Lunex Network’s future potential. Lunex Network offers a chance for massive profits with analysts forecasting a 500% gain by the end of the presale and a possible 50x return after the token launches on multiple exchanges in Q1 2025.

The series of lower highs and lower lows that have molded the recent market action on the XRP price chart clearly shows this bearish trend, which resulted in a plunge below the $1.99 support level. The XRP price has shown resilience, meanwhile, breaking back over the $2.2 level in spite of the bearish momentum. XRP has had a tremendous comeback over the previous month, rising more than 55%, therefore demonstrating its potential for further rallies. XRP has repeatedly faced rejection around the $2.7 zone, but analysts still hope for a positive breakout before the year ends. Technical indicators are mainly positive; the Momentum Oscillator, MACD, and Moving Averages hint at purchasing prospects on the XRP price chart. The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) shows some bearish signs, but generally, XRP’s price structure looks bullish. TRON price dips after ATH With a prior week drop of more than 13%, the TRON price has been under notable negative pressure lately. After reaching a fresh all-time high of $0.44 on December 4, the TRON price had a significant decline and fell below the $0.26 support level. The TRON price is now hovering just above the $0.23 support zone, where the altcoin has seen rejection from this fall. Still, many TRON holders, especially those purchasing the dips, anticipate a possible breakout as the market stabilizes. Despite recent price swings, the TRON price chart shows that the altcoin has exhibited a notable increase over the previous month, rising by 17%, indicating a great optimistic sentiment. With the Momentum Oscillator, MACD, and Moving Averages all pointing toward bullish momentum, the technical indicators on the TRON price chart also provide hopeful signals. These signals imply that TRON might shortly undergo a recovery and perhaps break out in the bullish direction despite the current negative pressure. Lunex Network set to outpace XRP and TRON While XRP and TRX negotiate changing market conditions, Lunex Network is fast rising as a very promising competitor. Lunex Network is drawing a flood of investors looking for greater flexibility and better profits with its creative cross-chain swaps, ultra-low fees, and strong crypto wallet supporting over 50,000 coins. Crypto aficionados have taken notice of the 300% increase in LNEX token value and its increasing momentum in the presale phase while projections indicate possible 50x gains post-launch in Q1 2025.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 13:22:00

Some tokens stand out for their potential to grow. DTX Exchange (DTX), Solana (SOL), and SUI are catching attention for their unique features and uses. If you’re looking for coins that might be worth watching, these could be great picks. But what makes them so special, and why are experts talking about them now? Let’s find out. 1. DTX Exchange DTX Exchange is changing the game in the crypto world with its fair and innovative approach. Unlike traditional models, DTX gives equal opportunities to all investors, whether big or small. DTX token holders have access to a wide range of assets. These include the best altcoins, forex, stocks, and ETFs. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange offers speed and security. DTX Exchange comes with a remarkable speed of 100,000 TPS! Early DTX presale investors are already seeing great returns. During its ICO, the DeFi coin price surged by 500%, and experts predict more growth soon. The DTX token is valued at $0.14 in Stage 7 of its public presale and is gaining attention. Analysts expect it to hit $0.20 by early 2025 when it launches on major exchanges like Binance and Uniswap. This could make it one of the best cryptos to buy now. The DTX Exchange platform also rewards loyal investors with its cliff pricing strategy. By holding DTX tokens, users can shape the platform’s future and enjoy financial perks. Many believe DTX’s price could climb even higher in the coming months. 2. Solana Regulators recently dealt a blow to Solana’s hopes for an ETF. Two out of five asset managers who applied for a Solana ETF were told their applications would likely be rejected. This setback may delay the ETF process, which could negatively impact SOL’s price action. The reason for the likely rejection is Solana’s unclear regulatory status. In the past, Solana was classified as a security in lawsuits against major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. This uncertainty makes Solana’s future uncertain, and investors are left wondering if it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy. Regarding SOL’s performance, the coin experienced price improvements in the last week. The coin is currently selling at $195.01, indicating an 8.23% rise in that timeframe. Solana’s price is looking strong, with SOL analysts predicting it will reach $328.75 in early 2025. However, SOL investors may consider DTX exchange, which is expected to provide more profitable gains than SOL. 3. SUI On January 1, 2025, the Sui Network will release 64.19 million $SUI tokens, making up 2.19% of the circulating supply. This move could change the token’s market dynamics. If demand is low, the increased supply might push $SUI’s price down. But if many holders keep their tokens, the price impact might be smaller. SUI’s price dropped 3.59% over the past week. It’s now trading at $4.10, a slight decrease from its previous value. Sui’s price is gaining attention with its upward momentum. While some technical signs, like the Momentum Oscillator and Moving Averages, suggest the price will keep rising, others, like the Williams Percent Range indicator, are flashing sell signals, hinting at a potential downturn. The confidence of investors weakened by this conflicting prediction can be restored with DTX Exchange, as experts predict incredible surges for the coin. DTX Token Sees Massive Surge, Predicted to Soar in 2025 The DTX token is seeing incredible growth, surging over 500% during its ICO. Although SUI and SOL are expected to generate profit, DTX exchange is the best option. It’s currently priced at $0.14 in round 7, but analysts expect it to launch at $0.20 on leading exchanges in Q1 2025. With its investor-friendly ecosystem, DTX is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy in this market dip. Post-launch, the token is predicted to achieve 100x gains, making it a promising investment opportunity. As the DeFi coin price continues to fluctuate, DTX is worth keeping an eye on.

Market observers and crypto enthusiasts are drawing parallels between the soaring success of Mystery and the remarkable rise of $PEPE in previous market cycles. This surge is being fueled by a compelling narrative tied to “The Night Riders,” an older publishing by Matt Furie, who also created characters that drove the crypto meme coin trend in 2024. Launched on the Ethereum Network, Mystery Coin has quickly become the topic of energetic discussions across social media platforms, live streams, and crypto-focused forums. The project references Matt Furie’s “The Night Riders,” a publication that preceded his well-known “Boys Club” series. The latter gave rise to popular tokens such as $PEPE, $BRETT, $ANDY, and $WOLF, all of which achieved significant successes in 2024. With the introduction of Mystery, Toki, and Hoodrat—characters from “The Night Riders”—crypto enthusiasts are predicting a new wave of momentum leading into the 2025 bull run. The market capitalization of tokens linked to Matt Furie’s “Boys Club” characters soared collectively to over $10 billion. Many industry watchers are now focusing on the similar potential that “The Night Riders” characters could unlock, and Mystery Coin is rapidly becoming the centerpiece of that speculation. According to its team, Mystery has established a strong foundation with no taxes, a renounced contract, and locked liquidity, reinforcing its identity as a community-centric project. Observers note that Mystery’s lower market capitalization, compared to older meme tokens tied to Furie’s work, creates substantial room for further growth. In addition to its strong community-driven growth, Mystery Coin has already achieved notable milestones, including its listing on GATE.io’s pilot platform and the Binance Wallet, signaling growing recognition from top-tier platforms. These achievements further bolster the token’s credibility and visibility within the crypto space, laying the groundwork for potential future listings on major centralized exchanges. Crypto influencers, including respected personalities such as Davinci, have drawn attention to Mystery’s meteoric rise. Market analysts suggest that social media conversations about Mystery’s rapid appreciation in value, combined with its creative branding and strong community support, have contributed significantly to its current momentum. The Mystery community has also been extremely active, with over 6000 new holders joining in a short span of time, further fueling positive sentiment around the token. Speculation has risen that prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs) are evaluating potential listings for Mystery. The high trading volume and enthusiastic community engagement are reminiscent of the early days of $PEPE’s explosive popularity. Evidence of Mystery’s original connection to Matt Furie’s “The Night Riders” storyline has been shared across various social platforms, reinforcing the sense of authenticity behind the project’s narrative. The name of the frog character in “The Night Riders” is revealed as “Mystery,” a detail that has strengthened the community’s belief in its legitimacy and historical significance. As the project continues to evolve, Mystery’s tokenomics remain straightforward, with a total supply of 420,690,000,000,000 tokens. The team highlights the absence of any tax structure, emphasizing that there are “no tricks and no added complexities,” consistent with their commitment to transparency. The sense of nostalgia tied to the older Matt Furie characters, combined with the potential for continued market interest heading into 2025, further cements Mystery’s position as one of the most watched meme coins in the space. Speaking on behalf of the team, a spokesperson for Mystery Coin noted that their focus is on growing a robust community. “The engagement and excitement around Mystery have been incredible,” commented the representative. “We believe in the strong legacy of Matt Furie’s characters, and we are thrilled to see such rapid and enthusiastic support from crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Our priority is to honor that heritage by maintaining a transparent and user-friendly environment for all our holders.” For more information visit https://furies-mystery.com .

In a striking display of vigilance, Vietnam’s Hanoi City Police dismantled an elaborate crypto scam that defrauded victims of $1.17 million, while blockchain sleuths uncovered fresh activity from the notorious “Blockchain Bandit,” a hacker responsible for stealing tens of thousands of Ether by exploiting weak private keys. Blockchain Bandit Resurfaces: Consolidates 51,000 Stolen Ether After Two Years of Dormancy The infamous hacker known as the Blockchain Bandit, who amassed over 51,000 Ether ( ETH ) by exploiting weak private keys, has reappeared on the blockchain radar. After nearly two years of inactivity, the Bandit moved the entirety of the stolen Ether into a single wallet, raising alarm bells across the cryptocurrency community. On Dec. 30, 2024, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported in a Telegram post that the stolen funds had been transferred from 10 separate wallets into a multi-signature wallet identified as “0xC45…1D542.” The movements occurred in a series of rapid transactions, primarily in batches of 5,000 Ether, between 8:54 PM and 9:18 PM UTC. Before this activity, the stolen funds had remained untouched since Jan. 21, 2023, when they were previously consolidated. Notably, around the same time in 2023, the hacker also transferred 470 Bitcoin (BTC), further cementing their reputation as a significant threat to blockchain security. The Blockchain Bandit’s nefarious activities date back to 2016, with their most audacious operations taking place in 2018. Using a process dubbed ”Ethercombing,” the hacker employed brute-force techniques to search for random private keys. By exploiting faulty code and flawed random number generators, the Bandit uncovered 732 private keys linked to 49,060 transactions, accumulating nearly 45,000 Ether in the process. Crypto security analyst Adrian Bednarek, who coined the term Ethercombing, explained that such exploits were theoretically improbable but became feasible due to vulnerabilities in key generation processes. Speculations on the Hacker's Identity The identity of the Blockchain Bandit remains shrouded in mystery, although some experts, including Bednarek, have suggested that a state actor, potentially North Korea, could be behind the thefts. This theory aligns with broader concerns about state-sponsored cybercrime in the cryptocurrency sector, where digital assets are increasingly targeted for their liquidity and anonymity. The Bandit's resurgence brings attention to a troubling trend in the crypto space: an unprecedented rise in hacking incidents. According to a recent report from on-chain security firm Cyvers, hackers stole over $2.3 billion worth of digital assets in 2024, a staggering 40% increase compared to 2023. These thefts occurred across 165 major incidents, with access control breaches accounting for 81% of the stolen value—equivalent to $1.9 billion. Centralized exchanges and custodian platforms were particularly vulnerable, underscoring the pressing need for improved cybersecurity measures. The uptick in cyberattacks has reignited debates around the security of blockchain networks and the critical importance of robust private key management. The movement of such a significant amount of Ether has triggered widespread speculation about the hacker's motives. Some experts believe the consolidation could precede an attempt to cash out through mixers or decentralized exchanges, while others warn it may signal an escalation in the hacker's activities. ZachXBT’s analysis and transparency efforts have been praised within the crypto community, but the incident also serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that persist in the blockchain ecosystem. For many, the Blockchain Bandit's exploits are a wake-up call to strengthen security practices at both individual and institutional levels. As the blockchain industry continues to grow, so do the challenges posed by cybercriminals. Innovations like quantum computing and advanced cryptographic techniques are being explored to fortify blockchain security, as highlighted by Adam Back, a prominent figure in the crypto space. However, these advancements are still in their nascent stages and far from foolproof. The Blockchain Bandit saga serves as both a cautionary tale and a call to action. As the community grapples with the implications of this latest development, one thing is clear: the battle for blockchain security is far from over. Hanoi Police Halt $1.17 Million Crypto Scam, Saving 300 Potential Victims The Hanoi City Police Department has thwarted an elaborate cryptocurrency scam that defrauded victims of over 30 billion Vietnamese dong ($1.17 million) and prevented an additional 300 individuals from falling prey to the scheme. The operation targeted unsuspecting Vietnamese citizens and businesses. At the center of the scam was Million Smiles, a company that lured investors with false promises and elaborate marketing tactics. The company promoted a fictitious cryptocurrency called QFS (Quantum Financial System), claiming it offered access to a groundbreaking financial ecosystem. Million Smiles deployed deceptive advertising linking QFS to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims, enticing individuals and businesses with promises of unrealistic returns. The company falsely asserted that owning QFS tokens would provide benefits like collateral-free and interest-free funding. Hanoi police uncovered the scheme when Million Smiles attempted to host a meeting with 300 potential investors. These meetings were aimed at convincing individuals to invest amounts ranging from 4–5 million dong ($190) to 39 million dong ($1,350) for businesses. During a raid on the company’s headquarters, authorities seized documents, computers, and other materials critical to the investigation. Subsequent inquiries confirmed that the QFS token was entirely fictitious and did not comply with Vietnamese law, making the scheme illegal. Before the crackdown, Million Smiles had already defrauded approximately 100 businesses and 400 individuals, exploiting their trust through manipulative marketing and fabricated claims. The company’s methods demonstrate the evolving sophistication of crypto scams in Vietnam and the broader region. Vietnam has demonstrated a robust commitment to combating crypto-related crimes, with multiple crackdowns on fraudulent schemes. In October 2024, police in Nghe An Province, which borders Laos, dismantled a scam network run by offshore actors. This group specialized in ” pig-butchering ” scams—a form of social engineering where scammers build trust with victims over time before deceiving them into making significant financial investments. One victim from Ho Chi Minh City was lured into investing in “Biconomynft,” a fraudulent app promising exorbitant returns. Over several months, the scammer, posing as a woman, stole more than 17.6 billion dong ($700,000) from the victim. Vietnam’s Broader Crypto Landscape Despite its status as one of the world’s leading adopters of blockchain technology, Vietnam remains vigilant against fraud. The government has launched several initiatives to foster blockchain innovation while ensuring investor protection. In recent months, Vietnam released a national blockchain strategy aiming for regional leadership, emphasizing the balance between innovation and regulation. The Million Smiles case places the spotlight on the urgent need for education and awareness about the risks of crypto investments. The promise of quick riches often blinds investors to the red flags associated with such schemes. Law enforcement’s decisive actions, like those seen in Hanoi and Nghe An, serve as a deterrent, but the onus is also on individuals to exercise caution and conduct due diligence.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ZRX,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 13:30:00

With its innovative approach to integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI is capturing investor attention through its highly anticipated Lightchain AI Presale , offering early access to its promising ecosystem. Alongside Lightchain AI , other tokens are also gaining traction, showcasing the potential for breakout performances. For investors seeking transformative projects with strong fundamentals, the new year presents exciting opportunities in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. The Rise of Lightchain AI- Revolutionizing the Blockchain with AI Integration Lightchain AI is spearheading a new era in blockchain technology by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence into its ecosystem. At the heart of its innovation lies the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which incentivizes computational contributions to AI processes, transforming the way networks operate. Complementing this is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a groundbreaking platform enabling decentralized AI applications to thrive. By combining blockchain's security with AI's analytical power, Lightchain AI addresses scalability, efficiency, and transparency challenges that have long plagued traditional networks. This synergy positions it as a leader in redefining decentralized systems, paving the way for AI-driven advancements in industries such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management, all while empowering a decentralized, intelligent future. Presale Insights- Key Metrics and Milestones for Lightchain AI Lightchain AI is currently conducting its presale, offering early supporters the opportunity to acquire LCAI tokens at a discounted rate of $0.0045 per token. This presale phase has a hard cap of 4 billion LCAI tokens, representing 40% of the total 10 billion token supply. Participants can purchase tokens using Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT) by connecting their decentralized wallets, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, to the Lightchain AI platform. The presale is structured in stages, with the current price set to increase in subsequent phases, incentivizing early participation. Additionally, Lightchain AI has undergone smart contract audits to ensure security and transparency for its investors. By joining the presale, investors gain early access to Lightchain AI's innovative ecosystem, which integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Top Tokens to Watch- Emerging Opportunities in the New Year While Lightchain AI is undoubtedly a token to keep an eye on, other projects are also shaping up for a breakout year. One such project is Polkadot, which offers cross-chain interoperability through its innovative parachain technology, making it easier for different blockchains to communicate and exchange data. With backing from prominent figures in the industry, Polkadot has gained significant traction and presents promising potential for growth. Another project to watch out for is Chainlink, which enables smart contracts to interact with real-world data sources securely. As more industries turn towards decentralized systems, Chainlink's oracle solutions have positioned it as a leader in bridging the gap between on-chain and off-chain data, making it a valuable token in the growing DeFi sector. The rise of Lightchain AI and other tokens demonstrates the potential for growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency space. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and integrate with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, new opportunities will arise for investors seeking transformative projects with strong fundamentals.

On Thursday, the Tesla & SpaceX CEO lead posted on X, a dollar bill with a Dogecoin-dog logo, sparking speculations of a Dogecoin reserve ahead. As a response, market watchers are anticipating remarkable gains in DOGE price ahead despite the recent market volatility. Elon Musk’s DOGE Post Sparks Speculation Over Dogecoin National Reserve In an X post on December 31, Elon Musk shared a pic of a dollar bill with the logo of the Shiba Inu dog breed behind Dogecoin instead of George Washington. Notably, the pic is about three years old, saved on Musk’s laptop, and is a sticker gifted by a German guy. This post has set off market-wide speculations of whether a Dogecoin reserve could be in the pipeline. This move has sparked discussions in the broader crypto market, especially with Musk’s previous backing for the top meme coin . Besides, the recent shifting focus of investors towards the meme coin sector has further fueled speculations in the market. Meanwhile, the Tesla & SpaceX CEO has previously backed the top dog-themed meme cryptocurrency, which has gained notable traction from the market participants. Simultaneously, a stockpile of other events has cemented Dogecoin’s stance as a top crypto asset, primarily in light of Elon Musk’s previous support and Donald Trump’s win in the U.S. elections. What’s Next For DOGE? Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) post under Trump’s presidency has substantially uplifted the market sentiment for Dogecoin. A recent CoinGape report even revealed that Musk’s D.O.G.E., led by V. Ramaswamy , aims to tackle the U.S.’s $36 trillion debt crisis. Also, speculations of the meme coin hitting the $4 mark have prevailed as the Tesla & SpaceX lead said D.O.G.E has real potential . DOGE price traded at $0.3207 at the time of reporting, up marginally by 0.04% at the time of reporting. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.3065 and $0.322, respectively. Intriguingly, a recent Dogecoin price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token also eyes a potential $20 target this bull cycle, further solidifying bullishness in light of the abovementioned developments. Considering all these aspects, it is likely that the DOGE price is gearing up for a robust rally amid soaring anticipation over a broader crypto market rally.

The vulnerability was discovered after discussions on Reddit highlighted the risks to users’ funds. Redditors criticized Tangem for exposing the private keys to email accounts and making them accessible to its employees. Tangem’s Wallet Vulnerability: What Happened? On Dec. 29, a Reddit user, u/areklanga, raised the alarm , claiming Tangem had failed to address the issue promptly. They alleged that private keys were stored in email histories and possibly in Tangem’s internal systems. The user further noted that an earlier Reddit post pointing out the problem was mysteriously deleted. Tangem acknowledged the flaw on Dec. 30 and released a bug fix to address the issue. HOLY CRAP TANGEM WALLET JUST LEAKED SEED PHRASES. Someone called them out on Reddit and Tangem had to figure it out. pic.twitter.com/zA5OqRGb0h — Lysander (@UnderCoercion) December 31, 2024 In a statement addressing the issue, Tangem assured its users that the problem had been fully resolved. The company said , “We sincerely appreciate your feedback regarding this issue and want to assure you that it has been fully resolved, At Tangem, we prioritize transparency, security, and trust, and we take matters like these extremely seriously.” According to Tangem, the vulnerability stemmed from a bug in the app’s log processing system. This flaw affected a limited group of users who created wallets using seed phrases and contacted the support team directly through the app. These logs, which included private keys, were accessible for a short period before being deleted. The company clarified that users who activated their wallets without seed phrases were unaffected, as their private keys are generated directly on Tangem’s hardware cards. The company explained: “Private keys do not exist with such setups, therefore they are unable to be extracted by anyone, not even Tangem.” While the overall impact was minimal, affecting fewer than 0.1% of users, Tangem acknowledged the seriousness of the situation. “We recognize the trust you place in Tangem, and we are fully committed to maintaining that trust by upholding the highest standards of security and transparency.” Tangem Fixes Security Bug, Promises No Private Key Compromises Tangem swiftly responded by identifying the bug, fixing it, and updating the app to ensure that private keys are no longer logged under any circumstances. To further safeguard users, the company has permanently deleted all logs and attachments sent to its support team and implemented enhanced security protocols to prevent similar issues in the future. Tangem is also reaching out directly to potentially affected users, providing clear instructions on securing their accounts. The company is urging all users to update to the latest version of the Tangem app for optimal security. Additionally, Tangem highlighted its active bug bounty program, which incentivizes security researchers and ethical hackers to identify system vulnerabilities. Tangem reassured its community that no private keys were compromised, no funds were lost, and no unauthorized access occurred due to the bug. Despite the fix, some crypto community members criticized Tangem for its lack of transparency. As of Dec. 31, the company had not announced the issue on its social media platforms, including Twitter, Discord, or Telegram.

The exchange reported 130,936 BTC in user assets, an 8,992 BTC reduction from November’s numbers. In contrast, Ethereum holdings grew by 85,265 to reach 1.765 million ETH. However, USDT balances increased by 1.91 billion to 8.56 billion, representing a 28.79% monthly gain. The latest data confirms full backing across all assets, with the exchange maintaining a 105% Bitcoin reserve ratio. This means for every 100 BTC in user deposits, OKX holds 105 BTC in its wallets. The report provides a complete breakdown of assets held directly by the exchange and those in third-party custody. Bitcoin holdings drop while other assets grow The reduction in Bitcoin holdings mirrors broader market trends in December. This change brought OKX’s total Bitcoin user assets to 130,936 BTC. This is split between 124,699 BTC held directly by the exchange and 12,312 BTC in third-party custody. The exchange’s 105% reserve ratio means OKX maintains 137,011 BTC in total wallet assets, keeping an extra buffer above user deposits. OKX crypto holdings as of December 2024. Source: Wu Blockchain While Bitcoin holdings decreased, other major assets on OKX saw notable growth. Ethereum assets increased by 85,265 ETH to reach 1.765 million ETH, with the exchange maintaining a 102% reserve ratio. This means OKX holds 1.807 million ETH in wallet assets, divided between 1.630 million ETH on the exchange and 176,527 ETH in third-party custody. USDT holdings showed the largest percentage increase, growing by 1.91 billion to reach 8.56 billion USDT, a 28.79% monthly gain. The stablecoin maintains a 102% reserve ratio, with OKX holding 8.76 billion USDT in total wallet assets. Reserve ration analysis across assets OKX maintains different reserve ratios across its supported cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) showing the highest coverage at 113% of user deposits. For major cryptocurrencies, the reserve ratios paint a clear picture of the exchange’s risk management: Bitcoin at 105%, Ethereum at 102%, and Solana at 103%. These ratios mean that for every $100 worth of user deposits, OKX holds between $102 and $113 in actual assets. Among other altcoins, XRP and EOS both maintain 107% reserve ratios, while Dogecoin sits at 101%. This consistency in over-collateralization extends to smaller market cap assets, with most maintaining ratios between 100% and 105%. The exchange keeps lower reserve ratios for stablecoins compared to volatile cryptocurrencies. USDC matches user deposits exactly at 100%, while USDT maintains a slight buffer at 102%. For USDT, the 102% ratio represents over 8.76 billion USDT in wallet assets against 8.56 billion in user deposits. For ETH, it means holding an extra 42,213 ETH beyond user deposits. Custody distribution and security measures OKX divides its assets between direct exchange custody and third-party custody services, with most assets held directly on the exchange. For Bitcoin, 124,699 BTC remain under direct exchange control while 12,312 BTC sit with third-party custodians. The custody pattern varies by asset type. Ethereum shows a larger portion in third-party custody, with 176,527 ETH held externally, representing about 10% of total holdings. USDT follows a similar model, with 321 billion USDT, or roughly 3.7% of holdings, placed in third-party custody. For tokens like APT, BCH, and LINK, OKX keeps nearly all assets under direct exchange control.

Bitcoin fails to restore $98,000 while Ethereum may close the trade below $3,500. Meanwhile, the XRP price continues to trade above $2, displaying magnificent strength that may result in the token manifesting massive moves in the upcoming days in 2025. The current trade setup for XRP suggests the token is poised to mark a double-digit figure in 2025, as the bulls appear to be poised for a 10x rally. The XRP price is displaying very sluggish behaviour at the moment, with the volume depleting and reaching the lowest possible levels. This may suggest a massive drop in the number of buyers, as the progress seems to be very low. However, the token is about to make a historic yearly close above $2 after marking a seven-year high close to $3. Hence, sealing the levels above $2 that it usually fails to achieve after the 2018 & 2021 bull run suggests there is more room for the token to thrive in 2025. The XRP price has been trading decremental since the rejection from the 7-year high close to $3 and seems to have reached the edge of the consolidation.

The recent rise in the trading volume that surpassed $55 billion indicates the bulls are vigilant over the token.

Table of Contents Rollblock poised for groundbreaking gains Solana eyes $300 in January Can Dogecoin actually overtake Solana? Conclusion The recent crypto market correction has shaken things up, but it also sets the stage for a potential explosive rally in the coming months. Crypto bigwigs like Dogecoin and Solana are expected to boom, with some quarters of the market predicting DOGE would overtake SOL soon. However, the project that’s generating significant buzz is Rollblock . While the crypto world debates whether Dogecoin can surpass Solana in market capitalization, Rollblock is quietly laying the groundwork for a festive breakout. You might also like: Shiba Inu, Dogecoin struggle while Rollblock is targeting 10x gains in Q1 2025 Rollblock poised for groundbreaking gains Rollblock is an online crypto casino that is designed to change the GambleFi market. It champions transparency and user empowerment, making it a provably fair gaming platform, which is rare in this space. Then there are the fast withdrawals, bonuses, rakebacks, exquisite games, and other gaming incentives that make it the go-to place for most people. For crypto investors, Rollblock offers staking rewards and a share of the revenue it generates every week. This has been its backbone since its launch, as it not only rewards loyal players but also fosters a strong and vibrant community. At the moment, Rollblock is home to thousands of active players, and tens of thousands of investors have contributed to its roaring presale. Available now for $0.044 per token , it has raised close to $8 million from the public. This crypto is billed to appreciate by 800% before the presale ends, which is why its explosion during this festive period is pretty possible. Solana eyes $300 in January Solana is a high-performance blockchain whose growing ecosystem has it competing with Ethereum. Buoyed by a massive community and positive Solana news, SOL hit an all-time high of $263 recently. However, some of these gains were wiped out in the last market liquidation, sending SOL down to the $200 price level. This drop has reduced the gap between SOL and coins like DOGE, sparking rumors the latter could overtake it. Nevertheless, SOL remains a crypto bigwig and is eyeing a resurgence to $300 in the new year. Can Dogecoin actually overtake Solana? Dogecoin has a bigger fan base than Solana even though it has little to no utility or use case. Its rally in the last month has pushed DOGE’s market cap to around $47 billion, which is quite massive. However, Solana’s market cap is around $90 billion, almost double what the meme coin currently boasts of. It would be quite difficult for Dogecoin to overtake Solana during this festive season. The only way that could happen is if DOGE goes on a ballistic rally while Solana drops drastically. The chances of this happening are rare, but it doesn’t mean that the king of meme coins won’t fetch a decent profit in the coming months. Conclusion Given that Solana news is mostly positive, SOL is less likely to depreciate more than it already has, making it difficult for Dogecoin to overtake it. That is why the savvy investors are going in for Rollblock. Priced at an attractive $0.044, it is set to appreciate stellarly during the festive periods before its presale concludes. When it hits the exchanges, Rollblock may fetch investors major profits in excess of 10,000%. This is due to its capability to disrupt the $500 billion GambleFi market. It’s the reason why everyone is hopping onto the Rollblock presale. For more information, visit the Rollblock presale website and join the online community.

AI surpassed even meme tokens as the most actively appreciating token class. The AI narrative achieved the highest returns of 2024, based on a year-end data collection by CoinGecko. AI-themed tokens achieved average returns of 2,940% for the past 12 months, even surpassing the net achievements of meme tokens. The real AI rally happened from the end of November onward, even though the sector grew by only 77% until the end of Q3. Virtuals Protocol led the AI agent rally The AI narrative started expanding in the last three months of the year, rising mostly due to the influence of AI agent tokens. Previously, the AI narrative included older projects, such as FET and RNDR, which only had minor rallies. The last months of 2024 tapped the growth from both individual AI agents and the emergence of launch platforms. One of the biggest drivers of growth in December turned out to be Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). The token traded at an all-time high of $3.79 , gaining more than 300% in the past weeks. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) kept posting rapid gains in December, reaching a new all-time high at $3.79. | Source: CoinGecko Some of the recently launched AI agent tokens had the characteristics of meme tokens, hence their immediate price appreciation. GOAT and FARTCOIN were in fact launched as memes, while also riding the AI narrative. In just a few days, the AI token collection expanded its total market capitalization from around $8.7B to over $13B , with no signs of stopping. Since most AI agents are relatively new, they lack the influence of meme tokens, which still grew by 2,185% on average. As an adjacent narrative, DePIN tokens rose by 135% in 2024. DePIN was actually the category to take up former AI tokens that also built infrastructure and shared GPU pools. DePIN may benefit from the market for AI agents, which will also need GPU power to produce content. L2 was the only losing narrative The worst performer in 2024 was the L2 narrative, despite the increased usage of actual L2 platforms. Both new launches and the existing tokens in this narrative underperformed. One reason is the legacy of token unlocks, which put downward pressure on the price. The other was an attempt to raise funds for launching new L2s, even when there was no need to create an additional chain. L2 was the only losing narrative in 2024, with an average loss of 20.7%. Another reason for the struggle is the additional scrutiny on the performance of L2s. Once their airdrop mining periods passes, previously busy chains see an immediate outflow of traffic. Even speed and innovation were not enough to convince investors. Previous stars like Scroll were among the biggest losers for the past year. The entire L2 sector ends the year at a total market capitalization of $29B, with most tokens in the red for the past week. Most of the L2 activity in 2024 concentrated on a handful of leading networks, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Taiko, Linea, ZKSync, Starknet, and Blast. All of those chains shift positions depending on the activity of their apps. Arbitrum retains its leading position by attracting liquidity from Ethereum and hosting top DEX apps. Older Web3 narratives underperform Web3 is no longer enjoying the same level of hype, as most of the features work in the background and are integrated into newer tokens. DeFi tokens gained on average 101% in 2024, joined by growth in RWA projects by 820%. Layer 1 chains, led by SUI and Aptos, rallied by 142% in the past year. The weakest gains came from GameFi, which underperformed the market, growing just 15% on average. In the past year, the Web3 gaming and NFT narratives also underperformed, despite the occasional rally for top collections. The only return to NFT happened ahead of the Pudgy Penguins PENGU airdrop. NFT failed to have a year-end rally, despite the Magic Eden (ME) airdrop. The OpenSea platform also faced delays in launching its new version, while attention shifted to the other active narratives.

This represents a 24% increase over the past 90 days and a 52% rise during the last three months of the year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s hash rate also crossed the 800 EH/s threshold this month for the first time, signaling the network’s solid performance. Despite these indicators of a strong network, miners face challenges due to the halved block rewards and increased difficulty, which squeeze their profitability. Temporary Relief But Cost Pressures Mount for Bitcoin Miners CoinShares’ Q3 Bitcoin Mining Report highlights that although these factors have raised mining costs, the recent rise in hashprice has provided temporary relief. However, this boost is not expected to last, and miners will need to adapt to the long-term pressures driven by rising costs and competition for resources. In its latest report, the European asset manager stated that cost-of-production pressures are expected to continue and will be driven by fierce competition for land and power resources. Hyperscalers, which offer more profitable alternatives, are outbidding miners and are ultimately driving up operational costs. Meanwhile, machine prices, closely correlated with Bitcoin’s value, are also set to increase thereby amplifying capital expenditures and depreciation expenses. Miners Explore AI and Clean Energy Solutions As a result, miners are adopting diverse strategies such as HODLing Bitcoin or exploring artificial intelligence (AI) partnerships, which may temporarily slow BTC production but open new revenue streams. CoinShares’s identified firms, like TeraWulf and Cipher, are well-positioned to capitalize on AI opportunities due to their strategic relationships with energy companies and significant investments in clean energy. However, the financial impact of these ventures may take time to materialize, the report stated. On the other hand, debt markets remain liquid and encourage miners to issue new debt even as rising interest expenses and risks of insolvency loom large. Public miners like Argo face heightened risks, particularly if Bitcoin prices dip. This is due to negative shareholder equity and limited fundraising options. Notably, the average cash cost of mining Bitcoin rose to almost $55,950 in Q3, a 13% increase from Q2, with total costs, including non-cash expenses, climbing to roughly $106,000. Companies like TeraWulf have emerged as low-cost leaders, aided by reduced debt expenses, while others, like Riot and Marathon, achieved quarter-over-quarter production growth.

What’s next?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/terra-do-kwon-extradited-to-united-states/,"Do Kwon, the controversial co-founder of Terraform Labs, is officially on U.S. soil. After months of legal battles and international drama, Montenegro handed Kwon over to U.S. authorities on December 31. Known for orchestrating one of the biggest disasters in crypto history, Kwon now faces the fallout from the $40 billion implosion of TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token, Luna. This collapse not only decimated investor funds but also crashed the global crypto market. Montenegro’s Prime Minister, Milojko Spajic, confirmed the extradition in a post on X, calling it a testament to the country’s commitment to international justice. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro last year while trying to board a flight to Dubai with a fake passport. And that was the end of his ludicrous, and frankly quite dramatic, year-long run from authorities. The implosion that rocked crypto Terraform Labs launched TerraUSD as an algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar. Investors flocked to it, pouring billions into the project, lured by Kwon’s confident pitch and the promise of a revolutionary crypto product. But in May 2022, UST lost its peg and Luna lost over 90% of its value in what was one of the largest financial collapses in history. Investors lost $40 billion overnight. Hedge funds collapsed. High-profile firms like Three Arrows Capital and BlockFi filed for bankruptcy. Authorities wasted no time going after Kwon. South Korea issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then, he was on the run. Facing the music Now back in the U.S., Kwon is staring down eight criminal charges, including securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud investors. Prosecutors allege that he knowingly misled investors about TerraUSD’s stability and how Terraform even worked. They accuse him of inflating the system’s value while hiding its vulnerabilities. If convicted, Kwon could spend more than 100 years in prison. His situation isn’t much better in South Korea, where he’s facing a separate legal battle. Authorities there say if they get their hands on him, he would face up to 40 years behind bars for financial crimes related to the TerraUSD meltdown. In April this year, a U.S. court found Terraform Labs and Kwon personally liable for fraud in a civil case brought by the SEC . The court ruled that Terraform’s crypto products were securities and that Kwon’s team misled investors. The company agreed to pay $4.5 billion to settle the case. This included $3.58 billion in disgorgement, $466 million in prejudgment interest, and $420 million in civil penalties. Kwon himself was slapped with a $110 million penalty. His personal fortune was once thought to be hundreds of millions of dollars. However, it has since been drained by lawsuits, fines, and legal fees.

US San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly compared cryptocurrencies to gold in an interview with Yahoo Finance. Stating that cryptocurrencies and gold are not the same, Daly emphasized that cryptocurrencies should not be seen in the same class as gold and should be classified as a separate asset class. Daly added that cryptocurrencies have a multifaceted structure and that a clear definition is needed. “I see cryptocurrencies as a complex thing and the service we need to provide to everyone is to clearly define what they are. Cryptocurrencies can be a medium of exchange. It can be a stock (an asset that retains its value or sometimes loses value.) “That's why I don't think cryptocurrencies are like gold. Sometimes they have properties like gold, but I think they have fundamentally different properties than gold.” Daly noted that he agreed with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s views that cryptocurrencies do not yet have the status of a currency. However, Daly added that for cryptocurrencies to achieve such status, their value must be aligned with economic growth. Daly’s perspective contrasts with that of Powell, who described Bitcoin at the New York Times DealBook conference as a speculative, highly volatile digital asset more akin to gold than the dollar, and noted its limited use as a payment method or stable store of value. *This is not investment advice.

Table of Contents XYZ could be the ultimate meme coin for the rally Ethereum Cardano XRP Dogecoin Conclusion The altcoin market is experiencing a significant surge. Certain coins are outperforming others, capturing attention as their values climb. This upward trend raises the question: which coins could be crucial during this rally? Delving into the current market dynamics, this article highlights the altcoins that might be essential additions for those looking to capitalize on the momentum. You might also like: Don’t miss these winter altcoins: XYZVerse tops the list with promising returns XYZ could be the ultimate meme coin for the rally XYZ is the sports-driven meme coin that’s taking the crypto world by storm. As values climb across the board, XYZ is poised to deliver explosive returns, making it a must-watch for anyone looking to capitalize on the momentum. Blending the excitement of sports betting with the viral power of meme culture, XYZ is at the heart of XYZVerse, an award-winning ecosystem designed for both crypto enthusiasts and sports fans. Think back to Polymarket’s $1 billion trading frenzy during the U.S. elections. Now imagine that energy amplified in the world of meme coins, where millions of sports bettors and crypto degens are gearing up to dive into the action. With a presale strategy projecting a staggering 7,400% growth and major exchange listings on the horizon, XYZ is severely undervalued at its current price. Early investors have a chance to secure life-changing gains before this token claims its spot as the MVP of the altcoin rally. As the market heats up, XYZ is more than just a meme coin; it’s a high-potential contender in the next wave of crypto champions. Ethereum Ethereum is more than just digital money. It’s a platform that changed how we use blockchain technology. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts and decentralized apps. This means people can build applications that run exactly as programmed, without any chance of fraud or third-party interference. In 2022, Ethereum made a big move called the Merge, shifting to a Proof-of-Stake system. This change made transactions faster and more energy-efficient. Soon, Ethereum plans to add sharding, a feature that will make it even quicker and reduce costs. Right now, Ethereum looks promising in the crypto world. While some coins simply serve as digital cash, Ethereum offers a whole ecosystem for new ideas. Its network supports decentralized finance, games, and more. With upgrades on the horizon, Ethereum aims to handle more transactions at lower fees. Compared to other coins, its strong foundation and active development make it stand out. Market trends show a growing interest in platforms that do more than just store value. Ethereum’s commitment to innovation keeps it at the forefront, making it an attractive option in the current market. Cardano Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a blockchain platform that’s flexible, sustainable, and scalable. Designed for smart contracts, it helps developers create decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native coin, ADA, is a rival to Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and even stake ADA on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its eco-friendly approach. Instead of using energy-hungry methods like Bitcoin, it uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. This means it’s much more energy-efficient. But that’s not all. Cardano’s blockchain is split into two layers. One handles transactions, and the other deals with smart contracts. This design boosts its ability to process transactions, potentially up to a million per second. With the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, interacting with smart contracts became more secure and cheaper. This makes Cardano a strong contender in the crypto market. In the current market cycle, where scalability and sustainability are key, ADA looks attractive. Compared to other coins, its technology offers efficiency and room for growth. As the demand for decentralized apps grows, Cardano’s unique features could help it rise to the top. XRP Imagine sending money anywhere in the world in just seconds, with minimal fees and without needing a bank account. That’s the promise of XRP, a digital currency built on the XRP Ledger. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP was designed to be fast, low-cost, and accessible to everyone. With no central authority controlling it, transactions are secure and can’t be reversed, making it a reliable option for global transfers. Ripple, the company supporting XRP, holds a large reserve to ensure stability and growth, aiming to make payments as seamless as sending a text message. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. While Bitcoin transactions can take minutes or even hours, XRP transactions settle in mere seconds. This makes it attractive for people and businesses looking to move money quickly across borders. As the world moves towards digital payments, XRP’s technology positions it well for growth. Although the crypto market is known for volatility, XRP’s focus on real-world utility could make it a promising option in the current cycle, especially as more institutions look for fast and cost-effective payment solutions. Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. It featured a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to other cryptocurrencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There’s no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. People first saw it as a “meme coin,” but in 2021, its value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market value, exceeding $50 billion. Social media buzz and support from Elon Musk helped drive its rise. This shows how strong communities and social media can impact financial markets. Dogecoin’s technology is simple and based on earlier cryptocurrencies. Its abundance means transactions are fast and fees are low. In the current market, some see Dogecoin as an appealing option. Its popularity and strong community support keep it in the spotlight. Compared to other coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin is more accessible. Market trends show continued interest in cryptocurrencies. As more people enter the market, coins like Dogecoin may continue to gain attention. However, its price can be very volatile. It’s important to stay informed and understand the risks before getting involved. Conclusion While ETH, ADA, XRP, and DOGE are strong, XYZVerse is unique, uniting sports fans in a meme coin aiming for significant growth and community-driven success.

On the other hand, Cardano (ADA) continues to show bullish momentum, and targets mention reaching another all-time high. The new contender Yeti Ouro (YETIO), keeps garnering attention with its presale gaining momentum. Investors are seen rushing to presale due to YETIO offering a 25% bonus on all purchases made between December 31 and January 2. Yeti Ouro: The Altcoin Revolutionizing Play-to-Earn Gaming Yeti Ouro is quickly becoming a standout project in the crypto landscape, blending gaming innovation with token utility. Yeti Ouro combines the meme coin craze with serious utility, delivering actual value to holders with a meme coin built on the Ethereum blockchain. Central to this project is its highly-anticipated Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game, Yeti Go. Yeti Go – The P2E Game That Offers Real Rewards Yeti Go is more than just a racing game; it’s an adrenalized PvP where players race against each other, using skills and tactics to outsmart their opponents. Yeti Go is built with Unreal Engine for state-of-the-art graphics and FMOD for extraordinary audio. Here, players are rewarded with YETIO tokens when winning races or other challenges and by staking tokens for in-game advantages. Tokens can also be spent to buy exclusive upgrades, trade collectibles on the marketplace, or enter high-stakes tournaments. Yeti Ouro relies on its community-driven model to build a flourishing environment for gamers and investors. Yeti Ouro’s presale has also about really moved up with big injections going in. A capped total supply of 1 billion YETIO creates scarcity and greater demand as more investors familiarise themselves with YETI’s fundamental proposition. Featured with a large community and continuous development updates, Yeti Ouro has all it takes to be a top competitor in the crypto market. XRP Price Prediction: Legal Troubles Continue To Hurt Price XRP from Ripple is still facing pressure from ongoing legal woes with the SEC. The case addresses one of the core questions of the entire cryptocurrency market: whether XRP is a security. Although all is not lost for XRP price, which has seen recent rebounds and relishes some solace, the case’s outcome is crucial to its future trajectory. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap XRP News: Speculations And Its Impacts On The Market Due To SEC The open-ended legal dispute has made XRP extremely speculative. In any case, XRP has a die-hard community, and the right news in the case could cause triple-figure price moves. Still, the uncertainty is leading many to avoid traditional, high-potential altcoins and keep the focus on Yeti Ouro. This new project has no regulatory baggage and the potential for explosive growth. Cardano Price Prediction: On The Verge Of An All-Time High Even as it was subjected to market neglect, Cardano (ADA) has proven to be one of the most solid blockchains in the crypto realm. As a result of its sustainability and scalability, Cardano adoption rate has increased for dApps & DeFi ecosystems. 1-month ADA price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Cardano News: Bullish Momentum For ADA The strong technical foundation of Cardano attained and recent series of network upgrades have established a ground for potential all-time high. As more projects launch on the Cardano blockchain, demand for ADA is expected to increase, which will drive ADA price higher, analysts say. Yet, ADA provides stability and growth, whereas it finds no competitive edge with the entertainment-driven appeal and practicality that Yeti Ouro can offer through its P2E ecosystem. Conclusion With Ripple facing legal ambiguity and Cardano swelling to new heights, Yeti Ouro offers a convergence of gaming, investment, and digital currency like no other. Offering innovative P2E mechanics, immersive gameplay, and token-based rewards, the Yeti Go game cements Yeti Ouro as a project that both entertains and rewards its community beyond the game itself. From the crypto investors scouting for the next big thing Yeti Ouro is one to watch. To celebrate the New Year, Yeti Ouro is offering investors a 25% bonus on purchases made between December 31 and January 2. This initiative highlights Yeti Ouro’s commitment to welcoming 2025 with exciting opportunities and valuable rewards for its community.

This time, Musk renamed his official profile to “Kekius Maximus” and replaced his avatar with a PEPE frog dressed in antique armor holding a gaming controller. While the eccentric tech magnate has not offered an explanation, the sudden shift has fueled intense speculation. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this development is a relatively unknown memecoin, also called Kekius Maximus (KM). Notably, mere hours before Musk’s rebranding, an anonymous trader made a noteworthy purchase that led to a massive windfall. On-chain analysis firm Lookonchain (@lookonchain) reported via X: “What a lucky trader—or perhaps an insider! 9 hours ago, he spent $4,360 to buy 18.15M KM. Just one hour ago, Elon Musk changed his profile name to Kekius Maximus, sending the price of KM soaring by ~17,000%. The 18.15M KM he bought is now worth $638K!” Related Reading: Top Crypto Assets For Q1 2025: Grayscale Reveals The Best Altcoins Whether the timing was pure coincidence or something more coordinated remains an open question. As of press time, there is no indication that Musk has any direct affiliation with the token. Yet the trader’s sensational profit underscores the often-unpredictable relationship between Musk’s online antics and sudden market movements. As of press time, Kekius Maximus (KM) is trading at $0.03087, representing a staggering 12,533% increase in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization has shot up to $30.87 million, while daily trading volume has surged to approximately $103.51 million. However, contrary to claims from some crypto media outlets, Musk’s name change has no connection to the memecoin itself, and there is no affiliation. Once again, it’s a fortunate surprise for certain crypto traders. Related Reading: Expert Reveals Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 You Need To Know Remarkably, this is not the first time Musk has generated a frenzy with his name or profile changes. In the past, he has adopted monikers like Mr Tweet, Naughty Moniker, and Naughtius Maximus. In April 2023, he famously replaced the Twitter bird logo with the Dogecoin Shiba Inu dog, causing a temporary DOGE price spike. Regarding his latest adoption of the term “Kekius Maximus,” various interpretations abound within online communities. “Kek” traces its origins to World of Warcraft’s auto-translation of “LOL,” evolving into a broader internet meme. “Pepe the Frog” is similarly intertwined with “Kek,” having been adopted by assorted online subcultures over the years. The notion of “Kekistan”—a fictional internet “nation” that plays on cultural satire as a satirical response to identity politics, while the flag of Kekistan mimics a German war flag. Recently, Musk has made significant waves in German politics by expressing support for the Alternative for Germany (AFD). The mainstream media and other political parties have strongly criticized Musk’s actions, while he himself has reaffirmed his stance by agreeing to an interview with AFD leader Alice Weidel. However, whether there’s a broader context to these actions remains purely speculative.

As always, these tokens have captured the attention of investors worldwide, especially with notable developments like BTFD Coin’s (BTFD) presale, raising over $4.6 million in its first month. This momentum has got everyone talking about meme coins’ potential for wild success. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin, though. It’s shaping up to revolutionise the market with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a killer referral programme, and serious staking rewards. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join this week, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. But don’t stop there. Sudeng (HIPPO) and AI Companions (AIC) also make waves in the meme coin community. While BTFD Coin might dominate headlines, these other tokens offer unique value propositions that could make them solid investments. This article will dive into each coin’s features, presale successes, and predictions for the future. So buckle up and keep reading to get the full scoop on the best new meme coins to join this week. Meme coins have had a bit of a roller-coaster ride over the years. From the wild success of Dogecoin (DOGE) to the rapid rise of newer tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), these coins have become an unstoppable force in the crypto world. Investors love riding a meme coin wave to massive returns, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down. With BTFD Coin, Sudeng (HIPPO), and AI Companions (AIC), we’re seeing three promising tokens that take the meme coin game to new heights. Let’s explore these coins and why they might just be the best new meme coins to join this week. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The New King of Meme Coins BTFD Coin has been a hot topic in the crypto world, especially with its presale surging past $4.6 million in just the first month. The presale is a massive success , with over 60 billion coins sold to more than 7,000 holders. It’s clear that investors are ready to dive in, and for good reason. BTFD Coin’s presale started at a low price of $0.000004 per coin but has steadily climbed to $0.00142 per coin in Stage 13. This rise in value shows the immense demand for the coin, and experts are predicting even bigger gains as the presale progresses. The secret to BTFD Coin’s success lies in its unique features. This coin isn’t just about memes; it’s about building a strong community, rewarding holders, and offering exciting incentives. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral programme, and staking rewards, BTFD Coin is taking meme coins to the next level. It’s not just a fun investment – it’s a real opportunity for those who believe in the potential of meme coins to make a difference in the broader crypto ecosystem. If you invest $8,000 in BTFD Coin at the Stage 13 price of $0.000142 per coin and use the BIG50 code for a 50% bonus, you will receive 84,507,042 coins. When the coin price rises to $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would be worth $50,704.23, yielding a profit of $42,704.23. This highlights the substantial potential of leveraging the BIG50 bonus for significant gains. So if you’re wondering what the best new meme coins to join this week are, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. The presale is still ongoing, and the price continues to rise with each stage. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to get in early before BTFD Coin hits the big time. Sudeng (HIPPO): The Meme Coin with Serious Potential Now, let’s talk about Sudeng (HIPPO). This meme coin has a lot to offer. Sudeng (HIPPO) is capitalising on the trend of meme coins while offering something unique: a strong community-driven approach. Like BTFD Coin, Sudeng (HIPPO) is focusing on creating a space where investors feel like they’re part of something bigger. The team behind Sudeng has made it clear that their mission is to create a coin that rewards loyal holders and fosters an active, engaged community. One thing that sets Sudeng apart is its innovative staking model. Investors can stake their HIPPO tokens and earn rewards through more HIPPO tokens. This mechanism helps build long-term value and benefits holders from the coin’s growth. Sudeng’s dedication to transparency and regular updates keeps its community informed and excited about what’s coming next. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join this week, HIPPO could be the underdog that surprises everyone. It’s still early days for Sudeng, but with its strong community focus and staking rewards, it could soon be in the same league as some of the bigger meme coins on the market. AI Companions (AIC): The Future of Meme Coins AI Companions (AIC) is another exciting entry into the meme coin space. What makes AIC stand out is its integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the meme coin world. While many meme coins focus solely on the community aspect, AIC takes it a step further by offering AI-driven features that make the token more than just a joke. AIC is designed to be a utility token with a meme coin twist, making it appealing to investors and tech enthusiasts. The team behind AIC is developing AI-based tools and services that will benefit token holders.

Analysts closely monitor its performance, particularly with the Williams Alligator Indicator providing critical insights into the asset’s potential trajectory. The cryptocurrency surpassed the $2 mark earlier this month, a pivotal threshold for market sentiment. Despite retracing from a high near $3, the asset remains of interest due to its potential for sustained bullish momentum. Examining XRP’s Market Structure Analyst Egrag has drawn attention to the Williams Alligator Indicator, which uses three moving averages—Jaw, Teeth, and Lips—to assess market trends. According to Egrag, XRP’s current alignment of these moving averages supports a bullish outlook, provided the asset holds above the $2 equilibrium zone. #XRP – Williams Alligator Indicator : Analyzing the Williams Alligator: By Checking the angles of increase for the Williams Alligator (Jaw, Teeth, Lips) market momentum looks #Bullish . Check the parameters in the below chart If the three moving averages cross above… pic.twitter.com/02iWEgj0Eq — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 29, 2024 Egrag’s analysis highlights two critical “Break of Structure” (BOS) moments in XRP’s price history. The first occurred in early 2018 when XRP achieved its all-time high. The second attempt, in 2021, failed to break the previous record. Currently, a new BOS is emerging, with XRP maintaining its position above $2, signaling a potential continuation of the uptrend. Historical comparisons are particularly notable. The last time the Williams Alligator Indicator showed a similar alignment, was in late 2017 , XRP surged to an all-time high of over $3.80 by January 2018. However, Egrag emphasized the importance of forthcoming monthly candles. “The opening and closing of the subsequent candle will help solidify XRP’s trajectory,” he explained, noting that two-candle formations often provide stronger trading signals. He added that the current monthly candle appears bearish, underscoring the need for caution. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Significance of the $2 Support Level A key takeaway from Egrag’s analysis is the importance of the $2 support level . As long as XRP remains above this threshold, bullish sentiment is expected to persist. Both psychological and technical factors reinforce this level as a crucial marker for traders. Despite some challenges, XRP has repeatedly demonstrated resilience. Earlier this month, it briefly dipped below $2 twice, only to rebound strongly each time. These rebounds suggest buyers continue to defend this level, even as broader market conditions remain volatile. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.06, down 2.80% over the past 24 hours. While consecutive daily declines have raised concerns, the asset has thus far avoided significant breaches of the $2 support. With historical patterns providing context and current indicators suggesting optimism, XRP’s ability to maintain $2 as a strong support level will be a defining factor for its short-term prospects.

PEPE has achieved significant milestones and is now trading at $0.00002079, having surged 18% in the past 24 hours. The market cap has surged to $8.7b, and the 24-hour trading volume is $3.8b.

However, many analysts are eyeing FXGuys ($FXG) as they predict that the token’s value will keep rising after its upcoming launch. With a Trade2 Earn program available on FX Guys, traders get tokens in reward every time they trade. This allows everyone a fair chance to increase their holdings without involving difficult processes. Additionally, FXGuys helps traders acquire significant trading funds via a Trader Funding Program. But will $FXG’s predicted gains put it ahead of BNB and HBAR? Stay tuned to know! >>JOIN FXGUYS HERE BNB Price Drops After Hitting New All-Time High BNB reached a new ATH of $794 on December 4, 2024. The token’s consistent ascent in 2024 reflects the increasing demand for BNB. Many people who hunt the top altcoins to buy find its performance appealing. One of the main factors of the recent BNB price surge was increased crypto trading volume. The price maintained an uptrend as more individuals utilized Binance’s offerings. However, since reaching its new ATH, BNB’s price has since dropped to $705. Although some analysts believe that BNB’s price might skyrocket to $900 in a few weeks, others are dubious about investing in BNB because of possible sell-offs from profit-taking investors. They believe this could drive BNB’s price below $650. Analysts Foresee Hedera’s Uptrend Ending Soon Hedera’s HBAR is currently trading at $0.31, up by 6.4% in the past seven days. On December 7, 2024, Hedera’s price rose to its three-year high of $0.37. Hedera’s commitment to technical innovation is one of the biggest drivers of HBAR’s growth. The network’s recent upgrade also has the potential to make Hedera a go-to platform for enterprises and developers looking for a fast, efficient blockchain. Despite these developments, many analysts believe that Hedera’s uptrend is about to slow down. As a result, these investors are moving from HBAR to FXGuys due to the huge profits and massive growth potential of $FXG.

Table of Contents Ethereum gears for Pectra upgrade in 2025 Institutional investors accumulate Ether during dips US based Spot Ethereum ETFs could pass on staking yield Higher adoption among institutions, outside of token utility Technical analysis and targets Ethereum gears for Pectra upgrade in 2025 Ethereum could see a boost in scalability, security, and user experience with the upcoming Pectra upgrade, expected to go live in 2025. The upgrade will introduce enhancements in account abstraction, validator operations, and network performance. The goal is to improve both the user and developer experience on Ethereum and make future scalability upgrades easier to implement. Validator stake limits, staking withdrawals, and streamlined smart contract development could improve Ethereum’s network security and efficiency. This could have a domino effect on Layer 2 chains that rely on Ethereum for their security infrastructure. Pectra will be the third most significant upgrade in the Ethereum ecosystem after the Merge, and its successful execution could act as a catalyst for Ether’s recovery in 2025. Ethereum analyst Anthony Sassano estimates that the Pectra upgrade will go live next March or April. Notably, Unichain, an Ethereum-based protocol, set to launch its mainnet in early 2025, aims to use blobs, and Pectra’s improvements could help Ethereum meet Unichain’s scalability requirements. We're getting a blob increase to 6/9 from 3/6 with Pectra in March/April (my estimate). Unichain is slated to launch their mainnet in early 2025 and they'll be using blobs. The demand for blobs is up only and Ethereum will scale to meet this demand! — sassal.eth/acc 🦇🔊 (@sassal0x) December 31, 2024 Institutional investors accumulate Ether during dips On-chain data intelligence platform Santiment shows a consistent increase in two key metrics: supply held by top non-exchange wallet addresses and the token’s top addresses as a percentage of total supply. An increase in these metrics during November and December indicates that large wallet investors are accumulating Ether. Ethereum supply held by top non-exchange addresses and supply held by top addresses | Source: Santiment Data from Lookonchain shows entities like World Liberty Financial, backed by Donald Trump, have bought Ether tokens during the dips in ETH price. As the supply of Ether held by large entities outside exchange platforms increases, it signals whale accumulation, a typically bullish indicator for ETH.

The regulator has pushed back on all ETF proposals including staking, unlike those in Switzerland and Canada. Pro-crypto regulations under President-elect Donald Trump could pave the way for investors to increase returns through ETH staking rewards. ETF issuers could benefit from staking rewards via an increased NAV, reduced management fees, and dividends. A report by Bernstein Research suggests that under a crypto-friendly Trump administration, the SEC is likely to approve staking yield for Ethereum ETFs. Bernstein Research comments on Ethereum ETF | Source: Bernsteinresearch Higher adoption among institutions, outside of token utility Dario Lo Buglio, CTO at Brickken, told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “There is one thing people should remember about Ethereum, it not only has financial use cases like Bitcoin, it has smart contracts. It can be used for programming applications and there must be a balance between Ethereum value and its utility as a form of payment and decentralized applications. I wouldn’t say there is a lag in price. What I think there is a lag in, is active development. And it is because it is the largest decentralized blockchain so it takes time to make changes, unlike Solana and other protocols that can be upgraded with no hassles.” Lo Buglio remains optimistic about Ethereum’s adoption among institutions for its smart contract functionality and underlying technology.

Matrixport: Ethereum Faces Uphill Battle for Price Growth Amid Low Ecosystem Activity and Strong Competition This, coupled with persistently low trading volumes, presents significant challenges for Ethereum (ETH) to achieve significant price appreciation in 2025. The decline in Ethereum’s gas fees, a metric typically associated with on-chain activity, highlights the decrease in network usage. Matrixport noted that the sluggish ecosystem activity reflects a slowdown in user engagement and raises concerns about Ethereum’s ability to maintain its dominance in the blockchain sector. Matrixport also noted the increasing competition Ethereum faces from alternative blockchain platforms like Solana and Sui. These emerging protocols are gaining traction and successfully attracting a wider user base through 2024 by offering faster and more cost-effective solutions. “The outperformance of Solana and Sui tokens compared to Ethereum throughout the year underscores the changing market dynamics,” Matrixport said. Without major catalysts or major upgrades, Ethereum is expected to remain under pressure in the coming year. Matrixport warned that rival projects will continue to expand their market share, further challenging Ethereum’s dominance. However, analysts believe that Ethereum’s robust developer ecosystem and established position could play a critical role in its long-term recovery if the platform effectively addresses its scalability and user engagement issues. *This is not investment advice.

However, Pepe ($PEPE) looks to be staging a breakout, while Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Bonk ($BONK) bulls are attempting to turn their fortunes around. $PEPE breaks out of channel Source: TradingView $PEPE is breaking out of the descending channel once more. However, it still remains to be seen if this breakout will be successful, or whether yet another fake-out could dash the hopes of the bulls. The price is at resistance now, and therefore a big effort is required in order to break past this and settle above. It should also be noted that a potential bearish head and shoulders pattern could be waiting to ambush the bulls if the price does go higher. Bullish targets are $0.000023 at the 0.618 Fibonacci, and $0.000025 at the 0.786 Fibonacci. The all-time high at $0.000028 will also need to be surpassed if $PEPE is to continue its bull market trend. $DOGE finding support Source: TradingView The $DOGE price looks as though it is trying to now consolidate above $0.31 and also break through the first of the Fibonacci levels at 0.236. Should the support hold, there is a good chance that $DOGE bulls, ably assisted by the ongoing rumours that $DOGE could one day be used by Elon Musk as some kind of payment system, can send the price higher. Fibonacci targets are on the chart above. $DOGE will need to surpass all of these, plus make a local high above $0.48 in order to continue its own bull trend. $BONK breakout imminent Source: TradingView Bonk ($BONK) suffered a 60% reversal from its all-time high which it made on 20 November. However, the $BONK bulls are busy trying to reverse this trend. A local bottom looks to have been made, and it now remains for the bulls to push the price through the descending trendline. The Fibonacci levels on the chart above provide the potential price targets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This prolonged downtrend has left investors and traders questioning whether the popular meme coin can recover or if further losses are on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Top analyst Ali Martinez has shed light on Shiba Inu’s current price structure, sharing a detailed technical analysis that pinpoints the asset’s most significant support zone between $0.0000215 and $0.0000193. According to Martinez, this range represents a crucial battleground for SHIB. Holding above this support could pave the way for a substantial rally, reigniting optimism among holders and signaling a potential reversal in sentiment. However, a failure to defend this critical zone may trigger deeper corrections, extending the bearish momentum that has gripped the market. For now, all eyes are on Shiba Inu as it tests these pivotal levels. Whether the token can stabilize and recover or succumb to further downside pressure will likely depend on broader market dynamics and the ability of SHIB’s community and whales to support its price. Shiba Inu Holding Key Demand Shiba Inu remains a focal point for meme coin enthusiasts, capturing attention for its resilience and potential to deliver gains. Following a clean breakout post-election, the token has seen renewed interest from retail investors eager to identify an opportune entry point. The allure of meme coins, combined with Shiba Inu’s history of explosive rallies, continues to make it a speculative favorite among traders. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted Shiba Inu’s critical support zone between $0.0000215 and $0.0000193. Martinez’s technical analysis indicates that holding above this range is vital for the token’s price trajectory. If SHIB maintains these levels, it could spark a wave of buying pressure as investors flock to capitalize on its perceived upside potential. A stabilization within this zone might act as a launchpad for future price surges, reigniting excitement across its loyal community. Related Reading: Cardano Holds Crucial Support At $0.77 – Massive Rally Ahead? However, the risks are equally evident. Shiba Inu’s momentum may wane as interest shifts toward emerging meme coins that promise quick gains or novel narratives. Competing for attention in the crowded meme coin market is a constant challenge. To stay relevant, Shiba Inu must leverage its strong community support and strategic developments. Technical Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00002117, showing resilience by holding the 200-day EMA at $0.00002059 as a key support level. This development is significant, as the 200-day EMA is widely regarded as a long-term strength indicator in technical analysis. Maintaining support above this mark signals that SHIB may be gearing up for a potential price surge. Fostering optimism among traders and investors. The 200-day EMA often acts as a critical dividing line between bullish and bearish trends. For SHIB, defending this level not only reinforces market confidence but also sets the stage for buyers to regain momentum. A sustained hold above the EMA could catalyze a broader rally. Potentially pushing SHIB toward higher resistance levels and reviving its appeal among meme coin enthusiasts.

VCs are focusing on DeFi, stablecoins, and proven markets for 2025 growth. Caution remains, with VCs prioritizing regulatory clarity and real-world applications. As the crypto market enters 2025, venture capital (VC) firms are gearing up to invest in blockchain and DeFi. Despite a strong recovery in 2024, crypto VC funding remains below its peak. However, according to The Block , VCs are optimistic about growth in the coming year. They cite shifting regulations, increasing institutional investments, and continued technological advancements as key drivers. 2024 Funding Overview and 2025 Outlook In 2024, crypto venture investments rose by 28% to $13.7 billion. While this shows growth from 2023, it’s still lower than the levels seen in 2021-2022. Analysts predict continued growth in crypto funding by 2025. They point to factors like evolving U.S. regulations, rising institutional engagement, and the potential for increased token values. However, Rob Hadick of Dragonfly cautions that the sector is unlikely to see the funding amounts of 2021-2022 again soon.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X that the non-fungible token (NFT) sector may flourish due to fiat currency debasement and the growing popularity of digital assets among younger generations. “My highest conviction ‘set it and forget it’ investment for the next 10 years is crypto art. For me, it’s the most compelling, enjoyable and interesting area in all crypto. Massive crypto wealth creation, along with monetary debasement, will drive incredible demand for scarce desirable assets (digital real estate or, well, digital art). Younger generations are more attracted to digital assets than most physical assets. If, as [MicroStrategy founder Michael] Saylor says, BTC is Manhattan real estate, then the best crypto art, or NFTs, are the scarcest, most desirable block space of all.” He also says that NFTs are a more cost-effective and efficient way to possess assets than physical things. “Also as people go up the crypto wealth-curve, you soon realize that physical property is expensive to hold as an investment and is better as a lifestyle asset. Art fills that gap and crypto art is ultra-cheap to custody for extended periods. Like property, it can be used as collateral too, if you so desire it.” According to Pal, NFTs are already being used more as long-term investments. “The days of flipping art NFTs are largely over. The game now is to buy and hold the best artists (new or older) and demand will only grow over time while supply gets taken off the market for decades. There is realistically very little supply of established art currently and it will keep shrinking.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With the new year kicking off and the Terra Luna Classic burn rate continuing, will the LUNC token soar? LUNC Price Falls As Burn Rate Rises Terra Luna Classic price has retreated even as data points to an accelerating pace of burn rate . According to LUNCMetrics , the network burned 48.7 million tokens on Monday this week. Most of these burns, or about 44.5 million, were on-chain burns, while the rest were daily wallet burns. The burn rate has been on an a gradual increase as the network incinerated 29.7 million tokens a day earlier and 17 million on Saturday. Terra Luna Classic has cumulatively burned over 286.9 million tokens in the last seven days. These burns have brought cumulative burns since inception in May 13 2022. The burning trajectory will likely continue to accelerate in 2025. Burning or incinerating is a popular process in the crypto industry. In this process, tokens are moved to an inaccessible address, boosting their price by reducing the number in circulation. LUNC price has also pulled back even as its ecosystem grows. For example, Air For LUNC, a top play-to-earn game in the network was recently named one of best blockchain action game of the year. AIR LUNC Image Terra Luna Classic Analysis The LUNC price rose and peaked at $0.0001791 as Bitcoin and most other altcoins rallied. However, it then lost momentum and dropped 40% to its current $0.0001080. The token also moved below the important support level at $0.0001311, its highest swing on May 30th. On the positive side, the coin formed a hammer pattern on December 20, a popular reversal sign. This pattern consists of a long lower shadow and a body. Another positive is that it has remained above the 200-day moving average and above the ascending trendline connecting the lowest levels since August. LUNC Price Chart LUNC Coin Price Targets Therefore, with the LUNC price remaining above these support levels, and with the burn rate continuing, it is likely to rebound. If this happens, the first target to watch will be the support at $0.0001311, up by 21% above the current level. That will be followed by a move to the December high of $0.000179. The alternative scenario is where the Terra Luna Classic price loses the psychological support at $0.00010. This level, which coincides with the ascending trendline, will point to more downside, potentially to $0.000079, its lowest swing on November 3.

This CoinGape article complies a list of industry experts’ 2025 ETH price predictions & targets. Let’s also explore what Elliot Wave analysis forecasts for January 2025. *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 27 minutes ago. Experts Predict Ethereum Price Outlook For 2025 Venture Capitalist, Tim Draper predicts Ethereum could hit $10,000 by the end of 2025. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee echoed Draper’s outlook with an ETH price target of $8,000 to $10,000 in 2025. Lee adds, “improving fundamentals, increasing institutional interest, and growing demand for DeFi services all point to a strong year ahead for Ethereum.” Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick noted, “Our forecast suggests Ethereum could reach $12,000 by the end of 2025. We’re seeing significant growth in Ethereum’s ecosystem, and the network’s scalability improvements will only add to its appeal.” Based on the above Ethereum price predictions , the outlook for ETH looks massively bullish, with a consensus of five digits per ETH. “Ethereum will moon in 2025,” said Crypto Kaleo, a popular crypto influencer. ETH Technical Analysis & What to Expect in January 2025 From an Elliot Wave analysis standpoint, XForceGlobal adds that Ethereum is in a “bullish consolidation.” The analyst further adds that ETH is undergoing a small pullback and is unlikely to trigger a large correction. The expert anticipates either a triangle variation or a nested 1-2 wave, both of which are bullish from an Elliot Wave perspective. Based on this approach, once the pullback ends, it should trigger a massive run up to roughly $7,000, a new ATH. But the experts ultimate target for Ethereum price is roughly $12,000, which is in line with the industry experts like Tom Lee & Tim Draper’s five-digit prediction. ETH/USD 1-day chart Ethereum Price Targets For 2025 Here’s CoinGape’s compilation of top experts’ Ethereum price predictions for 2025. Tim Draper’s price prediction for 2025: $10,000. Tom Lee’s ETH price forecast for 2025: $8,000 to $10,000. Geoff Kendrick’s price target 2025: $12,000. David Grider’s ETH price prediction 2025: $7,000 to $10,000. Mark Palmer’s Ethereum price forecast 2025: $6,000 to $8,000. Adam Cochran’s ETH price target 2025: $8,000 to $12,000. Ryan Selkis’ Ethereum price prediction 2025: $5,000 to $7,000. CryptoKaleo’s Ether price forecast 2025: $15,000. TheCryptoOracle’s target for 2025: $12,500. CryptoMaji’s prediction for 2025: $10,500. As we enter 2025, the Ethereum price predictions from top industry experts paint a bullish picture. With targets ranging from $5,000 to $15,000, the consensus is clear: Ethereum is poised for significant growth in the coming year. The average target for all these predictions hovers around $10,909.

The latest development is part of its ongoing strategy to diversify its portfolio, with the announcement made in May 2023 as part of the firm’s bid to create additional revenue streams. Following the declaration, the stablecoin operator committed to regularly allocating up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward purchasing the flagship cryptocurrency. Beyond the buys, Tether has been diversifying its investments into emerging sectors such as AI, Bitcoin mining, and decentralized communications. CEO Ardoino Addresses FUD However, the latest purchase comes as Tether faces increasing concerns surrounding the legal status of USDT in Europe. The implementation of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation on December 30, 2024, has raised uncertainty about the asset’s future on European exchanges. MiCA, which aims to standardize and regulate cryptocurrency operations across the European Union, has caused fears that USDT may be delisted from exchanges within the bloc due to Tether’s reported failure to meet compliance requirements. Meanwhile, the uncertainty surrounding the potential delisting under the framework has led to a notable drop in the stablecoin’s market cap. CoinGecko data shows that USDT’s overall value in the market fell from $140 billion over the past week to approximately $137 billion. The over $3 billion decline marks the largest drop in a year of continuous growth for the cryptocurrency. In response to these concerns, CEO Paolo Ardoino addressed the growing FUD in an X post , reassuring the crypto community and urging them not to be swayed by misleading information. The statement was made after lawyer Jonathan Galea published a thread on the same social media platform discussing the potential legal implications of the incoming rules for stablecoins. Ardoino emphasized that “USDT is safe,” dismissing concerns about it as baseless and attributing them to competitors attempting to exploit the situation.

Daily trading volume in the cryptocurrency market is approximately $177.54 billion at the time of writing, showing moderate activity across exchanges. Among the top cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $93,931.42, marking a 0.6% daily increase and a marginal 0.1% rise over the past week. Ethereum (ETH) is priced at $3,385.68, reflecting a slight 0.4% daily decline. Other major assets like XRP (XRP) are trading at $2.07, showing a 0.8% gain in the last 24 hours but a 6.8% decline over the week. Solana (SOL) is up 1.1% daily, priced at $193.73, while Binance Coin (BNB) saw a 1.2% daily increase, now trading at $703.95.

In the trending and top-gaining tokens, Kekius Maximus surged by an impressive 875.1%, while Saros and LIMITUS saw gains of 70.1% and 59.7%, respectively. AI Agents: The Next Evolution in Industry In crypto news today, the rise of AI agents is drawing comparisons to the advent of corporations in the 19th century, as they increasingly demonstrate their ability to operate autonomously in industries, including crypto. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted this parallel, suggesting AI agents might follow a similar trajectory to corporations, which were once feared but have become integral to modern life. “The more I think it perfectly parallels to the 19th century advent of the corporation: able to enter contracts itself, hire humans, own things, and outlive people,” Horsley wrote. “Corporations were feared, and now number in the millions. We all work for them and they produce everything we use and consume.” I think will be faster, and more extra-legal — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) December 31, 2024 AI agents, capable of entering contracts, building Web3 applications, and interacting with humans, are rapidly gaining traction. Crypto trader Alex Becker predicts 2025 will see a surge in “AI agent fever” across industries, as these technologies reshape the landscape. 2025 is going to be the year of AI agent/AI fever in all industries. Bitcoin/ETH is going to charge leading to ABSURD overvaluations in AI crypto. I can't understate this. Pack the fucking bags. — Alex Becker (@ZssBecker) December 30, 2024 Franklin Templeton Predicts Global Bitcoin Reserve Adoption in 2025 Franklin Templeton, a leading spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, anticipates that more nations will adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve in 2025. In its digital assets outlook published on December 30, the company highlighted its expectation that Bitcoin will strengthen its role as a global digital store of value, driven by increased institutional and sovereign adoption. Bitcoin will solidify its position as a global financial asset acting as a digital store of value, accelerated by sovereign and institutional adoption. We expect to see strategic BTC reserves added by several nations — Franklin Templeton Digital Assets (@FTDA_US) December 30, 2024 The report also predicts a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market, moving from speculative trading to utility-driven use cases in 2025. Franklin Templeton emphasized that the foundational technologies underpinning crypto, such as blockchain, will become critical components of global financial systems. Binance Labs to Rebrand in 2025 with CZ Leading In other crypto news today, Binance Labs, the venture capital arm spun off from cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has announced plans to rebrand in 2025. The rebranding aligns with its vision of operating as an independent entity, distancing itself from Binance following regulatory scrutiny. At Binance Labs (soon to be rebranded), we’re laser-focused on fundamentals, aiming for long-term impact. Going into 2025 and beyond, we’ll continue to provide evergreen support to founders who share our vision of building for the long term.

38349923,https://finbold.com/?p=224659,1735660084,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,AI predicts Hedera price for 2025,https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-hedera-price-for-2025/,"In early Q2 2024, Hedera ( HBAR ) saw prices shoot up from $0.08853 to $0.15649 on account of positive developments surrounding the token’s role in real-world tokenization (RWA). BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) announced in late April that it had tokenized one of its U.S. Treasury money market funds on Hedera’s network. This 76.76% surge didn’t last — by the end of April, the price of HBAR had receded to $0.009358. After that, it entered an extended downtrend, which lasted until early November, when the wider cryptocurrency market entered a bull run. Since then, the price of Hedera has risen to $0.27880 — year-to-date (YTD) returns stand at 226.62%, although the digital asset is still trading some 24.52% lower compared to its yearly high of $0.36939 HBAR price YTD chart. Source: Finbold At present, Hedera is the 17th largest cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of roughly $10.71 billion. It’s a promising, affordable token — so Finbold has decided to consult one of the most advanced publicly available AI models to determine what Hedera’s price will be in 2025. AI highlights bullish and bearish factors affecting HBAR For additional context, OpenAI ’s ChatGPT-4o model was first asked to provide a list of the most relevant factors, both bullish and bearish, at play with HBAR. It outlined four factors on either side. Hedera’s numerous partnerships with leading corporations were singled out as a strong bullish signal, suggesting that it has already become a preferred blockchain solution for businesses on account of its enterprise-grade governance model. The AI model also singled out Hedera’s high transaction speeds of up to 10,000 TPS, which require minimal energy consumption as a potent draw for new clients. Lastly, ChatGPT cited an ever-increasing list of use cases spanning everything from supply chain management to telecommunications and finance — a fact that provides Hedera with a rather large total addressable market (TAM). Bullish factors affecting Hedera. Source: OpenAI On the bearish side of the aisle, the first factor that was listed was the intense competition present, stemming from robust Layer-1 alternatives such as Solana ( SOL ) and Avalanche (AVAX). After that, the AI noted that overreliance on enterprise growth and shifting macroeconomic factors could also serve to curtail future growth. Finally, OpenAI’s flagship model pointed out that, as effective as Hedera’s governance model has been in terms of compliance, perceived centralization could serve to deter retail and decentralization-focused developers. Bearish factors affecting Hedera. Source: OpenAI AI sets Hedera price forecast for 2025 Once all was said and done, ChatGPT-4o set three price targets — reflecting a bullish, bearish, and mixed scenario in 2025. If the positive catalysts prove to be dominant, the AI model sees a range of $0.50 to $0.75 as a reasonable price target for 2025. In contrast, if the digital asset sees adoption slow down and unfavorable macroeconomic trends take hold, OpenAI’s model expects to see the price of HBAR drop to between $0.20 and $0.15. ChatGPT’s price targets for HBAR in 2025.

Notably, an analysis by Dark Defender on December 31 highlights that XRP is trading within a descending triangle pattern on the daily time frame, a technical setup often associated with significant breakouts. Key support and resistance levels for XRP The analysis highlights $1.95 as a critical support level within the descending triangle pattern, which has provided a solid foundation for XRP amidst recent market volatility. Dark Defender suggests that as long as this level holds, XRP is well-positioned for an upside breakout. If the breakout materializes, immediate resistance levels are anticipated at $2.22, $2.72, and $2.90, with a long-term projection extending to $5.85. XRP price analysis. Source: DarkDefender/X Furthermore, a “throwback” scenario could also occur, where the price briefly retests the breakout level before surging higher. This retest would serve as additional confirmation for traders seeking to enter long positions, reinforcing the bullish outlook. However, failure to sustain the $1.95 support could significantly alter the current narrative. In such a scenario, XRP might revisit lower support levels at $1.88 or even $1.63, potentially invalidating the bullish projection. This would likely shift market sentiment to bearish , delaying any recovery attempts and adding pressure to the broader outlook. Regulatory and market forces in play Beyond technical analysis, key regulatory and market developments are shaping XRP’s outlook. Former President Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, as the incoming SEC Chair is widely viewed as a positive catalyst. This move is anticipated to resolve the legal uncertainties surrounding Ripple Labs, potentially marking the end of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, which has persisted since 2020. Adding to the optimism is the timing of the SEC’s appeal, scheduled for January 15, 2025, just days before Trump’s inauguration. Market participants are increasingly hopeful that a resolution could pave the way for a more favorable regulatory environment for Ripple, including the potential approval of a spot ETF for XRP in 2025. Such a development would serve as a significant catalyst for XRP’s long-term growth However, despite this optimistic outlook, XRP faces immediate headwinds. The token is at risk of slipping below the $2 psychological barrier , primarily due to increased selling pressure and broader market dynamics. Ripple Labs’ escrow system, which releases 1 billion XRP tokens into circulation on the first day of each month, is expected to further contribute to this pressure by increasing the token supply. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.12, reflecting a 27% drop from its December 2 high of $2.71. XRP one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite this setback, the token has delivered an impressive year-to-date (YTD) gain of 258%. Adding to the optimism, XRP has risen 5.8% on the daily chart, hinting at a potential recovery amid ongoing market volatility. While regulatory developments bring optimism, the token’s near-term trajectory remains uncertain, with key market dynamics and supply-side factors adding complexity to XRP’s outlook.

Lightchain AI draws major investor attention as it combines AI and blockchain technology, positioning itself as a strong competitor to Solana and Ripple. Table of Contents Why investors are backing Lightchain AI How Lightchain AI could outpace Solana and Ripple Road to 2025 Lightchain AI’s vision The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as big investors flock to secure their stakes in Lightchain AI, an emerging altcoin poised to disrupt the blockchain space.

With its approach to merging artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, this viral altcoin is set to redefine industry standards and deliver exponential growth in 2025. Why investors are backing Lightchain AI Lightchain AI has quickly become a favorite among large-scale investors due to its vision and strong execution strategy. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that focus solely on scalability or transaction speed, Lightchain AI introduces a comprehensive framework that integrates blockchain with AI-powered applications. This unique approach unlocks new use cases, particularly in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, where secure and efficient systems are critical. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its early-stage accessibility and growth potential. During its presale, priced at just $0.0045, the project has already raised over $7 million, signaling strong investor confidence. With plans to expand its ecosystem through targeted collaborations and partnerships , Lightchain AI offers a compelling narrative for long-term value creation. Investors recognize that getting in early could yield substantial returns as the platform matures and gains adoption. How Lightchain AI could outpace Solana and Ripple While Solana and Ripple are strong in their roles as top coins, Lightchain AI’s aim on new ideas and change gives it a lead in getting into fresh market areas. Solana is famous for its fast deals and small costs where Ripple does great in global money transfers. But, Lightchain AI can mix AI traits into blockchain systems which gives a wider choice of uses that not Solana or Ripple now covers. For example, Lightchain AI is made to deal with tricky computing jobs, making it great for fields needing smart AI work. Its planned tie-in with business systems makes sure smooth use in both common and spread-out markets. This flexibility puts Lightchain AI as a platform͏ that can go beyond Solana and Ripple for market importance and growth chance. Road to 2025 Lightchain AI’s vision Lightchain AI is set to transform the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence by 2025, driven by a well-defined roadmap. The process began with prototype development in November 2024, introducing the groundbreaking Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), along with a developer portal to engage early adopters. By January 2025, the testnet will go live, allowing real-world testing of token staking and AI workloads while enabling community validation. The March 2025 mainnet launch will deploy PoI and AIVM at scale, fostering decentralization through diverse validator participation. Ecosystem expansion follows in May, with grants, incentives, and cross-chain integrations to attract developers and businesses.

With over 300 chains listed , the ecosystem should be able to cater to the needs of all types of users sustainably. However, in this sprawling landscape, a majority of activity and liquidity is locked within multiple Ethereum Layer 2’s . In its current state, Ethereum is reminiscent of early 1500s Europe, which experienced breakthroughs like the printing press and advanced shipbuilding that enhanced resource management. Today, Ethereum's flourishing DeFi ecosystem is equipped with primitives such as lending and borrowing, staking and restaking. However, much like Europe's challenges with scarce and overutilized resources, Ethereum faces obstacles in making other assets useful in its own home — its Layer 1. The current blockchain ecosystem thus remains frustratingly fragmented. While chain abstraction has been a trending narrative with many projects making progress, solutions like intents usually involve sequencers that favor large players when filling orders between blockchains, leading to centralization. Furthermore, there is no additional utility created for users as most solutions are focused on simply swapping assets. Despite impressive technological foundations, we've created a landscape where digital assets are constrained rather than empowered. Top blockchain resources such as Ethereum are underutilized and limited by rigid architectural boundaries. For true interoperability to exist, in 2025, we must take a step back and re-approach blockchain modularity from a fresh perspective. The illusion of modularity The common analogy of blockchain as ""Lego blocks"" oversimplifies a complex technological landscape. Unlike uniform construction pieces, blockchain components are intricate systems with specific dependencies and complex interoperability challenges. Consider a practical scenario: moving an asset between different blockchain networks should be straightforward. Yet current solutions like basic token swaps offer minimal functionality. The technology demands a more nuanced, sophisticated approach. Emerging technologies are changing this narrative. General message-passing alternatives and advances in transaction finality are allowing for a more organic, unified ecosystem. The ultimate goal isn't just connecting disparate parts but creating an infrastructure where different networks can collaborate effortlessly. 2025: The year of utility and accessibility Looking ahead to 2025, I anticipate a two-pronged approach to address current and future fragmentation issues. In order to appeal to users and build a sustainable user base, the infrastructure should blend into the background so users can focus on the application itself without getting caught up in the technology behind it. Currently, users are unable to utilize their assets optimally due to complicated bridging solutions which disincentivize users from moving their assets easily across the chains. Instead, we need to provide users with an avenue to maximize their yield while contributing to the ecosystem. This can be achieved by giving freedom to token holders to move their assets from chain to chain without bridging, through solutions like restaking. As restaking expands beyond Ethereum connecting multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks, this is a growing area of interest for users. Instead of fragmenting the ecosystem with new, competing blockchains, projects will focus on enhancing and interconnecting existing infrastructure. This approach will breathe new life into currently dormant chains, driving activity and creating genuine value. On top of improvements to the underlying infrastructure, user experience will also take center stage. We'll see applications that integrate blockchain functionality so seamlessly that users will interact with sophisticated technology without ever recognizing its complexity. The infrastructure will become invisible — a powerful backend that complements fluid frontend experiences without technical friction. Creating a global marketplace While 2024 marked significant acceptance of the industry, evidenced by increased investment in assets like bitcoin, true adoption requires an inclusive vision. We should not just build financial instruments, but create a global marketplace where everything talks to everything else, enabling every asset to reach its maximum potential. The future of blockchain isn't about individual chains competing for supremacy. It's about creating a collaborative, fluid infrastructure that enables users access to economic potential, by building the future of how money and value can work.",Opinion|Opinion|Ethereum|Layer 2s,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-31 15:57:12

The asset has plunged in the last two weeks and was hovering around $93,750 at the time of writing. Analysis by CryptoQuant official AxelAdlerJr revealed that crypto exchanges are recording very low levels of BTC deposits while investors are moving assets away from the platforms, possibly to their personal wallets. AxelAdlerJr said these trends suggest BTC could see robust price movements in the near term. Lower Daily BTC Deposits According to AxelAdlerJr, crypto exchanges have witnessed around 30,000 BTC daily deposits over the past few weeks, similar to record lows seen in 2016. In contrast, 10-year average daily deposits hover around 90,000 BTC, and this bull cycle’s peak sits at 125,000 BTC, especially when the asset hit the bullish mark of $66,000. The last time bitcoin’s daily deposit figures were at this low level was during the onset of its major rally. “When users send fewer coins to trading platforms, it typically suggests they prefer to keep their BTC in personal wallets rather than gearing up to sell,” stated AxelAdlerJr. A decrease in deposits on exchanges could lead to a shortage of BTC on the spot market, triggering positive price movements, per the laws of demand and supply. While low deposits do not guarantee a swift price upswing for BTC, they could create an environment that would trigger positive momentum. Traders Move BTC From Exchanges In addition to the plunge in daily BTC deposits on exchanges, traders are moving their bitcoins away from these trading platforms. AxelAdlerJr cited the Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio, a metric that monitors the relationship between net inflows and outflows to exchanges and their total reserves . When the Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio turns negative, it signals a dominance of outflows from exchanges, meaning BTC is being withdrawn. While the metric is currently negative, the CryptoQuant official noted that the most pronounced negative values were seen at the end of the bear market when traders bought BTC from forced sellers at roughly $17,000. “The drop in daily deposits to exchanges to a level not seen since 2016 suggests a large-scale trend of holding Bitcoin in personal wallets, while the Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio confirms a continued outflow of coins. Taken together, these signals set the stage for potentially more robust price movements in the future,” AxelAdlerJr added.

While the bullish momentum in XRP has waned in December, the price has dipped below $2 but continues to hold above $2. XRP continues to stay at the top of South Korea's largest exchanges as it struggles with declines. According to the data, XRP exceeded $800 million in dollar terms in the last 24 hours in trading volume in KRW trading parity on UpBit and Bithumb, South Korea's largest exchanges in terms of volume and number of users. UpBit recorded over $600 million in volume and Bithumb over $200 million. Bitcoin’s trading volume was less than half of these levels. Interest in leading altcoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) also remained low compared to XRP. Experts pointed out that South Korean investors contributed to the buying pressure by creating enthusiastic increases in altcoins and affected the prices upwards, and said that these volume increases could indicate a potential increase in the XRP price. $11 Target for XRP!

One such altcoin capturing attention is RCO Finance (RCOF), which is generating buzz for its potential to deliver extraordinary gains, with some analysts predicting returns as high as 30,000%. With the aim of improving DeFI investing, RCOF is poised for a parabolic surge, earning investors significant ROI. Ethereum Price Faces Persistent Decline: A Bearish Trend Intensifies The Ethereum price continues to struggle, signaling a potential bearish trend as it falls below critical levels. After failing to maintain momentum above the $3,550 resistance, ETH slipped beneath the $3,450 support zone and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, a key indicator of market strength. This fresh decline has brought the Ethereum price to the $3,300 support level, precariously close to breaking lower. The recent dip aligns with the broader market movement, mirroring Bitcoin’s downward trajectory. Key technical indicators, including the hourly MACD and RSI, suggest increased bearish momentum, with Ethereum trading below the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement of its previous upward wave. A break below the $3,300 support could pave the way for the Ethereum price to slide toward $3,250 or even $3,220 in the near term. While recovery above $3,420 could stabilize the Ethereum price, the declining momentum raises concerns among investors, driving attention toward alternative opportunities like RCO Finance (RCOF). RCO Finance (RCOF): The Low-cap Altcoin with Bullish Signals As Ethereum faces challenges, RCO Finance (RCOF) is gaining traction among investors seeking high returns. RCO Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to improve trading strategies and investment opportunities In a market often dominated by giants like Ethereum, RCO Finance (RCOF) emerges as a compelling contender, showcasing a suite of features designed to attract both novice and seasoned investors. What sets RCOF apart is its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi), integrating advanced technologies that promise to revolutionize how users engage with cryptocurrencies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which tailors investment strategies based on individual user profiles. This intelligent system analyzes historical price data, market trends, and news from sources like Reuters, and events to provide personalized recommendations. Eliminating emotional biases and human errors, the Robo Advisor empowers users to make informed decisions, increasing their chances of achieving optimal investment outcomes. This level of sophistication was once reserved for professional traders, but RCOF democratizes access to such tools, making them available to everyone. Another notable aspect of RCO Finance is its commitment to real-world asset integration. The platform allows users to invest in traditional assets like stocks and bonds using cryptocurrencies, effectively bridging the gap between digital and physical markets. This tokenization of real-world assets broadens investment opportunities and increases liquidity, enabling investors to diversify their portfolios without the hassle of converting cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. RCO Finance also prioritizes user privacy and security. SolidProof audits the RCOF altcoin smart contracts, and the platform does not require KYC procedures, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while still complying with necessary regulations. This focus on privacy is particularly appealing in an era where data security is needed. The platform’s governance architecture further improves its appeal. RCOF token holders significantly influence key decisions within the ecosystem, ensuring that the community’s voice is integrated into the platform’s evolution. This decentralized approach contrasts sharply with many other projects. Join the RCOF Altcoin Presale for Unmatched ROI As interest in RCO Finance continues to grow, now is the perfect time for investors to take action by participating in the ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.0778 per altcoin during Stage 4, this presale presents a unique opportunity for early adopters to secure their stake before prices increase. With projections suggesting that RCOF could achieve returns exceeding 700% upon launch at the anticipated $0.6 and potentially reach a staggering 1,000x increase shortly thereafter, the potential for profit is immense. Investing in RCOF offers financial rewards and grants access to exclusive features within the platform. Holders can benefit from quarterly dividends based on their token holdings, ranging from 1% to 6%, depending on the number of tokens owned. Additionally, early investors will enjoy significant discounts on trading fees and access to advanced AI tools that improve their trading strategies. With the Ethereum price movement showing signs of continued drop, RCO Finance is the perfect investment opportunity for investors looking to edge their funds in a lucrative option.

Soltani highlighted that by 2030, the value of cross-border flows is expected to reach an astonishing $300 trillion. Despite this massive projected growth, she emphasized the inefficiencies in the current global payment systems, which are often slow, expensive, and error-prone. Ripple aims to address these challenges through its blockchain-based solutions and the use of digital assets like XRP. #Ripple 's Head of Payments Envisions $300 Trillion Cross-Border Flow—XRP to Handle It All assuming it handles a $300 trillion flow with a circulating supply of 52 billion $XRP , would be approximately $5,769.23 per #XRP . pic.twitter.com/hjroOyJGvc — Xaif | (@Xaif_03) December 29, 2024 Ripple’s Solution to the Inefficient International Payments System Ripple’s payment system leverages blockchain technology to enable faster, more affordable, and more transparent transactions. According to Soltani, the process is streamlined to ensure efficiency and reliability. She gave an example, explaining that when a business in the UK sends funds to the Philippines, Ripple’s platform facilitates the transaction by using a digital asset as a bridge currency. The funds are converted into Philippine pesos through Ripple’s extensive global partner network, ensuring the recipient receives the exact quoted amount in real-time. One of Ripple’s key advantages is its global payout network, which offers access to traditionally hard-to-reach markets and currencies. Soltani noted that businesses could begin transacting within as little as three weeks, with payments settling in seconds instead of days. This speed and scalability position Ripple as a frontrunner in modernizing international finance. It has made XRP a highly popular asset, with the World Bank highlighting it as a leading currency for cross-border transactions. As Ripple’s network grows, increased adoption could significantly boost its price. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Price Target for XRP Xaif’s post drew attention to the implications of Ripple’s potential role in managing these massive cross-border flows. He posited a scenario in which XRP handles the $300 trillion annual flow projected by Soltani, with its circulating supply of 52 billion XRP. Based on this hypothesis, Xaif suggested that XRP’s value could reach $5,769.23. This valuation shows the potential scale and significance of Ripple’s technology in the evolving financial ecosystem. It also affirms the bullish stance shared by many in the XRP army. The view that XRP can serve as a global reserve currency also extends to other prominent financial voices , and experts have set targets as high as $10,000 if XRP can take control of the cross-border payments market.

Once driven by viral trends and celebrity endorsements, Dogecoin price now struggles to maintain momentum, and investors are looking for new opportunities. According to a Bloomberg analyst, WallitIQ (WLTQ) could experience a remarkable 30,000% breakout, positioning it as the next big cryptocurrency. As Dogecoin loses its appeal, WallitIQ (WLTQ) steps in with a clear value proposition for future growth. While the Dogecoin price may continue to falter, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a promising investment. The Bloomberg analyst prediction highlights WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) immense potential, as it offers advanced features and real-world use cases far beyond Dogecoin. Investors are starting to take notice, making WallitIQ (WLTQ) the standout crypto choice in 2024 and 2025. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Takes The Spotlight: The Next Big Thing In Crypto As Dogecoin price struggles to maintain the momentum it once enjoyed, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has emerged as a rising star, gaining traction among both seasoned investors and crypto enthusiasts. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is not just a cryptocurrency—it’s an entire ecosystem powered by advanced artificial intelligence, providing users with a range of innovative features designed to disrupt the market. One of the standout features is WallitIQ’s AI-driven anomaly detection, which allows for real-time security alerts. This makes it ideal for investors who value safety alongside high growth potential. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) unique blend of cutting-edge technology extends beyond just security.

This audit boosts investor confidence, knowing that the project is secure and trustworthy. With these features, it’s no wonder that a Bloomberg analyst predicts a 30,000% breakout for WallitIQ (WLTQ). Investors who act now during the presale could see significant returns as WallitIQ (WLTQ) emerges as a dominant force in the crypto market. The Dwindling Appeal Of Dogecoin: Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Could Be A Better Investment Dogecoin, once seen as a joke turned serious contender, has become a household name in the crypto world. However, the Dogecoin price has failed to maintain the meteoric rise that characterized its early success. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price has seen significant volatility, with sharp peaks followed by equally sharp declines. While Dogecoin’s celebrity-driven hype may have driven it to new heights, it is increasingly clear that the meme coin lacks the foundational growth drivers that could sustain long-term value. As the Dogecoin price wanes, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents itself as a more promising investment, as the Bloomberg analysts point out. Unlike the Dogecoin price, which thrives on social media hype, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) value proposition lies in its innovative AI features, extensive crypto portfolio management, and secure platform. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) predicted by the Bloomberg analyst to experience an incredible 30,000% surge, it’s clear that its upside potential far outstrips what the Dogecoin price has left to offer. Investors looking for more than just a short-term price spike should pay heed to the Bloomberg analyst prediction for WallitIQ (WLTQ), which has a solid foundation and a clear roadmap for future growth. Conclusion: Don’t Miss The Opportunity To Invest In WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale At $0.0420 With WallitIQ (WLTQ) poised for an explosive 30,000% breakout, according to the Bloomberg analyst, now is the time to act.

At a presale price of just $0.0420, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is an investment opportunity you won’t want to miss.

Investors have jumped on the greenback as the Federal Reserve continues to signal steady interest rates while the rest of the world braces for deeper cuts. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, climbed 6.6% this year. It saw an explosive 7.5% jump in the fourth quarter alone—the biggest quarterly leap since 2015. On Tuesday, the index ticked up 0.1% to 108.16. The euro is down 0.2% to $1.0386, bleeding 6% for the year. The yen? Barely holding at 156.76 per dollar after a brutal beating. Even the pound, which held its ground better than most, only managed a meager 0.02% bump to $1.2551. Analysts say Trump’s policies will keep the greenback strong well into 2025. Hedge funds and asset managers are already going all-in, betting $29.8 billion on the dollar’s rise—the most bullish stance since April. Markets feel the dollar’s heat While the dollar flexes, global markets are trying to catch their breath. On Wall Street, stocks managed a modest bounce after three days of losses thanks to high US Treasury yields. The Dow rose 112.81 points to close at 42,688.89. The S&P 500 added 5.82 points, landing at 5,913.01. The Nasdaq slipped 21.86 points to 19,463.98. But despite a bumpy December, the S&P 500 posted a 24% gain for the year, its best two-year streak since the late ’90s. Artificial intelligence (AI) hype, anticipated Fed rate cuts, and the pro-business vibes from Trump’s incoming administration lit a fire under equities. Energy stocks led the charge, with all 11 major sectors in the green by year-end. It’s a Wall Street party, but the bond market is not invited. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly hit 4.641%, the highest since May, cooling some of the rally. The yield settled slightly lower at 4.527% on Tuesday but stayed above 4.5%, a level that makes traders squirm. The international scene isn’t looking much better. Trading volumes were thin with European markets either closed or running half-day sessions for the New Year holiday. Germany, Italy, and Switzerland didn’t even show up.

In his analysis, he highlighted the $1.95 price level as being crucial as it could determine XRP’s next move. XRP Price Forms Descending Triangle On The Daily Chart In an X post, Dark Defender mentioned that the XRP price has formed a descending triangle on the daily time frame. He added that a breakout is imminent in this pattern as long as $1.95 is protected. The analyst highlighted $2.22, $2.72, $2.90, and $5.85 as the initial targets XRP could reach if the price breakout occurs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Guns For A Mid-High Timeframe Reversal Against Bitcoin In Bullish Q1 2025 Meanwhile, the crucial support levels for the XRP price are $1.95, $1.88, and $1.63. Based on an earlier analysis by Dark Defender, XRP could still rally to double digits in the long term. The analyst highlighted a bull flag that had formed on the daily chart, noting that it was similar to the one that had earlier formed on the 4-hour timeframe. Dark Defender stated that the bull flag that formed on the daily chart targets the Fibonacci Level of $5.85 and penetrates toward $10.1979. The crypto analyst remarked that this is a historical pattern approach and the Fibonacci Wave. He added that the last Fibonacci targets stand at $18.22 and $36, with no significant targets in between. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the XRP price could reach these targets in the first half of 2025. While analyzing XRP’s yearly chart, Dark Defender stated that a God Candle awaits next year. This came as he noted that XRP had enjoyed a breakout year in 2024, having consolidated for around six years. XRP boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 228%. From An RSI Perspective Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto provided insights into the XRP price action from a Relative Strength Index (RSI) perspective. The analyst stated that 74, 70, and 65 are the three key RSI levels to watch out for. In the most bullish scenario, he remarked that XRP needs to ideally reach 88 or even 96.5 and higher for the RSI curvature to continue trending upward. Related Reading: Legendary Analyst Peter Brandt Says Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $78,000, Here’s Why Egrag Crypto said it would be “incredibly” bullish if the XRP price bounces from the 74 range. Meanwhile, a dip to 70 could indicate bearish momentum. However, he added that a bounce from this RSI level is essential for continuing the bull run. Likewise, a dip to 65 is also bearish for XRP, but as long as the crypto doesn’t drop below this level, then a bounce would indicate a significant move ahead. The crypto analyst warned that closing below the 65 RSI level could signal the end of the bull run. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

With projections of an 18,299% PCHAIN rally by Q1 2025, this altcoin could outperform the market, becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now. Dogecoin Price Faces Stagnation Despite Crypto Market Optimism Despite a broader crypto rally sparked by a post-election market boost and the Bitcoin price surge past $100,000, the Dogecoin price action remains underwhelming. The Dogecoin price today is $0.32 , reflecting a 18.52% drop over 30 days. While Dogecoin has shown resilience with a 1.80% gain over the past day and an 8.97% rise over the week, its inability to maintain upward momentum for the month has left traders skeptical. Analysts attribute the Dogecoin price stagnation to a lack of interest in meme coins from governments and institutions fueling this bull run. With the broader market optimism shifting to utility-driven altcoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to capture the same excitement seen during its previous peaks, considering its heavy reliance on social sentiment. This decline further cements the perception that DOGE may have reached a saturation point, compelling investors to diversify into more promising crypto assets. Why the $0.01 PropiChain (PCHAIN) Altcoin is the Market’s New Darling As the Dogecoin price faces a significant downturn, investors are dumping DOGE and seeking refuge with the PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale, which has raised nearly $2 million so far. Currently priced at $0.011, PCHAIN is the altcoin powering a groundbreaking platform that’s captivating investors with its unique combination of blockchain, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and AI technologies. Unlike competing Web3 solutions, PropiChain is set to revolutionize the $634 trillion real estate industry by offering a full-service solution for property transactions, management, and investment. At its core, PropiChain (PCHAIN) allows fractional ownership of any property, democratizing access to real estate investment. Investors can purchase fractions of multi-million-dollar properties with as little as $100, removing elitism from an industry traditionally reserved for the rich and wealthy. Considering how PropiChain will bring liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market by enabling instant transactions combined with its metaverse marketplace taking global access to real estate to the next level, PropiChain is positioned to become the leading Web3 real estate trading hub. Furthermore, PropiChain’s AI-powered tools take its appeal a step further. With features like predictive analytics, instant asset valuation, and personalized property recommendations, the platform empowers users to make data-driven investment decisions. Its AI algorithms ensure maximum returns by identifying undervalued properties and predicting market trends. Additionally, PropiChain’s smart contract functionality automates time-intensive tasks such as asset leasing, renewals, and rent collection, significantly reducing operational costs for property managers. To wrap up, blockchain-based security ensures fraud prevention and transparent transactions, enhancing trust in a sector notorious for occupation fraud. Statista reports that the real estate industry suffers the highest losses from occupation fraud among all industries, losing billions of dollars annually. 2025 Dogecoin Price and PropiChain Price Predictions Dogecoin (DOGE) has carved out its place as a cultural phenomenon. However, its lack of substantial utility has hindered its ability to capitalize on broader market trends, as evidenced by the double-digit Dogecoin price drop coming just as the Bitcoin price hit a new ATH of $108,268. On the other hand, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as the top altcoin to buy now, considering its disruptive potential in the real estate sector. With analysts forecasting an unparalleled 18,299% growth by March, investors are visibly excited, especially after PropiChain’s successful BlockAudit security audit. Investors Splash Nearly $2 Million on “Revolutionary” Altcoin Presale PropiChain is about to revolutionize the real estate industry, and the project’s potential hasn’t gone unnoticed, with the PCHAIN presale already raising nearly $2 million in record time. For investors, PropiChain’s astronomical 18,299% profit potential is difficult to ignore as PCHAIN can rise from $0.011 to $2.012 in just three months, rivaling some of the most iconic bull runs in crypto history. Not only do round two investors get PCHAIN at the lowest price it’ll ever be again, but a modest $865 investment today can yield a staggering $159,151 by March, or much earlier if Trump’s inauguration triggers another massive bull run. However, there’s bad news. Round two of the presale is moving three times faster than the previous round, thanks to news of its early success and the bullish mood around the PropiChain CoinMarketCap listing. This means waiting any longer would likely mean missing out on the low round two price of $0.011. PCHAIN will cost $0.032 in the next round, so hurry up and join round two before it’s too late.

He accused the crypto firm of manipulation following its recent 7,629 BTC purchase. Peter Schiff Accuses Tether Of Manipulation In reaction to Tether’s recent Bitcoin purchase, Peter Schiff accused the USDT issuer of “more manipulation.” He stated that the crypto firm simply creates USDT out of “thin air” and uses it to buy Bitcoin. The renowned economist further described this USDT minting as Tether’s version of quantitative easing (QE). He added that this will not end well for Tether or Bitcoin. USDT issuer Tether recently added 7,629 BTC to its reserve, which sparked Schiff’s remarks. The crypto firm now holds $7.68 billion worth of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Schiff’s accusation that USDT was created out of thin air is unfounded, as the stablecoin is backed by the USD and other Tether reserve assets. The firm also releases independent audit reports of its reserves. However, Peter Schiff still seems to be convinced that there is some sort of manipulation involved in the USDT minting. In another X post, he stated that by definition, the USDT Tether uses to buy is not backed by anything other then the BTC it acquires as a result of the purchase. It is worth mentioning that Schiff also criticized MicroStrategy’s $209 million Bitcoin purchase. He stated that the software company is no longer buying enough BTC to keep the price rising. Adding To The Tether FUD Peter Schiff’s remarks about Tether add to the FUD surrounding the stablecoin issuer. There have been many ill comments about the crypto firm’s imminent exit from the European Union (EU) region. Amid this development, USDT’s market cap has slumped by $2 billion. Tether’s CEO, Pablo Ardoino, has addressed the FUD, stating that competitors are just trying to make market participants believe things that don’t exist. In a recent X post , Arduino stated that the paid shill armies that have kept attacking Tether for years are the same that keep attacking Bitcoin to promote some alternative “useless tech.” He added that Bitcoin and Tether are standing in their way but stated that they are unstoppable together.

South Korea Seeks Arrest Of President Yoon According to Reuters , the country’s Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials confirmed that Seoul Western District Court approved the arrest warrant Tuesday over his short-lived declaration of martial law on December 3. WATCH: A South Korean court approved the arrest of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law. An arrest warrant for an incumbent president is unprecedented in the country https://t.co/oXRZ0xtSP0 pic.twitter.com/EODlzdNxwq — Reuters Asia (@ReutersAsia) December 31, 2024 Yoon – who reportedly ignored three summonses related to the inquiry – has since pushed back on the arrest warrant, with his lawyers calling it “illegal and invalid.” The warrant against the one-time prosecutor is active until January 6, making Yoon the first president to face arrest. Critics have argued that Yoon’s choice to impose martial law was an attempt to start a rebellion in the East Asian country, while the polarizing political figure claims he was protecting his citizens from alleged “anti-state forces.” The jarring governmental crisis has prompted international concerns over South Korea’s political stability as Yoon faces the death penalty should he be convicted for spearheading an insurrection against the country’s opposition-led government. Crypto Prices Dip After Martial Law Decree Following Yoon’s martial law decree on December 3, a handful of digital assets temporarily shot down in value over the political crisis. Both Bitcoin and XRP dropped by an estimated 30 percent before Yoon was ordered to rescind his decree on December 4. South Korea’s national currency, the won, briefly dipped as well – though has since seemingly returned to normal levels. News of Yoon’s reported impending arrest comes the same day as disgraced South Korean crypto tycoon, Do Kwon, was extradited to the United States. The Terraform Labs founder fell from grace in May 2022 when his algorithmic stablecoins Terra USD and LUNA crashed, wiping over $40 billion from cryptocurrency markets. The purported crypto fraudster persistently evaded authorities following the crash of his tokens by hiding out in numerous locales across Asia and Europe including Serbia, Dubai, and Montenegro. Kwon was ultimately arrested in the Bakan nation in March 2023 for falsifying travel documents in a bid to flee Europe as INTERPOL issued a “red notice” for his arrest. Kwon was imprisoned in a Montenegrin jail as South Korea and the U.S. battled for his extradition before being sent to federal prison stateside Tuesday. It is unknown whether the current political climate in South Korea played a role in that decision.

38352086,https://finbold.com/?p=224678,1735664537,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Short squeeze alert for January 2025: Two cryptocurrencies with potential to skyrocket,https://finbold.com/short-squeeze-alert-for-january-2025-two-cryptocurrencies-with-potential-to-skyrocket/,"The wider cryptocurrency market has retraced downward after December 17 saw Bitcoin ( BTC ) reach a new all-time high (ATH) price of approximately $106,490. Following the high, the price of BTC retreated to roughly $94,000, before a failed retesting of the $100,000 mark. Prices subsequently crashed below $93,000 but had recovered to $95,256 by press time, with year-to-date (YTD) returns at 126.67%. While broad consensus states that this is just a temporary consolidation period before the market-wide rally continues, even temporary drops have a way of intensifying bearish sentiment. With short sellers having reaped significant rewards from this latest move to the downside, they have doubled down on their bets — in a move that leaves space for potential short squeezes. To identify potential short-squeeze opportunities for January 2025, Finbold retrieved derivatives data from CoinGlass to select two cryptocurrencies that both exhibit high short volume and possess the potential for significant price appreciation. A look at the data identified two promising candidates Aave ( AAVE ) and Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), both of which are well-established digital assets with significant market capitalizations. HYPE and AAVE long & short ratio. Source: CoinGlass Short volume for AAVE and HYPE is beginning to surge Whereas some $140.63 million in long positions was opened in AAVE, $153.02 million was placed in short orders. At present, 52.11% of the daily open interest is on the short side. Although Hyperliquid’s daily open interest is a tad less bearish, with 51.40% in favor of the short side, the total volume is significantly greater. In the last 24 hours, $424.17 million worth of HYPE shorts have been placed, whereas $401.14 million has been used to open long positions. While this is generally lower than what is required for a short squeeze, if the pace continues, the open interest on both assets could swing even more to the bearish side by the end of January. Readers should note that there is no guarantee that a short squeeze will happen with these cryptocurrencies. While the bears have a slight edge at present, a short squeeze requires a rapid and powerful pivot from bearish to bullish sentiment, with plenty of open positions in the previous direction. However, with that being said, these are the two assets that experienced the most bearish shifts over the last 24 hours. If the pace continues into January, a lot of capital could be at risk. Both AAVE and HYPE are likely going to benefit from platform improvements in 2025 — HYPE staking went live on December 30, providing a massive bullish catalyst for the asset, and the highly-anticipated launch of Aave V4, slated for early 2025 , will doubtlessly do the same for AAVE.

Pepe ( PEPE ), the third-biggest meme coin, climbed to a high of $0.000022, its highest level since Dec. 18. The rebound came after Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, updated his X profile picture to a Pepe-like image. Musk, one of the most influential people globally, has over 234 million followers on X, close ties with Donald Trump, and a fortune of nearly half a trillion dollars .

Pepe breakeven price | Source: IntoTheBlock Pepe Coin price analysis Pepe price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Pepe coin price peaked at $0.00002833 earlier this month before pulling back. It bottomed at $0.0000145, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point, and formed a hammer pattern. This pattern, characterized by a small body and a long lower shadow, is often a bullish signal. Pepe has now climbed above the key resistance level of $0.00001950, its highest swing on Dec. 24. It is also trading above the 200-day and 100-day moving averages. Given these bullish indicators, Pepe is likely to continue rising, with bulls targeting the year-to-date high of $0.00002833, which represents about a 33% upside from the current level. Potential catalysts for further gains include Donald Trump’s upcoming swearing-in and the expected FTX distributions . Some of the $16 billion from the distributions may be reinvested into cryptocurrencies, potentially boosting Pepe.

We Evaluated Bitcoin's New Year Performances!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/does-bitcoin-btc-like-new-years-we-evaluated-bitcoins-new-year-performances/,"The year 2024 has seen exponential growth in adoption for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, with the most significant factor being the US SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which has seen a significant increase in institutional interest in BTC. BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time in its history, breaking new records, thanks to the growing interest from institutions and Donald Trump's victory in November. While Bitcoin is running from record to record with supportive winds, altcoins still haven't met expectations. At this point, while many investors are waiting for losses in altcoins they bought at high prices, the great expectation of an altcoin rally in 2025 continues to be a hope for closing the losses. How Is Bitcoin Performing in the New Years? As is known, BTC's trading adventure on exchanges does not date back very far. Even on major exchanges such as Binance, Bitcoin, which started trading in 2017, does not have many anniversaries to compare it with. Although Bitcoin started to be traded on some exchanges in 2014, we will not take it into account in this review as we think it will not shed light on today due to the low trading volume in those years. Year 2021-2022 Year 2022-2023 Year 2023-2024 As can be seen, a general upward movement was observed in Bitcoin after the new year anniversaries. As a result; Bitcoin tends to show an upward movement on anniversaries. Of course, the fact that it has acted this way before does not mean that it will happen again. While it remains unclear how Bitcoin will greet the year 2025, one thing we do understand is that “Bitcoin loves new years.” *This is not investment advice.

The token welcomes the new year with grand ambitions and expectations. Memecoins have seen tremendous growth over the past year, awarding investors handsomely. Husky Inu (HINU), one of the newest memecoins to grace the crypto world, is ready to welcome 2025 and expects immense growth this year. The project is currently in its second presale round, which has generated over $690,000 since launching. Another Winner from the Solana Network: Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu is the latest memecoin to join the Solana blockchain. Affectionately known as Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) new best friend, Husky Inu, was created to bring its holders more utility and value by leveraging the power of Solana. Husky Inu and its native token, HINU, aim to disrupt the memecoin industry by building a supportive community boasting innovative features and improved rewards. The project recently launched the presale for its native token, HINU and is doing immensely well. Since going live, the presale has generated over $690,000. Husky Inu is working on exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. According to the platform, the Earn App will reward users for engaging with the platform and completing simple tasks such as liking, sharing and reposting content. On the other hand, the DEX will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU token holders. Husky Inu owes its stand-out presale performance to some fantastic features. The project is committed to a reliable token ecosystem through a carefully designed distribution model and a capped maximum supply to ensure scarcity and value. The project has capped its total supply to 100 billion tokens and boasts a unique deflationary supply element. The deflationary aspect means that 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming Husky Inu Exchange and DEX will be used to buy and then burn $HINU tokens and, in such a way, reduce the circulating HINU supply. What Makes Husky Inu (HINU) a Good Buy? It is clear to see why the memecoin sector attracts the attention it does. Often, these projects enter the crypto sphere motivated purely by speculation and fun, but specific tokens stand out for their ability to move beyond their reputation. Husky Inu and its grand plans have already positioned itself as a promising candidate, and its future roadmap displays the traits of a profitable investment.

United States policymakers and our allies focus too narrowly on macroeconomic tools like sanctions and promoting the dollar as a reserve currency when the modern front is evolving. Today, the real battles are being waged on smartphones and in the global currency markets. China is waging a multi-decade plan to displace the United States' greatest asset: the dollar. The dollar is critical to the United States' economic and geopolitical power as the global reserve currency. Without it, our influence would weaken, and our debt would become a bigger problem. This is precisely what the Chinese Communist Party and the Kremlin want. China and Russia have shed billions of dollars worth of U.S. Treasury holdings while growing their stockpiles of gold. Our sanctions, designed to separate countries from the ""Western"" economic system, are no longer enough of a deterrent for those who can control financial activity within their borders and project their power outward. Authoritarian adversaries — including China, Iran and Russia — are actively building parallel cross-border economic systems that will pull into their orbits not only neighboring countries but also our allies who trade heavily with them. For example, over half of businesses in Japan accept Alipay, while more than one-third accept WeChat Pay. This distribution gives two Chinese firms unprecedented visibility into the individual market transactions of Japanese consumers and businesses. It could allow China to disrupt Japan’s economy should tensions escalate, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. How the U.S. can respond China sees financial technology and cryptocurrency as tools to extend its financial power and surveillance globally. The United States must respond in two ways: export our financial technology and systems worldwide and embrace bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset instead of stifling innovation. Lawmakers and politicians on both sides of the aisle, most notably President-elect Donald Trump, recognize the power of holding bitcoin on the nation’s balance sheet as a hedge against inflation. This direction would also strengthen U.S. resilience against economic challenges posed by China’s financial strategies. The Federal Reserve, like many central banks, holds a diverse portfolio of reserve assets. As of 2024, this includes approximately $35 billion in foreign currencies and $11 billion in gold stock. These holdings demonstrate America’s economic strength and provide liquidity during financial stress. However, in our rapidly digitizing world, the absence of a native digital asset in this portfolio is becoming increasingly conspicuous. With its global reach and growing adoption, bitcoin is the ideal candidate to fill this gap. Often called “digital gold,” bitcoin is a scarce commodity. The U.S. is the largest nation-state holder of bitcoin, having seized 210,000 coins from illegal actors. This gives the U.S. a first-mover advantage and could secure our economic future. Critics may argue that bitcoin's volatility makes it unsuitable as a reserve asset. However, this volatility will likely decrease as adoption grows and the market matures. In 2021, El Salvador recognized bitcoin as legal tender and began purchasing it as a treasury reserve asset. They have seen a 100% increase in value and have no intention of selling. A multi-front war The U.S. must recognize we are already in a multi-front war with China. One of these fronts is financial services, and crypto is a weapon in our arsenal. Losing this battle means global financial services and individual financial activity would be dominated by adversarial states focused on control, surveillance and dominance — and a continued attack on our currency. Trump understands this, telling Bloomberg in July, “If we don’t do it, China is going to pick [bitcoin] up.” Projecting American financial power also requires the government to empower, enable and encourage our private economic sector to interact with contested economies throughout the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Expanding the use of our payment systems, banks and dollars — even where it’s controversial — is essential. Right now, our adversaries are winning because we aren't even playing. They are exporting their systems, institutions and surveillance tools worldwide. Meanwhile, we’ve done little as TikTok, a serious threat to our national security, captivates an entire generation of Americans. We must do the same with financial technology because no disruption would be greater to our enemies. The U.S. should more explicitly weaponize financial technology and crypto. For example, we should endorse decentralized financial technology that enables citizens of hostile governments like Iran to use smartphones to access USD-based stablecoins and payment services, in order to begin separating their economic activity from their government’s control. At its core, power is about control — not just of police or national security but of resources and economies. The world is at a financial crossroads. The question isn’t whether digital currencies will shape the future but how we will adapt to this new reality. The U.S. can shape this future by embracing bitcoin as a reserve asset. The time for bold action is now, and the benefits for global financial stability and innovation could be profound.",Opinion|Opinion|Bitcoin Strategic Reserve|China,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-31 17:18:06

Some market observers suggest the price could hit $4 or even much higher, supported by declining exchange holdings, which reduce the immediate selling pressure. Major XRP Rally on the Way? Ripple’s XRP has been among the worst-performing leading cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. On December 30, it briefly tumbled under $2 before it recovered some losses to the current $2.07 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the bearish outlook in the last week, 2024 has been highly successful for XRP. Recall that it was worth around $0.62 at the start of the year, meaning it has experienced a 230% price increase since then. Multiple analysts believe it has much more room for growth. One of those is Ali Martinez, who claimed that the Bollinger Bands on the token’s price chart have been squeezing lately, indicating a “big movement” underway. This technical indicator, developed by John Bollinger in the early 1980s, assists traders in detecting when an asset may be overbought or oversold and spot potential price breakouts or reversals. Tightening the bands means XRP has experienced relatively low volatility for a prolonged time and might be headed for a huge rally (or correction). JAVON MARKS remains an optimist and suggested that XRP’s current price condition looks very similar to what transpired in 2017 (shortly before the bull run that took it to a new all-time high of over $3.4). “Prices right now may only be getting ready to come out of an ‘Intermission Phase’ before yet another ‘groundbreaking’ bullish rally! It may be time to strap in,” the X user assumed. Previous Predictions Other market observers who have set bullish targets for Ripple’s native token include Mikybull Crypto and Coach, JV. The former expects a rise to a new peak of $4, whereas the latter thinks that XRP would be one of those cryptocurrencies that investors will regret not buying at current rates: “XRP will be one of these assets where people will say, “I could have bought XRP at $2, $5, or $7, and will FOMO in at $100.” The beauty in this. Everyone will win in the long run! It’s the short-term mindset that destroys portfolios!” Meanwhile, the amount of XRP stored on exchanges has been declining in the past week. This suggests a shift from centralized platforms towards private wallets and could be considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure.

Franklin Templeton Digital Assets first wrote that he expects a bright outlook for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Franklin analysts noted that by 2025, cryptocurrencies will see significant advances shaped by regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and technological evolution. According to the report, analysts listed their expectations as follows: “We believe that in 2025, U.S. regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve more diversified crypto-related financial or investment products, such as more crypto ETFs or tokenized security products. Favorable regulations will allow the United States to reestablish itself as a global hub for crypto innovation. We will see large TradFi companies enter the crypto space. A stablecoin regulatory framework is expected in the US. This will open the doors for large financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Bitcoin will solidify its position as a global financial asset that acts as a digital store of value, accelerated by sovereign and institutional adoption. We expect strategic BTC reserves to be added by several countries. We will see the convergence of AI and cryptocurrencies accelerate, with blockchains providing transparency and verification that will be crucial to expanding the AI-driven economy.” *This is not investment advice.

The country plans to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its national reserves. Giw Zanganeh, Vice President of Energy and Mining at Tether, spearheads this initiative . The proposal could lead to a historic shift in Switzerland’s financial landscape if successful. It could have significant implications for the Swiss financial system and the broader cryptocurrency world. The Vision: A Bitcoin-Fueled Swiss National Bank Zanganeh’s plan proposes changing Switzerland’s constitution to allow Bitcoin to be part of the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) reserves. The SNB currently diversifies its reserves across various fiat currencies and gold. The bank has always seen gold as a safe investment, so it holds over 1,000 tonnes of it. The country’s constitution, Article 99, Clause 3, mandates that part of its reserves must be held in gold. Zanganeh’s initiative proposes a small yet powerful change to this article, adding just a few words to allow Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This inclusion would mirror the growing global interest in Bitcoin as a store of value and financial hedge. It could position Switzerland at the forefront of digital currency adoption at a national level. Meanwhile, making Bitcoin part of Switzerland’s National Bank reserves won’t be easy. The proposal needs to collect 100,000 signatures from Swiss citizens by June 30. If it does, it will be reviewed by the Swiss Federal Assembly. For this to happen, the proposal will need support from the public and political leaders in Switzerland. A Previous Attempt and the Global Shift Toward Bitcoin This is not the first time Switzerland has entertained the idea of integrating Bitcoin into its financial framework. 2B4CH, a crypto initiative group, tried a similar plan in October 2021, but it didn’t get enough support. Since then, the landscape has shifted dramatically. The incoming U.S. government has also teased creating a Bitcoin reserve. Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding the idea , other countries are looking into it too. Recently, Christian Lindner, the former German finance minister, has suggested adding Bitcoin to Germany’s reserves. This also includes the European Central Bank’s reserves and those of Russia and Canada. Switzerland’s Crypto-Friendly Legacy Switzerland has long been a haven for crypto firms and investors . The country is prominent for its progressive stance on digital currencies. It has provided a welcoming environment for blockchain innovation. Zug, one of Switzerland’s cantons, started experimenting with Bitcoin payments in 2016. This was years before the digital asset gained mainstream popularity. This new plan continues Switzerland’s crypto-friendly tradition, pushing for a new way to achieve financial stability.

According to new data from whale-tracking platform Whale Alert, an ancient BTC address that has been inactive for a decade has risen from its slumber to shift around 357 BTC worth $34,070,177. “A dormant address containing 357 BTC ($34,070,177) has just been activated after 11.0 years!” Data from blockchain tracker BitInfoCharts shows the wallet profited a staggering $33.7 million, or 10,150%, from the price of Bitcoin rising. BitInfoCharts also shows that the wallet hasn’t been active since January 2014. At that time, the crypto king was valued at just $862. The data also shows that the address was sent small amounts of BTC numerous times throughout its existence. Earlier this month, BitInfoCharts found that long-dormant crypto whale wallets were receiving trace amounts of BTC likely due to dusting attacks. Dusting attacks occur when bad actors send small amounts of crypto to addresses as a means of invading their privacy, tracking the transactional data from them to identify the individuals or companies behind them. The flagship digital asset is trading for $94,209 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

This small, self-proclaimed libertarian state, wedged between Croatia and Serbia, is about to choose its next set of leaders. The elections will fill the seats of the Congress, Liberland’s governing body, which makes the laws, policies, and fiscal decisions for the nation. What’s different here is that the entire voting process is on the blockchain. No physical ballots, no middlemen. Just decentralized, tamper-proof voting. The candidates running for Congress The candidates are as unconventional as the election itself. Justin Sun, Liberland’s Prime Minister and the co-founder of TRON blockchain, is on the ballot. Justin says his focus is on running a minimalist government. “Our success can inspire other nations to embrace libertarian principles, demonstrating that a minimalist government can bring stability and prosperity without excessive regulation or coercion. By upholding this approach, we will further Liberland’s status as a beacon of freedom and individual autonomy,” he said. Evan Luthra, Liberland’s IT Minister and entrepreneur, is another candidate. Evan claims he plans to overhaul Liberland’s digital systems. “Liberland is for people who believe freedom is a fundamental right,” he said. He’s pushing for streamlined services that “actually work.” Then there’s Karnika E. Yashwant, also known as Mr. KEY. A blockchain veteran with over a decade of experience, his campaign promises are quite specific: easier citizenship processes, better communication with residents, and putting Liberland on the map. “Liberland is a movement for freedom, choice, and innovation. My candidacy is grounded in actionable solutions that position Liberland as a trailblazer for liberty-driven governance,” he said, adding that: “Liberland is freedom in its purest form. But let’s face it: We’ve got the ideas, but we need structure. We’ve got the talent, but we need action.” – Mr. KEY Then Samuela Davidova, the Press Secretary of Liberland. She said, “As a candidate for Congress, my focus is clear: streamline foreign relations, empower citizens, and deliver real, tangible benefits. No reinventing the wheel. Let’s amplify what works and eliminate unnecessary obstacles.” A day before the election, on January 3, an online debate will take place. It’ll reportedly be a chance for citizens to hear directly from all 15 candidates. Each gets five minutes to introduce themselves, followed by questions from moderators and Cabinet members. The debate is open to the public via Zoom. Liberland’s Congress currently has seven members, and the election will determine its next lineup. Each term lasts only three months, reportedly to keep the government fast-moving and adaptable.

According to a report by Vijesti, the transfer from local authorities took place on December 31 at the Podgorica Airport border cross. Meanwhile, the U.S won the extradition request despite South Korea where Do Kwon holds citizenship fought keenly for his custody. The Do Kwon Extradition Dilemma According to the Vijesti report, the Terraform Labs founder faced the extradition with help from the NCB Interpol Podgorica officials. The Interpol collaborated with the Montenegro Special Police Unit to complete the extradition. This move marks an end to a process that began from as early as September 14, 2022. The controversial extradition battle ended last week in favor of the United States. This came as the country’s Minster of Justice Bojan Bozovic signed the extradition orders , upholding an ealier court ruling. In reality, since the March 2023 arrest of Do Kwon in Montenegro, there has been series of rulings regarding his extradition hurdles. At a time, the entire extradition process became delayed due to the appeal filed directly by the Terraform Labs co-founder. The extradition is now confirmed by Prime Minister Milojko Spajic Today Montenegro completed the extradition of Do Kwon to the United States to face charges in the Terra/Luna case.

What Next for Terra Classic? When the Do Kwon led the Terraform Labs ecosystem collapsed in 2022, the protocol saw a forking that lead to the creation of Terra Classic and Terra. While LUNA marked the new protocol, LUNC retained the original features, albeit with highly diluted supply. The ecosystem has continued to try different methods to restore the value of LUNC, including a Binance-backed LUNC upgrade . The Terra Luna Classic major v3.3.0 upgrade simplifies tax handling by automatically deducting it from the amount sent before it reaches the recipient’s wallet. This upgrade aims to enhance security and overall protocol usability. Beyond this, the LUNC token burning campaign is also advancing with a new 50 million stash sent to dead wallet. The expectation is that these deflationary shift can help revive the price of LUNC in the long term. As of writing, the price of Terra Classic was pegged at $0.0001088, down by 2.2% in 24 hours.

Ripple XRP price gained 8%, rising in its trading volume to impressive levels of around $5.4 billion. A new player, 1FUEL is set to become the next-generation crypto wallet to resolve the roadblocks to crypto adoption. Let’s see why experts believe this could be the altcoin to watch for 2025. XRP Price Rises 8%, Experts Predict a Breakout This December, the general cryptocurrency market has been in a consolidation phase. Mostly, this has been due to uncertainty over Federal Reserve cuts in interest rates, favoring a hawkish approach to arrest inflation. Despite its sideways movement, Ripple XRP showed its potential earlier this year when it made a 400% rally. XRP has evolved from the coin that traded between $0.30 and $0.60. This was in the past when it rose and crashed consistently. However, in November, it rose for four weeks straight, and things have been different since then. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.07, representing an uptick of 8.29% in 1 month. Its 24-hour trading volume is $5.4 billion, signaling a 121.92% gain. XRP’s partnerships with financial institutions and regulatory clarity have fueled a strong market performance so far in 2024, with the price hitting noteworthy highs this year. However, analysts warn that going into the new year, there could be stagnation as the market for blockchain-based financial solutions becomes more crowded. 1Fuel Set to Make Waves in Cross-Chain Transactions in 2025 While XRP’s growth might level out in 2025, a new altcoin, 1FUEL, is setting itself up as the next-generation crypto wallet to resolve the roadblocks to crypto adoption. The 1FUEL presale has gained traction, raising over $940,000 and selling over 99 million tokens as stage 3 beckons. Unlike XRP which is mainly focused on transactions, 1FUEL integrates cutting-edge tools with artificial intelligence to power digital asset management. With innovation at the core, 1FUEL is a new altcoin in a league of its own. This privacy-focused wallet approaches cross-chain transactions differently with AI tools that enable 1-click cross-chain transactions. Moreover, artificial intelligence monitors the network automatically to provide insights into network congestion and eliminate irregular transaction fees. As the 3rd stage of presale beckons, savvy investors are following the situation and participating at a low price point of $0.012. Analysts project massive returns of up to 500x on public launch. Users want a safe wallet to handle on-chain transactions, but 1fuel takes things up a notch by securing transactions with built-in mixer technology and disposable wallets. With the increase in wallet watching, these ensure anonymous transactions. 1Fuel offers a cold storage solution to store assets offline. This adds a layer of protection from breaches and hacks. Moreover, 1FUEL incentivizes token holders with staking rewards of up to 30% APR. Conclusion Ripple XRP gained 8%, rising in its trading volume to impressive levels, while 1fuel is setting itself up as the next-generation crypto wallet to resolve the roadblocks to crypto adoption. The 1FUEL presale allows savvy investors to get in on the altcoin to watch for 2025. Join the presale to lock yourself in position for mind-blowing returns.

With Rollblock , Dogecoin, and Stellar at the forefront, these altcoins show significant growth potential for 2025. As Donald Trump returns as a crypto-supportive president, blockchain projects with strong technology and innovative ideas could soon steal the spotlight from Bitcoin. Rollblock, Dogecoin, and Stellar are among those that have the potential to outperform the OG cryptocurrency. Rollblock – Revolutionizing the $450B Gambling Industry Through Crypto Rollblock project aims to merge the traditional iGaming industry with cutting-edge blockchain technology, pioneering developments in the GambleFi niche. In December, Rollblock saw over $1.3 million in bets placed, with predictions suggesting the casino could double that amount in January. A Fully Licensed and Operational Platform Rollblock is a fully licensed GambleFi platform. The site is licensed by Gaming Anjouan and offers over 7,000 games from more than 10 different gaming providers. The platform also recently introduced sports betting, tapping into major markets like the NBA, NFL, and Formula 1. RBLK – Fueling Rollblock's Ecosystem RBLK is the utility token of the Rollblock ecosystem. Now in its ninth stage of presale, the token is set to deliver substantial returns once it hits the market. Rollblock employs three key strategies to increase its value: ● Revenue Sharing – Rollblock will use up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buy RBLK tokens from the open market.● Token Burn Mechanism – The casino will burn 60% of repurchased tokens.● High-Reward Staking – The 40% of the remaining tokens will be distributed as staking rewards. This approach reduces the token supply while boosting rewards for holders, with more profits being generated each month. “Dogecoin is a Must-Buy for 2025,” Say Analysts Despite navigating a turbulent period caused by the ""DogeReaper"" vulnerability, which led to 69% of Dogecoin nodes crashing, Dogecoin continues to show promise. Trading at $0.3205 with a $46 billion market cap, the coin has a history of strong January rallies, averaging 90% gains. Galaxy Research forecasts that Dogecoin could hit $1 by 2025, achieving a $100 billion market cap. This optimism is fueled by its active community, growing adoption, and potential backing from broader market trends, particularly Bitcoin’s expected rise to $150K by mid-2025. However, Dogecoin’s path to $1 hinges on overcoming market volatility, regulatory challenges, and network recovery. Stellar – $1 Could Be Closer Than Ever Currently trading at around $0.32, Stellar has seen a dip in price since its November highs, but the altcoin still shows strong potential for a rally in 2025. Stellar's solid fundamentals, including partnerships with MoneyGram, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton, make it a strong contender, particularly in cross-border payments and real-world asset tokenization. Ali Martinez, a top technical analyst, highlights a bullish falling wedge pattern for Stellar, with key resistance levels at $0.45 and $0.50. Ali says that Stellar could soar to $2-3 at the end of 2025. The rally is driven by increased adoption, limited supply, and market dynamics. A breakthrough above $0.45 for Stellar could signal the start of a powerful rally, with some forecasts even suggesting a target price of $5. Is RBLK the Best Token for 2025? While many tokens are expected to experience strong rallies in 2025, RBLK stands out as one of the best options. Rollblock has a unique advantage over Stellar, Dogecoin, and even Bitcoin as it can capitalize on the massive $450 billion gambling ecosystem. As a result, RBLK holders not only stand to benefit from capital gains, but they’ll also share in the GambleFi platform’s profits. Tokens are currently available for just $0.044 and are set to increase over the next few weeks. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Africa is a region producing fintech unicorns that provide the highly unbanked (and equally highly “smartphonized”) population and merchants with payment solutions. Companies like TymeBank, Moniepoint, and Opay have made hundreds of millions of dollars by creating and maintaining payment mobile apps and ground touchpoints. In conditions where banks are absent—80% of Africans don’t have bank cards—digital money solutions are filling the void, and cryptocurrency is one of the factors shaping the modern-day financial reality of the continent. You might also like: Chainalysis: Stablecoins represent 40% of crypto economy in Sub-Saharan Africa Ethiopia entered the global BTC mining top According to Intellinews , in 2023, only 35% of Ethiopians had bank accounts. However, this did not block the country from becoming one of the world’s leaders in Bitcoin mining. In 2024, Ethiopia became the first African country with a high-scale state-backed crypto mining operation. Its revenue is expected to reach up to $5.4 billion in 2027. The backbone of Ethiopia’s success in the sector is the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a gravity dam constructed on the Blue Nile River by 2024. The GERD is one of the 20 largest hydroelectric power plants in the world and the biggest one in Africa. It provides electricity to the entire country and produces enough for export to other nations. Bitcoin critics have often emphasized the excessive energy consumption of the network, noting that many mining operations are based in countries with cheap electricity that rely on dirty fossil fuels. Ethiopia, however, mines bitcoins using cheap and clean energy from the GERD. Interestingly, only half of the Ethiopian population has access to electricity. This means a significant portion of the spare energy can be invested in mining. In 2024, Ethiopia generated $1 billion through Bitcoin mining. The profits made by mining help maintain the GERD infrastructure. According to Happy Coin News, the mining operation accounted for 18% of the country’s annual national income. Bitcoin mining brings in 18% of Ethiopia's revenue thanks to the country using its own GERD hydroelectric power station to mine cryptocurrencies. Read more: https://t.co/qkqiQLwciO — Happy Coin News ☣️ (@happycoinnews) December 28, 2024 In October, Luxor Mining COO Ethan Vera named the key components of Ethiopia’s success in the sector. These include cheap electricity and the use of mid-generation mining devices that consume less power and cost less than newer machines. The main models used in Ethiopia, according to Vera, are Bitmain’s S19J Pro and A1346 by Canaan. The Ethiopian blueprint In 2024, Ethiopia contributed 2.25% of the global hash power in Bitcoin mining. According to Luxor Mining, Ethiopia is the next biggest hash power contributor after the USA, Hong Kong, and Asia. The success of Ethiopia demonstrates that governments can use cryptocurrency to finance infrastructure development and lift local economies. Ethiopia emerged as a Bitcoin mining leader without compromising environmental sustainability. Notably, green mining requires easy access to clean energy while profits are reinvested in the dam’s development, representing a win-win scenario. While Ethiopia was building its mining powerhouse, other countries took note. The Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, is set to build its own clean mining operation in Virunga National Park. Meanwhile, smaller players in other countries are developing local grids to support grassroots mining operations. Initiatives like Gridless and Trojan Mining are also advancing eco-friendly Bitcoin mining efforts in Africa. Ethiopia is paving the way for other African countries to capitalize on renewable energy sources to build Bitcoin mining operations. Similar efforts across the continent could inject vitality into local economies, amplify the ongoing fintech revolution, and open new opportunities for African nations.

OKX Releases 26th Proof of Reserves Showing Changes in BTC, ETH and USDT Assets The snapshot reveals significant changes in user asset balances across major cryptocurrencies compared to the previous report on November 13. Key Points Bitcoin (BTC): User BTC holdings decreased by 8,992 BTC compared to the previous month, falling to 130,936 BTC. Ethereum (ETH): User ETH holdings increased by 85,000 ETH to 1.765 million ETH. Tether (USDT): User USDT holdings have increased significantly, reaching $8.56 billion. This figure equates to $1.91 billion, an increase of 28.79%. The Proof of Reserves initiative is part of OKX’s ongoing commitment to transparency and user trust. It uses cryptographic tools such as Merkle trees and public wallet addresses to verify the platform’s reserves and ensure that user funds are fully backed. OKX has been continuously updating PoR data since November 2022, allowing users and third-party auditors to independently verify solvency. This approach aims to increase trust in the exchange amid increasing regulatory scrutiny and increasing demand for accountability in the crypto industry. The report highlights changing user asset allocations with significant growth in ETH and USDT holdings. The decline in BTC holdings may reflect market trends such as profit-taking or diversification into other assets such as Ethereum and stablecoins. The sharp increase in USDT reserves is in line with broader market dynamics where users often park their funds in stablecoins during periods of volatility or uncertainty. *This is not investment advice.

Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale , Lightchain AI’s innovative technology and real-world utility are drawing attention, with analysts suggesting it could deliver exponential returns and outshine the giants of the market. Bitcoin and Ethereum Steady Growth in a Maturing Market Bitcoin and Ethereum keep to guide the crypto market, pushed by their set roles and rising big company use. Bitcoins small amount, mixed with its job as online gold, helps its slow rise to $130,000. In the same way, Ethereums power in op͏en money (DeFi) and clever deals backs its predicted jump to $10,000.

Looking forward, Binance Labs revealed it will keep a close look in three “key areas of focus” while investing. The company posted an announcement on December 31 calling for the year of the Wood Snake, symbolizing growth and creativity. On that note, Binance Labs will soon rebrand and plans to count with Changpeng Zhao ’s (CZ) guidance for its investments. As disclosed, the “key areas of focus” in 2025 will be crypto and blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and biotech. “We are also excited to see innovations emerging at the intersection of these three areas,” the fund wrote. Besides the also bullish stance regarding Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration in 2025 , Binance Labs commented further on its forecasts for the new year regarding specific crypto narratives and trends. “We anticipate that underperforming sectors like gaming, ZK technologies, and privacy solutions may experience a resurgence as they transition from development to production, enabling new use cases. Further, existing narratives like DeSci, RWAs/Stablecoins, and AI agents should continue to do well with strong momentum, as we are only scratching the surface of what can be achieved.” – Binance Labs Fund Binance Labs Fund 2024 recap Notably, Binance Labs disclosed its year-to-date investment strategy, balancing a fifty-fifty allocation among decentralized applications (DApps) and infrastructure projects. Out of 46 funding deals, decentralized finance (DeFi) led with 10, followed closely by AI and the Bitcoin ( BTC ) ecosystem, with seven deal each. Expanding to other narratives, restaking solutions had four deals and the gaming sector had three. Finally, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, real-world assets ( RWA ), and consumer apps had two deals each, closing Binance’s 2024 funding activities. Interestingly, only 14 out of the 46 projects were from the BNB Chain ( BNB ) ecosystem, which Binance is a main stakeholder. This shows an unbiased and chain agnostic approach, which will potentially influence Binance Labs’s rebranding. “We’re always on the lookout for projects that have real-world use cases, strong teams, solid roadmaps, and sustainable business models,” the firm concluded. The announcement also explained that Binance Labs is expanding its scope for investment beyond primary market deals.

The latest Franklin Templeton’s 2025 crypto outlook report, for one, predicted its continued dominance. Bitcoin is expected to solidify its position as a global financial asset, increasingly viewed as a digital store of value. Bitcoin Dominance Forecasted to Strengthen in 2025 The report anticipates sovereign and institutional adoption will drive this trend, with several nations strategically adding Bitcoin to their reserves. The forecast points to BTC’s role as the foundational asset in the digital economy, which is expected to be further accelerated by evolving regulatory landscapes and institutional interest. Looking beyond Bitcoin, the report highlighted significant advancements in the broader crypto ecosystem as well. Regulatory clarity, especially in the US after Donald Trump’s presidential win, is poised to enable more diversified financial products, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and tokenized securities, and ultimately represent a major shift towards more mainstream adoption. With a stablecoin regulatory framework expected, major financial institutions are likely to issue their own stablecoins, helping to bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto sector. The growing adoption of tokenized products and stablecoins will fuel decentralized finance (DeFi) growth, expanding the reach of blockchain technology. AI-Crypto Synergy Moreover, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) are predicted to see rising demand, especially in sectors like logistics and the Internet of Things (IoT), as industries seek more efficient, decentralized solutions. The intersection of AI and crypto will also intensify, with blockchains providing essential transparency and verification for the AI-driven economy. As AI agents leverage blockchain to automate transactions and manage portfolios, the synergy between digital content, social media, and on-chain activity is expected to expand, further reshaping the digital landscape. “Overall, 2025 will mark a shift from speculation to utility, as crypto’s foundational technologies become integral to global financial and operational systems. Stakeholders should watch regulatory developments, institutional moves, and advancements in AI-crypto convergence to navigate this dynamic landscape.” The post Bitcoin to Maintain Leadership in 2025 as Sovereign and Institutional Adoption Soars: Franklin Templeton appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Artificial Intelligence (AI)|Bitcoin ETF|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-31 18:19:42

Seeing others achieve life-altering returns while feeling left behind is disheartening. Does the fear of missing out make you question if there are still opportunities to succeed in the rapidly evolving crypto space? The uplifting news is that there is hope! By focusing on projects with solid foundations, forward-thinking technology, and practical applications, you can tap into immense potential returns. This guide aims to simplify the complex crypto space and identify the next biggest altcoins for 2025. Top 5 Next Altcoins to Explode in 2025 Here's our list of top altcoins poised for extraordinary returns by 2025: Web3Bay ($3BAY): Revolutionizing E-Commerce via Blockchain Ripple ($XRP): Fast Global Payment Solutions Polkadot ($DOT): Leading in Multi-Chain Technology Chainlink ($LINK): Connecting Smart Contracts to Real Data Dogecoin ($DOGE): From Meme to Crypto Market Leader Now, let's delve into each project to understand what sets them apart and why they should be part of your 2025 portfolio. Web3Bay (3BAY): Revolutionizing E-Commerce via Blockchain Web3Bay is significantly impacting the crypto world by transforming e-commerce through blockchain technology. This decentralized platform facilitates a barrier-free marketplace where buyers and sellers meet without middlemen. Integrating crypto payments with traditional ones like PayPal, Web3Bay is bridging the old Web2 and new Web3 commerce styles. Currently, 3BAY tokens are available at just $0.003 during the presale, rising by 15% in subsequent stages. Early participants could see returns surpassing 500x when the platform reaches full functionality. With 28 presale stages and a limited supply of tokens, Web3Bay presents an early opportunity to back a project set to reshape global commerce. What distinguishes Web3Bay is its combined payment system, decentralized control, and low fees. It offers merchants, especially in developing areas, access to global markets without traditional banking hurdles, placing it among the top altcoins for your attention. Ripple ($XRP): Fast Global Payment Solutions Ripple is at the forefront of transforming global financial systems. Its currency, XRP, enables quick, affordable, and secure international payments favored by banks and financial entities. Ripple’s blockchain completes transactions in 3-5 seconds with minimal fees, vastly surpassing old banking practices. Already collaborating with over 300 institutions like Santander and American Express, and with growing adoption in the $156 trillion international payment market, Ripple stands out as a promising option for both casual and serious participants. Polkadot ($DOT): Leading the Way in Multi-Chain Technology Polkadot tackles a major issue in blockchain technology: interoperability. It enables various blockchains to interact without barriers, creating an environment where decentralized applications (dApps) can prosper. Through its robust security model and adaptable parachains, Polkadot enables developers to craft scalable and secure blockchains for different needs. Its native currency, DOT, is essential for governance, staking, and bonding, promoting a decentralized, community-led ecosystem. As blockchain technology advances, Polkadot's emphasis on scalability and interconnection solidifies its role as one of the next biggest altcoins for sustainable growth.

This function is crucial for sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance, and supply chain management. The integrity and security of data are guaranteed by Chainlink's decentralized setup, making it vital for blockchain applications. LINK, its native currency, facilitates network operations and provides staking possibilities for holders. With developments like the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and increasing use across major blockchains, Chainlink is a leading contender among the next altcoins to explode. Dogecoin ($DOGE): From Internet Meme to Crypto Mainstay Initially created as a playful meme, Dogecoin has evolved into one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies globally. Supported by a dedicated community and endorsements from notable figures such as Elon Musk, Dogecoin has moved beyond its meme status to become a viable digital currency. DOGE's quick processing times and minimal fees make it perfect for daily transactions, including tips and small payments. Its recent integration with companies like Tesla underscores its expanding practicality. Although Dogecoin's speculative nature entails risks, its substantial community backing and growing practical applications make it a compelling option among the next biggest altcoin.

38354524,https://coingape.com/?p=231629,1735669478,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Swiss Citizens Push For Switzerland’s National Bank To Adopt Bitcoin,https://coingape.com/swiss-citizens-push-for-switzerlands-national-bank-to-adopt-bitcoin/,"Swiss citizens are advancing a new initiative to integrate Bitcoin into the financial reserves of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). This proposal has entered the official signature collection phase, aiming to secure 100,000 signatures within 18 months. If successful, the initiative will proceed to a national referendum to amend the Swiss federal constitution. Swiss Citizens Push For National Bank To Adopt Bitcoin The Swiss citizens initiative is an attempt to include Bitcoin in Article 99 (Clause 3) of the Swiss constitution which presently requires some amount of the country to be stored in gold. Bitcoin enthusiasts have suggested that Bitcoin should be considered as an instrument similar to gold. Consequently, this Switzerland amendment would entail only some changes in the wording of the constitution, yet it would have significant effects on Swiss fiscal measures. Today we officially launched the popular initiative to add #Bitcoin to the @SNB_BNS Swiss National Bank’s balance sheet. https://t.co/Y40yh9pW3X We will need the full support of our community to gather 100k signatures and make this a national referendum. Details will follow… — Giw Zanganeh (@gzanganeh) December 31, 2024 The proposal has come at the right time given the increasing interest in BTC as a reserve currency despite fears by CryptoQuant CEO that it would not come to happen especially in the US. Giw Zanganeh, the Vice President of Energy and Mining at Tether, revealed that the project has been published in the Federal Gazette and the signature collection can begin. After reaching the required number of signatures, the proposal will be forwarded to the Swiss Federal Assembly and then to a vote by the Swiss citizens. Switzerland’s History of Crypto-Friendly Policies Switzerland has been one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to the acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Since 2016, the canton known as Crypto Valley has allowed citizens to pay taxes using Bitcoin, making the region a fertile ground for blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. The progressive policy of the country towards cryptocurrencies is another reason why such an initiative may be presented. The Swiss citizens opine that incorporating Bitcoin into the SNB’s balance sheet would enhance Switzerland’s position as a financial innovation hub. Nonetheless, earlier efforts to incorporate Bitcoin into nations’ reserves, including the one by the crypto think tank 2B4CH in 2021, did not receive the desired approval. Will Bitcoin Adoption Grow in 2025? The demand for Bitcoin reserves in Switzerland by the Swiss citizens is in tune with trends highlighted by Franklin Templeton. According to Franklin Templeton’s digital assets outlook for 2025, more countries will incorporate Bitcoin into their currency reserves. ‘’Bitcoin will continue to evolve to serve as a digital store of value as more institutions and countries integrate the asset.’’ Franklin Templeton said. This growing acceptance is also visible in other countries. For instance, Donald Trump proposed a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy, German authorities and members of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council have also lately suggested including Bitcoin in their respective currencies. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in the first half of this year has also helped increase institutional demand. Challenges Ahead for the Swiss Bitcoin Initiative However, the initiative encounters numerous challenges even though the interest has been escalating. Switzerland being a neutral country does not often make changes to its constitution and the process is quite long and complicated. The proposal has to be supported and getting 100,000 verified signatures within the time limit is rather a challenging feat. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding the stability of the cryptocurrency, especially when considering it as a reserve asset comparable to stable and universally accepted assets such as gold. However, the supporters claim that due to scarcity and the lack of a central authority, Bitcoin is a perfect counterpart to traditional reserve assets.

Despite receiving charitable donations amounting to millions for his daughter's medical expenses, Blader launched the token and advised against its purchase. However, investors bought the token, leading to Blader selling half of the supply, which has been described as a 'rug pull' by some in the crypto community. In response to the backlash, Blader has committed to using his personal funds to reimburse those who lost money on $ZERO, with a reported amount of $600,000 set aside for this purpose. This situation has sparked controversy and debate within the cryptocurrency industry, with some questioning the ethics of using personal tragedy as a marketing strategy for a cryptocurrency project.

33767162,[object Object],1735669809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Touch $4.6, Here’s The Roadmap",https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-will-touch-4-6/,"In a detailed XRP price analysis on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst AlanSantana has identified a price target of around $4.68, even as XRP has extended its decline towards the $2 mark. This interesting prediction is based on resistance and support levels in the XRP price chart, which are more reliable for technical analysis. According to AlanSantana , the moment of decision (the point of no return) will signal the onset of a bullish trend for XRP, paving the way for its ascent to new all-time highs . The Roadmap to $4.68: Market Confirmation Is Key The XRP price trajectory in the past seven days has been filled with a consistent decline. According to data sourced from CoinMarketCap, XRP’s valuation has dropped approximately 10% in the last seven days alone. This downward trend has persisted into the past 24 hours, with the token experiencing an additional dip of around 1.5%. As it stands, XRP is close to breaking below the critical $2 support level, a move that could signal further bearish momentum. According to analyst AlanSantana, this ongoing retrace/correction/consolidation period can last for as long as it wants, and there is no way to determine when it will be over. Therefore, the crypto analyst’s strategy for XRP is monitoring market behavior for confirmation of a bullish breakout. He stresses the need to avoid speculation about exact dates and instead wait for tangible evidence from the market itself. With this in mind, the XRP daily candlestick timeframe chart that accompanied his analysis was highlighted by different support and resistance levels, with the highest being the $3 price level. The closest resistance level highlighted is around $2.36, which has served as a hindrance for XRP since December 17. In terms of support, the analyst highlighted supports at $1.968, $1.608, and $1.325. If XRP were to continue its decline, these support levels would serve as key points to watch for any notable response. When Will XRP Touch $4.6? The general sentiment is of an extended bull rally for cryptocurrencies in 2025, one in which XRP is expected to be a prime participant. This sentiment is echoed by AlanSantana, who noted that a strong move is still coming in. The analyst noted that the exact timing for this move cannot be predicted at this point, but the confirmation will be shown with a very high level of accuracy. After the confirmation, XRP will embark on a crazy price rally to the moon. Nonetheless, projections on the analyst’s XRP price chart point to the $4.68 price level in the middle of February 2025. This outlook relays well with projections from other crypto analysts. For instance, popular crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO recently predicted that XRP will reach a price target of $15 by May 5, 2025. Similarly, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the XRP price chart is showing a promising setup with a projected target of $11 sometime in 2025.",Uncategorized|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-31 18:30:09

Despite broader market indecision, with Bitcoin (BTC) struggling to regain upward momentum, Solana’s price action suggests strength in the face of uncertainty. Investors are closely monitoring SOL’s ability to maintain its current levels, as a breakout could set the stage for substantial gains. Related Reading: Cardano Holds Crucial Support At $0.77 – Massive Rally Ahead? Top analyst Ali Martinez recently provided technical insights highlighting Solana’s most significant support zone between $190 and $180. According to Martinez, holding above this range is crucial for SOL to sustain its bullish momentum. A solid defense of this support could attract more buyers, fueling a rally that might propel Solana to retest or surpass its recent highs. However, the entire cryptocurrency market remains on edge as Bitcoin’s struggles continue influencing sentiment across altcoins. For Solana, staying above its key support could be the foundation for a powerful upward move, but losing this zone may trigger a deeper correction. Solana Prepares For A Big Move Solana’s price action has entered a critical phase, suggesting that a significant move is on the horizon. The question remains: will it break higher or face a deeper correction? As the broader cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with uncertainty, Solana’s fate seems tightly linked to Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance, making the coming days crucial for its trajectory. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, emphasizing the importance of Solana’s support zone between $190 and $180. This range represents a key demand level that could either pave the way for a bullish surge or serve as a breaking point for a potential retracement. Martinez points out that holding above the $190 mark is essential for maintaining bullish momentum, especially as Bitcoin struggles to confirm its next direction. Solana’s short-term outlook is inextricably tied to Bitcoin’s behavior. If BTC can maintain its current levels or confirm a bullish continuation, Solana could ride the wave higher, potentially reclaiming previous highs and pushing into new territory. However, if Bitcoin falters, Solana might lose its footing and fall below the critical $180 level, opening the door for a steeper correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Within Symmetrical Pattern – Analyst Sets ETH Target Market sentiment remains indecisive as investors weigh the risks and opportunities in the current environment. For Solana, holding above the $190 mark and a stable Bitcoin could be the perfect combination to trigger a rally. Until a clear direction emerges, SOL’s price will likely remain under close scrutiny as traders anticipate the next big move. SOL Holding Strong Amid Uncertainty Solana (SOL) is trading at $194, showing resilience by holding strong above a critical supply zone that has flipped into demand. This strength comes amid widespread market uncertaintyas traders closely monitor key levels to anticipate Solana’s next move. The $190 support zone has emerged as a pivotal area, providing a foundation for potential upward momentum in the coming days. If Solana manages to maintain its position above $190, the next significant challenge lies at the $200 mark. Reclaiming $200 as a support level would be a crucial victory for bulls, signaling renewed confidence in Solana’s price action. This could trigger a swift recovery, with the potential to drive the price toward new all-time highs in the near future. However, the stakes remain high. A failure to break above and establish $200 as a support could leave Solana vulnerable to bearish pressure. In such a scenario, the price might experience a deeper correction, testing lower demand zones and shaking market sentiment further.

The anticipated Dogecoin price rally is among the top discussions, with analysts predicting a massive 600% surge to $2.28. Similarly, the XRP market cap is expected to climb to an astonishing $1.56 trillion, fueled by its growing dominance and technical breakthroughs. Adding to the excitement, BlockDAG (BDAG) has unveiled its 2025 New Year’s Raffle, offering a chance to win up to $1M USDT alongside massive BDAG bonuses. As its presale continues to grow, raising over $174 million so far, BDAG is emerging as the best crypto to buy in 2025. Analyst Predicts Massive Dogecoin Price Rally to $2.28 Dogecoin’s potential for a significant price surge has captured attention as analyst Javon Marks predicts a 600% increase to $2.28. Drawing from historical trends, Marks highlights the cryptocurrency's tendency to align with key technical indicators, such as the 1.618 Fibonacci level, during bullish phases. Past rallies in 2017 and 2021 followed similar patterns, suggesting a consistent framework for its price action. While the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, Marks’ analysis underscores Dogecoin’s resilience and growth potential, making the forecasted Dogecoin price rally a focal point for market watchers anticipating the next bullish cycle. XRP Market Cap to Breakout with a $1.56 Trillion Target Set! XRP’s market cap is attracting attention following predictions of a potential surge to $1.56 trillion, equating to a token price of $27.2. Analyst EGRAG Crypto highlights XRP’s ability to surpass key Fibonacci retracement levels, signaling room for growth in market dominance. Currently at 3.93%, XRP’s dominance could reach double digits if it maintains momentum, potentially leading to substantial market cap gains. Historical data supports this outlook, with minimal resistance at higher dominance levels, suggesting favorable conditions for XRP’s valuation. As investors monitor the XRP market cap closely, the cryptocurrency remains a focal point for those anticipating the next market rally. BlockDAG’s New Year Raffle Offers $1M Grand Prize in USDT BlockDAG has made a significant mark in the cryptocurrency market with an exceptional presale—raising $174 million and selling over 17.6 billion BDAG coins. Its value has soared by 2240%, rising from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0234 in the current batch, signaling strong market confidence. With its mainnet launch planned for 2025 and analysts forecasting a price surge to $1, BlockDAG is emerging as a strong choice for those seeking the best crypto to buy in 2025. This trajectory gains further excitement with the launch of BlockDAG’s limited-time 2025 New Year’s Raffle.

With notable developments in Chainlink, Cardano, and the emerging BlockDAG, this could be an ideal moment to investigate the best altcoins. The price of Chainlink and its ongoing integration into DeFi via oracles are garnering interest. The Cardano prediction for sustained growth is enhanced by its Hydra scaling solution and governance improvements. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing the limelight with its successful presale, accumulating over $174 million and achieving a 2240% rise in value. Its compatibility with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) increases its attractiveness. What distinguishes it even more? Its Refer & Earn scheme provides immediate USDT rewards, making BlockDAG a notable contender in the current competitive crypto market. BlockDAG: Leading with Technology and Instant USDT Rewards BlockDAG has rapidly ascended as a leading choice among the best altcoins, propelled by its groundbreaking technology and impressive presale results. The initiative has secured over $174 million, resulting in a 2240% value increase to date. More than 17.6 billion BDAG coins have been sold, attracting both group and individual participants. Currently valued at $0.0234 in its 26th batch, BlockDAG's coins are highly sought after, demonstrating confidence in its long-term prospects. Its dual compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) allows developers to effortlessly transition or develop decentralized applications. This robust infrastructure is engineered for rapid, scalable transactions, positioning BlockDAG as a future-oriented blockchain platform. A key feature making BlockDAG a compelling choice is its Refer & Earn program, offering immediate cashback rewards in USDT (BEP-20). Referrers receive between 6% and 10% cashback on purchases via their referral links, with rewards increasing for multiple transactions within a 24-hour window. Additionally, purchasers gain a consistent 6% cashback on each transaction, fostering loyalty and offering steady incentives for all involved. The allure of this referral program is enhanced by its simplicity and immediacy. Rewards are promptly credited in USDT, allowing participants to quickly realize the benefits of their transactions. With a low minimum purchase requirement of only $30, the program is accessible to a broad audience, making it an attractive option for acquiring BDAG coins today. BlockDAG's combination of advanced technology, attractive reward programs, and presale success solidifies its status as the best altcoin for those aiming to optimize their returns while engaging with a scalable, future-ready blockchain. Chainlink Advances Amid Expanding Network Chainlink continues to draw interest as it embeds its oracle technology more deeply within the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. Its recent alliances with entities like Swift and UBS Asset Management showcase Chainlink's role in linking conventional finance with blockchain innovations. The introduction of its Miner Extractable Value (MEV) solution is designed to reclaim profits for DeFi users, establishing Chainlink as a vital player in promoting equity and security within the ecosystem. At present, the Chainlink price stands at approximately $21.10, maintaining strong market interest amid fluctuations. Technically, Chainlink's ecosystem is growing, now including ties with significant initiatives like Aave, which is poised to integrate Chainlink's MEV solution soon. This development, combined with its proven capability to deliver secure, real-world data to blockchains, reinforces its potential for long-term relevance. As the Chainlink price approaches resistance near $23, its network enhancements underscore its escalating importance and utility. Cardano Enhances Scale and Community Engagement Cardano is strengthening its position as a scalable and community-oriented blockchain through recent enhancements. The launch of Hydra, its Layer 2 scaling solution, is set to support up to 100,000 transactions per second, which could lead to wider adoption. A recent Constitutional Convention further emphasized Cardano’s dedication to decentralization, with global representatives refining its governance framework. Current Cardano prediction models anticipate consistent growth, with prospects for the price to climb above the $1 threshold. In crypto trading, ADA is priced around $0.87, encountering resistance yet supported by a robust community. With ongoing upgrades to governance and the development of its smart contract capabilities, Cardano’s reach is extending into the DeFi and NFT markets. The latest Cardano prediction sees a promising trajectory driven by continual innovations and scalability enhancements. The Bottom Line Chainlink’s network expansion, including partnerships with names like Swift and UBS and its focus on MEV solutions, keeps the Chainlink price in focus for market watchers. Meanwhile, updates to Cardano’s Hydra scaling solution and governance mechanisms enhance its standing as a prominent blockchain, with Cardano prediction models showing potential for growth. Amid these updates, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a presale achievement of over $174 million and a 2240% surge in value. Its compatibility with both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) marks it as a technologically advanced choice among the best altcoins , while the immediate USDT rewards from its referral program offer a unique incentive to engage now.

It crushed every other investment class, climbed to insane heights, and proved once again why it’s king. Starting the year around $40,000, it more than doubled, hitting $108,000 in mid-December. How crazy is that? The launch of Bitcoin ETFs was a big reason behind the surge. These funds made it easier for investors to get in on the action. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) pulled in over $50 billion in 12 months, forcing Bloomberg to dub it the “greatest launch in ETF history.” And Bitcoin wasn’t the only winner. Ethereum ETFs hit the market in July, attracting $2 billion in just six months. Ether itself has gained nearly 50% this year, trading at about $3,400 as of press time. The Trump effect and Bitcoin’s biggest moments The U.S. presidential election was the tipping point. Donald Trump’s win over Kamala Harris lit a fire under Bitcoin. Investors saw Trump’s administration as crypto-friendly, and the market reacted. But the price action wasn’t all smooth sailing. December was rough. Profit-taking hit the market hard, and expectations of very few Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 didn’t help. Bitcoin turned red for the month, but even then, its yearly performance outshined everything else. Wall Street wasn’t left behind either. The S&P 500 rose 23% in 2024, while the Dow and Nasdaq set so many new records. AI, strong economic data, and hopes for deregulation drove those gains. Still, Bitcoin dwarfed them all, proving it’s in a league of its own. The April halving reduced block rewards for miners, and the effect was immediate. Mining stocks like Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms struggled, logging double-digit losses for the year. Miners faced tough conditions, with reduced rewards squeezing profits. But not everyone in the crypto space felt the pinch. Companies tied closely to Bitcoin saw massive gains. MicroStrategy, known for holding a ton of Bitcoin, skyrocketed 388% this year. Coinbase rallied 47%, while Robinhood went up an eye-popping 200%. MicroStrategy even got added to the Nasdaq 100 index, proving its Bitcoin bet paid off big, though it’s also ending the year with huge losses. Still, the company bought thousands of more Bitcoins just yesterday.

While Ethereum had a duller year compared to BTC, analysts predict that ETH will make a major breakthrough and surpass BTC in 2025. Steno Research stated in a recent report that they expect Ethereum to overtake Bitcoin and experience a massive rally in 2025. Steno Research analysts based their predictions for ETH on historical trends and Donald Trump's election victory in the US. Analysts also predicted a rally of more than double the current price, stating that they expect the Ethereum price to rise to at least $8,000. Analysts also added that they expect the ETH/BTC ratio to rise from the current 0.0357 to 0.06 in the next 12 months. Steno also stated that they are bullish on Bitcoin, predicting that the BTC price will reach at least $150,000 next year. Steno analysts led by Mads Eberhardt said: “This expectation for Ethereum is based on the argument that Donald Trump’s US presidential victory is more favorable for altcoins than Bitcoin. At this point, we expect Bitcoin's market dominance to drop from the current 58 percent to 45 percent and altcoins to experience a major rally led by ETH.” Ethereum continues to trade at $3,380 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

The meme coin market is arguably one of the most watched crypto space, and compared to the DeFi market, this sector thrives on community-driven hype. On account of this, investors are highly anticipating the high positivity that would stem from the meme coin space in 2025. Meanwhile, among several strong contenders, Pepe (PEPE) , Brett (BRETT), Shiba Inu (SHIB) , Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), and Dogwifhat (WIF) are signals as top meme coins to watch out for. However, even more anticipated is a new PayFi token called Remittix (RTX) , whose presale is already securing massive attention with nearly $1 million in revenue.

Currently, Pepe price is down by over 9% in the past month, despite hitting a peak price of $0.00002803 on the 9th of December. Currently in a weekly range of $0.00001722 and $0.00001936, it is clear that Pepe is pricing at lower levels. Besides, technical analysis on TradingView also signifies a neutral signal on its moving average, meaning Pepe coin could rise or fall in the next few weeks. However, Ali Martinez has indicated that the TD sequential presents a buy signal on PEPE’s daily chart which means that it might experience a price rebound soon. Brett price dips after surpassing crucial resistance but bullish predictions holds After surpassing the $0.20 resistance, the price of Brett fell considerably below this mark, into a weekly range of $0.122 and $0.1453. This has disturbed investors’ confidence in the token’s ability for a mega pump in Q1 2025, however, many see this as a brief correction which could result in a price rebound for Brett token later.

Pengu coin maintains bullish sentiment after over 500% monthly surge After completing a 550% monthly surge to hit an all-time high of $0.05738, Pudgy Penguins have grown in popularity. Even though Pudgy Penguins only launched a few weeks ago, the Pengu coin has acquired so much positive momentum as it just got listed by Binance, ByBit, OKX, and Bithumb. As a new and bustling meme coin on the Solana ecosystem, Pudgy Penguins is gaining quite the reputation as a top meme coin to anticipate in 2025. Although Pudgy Penguins is currently trading between $0.02628 and $0.04174, Crypto GVR has predicted that the token will hit a target of $0.1 by Q1, 2025. Another top analyst, Wizard of SoHo , has highlighted the strong growth potential of Pudgy Penguins token, saying that it will most likely hit a $10B market cap despite the situation of the crypto market.

You don’t have enough Bitcoin in the marketplace. So what happens? I need to own it. My board just told me I got to get a 1% position. Okay, what do I got to do? I got to go buy a 1% position. You start buying it. It’s liquid. It’s the deepest crypto market. But it’s not super liquid. $10 billion will move that market. It just will.” Scaramucci also predicts that the US government will create a Bitcoin reserve under President-elect Donald Trump’s leadership. “Let me tell you why I think it will happen. Trump wants it to happen, and he’s got the Senate Banking Committee. [Republican US Senator] Tim Scott wants it to happen. He’s going to be the chair of the Senate Banking Committee. [Treasury Secretary nominee Scott] Bessent wants it to happen… If you’re telling me there are no Democrats that are going to vote for that, then I’ll say, Okay, then we’re not going to get it. But I don’t see that… I think there’s a lot of Democrats who will look at it and say, ‘If Bitcoin is digital gold and we have $600 billion of gold on reserve at our bank and the Federal Reserve Bank, you’re telling me we couldn’t put $75 to $100 billion of Bitcoin on reserve? And by the way, you may even liquidate some of that gold to do that. You’re saying that’s not possible?”‘ Bitcoin is trading for $94,737 at time of writing, up 3% in the last 24 hours.

The S&P 500 soared 23% between January and December 19, and over half of that came from just seven companies. According to Bespoke Investment Group, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Meta Platforms, and others contributed 13.7 percentage points to the index’s rise. Investors hoped for a broader rally after 2023’s tech-fueled recovery, but it didn’t happen. Nvidia steals the show, but not everyone wins big Nvidia, the year’s crown jewel, surged 175%. The AI giant became the third-best performer in the entire S&P 500, thanks to its dominance in artificial intelligence hardware. Traders couldn’t get enough of Nvidia’s chips, and the company’s stock proved that hype. But not all Magnificent Seven members had a banner year. Microsoft only climbed 14%, underperforming the broader market. And for a moment, it even looked like the Magnificent Seven might lose members. Earlier in 2024, some analysts floated a new “Fab Four” lineup after Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet hit rough patches. Speaking of struggles, Intel had a miserable year. The chipmaker’s stock plunged over 60%, putting it on track for its worst performance ever. Intel ended the year as the second-worst performer in the S&P 500, despite a minor rally in December when it gained 1.2% during midday trading. Profit-taking hit Nvidia late in the year, with the stock dropping 1.3% in December. But even that couldn’t erase its monster gains. The rest of the market wasn’t so lucky. A historic year for the S&P 500 The S&P 500 didn’t just have a good year, it had one of its best ever. The index hit 57 all-time highs through the year, the third-most this century and fifth-most in history. Its 23.8% year-to-date gain followed a 24.2% rally in 2023, its best two-year run since 1997 and 1998. For those doing the math, the late ‘90s comparison isn’t comforting. Back then, stocks gained 31% and 26.7% in consecutive years before adding another 19.5% in 1999. Then the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, wiping out much of the tech sector’s gains. This year, the Nasdaq Composite told a similar story. It outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, driven by tech’s unmatched strength. While the Nasdaq kept climbing in December, the Dow slipped over 5%, and the Russell 2000, focused on smaller-cap stocks, tumbled nearly 8%.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

For now though, ADA is set to start 2025 on a muted note, with the Cardano price current stuck in a short-term downwards trend channel since its recent highs. For now, key support in the $0.80 area is holding firm, but chart analysis suggests near-term price risks remain tilted to the downside. That said, the fundamental outlook for Cardano suggests that at any moment the price could blow higher. Next year, Cardano is going to heights it's never been before. We got Bitcoin DeFi, Midnight, Patnerchains, all the DApp upgrades, Midgard, and some extra magic that we'll call ""the fire rises"" pic.twitter.com/ITI6S7mHun — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 In a recent tweet, the blockchain’s co-founder Charles Hoskinson highlighted exciting updates coming for ADA in 2025. The pivot to becoming a major Bitcoin DeFi chain could be a particularly potent narrative, with Bitcoin potentially on the verge of skyrocketing next year should a US-ignited global race to accumulate the asset kick off amongst nation states. However, its not just blockchain upgrades that could support the ADA price going into 2025. The crypto is set to benefit from tailwinds that could send the entire crypto market skyrocketing. Here’s how high the Cardano price could go in 2025. Cardano Price Prediction – Here’s How High It Could Go in 2025 Trump’s election victory last month triggered a stunning rally in crypto markets at the time, as investors anticipate a 180 degree shift in US crypto policy. The current administration and its allies at the SEC , such as Chairman Gary Gensler, have done all they could to stifle and kill innovation in the US crypto industry. By contrast, the incoming Trump administration is full of pro-crypto industry advocates and allies, signaling we are at the cusp of entering a new golden age for crypto in the USA. That’s great for Bitcoin, especially if the US government starts accumulating BTC for a strategic Bitcoin reserve . But it could be even better for altcoins like Cardano, which have been beaten down for years amid US regulatory uncertainty. There is the possibility that Charles Hoskinson might actually end up being a White House advisor, giving all the biggest ADA advocates direct access to President Trump’s ear, and the future is looking good for Cardano in 2025. So, if a bullish breakout is imminent, how high could we see the Cardano price surge? Well, when ADA hit its record highs above $3 back in 2021, it had nearly rallied to its 2.618 Fibonacci extension above its 2018 record highs at $1.30. If it can match this performance in 2025 and hit its 2.618 Fibonacci retracement back from its 2023 lows beyond its 2021 highs, that would imply an ADA price high of around $8. That said, Cardano investors need to be cautious. Cardano’s on-chain metrics need to show some better signs of growth if the crypto is to rally 10x from current levels. Per DeFi Llama , crypto worth only around $440 million is locked in smart contracts on Cardano. That hardly one third of 1% of the total value of all crypto locked in DeFi smart contracts, most of which is on chains like Ethereum and Solana . If Cardano is to maintain its status as a leading altcoin, on-chain adoption needs to accelerate in 2025.

Table of Contents The SHIB army faces an uphill battle after daily burn rate skyrockets Why is privacy-focused cryptocurrency 1FUEL set to be the most in-demand altcoin of 2025? The hottest cryptocurrency presale of 2024 is happening right now December has been a disappointing month for the SHIB army, thanks to a steady slide backwards. It’s given up 21.27% since 01 December, meaning the door is open for another altcoin to step into the limelight. With a white hot presale and expected returns in excess of 500% ahead of its public launch, read on to find out why the privacy-focused cryptocurrency 1FUEL is the leading contender for altcoin supremacy in 2025. You might also like: Bonk and WIF to be outshone by new altcoin 1Fuel, say experts The SHIB army faces an uphill battle after daily burn rate skyrockets After a year that has been overwhelmingly positive for the SHIB army, its stringent supporters will no doubt be a little put out that 2024 is ending on a negative note with December looking likely to end in negative territory. The meme coin has been in a downward pattern for much of the month, with the decline starting around the 8 th of the month. SHIB prices were trading strongly around the $0.000034 marker on 08 December but were down to $0.000024 just two days later. SHIB prices fell further on 20 December to a monthly low of $0.000019 . Further hindering SHIB’s ability to recover before 2025 arrives is a massive 972.96% increase in the daily burn rate. This burn, which took place on 29 th December, may well secure SHIB’s return to its all-time-high of $0.000090 in the longer term, but has done little to steady its price losses this month. While this may not be enough to convince the always vocal SHIB army to turn their allegiance elsewhere, it could be enough to push the SHIB whales towards a new altcoin. With its ultra secure crypto wallet and unrivalled one-click, cross-chain transaction technology, 1FUEL is the clear frontrunner. Why is privacy-focused cryptocurrency 1FUEL set to be the most in-demand altcoin of 2025? 1FUEL is currently in stage two of its viral presale and is commanding attention – and investment – from across the crypto industry. Its unique value proposition is founded on advanced levels of privacy and security and an unprecedented solution to the typical cross-chain transaction complexity. Together, these features promise to revolutionise access to the blockchain for millions of underserved and overlooked groups worldwide. At the heart of 1FUEL’s massive investor appeal is its unique technology. Its advanced system, which is partially powered by cutting-edge AI technology, allows users to manage, move and trade their digital assets with a single click across multiple networks. Its technology handles the whole transaction, removing the burden of manual exchanges, swaps and complicated fee structures. This isn’t just a time-saving convenience, it removes the main barriers to adoption that lock millions of people out of digital asset management each year. The unique one-click technology is enormously accessible – more so than anything seen on the blockchain to date. Backed up with an abundance of enhanced security and privacy features – including a temporary secure crypto wallet, a built-in privacy mixer, P2P exchange and accessible cold storage – it’s easy to see why 1FUEL is expected to be a runaway success when it launches publicly. The hottest cryptocurrency presale of 2024 is happening right now 1FUEL’ s cryptocurrency presale is on now, with more than $940,925 raised so far. It is already shaping up to give SHIB and other altcoins serious competition in 2025, with investors flocking to stage 2 of the presale. Experts expect presale returns to exceed 500%, with 100x returns on public launch. Interested investors who join now could also earn staking rewards of up to 30% APR.

Musk shared an image of his laptop with a dollar bill sticker bearing a Dogecoin-dog logo. The post immediately sparked debate about the possible hints Musk could suggest to the crypto community. What is Fueling the Speculation? Notably, George Washington’s face has graced the $1 bill since 1896, but the picture Musk shared is of a Shiba Inu dog breed. According to Musk, the picture has been in his possession for approximately three years as a gift. “This is a pic of my laptop. It’s about 3 years old. A guy in Germany gave me this cool sticker, so I don’t want to upgrade it and lose the sticker,” he wrote. The bill has the inscription “Dogecoin Reserve Note” at the top. This has made many in the community speculate about the possibility of a Dogecoin (DOGE) reserve soon. The speculations stem from Musk’s previous posts that support the memecoin. Dogecoin’s Growing Influence on Musk’s Ties Aside from sharing memes about DOGE, his car manufacturing company, Tesla, accepts DOGE as a payment method for some of its products. Hence, sharing the Dogecoin Reserve Note in a post to his over 209 million followers understandably caused a stir, particularly for crypto enthusiasts. Additionally, Elon Musk’s deliberate choice of portfolio, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) under Trump’s presidency, further fuels the positive sentiment for DOGE. The department has gained support from notable crypto stakeholders. And, each time his position receives a mention, it directs some attention to the memecoin. Analysts maintain that such a subtle support could drive up market sentiments and trigger a price rally. Interestingly, Musk made a cryptic statement last month, “Starting to feel like ’The DOGE has real potential’ on Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E).” Market Sentiment and Price Impact What Musk might have planned or if DOGE will benefit the incoming administration remains uncertain. However, his attention to the token could push it toward a price rally. As of this writing, DOGE is exchanging hands at $0.3245, a 4.44% increase in the last 24 hours. Its market volume has recorded an uptick of 15.99% to $2.5 billion. The community looks forward to more gains in the days ahead.

Private In 2021, Francisco Chavarria stood in the audience at Bitcoin 2021 and watched as Strike CEO Jack Mallers passionately delivered his now famous keynote speech during which he revealed that El Salvador planned to make bitcoin legal tender. That moment sparked something within Chavarria. “It was unlike anything I’d experienced in my professional career,” Chavarria told Bitcoin Magazine. “I knew I had to do something in the Bitcoin space after that. It was the seed,” he added. First-forward ahead two years, and Chavarria found himself putting his career as a Software as a Service (SaaS) consultant on hold to draw up the blueprints for Yopaki , a neobank and investment app with a Bitcoin-focus, aimed at serving the people of his home country, Mexico. (Users outside of Mexico can also use Yopaki’s non-custodial Lighting wallet.) Since then, he and his co-founder, Carlos Chida, have been hard at work bringing Yopaki to life, including taking part in Wolf’s Bitcoin Accelerator program in efforts to make Yopaki as cutting-edge and dynamic as possible. But before getting to that part of the story, let’s start with the cultural origin of the platform’s name. What’s In A Name? “The name Yopaki comes from the ancient language Nahuatl, the language spoken by the Aztecs,” explained Chavarria. “The Aztecs lived in the center region of what today is Mexico, and they're the ones responsible for some of the biggest pyramids in all of Latin America. The center of this historical place is called Teotihuacán, ‘the place of the gods,’” he added. “The name itself, if I were to translate it into English, most closely means “the pursuit of happiness.’” Judging by the name alone, it’s clear that Chavarria views Yopaki as more than just another business endeavor — he wants it to have a profound impact on those who use it. And he’ll need the app to have such an impact if he and his team are to succeed in their mission: to turn every Mexican into a Bitcoiner. 2025 Dream Predictions for Bitcoin in Mexico 🇲🇽😶‍🌫️ 1. Bitcoin adoption in Mexico surges. 2. Mexican Bitcoin startups attract global investors. With El Salvador’s influence, Mexico becomes the Latin American leader for Bitcoin innovation. 3. Peso-Bitcoin integration deepens.… — Francisco Chavarria (@FranciscoBTC) December 31, 2024 Bitcoin In The Mexican Context When Bitcoin is brought up in the context of Latin America and other developing regions, it’s often referenced as a tool to “bank the unbanked.” However, Mexico’s banking system is “quite advanced,” according to Chavarria. “The infrastructure has been built for people to have access to banking,” he explained. “It may not be the same banking that we have in the U.S. (where Chavarria currently resides), but, for example, in Mexico, there are stores like 7/11s called OXXOs, and they’re everywhere. Any person can walk into an OXXO with an ID, and within 20 minutes, they can walk out with a Visa card and an app,” he added. “It’s not exactly a bank, but it provides access to payment rails,” he added. Chavarria went on to share that these Visa cards charge high fees, though. “They’re very predatory in that sense,” he said. So, Yopaki provides its Mexican users with access to three different monetary accounts: a Mexican peso account, a U.S. dollar account and a (non-custodial) bitcoin Lightning wallet. Each of these accounts lets their users transact at lower rates than said Visa cards. (In 2025, Yopaki will also enable its Mexican users to buy stocks, ETFs and other securities, as well.) By offering a bitcoin wallet alongside accounts for traditional currencies, Chavarria hopes to legitimize bitcoin in the eyes of its users. However, he also feels that Yopaki has some work to do as far as helping Mexicans to get comfortable using bitcoin, which is why he and his team are doing what they can to make the process enjoyable. Making Bitcoin Fun With Lotería Lotería is a favorite pastime of the Mexican people. It’s comparable to Bingo but with images instead of numbers. Chavarria and the Yopaki team included it into the app with a Bitcoin slant — concepts and characters like the Lightning Network and Max Keiser appear in the Yopaki version of the game. “When it comes to Mexico, people think tequila, tacos, mariachi, and Lotería ,” said Chavarria. “There’s no negative connotation to the game. Because of this, the feedback we've received over the last couple of months has been, ‘Man, I didn't realize that Bitcoin was fun,’” he added. Users earn sats as they play Lotería within the app. When they’ve earned 1,000 sats or more, they can learn through the app how to transfer those sats from Yopaki’s custody into their own, all within the Yopaki app. Yopaki teamed up with Breez to bring its users a non-custodial Lightning wallet that doesn’t require its users to to deal with the hassle of Lightning channel management. Yopaki + Breez “One of the main reasons we decided to go with Breez is that we knew about their implementation of the Nodeless SDK through Liquid before it was public,” said Chavarria. “We know channel management is a fundamental roadblock for a lot of people in using an application like this. The second you introduce roadblocks the experience becomes scary. It’s just too much,” he added. “So, in offering a product in which users can do an immediate transaction, that magic that we've all had as Bitcoiners can be brought to the masses.” Chavarria went on to share that Yopaki’s Lightning wallet is so easy to use that even his mother-in-law is now using (and enjoying) the product. He’s excited to bring such a product to the Mexican market, because, as he put it, Mexicans “have been rugged” by custodial solutions in the past. “It’s important that we let users know that we don’t hold their funds,” said Chavarria. Prioritizing Bitcoin Education Not only does the Yopaki team encourage and prioritize self-sovereignty, but it also educates its users about Bitcoin, as it doesn’t underestimate their curiosity and ability to learn. “We have curated content including lessons on broad topics like ‘What is money?’ — not just Bitcoin, but money,” explained Chavarria. “They're micro lessons that take anywhere from one to two minutes to complete. At the end of the day, it's about creating a curiosity that I feel and I think a lot of us feel the legacy system has not really cared about,” he added. The educational component within the app also sets it apart from its competitors in the region. “Bitso is the largest player not just in Mexico but all of Latin America, and we have a lot of respect for what they've done, but they have turned into a casino with tokens and NFTs and all of that,” shared Chavarria. “We believe they have really underestimated the curiosity of their users and just triggered the degenerate gambling addiction side of things instead.” Guidance From Wolf Given how cool, calm and collected Chavarria was when I spoke with him, I got the impression that the now fleshed out vision for Yopaki came to him with relative ease, maybe even in a flash of light. But he told me otherwise. Apparently, he and Chida’s experience at Wolf’s Bitcoin startup incubator pushed them out of their comfort zone and into a state of mind that helped them to make Yopaki as unique as it is. “It was one of the most important and meaningful experiences we could have gone through,” said Chavarria of his time at Wolf. “The type of feedback we received and the type of strategy sessions we had were, to say it nicely, brutal in a good way.” Chavarria explained how he and Chida did, in fact, enter the Wolf program thinking they’d already crafted a solid vision for Yopaki, but that the guidance they received in the program is what pushed them to create many of the features that differentiate the apps for others like it. “Having people like Kelly Brewster (Wolf’s CEO), who has years of experience at Goldman Sachs, and Ross Stevens (Wolf’s founder) really sit down and ask the tough questions and push you to the limit was powerful,” said Chavarria. “They made us really consider ‘Do you understand that what you're doing is difficult?’ and made us articulate how we were going to execute our plan.” The Year Ahead As mentioned, Yopaki will enable its Mexican users to begin investing in traditional assets in the coming year and, starting next month, it will offer users a bitcoin exchange, as well. What is more, it will issue its users debit cards that they can use to spend their pesos, dollars or bitcoin. And Chavarria says it plans to offer sats back rewards when users purchase either traditional assets or bitcoin via the app. With so much coming down the pike, Chavarria is in good spirits. “I'm just grateful that we're doing this,” he said. “It's been really fun to build in the bear — now the good times are coming.”",Lightning Implementation|Breez|Yopaki|Bitcoin Education|Breez SDK|Mexico|Founders|Culture|Business|Education|Lightning network|Lightning,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin Magazine', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinmagazine.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinmagazine,2024-12-31 19:25:04

This came as she revealed that the crypto has found its local bottom. XRP Price Rebound To $2.60 On The Cards In an X post, CasiTrades predicted that the XRP price could rebound to $2.60. She stated that XRP had found its local bottom and held strong without making a new low below Wave C. She remarked that this is key for the D wave. While analyzing the sub-waves left in the D wave, CasiTrades stated that her next targets are $2.25 and $2.40. She expects this wave to extend toward $2.40, with the final 5th subwave reaching $2.60 to complete the D wave. The analyst added that she would closely watch how the subwaves form and how the price behaves around $2.60. CasiTrades also mentioned that a resistance at $2.60 is expected, but there is a chance that the E wave will fail and XRP will push into new highs earlier than expected. Meanwhile, the analyst’s accompanying chart showed that XRP could dip to $2.3 on the E wave and then rebound to as high as $2.80. This rebound to $2.80 could then pave the way for the crypto to rally to new highs. Crypto analysts like Ali Martinez have also provided a bullish outlook for the XRP price heading into the new year. The crypto analyst predicted that the crypto could rally to as high as $11 in 2025. Analysis Of The Bull Market Support Band In an X post , crypto analyst Egrag Crypto provided an in-depth analysis of the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB). He stated that the bulls are fiercely defending the BMSB. The analyst noted that when the BSMB surpasses $2, it signifies a strategic advantage. In line with this, he remarked that as long as the XRP price remains above $2, the BMSB should ideally catch up and stabilize above this level. Egrag Crypto further remarked that achieving this would be a tremendous gift at the start of 2025, demonstrating that the Bears are unable to push prices below $2 due to the strong defense from the Bulls. The crypto analyst has high expectations for the XRP price in 2025, predicting that the crypto could reach $27 next year. He explained that such a parabolic rally could happen since XRP witnessed a 50,000% in 2017.

Changpeng Zhao is also set to take a more active role, personally engaging with investment projects in 2025. The venture capital firm has stated that it will prioritize necessities for long-term impact as it moves into 2025, leaning more towards crypto, AI, and biotech. Binance Labs will build on more AI, blockchain, and biotech projects in 2025 Binance Labs has announced plans to reconfigure its brand in 2025. In a series of posts on X on December 31, the venture capital firm clarified that it’s seeking long-term impact moving into 2025 and beyond. It also emphasized its commitment to supporting founders who believe in their long-term vision. Moreover, the firm has decided to focus more on crypto, artificial intelligence, and biotech in 2025, aiming to have innovations in these fields. As they push through with their restructuring process, they foresee improvement in their least-performing sectors, such as gaming, ZK technologies, and privacy solutions. Additionally, the firm is looking to secure more secondary liquid deals, OTC aside from primary market deals. They emphasized that they are “chain-agnostic” and hence will invest across all stages of a deal. They also expect DeSci, RWAs/Stablecoins, and AI agents to perform better in 2025. To Binance Labs 2025 will be a year of innovation and development especially since it’s the year of the wood snake. The wood element represents growth and creativity, hinting at positive development for the company. The incoming Trump administration has also made the company optimistic about a far more friendlier crypto environment, believing it will augment investor and institutional interest in virtual assets. Changpeng Zhao will engage with investment projects at Binance Labs Binance Labs said it will seek projects that have real-world applications, strong teams, well-defined roadmaps, and sustainable business models moving forward. They stated they would also maintain a diverse portfolio across Telegram, Solana, Ethereum, and major Ethereum L2s. Not to mention they will continue making investments in Berachain, Monad, Initia, Stacks, Celestia, and Bittensor, with roughly 20% of their investment funds emanating from their MVB program. Changpeng Zhao is also expected to return to the crypto space, engaging with the company’s investment projects on a personal level, and maintaining interactions with existing and new founders. Zhao had previously predicted bullish results for Bitcoin and multiple other crypto assets in 2025, claiming increased adoption and technological advances will be the key drivers of future growth.

In a lengthy new thread on the social media platform X, crypto software developer Jeffy Yu says that Zerebro ( ZEREBRO ) is building a consumer facing launchpad for AI agents. “We are building Zentients, a consumer facing launchpad for agents… The exact details are still being finalized. But we want to keep the framework simple: Agents will require ZEREBRO for a creation fee and will be launched on a ZEREBRO bonding curve with fees. Once a certain valuation is met by the agent token, the token graduates [and] the liquidity from the bonding curve is deposited and locked into a DEX. Afterwards, traders buy and sell into the live liquidity pool with ZEREBRO.” News of the expansion sent ZEREBRO soaring. The digital asset went from a low of $0.410 on December 30th to its current price of $0.684, a gain of about 66%. Other notable additions planned for Zerebro include a standardized communications protocol for AI agents, web2 capabilities for the agents, decentralized GPU rentals, the ability for individuals to host their own agents, as well as multi-agent intelligence. According to Yu, Zerebro uses a unique financial model where all of its tokens are already in circulation. “ZEREBRO is unique in the sense that all of its tokens are in circulation, so we are not building ‘tokenomics’ in the traditional sense, which governs how tokens are emitted, distributed, and vested over time. Rather, this is a framework for value accrual powered by the Zerebro Stack, which is comprised of three parts: A) Zerebro, our main agent B) ZerePy, our agent framework C) Zentients, our consumer agent launchpad.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The Russian news agency Interfax reports that Russia’s top financial institution , Sberbank, is now a participant in the program, which conducts transactions with digital rubles. The pilot will eventually involve 22 banks. TBank and Tochka Bank also joined with Sberbank, according to Interfax, which reports that the digital ruble is expected to gradually move into widespread use starting in July. Russian President Vladimir Putin greenlit the creation of a CBDC in 2023. Reuters reported earlier this month that the Russian government has also recently taken legislative measures to legalize Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining and other crypto assets, helping Russian firms find ways around sanctions. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the news outlet that more Russian firms would use Bitcoin for international payments in 2025. “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use Bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further.” Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the US government was undermining the use of the US dollar as a reserve currency, forcing nations to turn to other assets. He cited Bitcoin as the top replacement for the US dollar as a reserve asset, noting that no nation could regulate it. However, Russian authorities also reportedly plan to prohibit cryptocurrency mining in 10 regions and impose seasonal restrictions in three others beginning January 1st, amid growing concerns over energy shortages.

The proposal, spearheaded by Giw Zanganeh , Vice President of Energy and Mining at Tether, aims to modernize the country’s reserve portfolio by including BTC alongside its $27 billion gold holdings. Today we officially launched the popular initiative to add #Bitcoin to the @SNB_BNS Swiss National Bank’s balance sheet. https://t.co/Y40yh9pW3X We will need the full support of our community to gather 100k signatures and make this a national referendum. Details will follow… — Giw Zanganeh (@gzanganeh) December 31, 2024 Published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesblatt) today, the initiative begins its signature collection phase, requiring 100,000 handwritten endorsements from Swiss citizens by June 30, 2025. If successful, the Swiss Federal Assembly will review the amendment, potentially positioning Switzerland as a global leader in Bitcoin adoption. The SNB’s current reserves are highly diversified, including fiat currencies and approximately 1,040 tons of gold. Advocates argue that adding BTC offers a robust hedge against inflation and aligns with Switzerland’s reputation for financial innovation. Unlike a similar 2021 initiative that fell short, this proposal gains momentum amidst global interest in BTC as a strategic reserve asset. Global Trends in Bitcoin Reserves Switzerland’s move mirrors growing interest among nations to include Bitcoin in their financial strategies. In the U.S., discussions are underway to establish a strategic BTC reserve. Germany’s former finance minister, Christian Lindner, has also pushed for Bitcoin adoption within the European Central Bank (ECB) and Germany’s national reserves. The proposed amendment would require minimal legislative changes, adding just two to three words to Clause 3 of Article 99, stating that reserves must include BTC alongside gold. Proponents highlight the low-risk, high-reward potential of this inclusion, which could significantly impact Bitcoin’s credibility on a global scale. Switzerland, already recognized as a crypto pioneer, has laid the groundwork for such an initiative. Its canton of Zug—dubbed “Crypto Valley”—introduced Bitcoin payments for government services as early as 2016, showcasing the nation’s proactive stance on blockchain technology. Bitcoin Price Outlook Amid National Reserve Talks Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading at $93,840, down 0.19% in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $1.86 trillion, supported by a 24-hour trading volume of $50.06 billion, Bitcoin remains a key player in global finance. Its circulating supply stands at 19.8 million BTC, nearing the maximum limit of 21 million coins. Technically, Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $95,190, with further levels at $96,000 and $98,360. On the downside, critical support lies at $92,100, with deeper protection at $89,610. Trading below its 50 EMA at $94,850 indicates short-term bearish momentum, while the RSI at 48 reflects neutral market conditions. A breakout above $95,190 could signal bullish potential, while a breach below $92,100 risks accelerating declines. Key Insights: Bitcoin Reserves : Swiss proposal targets adding Bitcoin to $1.03 trillion SNB reserves, alongside $27 billion in gold. Market Sentiment : Global Bitcoin interest rises; U.S. and Germany explore similar reserve strategies. Technical Levels : Bitcoin faces resistance at $95,190, with support at $92,100 and RSI at 48.02 signaling consolidation.

The extradition was confirmed today by local news outlet Vijesti, citing a statement from the Montenegrin Ministry of Justice. “Today, at the Podgorica Airport border gate, South Korean citizen Kwon Do-Hyung, who was wanted by two countries, South Korea and the United States, was extradited by NCB Interpol Podgorica authorities with the support of the special police unit,” the ministry said. Kwon, the former CEO of Terraform Labs, was handed over to US law enforcement and FBI agents following a decision by the Montenegrin Justice Ministry. The move marks the culmination of months of legal proceedings in Montenegro, where Kwon faces rival extradition requests from the US and South Korea. Related News: South Korea's Cryptocurrency Exchanges Announce Joint Decision to Delist This Altcoin Do Kwon faces multiple charges in the United States, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud, money laundering and wire fraud, in connection with his role in the collapse of algorithmic stablecoins and cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and LUNA, which wiped out billions of dollars in investor funds. The extradition comes after Montenegrin Justice Minister Bojan Božović signed the decision to extradite Kwon to the United States after receiving approval from the Montenegrin Constitutional Court on Friday. In September, Montenegro’s Constitutional Court ruled that the final decision on Kwon’s extradition would be made by the Justice Minister. The decision to send Kwon to the US was influenced by the seriousness of the charges, where the crimes were committed, the order of the extradition requests and the potential for further extraditions, the ministry said. *This is not investment advice.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI.

Bitcoin Is Still At A Notable Gap From Short-Term Holder Cost Basis In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the trend in the profit-loss status of the Bitcoin short-term holders. The indicator of relevance here is the “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio,” which keeps track of the ratio between BTC’s Market Cap and its Realized Cap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Now Worst Since Mid-October: Reversal Signal? The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model for the cryptocurrency that assumes the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the last transfer of any coin is likely to correspond to the last instance of it changing hands, the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap is nothing, but the sum of the capital that the investors as a whole have used to purchase the cryptocurrency. In contrast, the Market Cap represents the value that the holders are carrying right now. As the MVRV Ratio compares these two models, its value tells us about the profit-loss situation of the network. The traditional MVRV Ratio measures this for the entire market, but the version of the metric that’s of interest in the current topic is that specifically for the short-term holders (STHs), investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio over the past year or so: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin STH MVRV Ratio spiked to notable levels above the 1 mark when the recent leg up in the BTC rally took place. The indicator being above this value implies the Market Cap of the group is greater than its Realized Cap, and so, the average member is in a state of profit. Recently, as the decline in the cryptocurrency’s price has occurred, the indicator has naturally gone down. Its value still remains above the 1 level, though, suggesting profits held by the cohort still outweigh the losses. At present, the STH MVRV Ratio is sitting at 1.08, which corresponds to the group holding unrealized gains of around 8%. Historically, the STHs have shown to represent the fickle-minded side of the market that easily participates in selloffs, so their being in large profits has tended to be a danger sign for the price. The cohort is no longer making significant profits after the drawdown, but perhaps a cooldown may need to happen if the risk of profit-taking has to go away. A metric that makes it convenient to track when this could happen is the “Realized Price,” which is derived from the Realized Cap by dividing it with the total number of tokens in circulation. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst From the chart, it’s visible that the STH Realized Price has a value of $86,800 right now, which means the group will be just breaking-even on its investment if Bitcoin falls to this level. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly fell under the $92,000 level yesterday, but the coin has found a small rebound as its price is now trading around $94,500.

This transfer was made on December 30. “Blockchain Bandit” Returns In the latest update , prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT revealed that the consolidation originated from 10 wallets, which have been dormant for almost two years, with the last activity being flagged in January 2023. Alongside the Ether transfer, 470 BTC were also moved. The Blockchain Bandit earned infamy between 2016 and 2018 through an insidious technique called “ Ethercombing .” By exploiting cryptographic vulnerabilities, the attacker systematically guessed weak private keys, which were often generated by faulty random number algorithms or misconfigured wallets. This method allowed the malicious entity to steal more than 45,000 ETH across 49,060 transactions by compromising 732 private keys. While brute-forcing private keys is generally deemed improbable due to their vast numerical range, the Bandit capitalized on predictable flaws such as non-random key generation and poorly implemented recovery phrases. Cybersecurity analysts suggest that state-sponsored actors, possibly North Korean hacker groups, could be behind the attacks, noting parallels with other large-scale crypto thefts. Such groups are known to target cryptocurrency platforms to fund illicit operations, including weapons programs. The Bandit’s recent activity – coupled with the use of multi-signature wallets – signals preparations for potentially laundering the funds through mixers or decentralized exchanges to obscure their origins. From Fake Meetings to Seed Phrase Traps This attacker’s resurgence comes amid a wider uptick in crypto cybercrime as fraudsters develop new strategies to ensnare unsuspecting targets. Earlier this month, hackers were reported to have exploited fake Zoom meeting links to target crypto users and steal sensitive credentials as well as digital assets. SlowMist traced the malware’s code to Russian-linked operatives, revealing over $1 million converted to ETH. Another scam targeted opportunistic thieves by sharing seed phrases of fake crypto wallets. Once accessed, the wallets demand TRX for transaction fees, rerouting funds to scammers instead. Kaspersky warns that this scheme, disguised as a beginner’s mistake, manipulates thieves into becoming victims of their own greed.

Welcome to the world of meme coins, where culture meets crypto, and the BTFD Coin presale is blazing a trail that every investor is itching to follow. With Shiba Inu (SHIB) and SPX6900 (SPX) already making waves, the next big question isn’t “when” but “what” to invest in. The spotlight is on BTFD Coin, a next-gen meme coin redefining presales with its bold approach, unique Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and thriving community. As it enters the 13th stage of its presale, the buzz is undeniable. But how does it compare to meme coin juggernauts like Shiba Inu and SPX6900? Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin: Turning Dips into Dominance In a market where every dip sparks panic, BTFD Coin flips the script. Inspired by the iconic trading mantra “Buy the Dip,” this meme coin is all about making downturns work for you. And with over 60 billion coins sold to 7000+ bulls, it’s not just a crypto project—it’s a movement. BTFD Coin’s presale, currently in its 13th stage, has already raised $4.7 million, with coins priced at $0.000142. But it’s not just about numbers. The heart of BTFD lies in its utility and vision. BTFD Coin offers robust staking rewards, a high-octane P2E game, and a tokenomics model designed to empower its community. Don’t miss the chance to grab 50% extra BTFD coins by using the BIG50 code during your purchase. For example, if you invest $4,000 at the Stage 13 price of $0.000142 per coin, you’ll receive 42,253,521 coins after applying the BIG50 bonus. When the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $25,352.11, giving you a profit of $21,352.11. It’s an easy and exciting way to maximise your returns. Imagine leading a digital charge as part of the Bulls Squad in the BTFD P2E game, smashing through levels, and unlocking rewards. The excitement is palpable while the beta version is live (minus rewards for now). The game brings a fresh twist to meme coins, integrating entertainment and community engagement like never before. Whether you’re tackling challenging levels or inviting friends to join, the BTFD game ensures that every interaction adds value to the ecosystem.

It’s a masterclass in how to rally a community around a shared vision. Shiba Inu: The Dog That Rules the Pack When it comes to meme coins, Shiba Inu needs no introduction. Launched as a playful homage to Dogecoin, SHIB has grown into a full-fledged ecosystem with its own decentralised exchange, ShibaSwap, and projects spanning NFTs, gaming, and beyond. Shiba Inu captured the crypto community’s imagination with its explosive growth and a loyal following that refers to itself as the “ShibArmy.” Over the years, it has become more than a meme coin, evolving into a platform that promotes decentralisation and accessibility. For crypto enthusiasts, SHIB isn’t just a token—it’s a statement. SHIB’s appeal lies in its ecosystem. From staking rewards on ShibaSwap to the upcoming Shibarium layer-2 blockchain, Shiba Inu continues to innovate. The token’s versatility and vibrant community make it a go-to choice for both new and seasoned investors. While SHIB’s journey from a meme to a mainstream crypto asset is impressive, it serves a different purpose than BTFD Coin. Shiba Inu has matured into a more complex project, but the simplicity and focused vision of BTFD sets it apart in the current meme coin frenzy. SPX6900: A New Challenger with Big Ambitions SPX6900, affectionately dubbed SPX, is another player in the meme coin space that’s turning heads. Known for its bold branding and playful take on crypto culture, SPX is carving a niche among meme coin enthusiasts. SPX thrives on its vibrant community, which rallies around its irreverent humour and meme-driven campaigns. But it’s not just all fun and games. SPX has built credibility with strategic partnerships and integrations that hint at its long-term potential. While SPX started as a meme, it’s gradually exploring use cases beyond speculation. Its foray into decentralised applications and NFTs adds a layer of credibility, making it more than just a fleeting trend. Don’t Miss The Best Meme Coin Presales to Invest in for Short Term Gains Based on our deep dive into the world of meme coins, it’s clear that each project has its strengths. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and SPX6900’s cultural appeal are undeniably impressive. But when it comes to the best meme coin presales to invest in for short term gains, BTFD Coin is in a league of its own.

Have you been monitoring the crypto market and wondering how some early entries yielded significant returns? Or have you ever regretted missing out on presale events that later soared in value, wishing you had participated earlier? Crypto presales present an exclusive opportunity to engage at the ground level, often at significantly lower than their future prices. Don’t worry! This guide highlights the top presales that are not only full of promise but also brimming with features that might lead to remarkable results. From BlockDAG and 5thScape to Flockerz, these emerging crypto projects could revolutionize the future of digital currencies. Let’s explore how these altcoins with the most potential for 2025 stand out and why they deserve attention. 1.

Experts believe BlockDAG could realize a future ROI of 20,000x, making it one of the top altcoins with the most potential for 2025. 2. 5thScape (5SCAPE): Merging Virtual Reality with Blockchain Next in our rundown of altcoins with the most potential is 5thScape (5SCAPE), which is transforming digital interactions through its extensive VR ecosystem.

Via its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), participants directly influence the project’s direction while receiving rewards for their involvement. This method cultivates a dedicated community and encourages ongoing development. Beyond the incentives for voting, Flockerz provides staking options, offering participants a chance to earn passively while bolstering the ecosystem.

Speaking on X, Charles Hoskinson addressed what appears as some community members’ emotional blackmail in general conversations. He reiterated his contributions to the Cardano ecosystem and how he has avoided cash grab at the expense of the ecosystem. The ‘Last Duty’ For Cardano According to Charles Hoskinson, he has never deviated from the original roadmap over the 10 years he has contributed to the ecosystem. With the launch of the Chang hard fork upgrade, he said Cardano is now in the hands of the community members. Drawing on this, he confirmed that his last “duty is to remove any roadblock for this transition, and there is no way in hell anyone or thing is going to derail that process.” One of the most important things to get the Voltaire Age running is the budget and constitution approval. Despite the urgency, a Whistleblower once called out the Cardano Foundation for stalling the approval process. However, Charles Hoskinson said these two have to gain approval next year. Thereafter, he said he will oversee this achieved “regardless of the personal, economic, or professional consequences.” He is optimistic that in no time, the community can truly decide the future of Cardano and the sacrifices will be worth it at the end. For those who know me well, this statement is nothing new, but for the rest of the peanut gallery, when there is a debate, argument, or disagreement, things are reciprocal. Stick to the facts and the merit of the debate. If you cross personal and professional lines, you might… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 31, 2024 Benefit for ADA Price Beyond the cost and uncertainty that is associated with the decentralized governance, achieving it might set up ADA price for bigger growth. At the time of writing, Cardano price was changing hands for $0.8483, down by 2.78% in 24 hours. With the coin caught up in the volatility of New Year’s Eve, expert predicts projects ADA return to the ATH of $3.099 in the New Year. With the plans Cardano Founder and other developer bodies have for the protocol, the fundamentals to drive this growth are enormous.

To read full editions, subscribe . As we close out a historic year for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, some crypto-related equities are poised to end 2024 well into the green. Here’s a round-up of some of the best performers: Coinbase COIN shares started the year around $156. The stock rallied into the high-$200s in March, coinciding with bitcoin’s run-up to what was then a new all-time high of around $73,000. COIN’s big breakout came in the latter half of the year, though. Shares gained 67% between election night and Nov. 11, a sign investors saw Trump’s win as a major turning point for the industry. Boutique equity research firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. raised its price target for the exchange from $245 to $390 earlier this month. Analysts cited the Trump Administration’s potential plan to create a strategic bitcoin reserve as a positive catalyst for Coinbase’s custody services. COIN shares were up 58% year to date (to ~$247) at 2 pm ET Tuesday. MicroStrategy MicroStrategy, an unprofitable business intelligence company, started buying bitcoin back in 2020. Today, the firm has 446,400 BTC (acquired for an average price of $62,428 per coin), and execs say they have no intention of slowing down anytime soon . These days, MSTR is essentially a leveraged trade on BTC, and for those who bought shares at the beginning of the year, it’s paid off. The stock has gained more than 60% since Election Day alone. MSTR shares stood at $290 at 2 pm ET — up 323% in 2024. Miners Hut 8, Core Scientific Bitcoin miner Hut 8 made its public market debut in 2018 at around $17 a share. The stock hit a record high of almost $80 in 2021, a rally analysts attribute to bitcoin’s run and Hut 8’s mining operation expansion . After shares stalled in 2022 and 2023, Hut 8 saw another surge this year, once again thanks to record-high bitcoin prices and new mining technology. Recent price targets from Cantor Fitzgerald and Craig Hallum are in the mid-$30 range. HUT shares were up 63% year to date at 2 pm ET Tuesday, just north of $20. Up even more is the share price for rival miner Core Scientific, which has increased roughly 300% in 2024. The company emerged from bankruptcy in January, relisting on the Nasdaq. Core Scientific’s stock surged to above $7 in June right after inking its first hosting deal with cloud provider CoreWeave. CORZ’s share price hovered around $14 on Tuesday afternoon.

He was arrested in 2023 on charges of using falsified travel documents. In 2023, the U.S. and South Korea issued extradition requests for Kwon . On Dec. 31, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milojko Spajić announced that Kwon was transferred to US custody to bring the complex legal standoff to an end. Why the US and South Korea Wanted Kwon Kwon was at the center of the disastrous implosion of the Terra ecosystem in 2022. The incident resulted in billions of dollars in losses and contributed to a broader cryptocurrency market downturn. Regulators in the US and South Korea charged Kwon with fraud, conspiracy, and market manipulation. Until his arrest, there had been international interest in his whereabouts, but his location was not known. It was in Montenegro that he was arrested. Legal Challenges in Montenegro Kwon served four months in prison in Montenegro following his arrest for the use of fake travel documents. However, his legal status has remained very unclear since the courts debated over extradition to either the US or South Korea. Appeals from his legal team delayed the court proceedings by more than one year. Finally, the Justice Minister Bojan Božović approved extradition to the US on Dec. 27. Charges Kwon Faces in the US The US Justice Department charged Kwon with eight felony counts, including wire fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy to engage in market manipulation. In addition, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, earlier in 2023, found him and Terraform Labs liable for fraud and ordered them to pay around $4.5 billion in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest. Montenegro Committed to Justice Montenegrin Prime Minister Spajić outlined the commitment of the nation to international justice. “This extradition is a proof of our commitment to international justice and rule of law”, he said. What’s Next for Kwon? Far from over are all the legal battles with his extradition. He is expected to see US courts soon, when further developments in the case may emerge. Kwon’s case is a big example in crypto fraud enforcement worldwide. His case shows how many countries are collaborating to persecute such fraudsters.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|LUNA|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-31 20:34:15

Pepe (PEPE) was among the top gainers, flipping Hyperliquid (HYPE). The Elon Musk effect caused year-end rallies for Pepe (PEPE) and several categories of meme tokens. Musk’s new gaming and social media persona, Kekius Maximus , brought back attention to several meme categories. Pepe (PEPE) returned to $0.000020, while Hyperliquid (HYPE) stagnated around $25. This allowed PEPE to move up the charts, next aiming to overtake the position of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). PEPE trading volumes also moved up to $3.3B in the past 24 hours, the highest level in an otherwise slow week. Frog-themed tokens rallied after Elon Musk selected Pepe the Frog for his new avatar. | Source: CoinGecko Musk’s new avatar and Path of Exile name also sparked rallies for other tokens in the frog-themed category. As a result, the tokens rallied on average by 10% overnight, to a valuation of over $12B. Even minor tokens expanded, following the effect of PEPE. The token rallied based on its wide community reach. At the end of 2024, PEPE became the leader in terms of community wealth. According to meme influencer Murad Mahmudov, the PEPE community had the most wallets with a balance over $1,000. A total of 77,145 holders had over $1,000 worth of PEPE in their wallets, with a trend for long-term holding. PEPE buyers are also active on social media and participate in community-building. PEPE is also widely distributed, as even wallet clusters only hold a small part of the supply. PolitiFi reawakens in the new year PolitiFi tokens were one of the categories to slow down substantially following the November 6 US elections. After Donald Trump’s victory, some of the political memes lost their appeal, as traders shifted to other categories. The revival of frog memes raised the value of PolitiFi tokens, which returned above $500M. The space has been lagging and may bring back the attention of meme communities. The PolitiFi category also benefitted from the rapid gains of Kekius Maximus (KEKIUS), which was added to the list of political tokens. With Donald Trump’s second inauguration coming soon, the PolitiFi meta-narrative is seen as potentially undervalued. The quick reaction of traders shows even previously obscure tokens are closely watched for their potential to rally. Within hours, tokens like KEKIUS and TRUMPUS lined up among the newly trending AI agents, which are dominating meme trading in December. Parody tokens emerge as an undervalued category Parody tokens are a small, but rapidly growing category. This category of tokens showed its ability to react to current events. At the end of December, CoinGecko noted the category was gaining activity. Parody memes track other successful meme formats. This category of meme tokens is still small, but also extremely reactive to current events. Musk’s changed avatar sparked a rally for a little-known token named simply Elon. Parody memes are trending based on the success of WOULD, the leading token as of December 31. Parody memes are catching up to the size of the PolitiFi category, with a total valuation of $571M . This selection of tokens outperformed even the entire collection of Musk-inspired tokens . The one exception is ELONIA, a parody which gained more than 51% in the past week. The recent meme token rallies happened despite the shift of attention to AI agents. The smaller meme collections surpassed the selection of memes by this year’s top influencer, Murad Mahmudov. This time around, Dogecoin (DOGE) hardly budged, despite Musk being one of its early backers. DOGE remained unchanged at around $0.31, as its price requires much bigger inflows to spark a rally. Small-scale, unserious tokens, however, kept driving social media engagement and on-chain activity. The entire meme space made a slight recovery, rising to $109B after recently dipping under the $100B mark. Meme tokens as a whole had one of the highest returns in 2024, with more than 2,100% in total gains. The meme narrative also gained the biggest exposure on social media, based on recent CoinGecko data .

Bitcoin’s market capitalization came close to $3 trillion during the last surge, according to CoinGecko. As the year-end approaches, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and its upcoming policy decisions, which could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bitcoin’s Record Demand Meets Market Shifts Bitcoin demand is currently outpacing levels last seen during its $70,000 rally in March 2023. Axel Adler Jr., a researcher and author at CryptoQuant, noted that prior bull cycles saw demand peaks of 205% and 133%, suggesting the current surge could be a prelude to further highs. Source|AxelAdlerJr X This robust appetite for Bitcoin comes as the cryptocurrency matures, with its volatility hitting record lows, according to CryptoBanter show host Kyledoops on X highlighting Glassnode’s data. Source|KyleDoops X He also noted that institutional adoption and market stability are transforming Bitcoin into a dependable financial asset. Adding to the bullish narrative is President-elect Donald Trump’s vocal support for cryptocurrencies . Trump has pledged to make the US a global leader in digital assets, proposing favorable regulations and even a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This policy stance has injected fresh energy into the market, attracting investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Institutional Adoption and Derivatives Betting The institutional pivot toward Bitcoin is unmistakable. MicroStrategy Inc., a Bitcoin-focused firm, is set to join the Nasdaq 100 Index. The inclusion underscores Bitcoin’s growing mainstream acceptance and highlights how corporate entities continue to embrace it as a strategic asset. MicroStrategy, led by Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor currently holds 439,002 BTC, valued at $46.9 billion at the current market price. This makes Microstrategy the largest corporate HODler of BTC. On the derivatives front, the Deribit options exchange is seeing a concentration of bullish bets at the $120,000 strike price. This reflects traders’ belief in Bitcoin’s ability to extend its gains, particularly as macroeconomic conditions evolve. Analysts at K33 Research note that Bitcoin’s momentum could strengthen during the quiet weeks following the Federal Reserve’s final meeting of 2024. Economic and Political Drivers The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point rate cut this week, which could bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against traditional financial risks. However, market uncertainty remains, given the robust US economic growth and inflation concerns tied to Trump’s broader policy agenda. Bitcoin has also benefited from renewed retail interest. Its price has risen over 55% since Trump’s election victory on November 5, with US-based exchange-traded funds seeing significant inflows. This starkly contrasts Bitcoin’s skepticism a year ago when it traded at $41,000. Bulls, Bears, and the Road Ahead Despite its recent highs, Bitcoin remains a polarizing asset. Axel Adler Jr. highlighted that the market is perpetually divided between doubters and believers. Bitcoin’s cycles of extreme optimism and caution are unlikely to change, even as it pushes toward new records. As Bitcoin consolidates below $100k, the question remains: Is this the calm before another explosive move? With record demand, institutional backing, and favorable macro conditions, Bitcoin appears poised for a decisive end to the year. Whether it can sustain this momentum will depend on a delicate interplay of market forces and policy decisions.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 20:36:27

Charles Hoskinson expects that ADA will have an even better year in 2025, helped by numerous catalysts. Cardano Price Has Bullish year ahead in 2025 says Charles Hoskinson ADA price jumped by 60% in 2024, helped by the broader rally in the cryptocurrency industry. However, its performance lagged behind that of its top peers like Solana, Chainlink, and Binance Coin, which more than doubled. Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, has predicted that the network will soar to heights never seen before. One potential catalyst for this is the incorporation of Bitcoin DeFi through the BitcoinOS network . Incorporating Bitcoin into Cardano’s network could unlock billions of dollars for the Cardano ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson X Post Hoskinson also expects that Cardano’s midnight, partnerships, and dApp upgrades will help to supercharge the network. Just recently, Hoskinson hinted that Cardano would partner with SpaceX , the space company started by Elon Musk. ADA Technical Analysis The daily chart shows that the Cardano price soared to $1.326 in December, up by 375% from its lowest level this year. It has slipped below the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day moving average. That is a sign that the coin has nearly completed its mean reversion, a situation where an asset returns to the average price. On the positive side, the Market Value to Relative Value (MVRV) Z score indicator has retreated to 2.3. That is a sign that the coin is cheap since a crypto asset is normally said to be expensive when it moves above 3.8. This indicator is created by looking at the market value, the relative value, and the standard deviation. Cardano has also formed a falling wedge pattern. The higher side of this pattern connects the highest swings since December 2. The lower side links the lowest points since Dec. 1. A falling wedge is a popular bullish sign, meaning that it could recover soon. Cardano Price Chart Cardano Price Targets The outlook for Cardano in 2024 is bullish because of the wedge pattern. If this forecast works out, the next point to watch will be at $1.326, the highest point this year, which is 55% above the current level. More gains above that level will open the possibility of the coin soaring to the all-time high of $3. On the flip side, ADA price drop below the 61.8% retracement level at $0.707 will cancel the bullish outlook. Such a move will then lead to more downside, potentially to $0.45, its highest level in July.

This sell-off has led to an increase in whale activity, with some notable ones swapping the SOL token for Hyperliquid’s HYPE. So, does the Solana coin have more gains to run or is the rally over? Solana Price Downturn: What’s Behind the Decline? Solana’s ongoing decline is mostly because of the weak sentiment in the crypto industry. Bitcoin price has retreated from near $100,000 this week to $96,000, while the popular watched crypto fear and greed index moved from extreme greed a few weeks ago to neutral. Cryptocurrencies often have a close correlation with each other. Solana’s decline could be because of the ongoing profit-taking among investors after the coin more than doubled earlier this year. It is common for investors to sell highly profitable assets as the end of the year nears. As we will show below, there are some signs that some whales have started to dump SOL and moved to other cryptocurrencies. Solana and other cryptocurrencies have also retreated after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 0.25% in its December meeting. While this cut was good, the bank hinted that it would cut rates two times next year. That hawkish tone has led to higher bond yields, which historically affects risky assets. More data shows that Solana’s DeFi TVL has been in a strong downward trend, which may be affecting its price. It dropped from $20 billion on December 20 to $5.7 billion on December 26. Solana DeFi TVL Whales Dumping SOL: What Does On-Chain Data Reveal? On-chain data analysis is a good way to understand a token price movement. Whales or large token holders, often have more weight than traders. In this case, there are signs that some whales have started to dump their SOL holdings. One whale dumped 45k SOL tokens and swapped them to Hyperliquid’s HYPE toke. According to HypurrScan , one of his wallets holds HYPE tokens worth $9.5 million, and another has over $10 million. This dump partially explains why the SOL price crashed. This whale has a long history with Solana as he initially staked 1 million tokens in 2020, and has benefited from its surge and staking rewards. As such, his decision to exit the SOL trade is a sign that he wants to capitalize on the recently launched HYPE token. Solana Whale Transactions What’s Next for Solana Price? Will HYPE Replace SOL? So, will the HYPE token replace SOL? Chances for the HYPE token replacing SOL are limited because the two are significantly different assets. Solana is a layer-1 network used by developers in key industries like DeFi and NFTs, whyle Hyperliquid is a perpetual futures trading platform. The daily chart shows that the Solana price has been in a downward trend after rising to $265 earlier this month. It has formed a falling channel pattern and moved below the 50 Weighted Moving Average (WMA) indicator. The coin has flipped the key support at $210 into a support. The falling channel has a close resemblance to a descending wedge, meaning that it may rebound, possibly in January. If this happens, the SOL price will rise to $265, its highest level this year. A drop below the support at $175, its lowest level this month, will invalidate the bullish view and point to more Solana price sell-off, potentially to $120, the lowest point in September.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

It was added that Ethereum has what it takes to double more than its current value, while Bitcoin may see a more modest increase. This shift reflects Ethereum’s growing dominance and investor interest in altcoins. Ethereum’s Surge: A Bold Outlook Steno Research forecasted that Ethereum will surge past $8,000 in 2025, doubling its current price of $3,400. The asset would need to increase by approximately 135.29% to achieve this. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s value is projected to rise to at least $150,000, up from about $94,000. This requires an increase of about 59.57% to hit the speculated new mark. The report revealed that this price shift could push the Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio to 0.06, a significant increase from its current 0.0357. This trend follows previous market cycles, where altcoins gained strength and market share. A key factor driving Ethereum’s anticipated growth is the impact of Donald Trump’s potential U.S. presidential victory in 2024. Steno analysts believe that Trump’s leadership will be more beneficial for altcoins than Bitcoin. This shift in political dynamics is expected to drive greater institutional interest and adoption of altcoins, with Ethereum at the forefront. Notably, this Steno Research report starkly contrasts Franklin Templeton’s prediction of sovereign Bitcoin adoption in 2025. Bitcoin’s Dominance to Decline Amid Altcoins Focus and the DeFi Boom While Bitcoin has historically been the dominant player in the crypto space, that dominance is expected to wane in 2025. Steno Research predicted Bitcoin’s market share will drop from its current 56.6% to as low as 45%. This decline would lead investors to diversify their portfolios into a broader range of digital assets. Steno’s report also highlights the growing focus on altcoins, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. The total value locked (TVL) in decentralized applications (dApps) is expected to hit a record high of $300 billion by 2025. This surge in DeFi activity will further bolster altcoin prices. As expected, Ethereum will continue to lead the charge in smart contracts and decentralized application development. The ETF Factor: A Catalyst for Altcoin and Ethereum Growth Another significant development that could accelerate altcoin growth is the potential introduction of more crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. These ETFs are expected to open the doors for institutional investors, accelerating the adoption of Ethereum and other altcoins. With institutions increasingly entering the crypto space, these ETFs could catalyze more widespread Ethereum and other altcoins adoption. Steno Research predicts that 2025 will witness an unprecedented scale of institutional adoption of crypto, with altcoins benefiting the most.

Dogecoin is high on his list, alongside other assets showing strong potential. Pal’s picks reflect his strategy of targeting established and emerging tokens that he believes will perform well in the current market cycle. The market has been active, and Pal’s choices shared on December 16 on X highlight key trends investors should watch. Dogecoin: A Key Pick Amid Market Volatility One of the coins in Pal’s portfolio, Dogecoin is valued at $0.31 as per the portfolio. Nonetheless, Dogecoin has been fairly consistent despite recent ups and downs. The meme coin has increased by 2.23% in the last 24 hours and decreased by 12.42% within the last week. The market capitalization of the asset is currently $59.9 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.63 billion, showing sustained investors’ appetite. Raoul Pal has previously mentioned Dogecoin as one of his top crypto portfolio assets of focus, and his optimism for the token has not wavered. Back in November, on X, Pal cited Dogecoin’s 550% outperformance of Bitcoin since its genesis as evidence of being “harder money” at times than Bitcoin. This sets him in line with his bullish stance on Dogecoin, which remains one of his favorite assets for the current bull run . A Look at Pal’s Broader Crypto Watchlist: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui Raoul Pal’s top Crypto picks| Source: X Pal has a number of other digital assets on his radar, which he expects to perform during the bull market. The biggest one by market capitalization – Bitcoin – comes out on top; it is now valued at $2.07 trillion and has rallied 3.86% in the last seven days. Currently, Bitcoin’s 24hr volume is $50.6 billion, thus there is a strong interest from investors. Ethereum (ETH) is also on Pal’s list as well of course, their prices fell slightly during the week, with $404 billion in market capitalization and an ETH price of $3,363. Pal is especially bullish on Solana (SOL), calling it his “main game.” Priced at $194, Solana has a market cap of $93.2 billion. The project has seen growing momentum, which fits Pal’s long-term outlook. Sui (SUI) is another asset to watch. The token has hit new all-time highs and is currently priced at $4.20. It has surged by 13.48% in the past week, making it one of the top performers on Pal’s radar. Meme Coins: DOGE and Smoking Chicken Fish In addition to Dogecoin, Pal is also keeping an eye on meme coins. Smoking Chicken Fish (SCF), another meme coin has jumped 27.54% in daily trading. Meme coins like SCF and Dogecoin can be volatile, but Pal’s confidence in them shows he’s looking for opportunities in these high-risk, high-reward tokens. While Pal focuses on these major assets, he is also building a portfolio of culture NFTs. These long-term investments aim to capitalize on the growing trend in digital culture. Pal has emphasized that his strategy involves balancing immediate profits from some assets with long-term growth in the NFT space. Raoul Pal’s crypto picks, shared on December 16, reflect a well-rounded strategy. Dogecoin remains a key asset in his portfolio despite market fluctuations. His broader watchlist, which includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and meme coins like Smoking Chicken Fish, presents a mix of established leaders and emerging players.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 20:45:45

As the crypto market capped off another volatile year, artificial intelligence (AI), memecoins, and real-world assets (RWA) emerged as the top-performing sectors, with GameFi and Layer 2 solutions lagging behind. The AI trend has dominated 2024, delivering an average return of 2,940% year to date (YoY). This surge was primarily driven by the popularity of AI tool launchpad Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), which became the year’s top earner. AI saw a particularly strong year-end rally, nearly doubling its returns from 1,598% to 2,940% in December. This year-end momentum could see AI overtake memecoins as the most profitable trend of 2024. Related News: End of an Era: Terra (LUNA) Founder Do Kwon Leaves Montenegro Under Police Escort Memecoins have followed AI closely, with an impressive 2.185% average annualized return. This trend gained traction in March, when returns skyrocketed from 96.6% to 1,713.1% in a single month. Despite high volatility, memecoins have maintained their leading trend position for much of the year. However, after reaching a record 3,211.4% return on December 9, the sector has seen a pullback as investor interest has begun to wane. Real world assets (RWA) came in third with an average annual return of 820%. The trend experienced steady growth early in the year, peaking at 365.3% in April before entering a period of stagnation. RWA returns rose again in November, driven by the rising price of MANTRA (OM), and rose to their year-end positions. Layer 2: Layer 2 tokens, the only trend to lose money, saw an average decline of 21%. Seven of the top 10 Layer 2 projects reported price declines with losses ranging from 6.3% to 75.3%. The trend of projects building their own Layer 2 networks contributed to the sector’s underperformance. *This is not investment advice.

Yet, these prominent blockchains continue to face scrutiny over their relevance and use cases. Messari co-founder Ryan Selkis has emerged as one of their most vocal critics, reigniting hostilities with their communities in a series of provocative posts on X. “Harsh Words” for XRP and ADA Communities On December 15, Selkis targeted the XRP and Cardano communities on X (formerly Twitter), describing them as “the loudest and least valuable bot groups” in the crypto space. He challenged them to deliver real products and prove their user bases exist. “The XRP and ADA ‘communities’ are the loudest and least valuable bot groups on X. Ship something, and then I’ll respond. Where are the users?” Selkis posted. Selkis’ criticism comes as both XRP and Cardano experience increased activity. X community notes fired back with data suggesting that Cardano performed 280,000 transactions on December 12th, which is 20% to 60% of the current transaction volumes of both ETH and BTC, while interacting with only 2% to 8% of their respective market capitalizations. In the meantime, XRP remains one of the top digital assets, with Ripple stating continued expansion in payment channels operating on its digital infrastructure. Renewed Tensions with Ripple Selkis’ recent tirade also included attacks on Ripple, the company closely tied to XRP. He dismissed speculation about Ripple’s political influence after the company’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty was seen in a photo with presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Selkis criticized Ripple in a tweet filled with references to Pulp Fiction , calling XRP “a piece of shit” and labeling Ripple as “the drowning victim of crypto.” He has consistently argued that XRP’s primary purpose is to enrich insiders, a claim Ripple’s executives and community deny. Source: @twobitidiot X Cardano’s Longstanding Omission Cardano’s community has similarly been at odds with Selkis. The Messari co-founder excluded Cardano from the firm’s 2024 “Crypto Theses” report, citing insufficient economic activity. Selkis argued that blockchains without substantial usage did not merit inclusion. “It’s simple math. I find block space to be a commodity product and only covered the top ecosystems by economic activity. I omitted a TON of projects because the only chapter on Layer1s was 15 pages of a ~200 page report.Our team otherwise does excellent research on Cardano, ” Selkis wrote in December 2023. Despite this, Cardano has seen notable growth in network activity. Developers are actively building decentralized applications (dApps) and advancing its ecosystem, which includes innovative projects like Hydra , a scaling solution designed to enhance transaction throughput. XRP and Cardano Communities Push Back Selkis’ latest remarks have drawn sharp responses from XRP and Cardano supporters. Community members have cited data highlighting increasing transaction volumes and active use cases as evidence of the relevance of the blockchains. Community notes on Selkis X post While Selkis’ critiques are divisive, they reflect broader debates in the crypto industry about utility, decentralization, and long-term sustainability. The feud between the Messari co-founder and these communities appears far from over, with both sides entrenched in their positions.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 20:53:34

In a new YouTube update, the host of InvestAnswers lays out six potential catalysts that could cause altcoins to explode in 2025. “These are the top six items that I see as being critical to triggering the so-called alt season. Now, first of all, typically what happens is you need to see a big, big, big spike in Bitcoin, and then folks take profit and rotate into alts. I will stress this again: this is what happened in the past, not sure if it’s going to happen this year. Remember, Bitcoin is a much bigger asset, takes a lot more money for it to move, and you can see the amount of buying by iBit and MicroStrategy – nearly a million Bitcoin in 11 months. It’s bonkers… It’s pretty crazy the amount of growth and the amount that these firms are sucking in. So it’s a different cycle this time, I do want to stress that. But typically, historically, if Bitcoin spiked to $150,000 there are people who would take profit and then they would load into the alts.” Beyond the movements of Bitcoin ( BTC ), the analyst says new tech and product releases could also spur an altcoin rally. “Next, we need a big new tech release, for example, Fire Dancer from Solana. We need a new ETF, and I don’t know which ETF is going to come first. A lot of chatter about the Solana ETF coming first because it is the number one crypto out there in the world, despite what other people will say. It’s where two-thirds of all transactions happen from 40,000 cryptos, so you can take that data as you want. But there could also be, with the new administration in government in the US, in-kind and staking capabilities. We just showed the power of staking on SOL strategies and running validators. Imagine if the ETF is in-kind, where you deposit your Solana, you don’t have to move to fiat first, and then you withdraw your Solana. That’ll be powerful, and then you get staking benefits.” Finally, the InvestAnswers host suggests that adoption begets adoption. “Also, we need more adoption. We need to get to 100 million daily active users to use something like Fire Dancer, and if that happens, we all succeed. The crypto market cap goes to 10 trillion pretty fast. We need regulation to support all of this, especially the alts. Right now, we don’t have that, and we need some news [to] break, like a big partnership… That’s my take, and I do believe it will happen in Q2 or Q3 2025. So we have 6 to 9 months, but remember, predicting short-term stuff is very hard. But I think summer 2025 – have your seat belts on – could be a fun time.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to Alderoty, the SEC should only regulate securities transactions rather than expand its authority over asset sales without contractual rights or obligations. Ripple CLO Shares 6 Guidelines for SEC Crypto Regulation in 2025 In a statement shared on social media, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty emphasized the limited jurisdiction of the US SEC. He stated that the regulatory body should only oversee security transactions. Simple asset sales, such as selling a gold bar without associated rights or obligations, fall outside the Securities and Exchange Commission purview. Alderoty illustrated his point by contrasting two scenarios: selling a gold bar with contractual rights to a gold mine, which constitutes a security transaction, versus selling a gold bar without such conditions, which does not. This clarification asserts that the US Securities and Exchange Commission cannot regulate transactions that lack post-sale obligations. Moreover, Alderoty rejected the idea that a cryptocurrency token can change its classification from a security to a non-security. He labeled this concept a theory without legal support. This notion, he argued, serves only to complicate cryptocurrency regulations . Alderoty insisted, “Let’s hope these principles won’t need repeating in 2025 and beyond.” The Ripple CLO also reiterated that while cryptocurrency tokens may be used in security transactions, they are not inherently securities. This distinction is crucial for the industry, as it challenges the SEC’s broader interpretation of its authority over digital assets. Call for Collaboration Between US SEC and Congress Alderoty urged the next SEC chair to adopt a collaborative approach with Congress. He recommended focusing on clear and transparent rules for the cryptocurrency industry. This call for cooperation aligns with Ripple’s position against the SEC’s enforcement actions. In his statement, Alderoty also emphasized the need for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to address only fraud-related cases involving crypto. He criticized the regulator for expanding its jurisdiction based on subjective criteria, which he described as self-serving. Moreso, recently, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty emphasized the urgency of ending the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, labeling it a “lawless lawsuit”. Alderoty reiterated his call for the incoming Trump administration to address the controversies surrounding former SEC official William Hinman’s statements. The Ripple CLO claims that his statements caused regulatory confusion and undermined trust in the agency. The six principles outlined by Alderoty reflect Ripple’s stance on fostering fair regulatory practices. With the incoming Donald Trump administration, the cryptocurrency industry anticipates a shift toward more cooperative regulatory practices.

According to X user Shaun Edmondson , the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs trading on US exchanges hold 1,104,354 BTC after aggressive buying since their January launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF holds the most coins with 521,375 BTC, more than double the assets of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. BlackRock now ranks as the third-largest Bitcoin holder. (Source: X) Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold $109 billion in assets, equivalent to 5.57% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Bitcoin ETFs Record Second-Highest Weekly Inflows Since Launch This week has boded well for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the data so far showing that the weekly inflows are at the second-highest level since January. This comes after the products posted positive flows for six consecutive days. The total inflows to these products have already surpassed $2.35 billion so far this week. On December 5, inflows totaled $766M, with BlackRock’s IBIT posting $770M in inflows. These strong inflows coincided with a rally in BTC price above $100,000 to an all-time high of $103,670. Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have also recorded their best week since launch after total weekly inflows surpassed $752M. Spot ETH ETFs have been under pressure from persistent outflows from the Grayscale ETF. However, for the last nine days, these products have recorded positive netflows. Inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs also hit a record high of $428M on December 5, their highest level since their launch. These ETFs now hold $12.51 billion worth of Ether, equivalent to 2.71% of the altcoin’s market capitalization. Bitcoin ETFs Break Record in the ETF Market Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has opined that the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially BlackRock’s IBIT, has broken previous records in the US ETF market. “$IBIT is now over $50b. It took it 228 days to reach this milestone, the next fastest ETF to reach 50b was $IEFA in 1,329 days. So over 5x faster than any ETF ever launched,” he stated. Balchunas further added that while he was not a Bitcoin maximalist, BTC was a “special asset” compared to other cryptocurrencies.

To read full editions, subscribe . We’ve heard the “increased adoption” answer plenty when asking industry players about 2025 crypto market expectations . Beyond retail, an array of big players particularly want in on BTC, and forecasted regulatory clarity will help fuel that shift, many believe. Though bitcoin adoption looks different for various investors, BlackRock’s guidance earlier this month gives us a sense of the buying wave that is possible. During a busy month in which Donald Trump nominated a new SEC chair and the Fed again cut rates , some might have missed the asset management giant’s December “investment perspectives” edition. A couple weeks back, BlackRock execs wrote that the so-called Magnificent 7 tech stocks (in a portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds) each, on average, account for roughly the same share of overall portfolio risk as a 1-2% BTC allocation. “We think that’s a reasonable range for a bitcoin exposure,” they added. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz was among those who saw the guidance, reacting as follows: Slowly and then all at once… @BlackRock recommending up to a 2% Bitcoin allocation is massive. The world's largest asset manager now sees $BTC alongside tech giants like Apple and Tesla. Institutions are here. — Mike Novogratz (@novogratz) December 12, 2024 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan noted in an X space a week or so later that the news went unnoticed by many. It was sort of funny, Hougan added — “not just that people missed BlackRock saying you should add bitcoin to a portfolio, but all of a sudden we doubled the allocation.” Hogan is alluding to the not-uncommon 1% allocation to bitcoin for those who have jumped into the space. A March survey found that of the financial advisers allocating to the space, 15% recommended to clients a 1% allocation. Of those saying they planned to allocate, 23% expected to start with a position of that size. Many investors Bitwise speaks with opt for a 5% allocation, Hougan added — a level he noted would often get you laughed at a year ago. “[It’s] not just 2% for a few people at a wealth manager; [it’s] 2% for the base rate for a portfolio across every exposure,” he noted of the BlackRock guidance. “I think it’s really significant, and if you think it’s the end of the story, you’re wrong.” While US bitcoin ETFs have helped wealth managers wade into crypto , many still haven’t. Then there are the other interested institutions, whether it be companies , governments or pension funds . Hougan said as bitcoin volatility goes down in a year or two, perhaps BlackRock will recommend a 5% allocation to BTC. BlackRock execs indeed note that wider adoption and trading could make BTC’s low correlation with equities more stable — trimming the asset’s contribution to portfolio risk and enabling investors to up their position in it. “Yet broad adoption could also mean bitcoin loses the structural catalyst for further sizable price rises,” they explain. “The case for a permanent holding may then be less clear-cut and investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells 147,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may remain in a technical bullish trend for a while longer before eventually going parabolic. “The simple fact is that BTC price has not gone parabolic yet. This is both a negative and a positive. A negative in that those higher prices might not come in the here and now (is this really a negative?), and a positive in that price is still technically stable with eventual higher prices at a later date, compared to if the spike had come sooner. With the number getting high fast, this served to over-excite the market. There is an element of ‘money illusion’ at work in this in my opinion. Keep in mind also that price can always turn on a dime to the upside despite the sober technicals.” Dave the Wave uses his version of logarithmic growth curves (LGCs), which aim to forecast Bitcoin’s market cycle highs and lows while filtering out short-term volatility. Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he suggests that LGC’s support levels may be tested around the $70,000 range while the overall bullish trend remains intact. He also says that Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase until it can break out of a key trendline. “BTC consolidation the order of the day until the downward diagonal can be broken. Technically, still very solid.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Bitcoin is trading for $92,338 at time of writing, down 13.2% in the last two weeks.

Both projects are on the move—Render is integrating AI crypto solutions into decentralized GPU rendering, and Injective is reshaping DeFi scalability. The climbing price of Injective signals its expanding role in financial applications. Amid these tech breakthroughs, Web3Bay is emerging as a high ROI crypto with prospects that stretch far into the future. Poised to overhaul Web3 shopping, Web3Bay marries decentralized e-commerce with fresh payment solutions and hands-on user governance. With ambitions to weave together DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain features, its offerings could soon eclipse its competitors. For those eyeing both growth and practicality, Web3Bay’s take on decentralized shopping is catching eyes. Web3Bay: The High ROI Crypto Shaping Web3 Shopping Web3Bay is carving out the next chapter in e-commerce, marrying blockchain’s trustworthiness with the ease of online shopping. It caters to both the crypto-aware and the average shopper, striving to cut out the middlemen, slash fees, and secure transactions. Its novel dual payment system welcomes payments in both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal, broadening its appeal. Those considering a high ROI crypto addition to their portfolios will find Web3Bay brimming with potential, thanks to its blend of functionality and a forward-thinking design. The ongoing presale of Web3Bay’s 3BAY token is designed to yield massive returns for early birds. Starting at just $0.003 in the first batch, the token’s price is slated to jump by 15% in subsequent phases, aiming for $0.1959 by the end. This pricing model is turning heads, with initial buyers potentially looking at a whopping 6430% in returns. As a governance token, 3BAY not only drives transactions but also empowers its holders to help dictate the platform’s direction, bolstering its appeal as a high ROI crypto. Looking forward, Web3Bay’s roadmap includes integrating NFTs, DeFi staking, and cross-chain capabilities, aiming to cement its place in the decentralized market. By pairing long-term value with immediate profit prospects, Web3Bay is a project that’s capturing the attention of both investors and crypto buffs alike.

With the RNDR token currently valued at $6.88, Render’s emphasis on scalability and AI crypto applications positions it as a versatile choice for both creators and developers. Injective Price Rises Amid DeFi Surge Injective is reinforcing its foothold in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, offering a scalable layer-1 blockchain tailor-made for derivatives, prediction markets, and more. The current price of $20.61 reflects its increasing adoption, fueled by features like the inEVM layer-2 solution, which facilitates seamless integration of Ethereum-based applications. The addition of tokenized real-world assets and yield-bearing stablecoins like USDM expands its attractiveness to a varied audience. Recent initiatives like the Helix Institutional platform are geared towards enticing financial institutions by providing a secure trading environment for derivatives, indices, and more. Injective’s strategy to merge DeFi with AI crypto solutions opens new doors for automated, intelligent trading frameworks. With its robust tech and growing utility, the momentum behind Injective’s price indicates strong potential for sustained growth. Summing Up Render and Injective are charting new territories in blockchain innovation with their advancements in AI crypto and DeFi. Render’s dedication to decentralized GPU rendering and Injective’s focus on scalable financial solutions highlight their respective strengths. However, Web3Bay offers a distinctive advantage with its tangible applications in the Web3 shopping realm. As a high ROI crypto , it melds potential profitability with sustainable growth through initiatives like its 3BAY token presale and upcoming DeFi and NFT integrations. For those seeking utility and solid returns, Web3Bay’s approach to decentralized e-commerce positions it as a superior choice compared to its peers.

Developed by a Japanese programmer, the platform provides detailed insights into XRP wallet distributions and ownership. The report was highlighted by XRPL validator VET through X on December 16, 2024. Key Features of the XRP Rich List Summary The platform offers several features to help users analyze XRP ownership: Labeled Wallets : Prominent wallets, including those of exchanges and corporate entities, are tagged. Balance Trends : Wallet movements can be tracked over 7-day and 30-day periods to identify accumulation or distribution. Interactive Visuals : A heat map displays the spread of XRP holdings across the network. The data is updated hourly, ensuring the latest wallet activity is reflected. Information is sourced directly from XRP Scan and the XRPL. Exchanges Dominate XRP Holdings The tool ranks wallets on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) based on ownership and activity. According to the data, South Korea’s Upbit exchange leads with over 6 billion XRP in its wallet. Binance follows with 26 wallets, while Coinbase manages 542 wallets, reflecting the dominance of major exchanges in the ecosystem. Ripple, the company behind XRP , also holds significant influence. The tool identifies 87 wallets linked to Ripple. Individual wallets owned by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and XRPL architect Arthur Brito are also labeled, showcasing how corporate and individual actors shape the ecosystem. Mystery Wallets Remain Unknown While the tool identifies many key players, some wallets remain anonymous. For instance, the second-largest wallet, holding around 20 billion XRP, has no disclosed owner. As new details emerge, the platform updates its labels to improve transparency.

This rise, from an increase of roughly 399% in the period of a month, indicates that there is more and more speculation and confidence in the increase in demand for Ripple’s main token. This has led to a discussion on forums and social media of whether the altcoin is ready to reach for the stars and if a $10 XRP could soon become a reality. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Victory Sparks a Bullish Surge Twists from the external environment, including president-elect Donald Trump and his encouraging sentiments towards virtual currencies, have boosted the rally of XRP. The recent victory in the general election has brought hope among cryptocurrency investors, as most believe the new government will favor digital currencies. Trump’s victory sparked a 42% jump in the overall crypto market, propelling XRP to $2.48. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has been especially vocal about Trump and his administration, stating that Trump will “make crypto great again” and, by extension, the markets will do so as well. Robinhood Relists XRP, Igniting Retail Trading Frenzy Robinhood decided to reinstate cryptocurrency on its platform after it had been banned in early 2020 due to the SEC case against Ripple. The relisting sparked renewed interest in XRP particularly to the retail traders, thus the trading escalated. This is why trading volume on new applications such as Robinhood and Coinbase surged and caused the XRP price to rise. Many of these have opened their doors to XRP in recent days, helping foster consumer interest in the coin. Gensler’s Departure Opens Doors for Legal Clarity The pressure from the authorities is also easing up for XRP. That is good news for Ripple as well as for XRP, which has benefited from Gensler’s resignation alongside other positive signs, including what some believe to be the final stages of the SEC lawsuit. The resignation of Gensler as the chairman of the Commission is welcome, especially if one considers his quite hostile attitude towards the industry. With the prospect of a more crypto-friendly SEC leadership, XRP investors are hopeful that Ripple will soon be able to resolve its legal issues and unlock further growth. Altcoin Season: XRP Benefits from Bitcoin’s Declining Dominance Now, as it stands, BTC market dominance has fallen from 60% to 53% within the past weeks, and XRP has gained the advantage from the growing market appetite for altcoins. This trend is known as the altcoin season, during which investors return to buying larger numbers of different cryptocurrencies, including XRP. The decline in Bitcoin’s market domination indicates that Alts are being sought after, and XRP benefited greatly from this shift. ETF Speculation Boosts XRP’s Upward Trajectory A significant part of the bullish signals in XRP is associated with the increasing expectation of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Filing for the XRP ETFs by some key market players such as WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Canary Capital has attracted investors’ attention. In particular, investors have gotten excited about WisdomTree’s filing, and the Bank of New York Mellon has been listed as the trust’s administrator. Should the approval be granted, an XRP ETF can be considered as a real game mover, enabling institutional más investors and likely pushing up the XRP price. Record-Breaking Inflows Boost Confidence XRP recorded $95 million in inflows into investment products in the last week, the highest amount CoinShares has reported for XRP since tracking began. It has increased week over week by a massive 621% and points to increasing institutional demand. These inflows contributed to more than 35% of $270 million in total digital asset inflows in the last week, which proves the dominance of XRP. In turn, Bitcoin registered $457 million in outflows, with commentators attributing this to profit booking after the Bitcoin touched $100,000. Inflows into Ethereum this year amounted to $634 million and broke the $2.2 billion YTD mark. However, the growth of Ethereum’s input shed light on the increasing demand for XRP as the ETF debate continues and overall market interest intensifies. XRP’s Path to $10 XRP’s price surge to $2.48 is just the beginning. With $95 million in weekly inflows, bullish political changes, regulatory optimism, and the growing likelihood of XRP ETFs, the stage is set for even more upward momentum. XRP is now positioned to make a run at new all-time highs—potentially even $10. As market sentiment continues to favor Ripple, all eyes will be on the upcoming regulatory developments and ETF approvals that could make XRP a top performer in the crypto space.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 21:08:56

In a polite yet scathing response to the handling of dissent on X, the blockchain genius made it clear he’s not impressed with the liberal use of the “banhammer” to silence voices that don’t align with Elon’s views. Vitalik warned that such actions are dangerous for public discourse and could lead to chaos rather than constructive dialogue. The critique came after Elon’s aggressive reaction to a user accusing him of trying to “optimize something that shouldn’t exist,” in regards to the H-1B visa program. The eccentric billionaire lashed out, tweeting, “Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,” an escalation that instantly got him a lot of backlash. Vitalik warns of the dangers of censorship In his response, Vitalik pointed out that free speech is easy to support when you agree with the message but much harder when the opinions are tough to swallow. “Respecting free speech is easy when we agree with the speech, and hard when we think it’s awful,” he said. The Ether founder warned Elon that wielding the banhammer to control discourse today only paves the way for others to use it tomorrow. “The banhammer is controlled by one group today, it will be controlled by another group tomorrow, and every use of it legitimizes further use,” Vitalik explained. His argument centered on the idea that suppressing speech leads to either fractured conversations, a dominant monoculture, or constant hostility among opposing factions. Vitalik said: “I feel like a lot of people have been okay with rising aggressiveness because the target of the aggressiveness was one faction that they disliked, but once that beast is summoned, its nature is to look for new targets, and even if you approve of the first target you may not approve of the second or the third or the fourth – as many people have been finding out this week.” Vitalik also took aim at the aggressive tone of online discussions, something he says has worsened over the past few years. He emphasized that leaders like Elon play a critical role in setting the tone for these conversations. “It’s not ‘wartime mode’ that will get humanity to Mars in one piece; it’s something brighter,” he said, calling for a change in attitude and approach. That’s just Vitalik. In a surprising jab at Elon, he actually said, “This isn’t the kind of memetic beast we want running the show when we’re entering an era of dangerous global political competition and rapidly improving AI. The role of leaders in setting the tone is really important, and can be used to great good or great evil.” Elon’s H-1B visa battle Elon Musk has never backed down from sharing his opinions, and his recent defense of the H-1B visa program is no exception. The visa, which allows U.S. companies to hire skilled foreign workers, has been a cornerstone for his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. In 2024 alone, Tesla secured 724 H-1B visas, highlighting how essential the program is for filling key roles. Elon himself immigrated to the U.S. from South Africa and became a citizen in 2002. He credits the H-1B program and skilled immigration for much of America’s technological success, saying , “The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies… is because of H-1B.” Accusations of censorship pile up Elon is also under fire for allegedly silencing conservative accounts on X. Reports indicate that at least 14 right-wing accounts lost their verification badges after criticizing Elon’s stance on immigration. Losing verification not only affects credibility but also hits visibility and monetization on the platform, making it a serious issue for content creators. Critics say Elon is using his power to squash dissenting voices, something that feels hypocritical for a self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist. Elon fired back, labeling his detractors as “hateful racists” and “contemptible fools.” He argued that these critics are harming the Republican Party with their extreme rhetoric. This internal rift within the MAGA movement proves the growing tension over immigration policy. Elon, who supports legal immigration but opposes illegal immigration, finds himself in the crossfire of an ideological battle that refuses to die down. And what’s more, Trump actually took his side on the matter. Enter “Kekius Maximus” In typical Elon fashion, he added fuel to the fire by changing his display name on X to “Kekius Maximus.” This peculiar moniker combines internet meme culture with Roman grandeur, referencing both Pepe the Frog and Maximus Decimus Meridius, the legendary character from Gladiator . Pepe the Frog, once an innocent meme, has been co-opted by various online subcultures, some of which have links to extremism. But Elon is using it in a tongue-in-cheek manner, leaning into the absurdity of internet culture. The name change coincided with a surge in a memecoin called KEKIUS, which saw its value skyrocket by 500% within hours. As of press time, KEKIUS was trading at $0.005667, with trading volumes surging fast.

38360516,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-swap-app-costly-sandwich-attacks,1735680600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,This Solana swap app is trying to make sandwich attacks more costly,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-swap-app-costly-sandwich-attacks,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Earlier this year, Solana’s network congestion created a lot of concern over traders’ ability to land transactions onchain. Today, traders have a much easier time landing trades, but the concern has refocused on the prices they get while doing so. Widespread sandwich attacks , whereby sophisticated traders exploit price spreads at the expense of unsophisticated traders, have proven to be a long-running and tricky-to-solve issue. The Solana swap app and market infrastructure firm DFlow put an interesting new solution on the table when it proposed conditional liquidity, which tasks new market intermediaries with separating toxic from non-toxic order flow. When a DEX trader tries to swap one cryptocurrency for another, they are quoted a price and allowed to set slippage, which is the percentage that the quoted price can change after the order is submitted. Solana sandwich attackers exploit slippage by front-running transactions to artificially raise the price a few basis points before selling the asset right after at a profit — leaving the user with a worse price. In the aggregate, sandwich attackers can make millions per day . DFlow proposes adding a new class of market participants called segmenters to divide toxic from non-toxic order flow and limit sandwich attacking. Segmenters, which will initially be chosen by DFlow, sit between users who submit the transactions and the DEXs that receive them, and basically sort good from bad transactions. When DEXs receive these labeled transactions, they can then charge higher fees to sandwichers and lower fees to everyone else. Conditional liquidity “doesn’t completely solve sandwiching” but can reduce it by charging different rates, DFlow founder Nitesh Nath said. “The magnitude of sandwich reduction is proportional to the difference in the higher rate for toxic flow and the lower rate for non-toxic flow.” DFlow already launched a segmenter called DFlow Aggregator and a conditional liquidity DEX called Clearpool. Segmenters are meant to create a marketplace for order flow, where the better the prices segmenters achieve for users, the more order flow DEXs and wallets send them. Segmenters make money by collecting some of the price improvement they provide. “Conditional liquidity aligns the interests of retail traders, DEXs and the network — a win-win-win for all parties involved. We expect conditional liquidity to be one of the big breakout trends of 2025,” JR Reed, partner at DFlow investor Multicoin Capital, said. Chris Chung, CEO of the Solana swap app Titan, said he believes conditional liquidity could give honest traders better prices, but it could be hard to get DEXs to start accepting the new market structure. DEXs would only start altering their fees if there was sufficient demand for conditional liquidity from the venues where traders are placing orders, but those venues will also want to see DEXs integrate the feature first. “It becomes a chicken and [egg] problem,” Chung said in a text, adding that the demand question may be partly why DFlow launched its own segmenter and DEX. Nath told me a “handful” of large wallets and apps have inquired about integrating conditional liquidity, though he declined to say which ones.

Despite this setback, an analyst predicts an even bleaker outlook for the leading cryptocurrency. The formation of a bearish flag pattern suggests further price declines could be on the horizon, with the analyst projecting a steeper price plunge towards $90,000. Bearish Flag Pattern Signal Bitcoin Price Crash Pejman Zwin, a TradingView crypto analyst, released a chart analysis predicting a significantly bearish outlook for the Bitcoin price. The analyst based this gloomy forecast on the appearance of a bearish flag pattern and other key technical indicators. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Guns For A Mid-High Timeframe Reversal Against Bitcoin In Bullish Q1 2025 According to Zwin, Bitcoin is moving within a bearish flag pattern, a technical formation that often signals a continuation of a prior downtrend. If this flag pattern holds, Bitcoin is likely preparing to break downward, which could lead to severe price declines. The analyst indicated that the 50-day Moving Average (MA), around the $95,974 mark, acted as a key resistance or support level for Bitcoin. However, the cryptocurrency recently broke below this MA — a development considered bearish, suggesting further downside. Zwin also disclosed that Bitcoin is moving within a heavy support zone between $95,000 and $90,870. Additionally, he highlighted that the pioneer cryptocurrency is breaking through key support lines, signaling a potential continuation of the downward trend. Looking at Bitcoin’s price action relative to the aforementioned technical indicators and chart patterns, Zwin anticipates a significant price crash toward $91,000. The analyst highlighted that a decline to $91,000 was the minimum expected, which would occur if Bitcoin breaks current support lines. He also disclosed that if the heavy support zone is breached, BTC could face further bearish pressure, potentially revisiting lower price levels around $90,540. Interestingly, Zwin’s bearish Bitcoin price prediction follows a recent price crash to $91,000 on Monday. During this sideways trading Bitcoin’s market sentiment has declined, with its bearish price action showing no signs of slowing down. Although Bitcoin’s price suffered a sharp fall, it has quickly recovered and is now trading at $93,893. Nevertheless, a price drop to Zwin’s projected $90,540 target would result in a Bitcoin crash of approximately 3.6% Alternative Bullish Scenario While he projected a bearish outlook for the Bitcoin price, Zwin provided an alternative bullish scenario that could trigger a rebound. According to the TradingView analyst, around $95,974 could be a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price. If BTC can break above the resistance lines, it could invalidate the bearish flag pattern, signaling a potential reversal to the upside.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 21:34:00

As the blockchain ecosystem enters what he calls the Age of Voltaire, Charles has made one thing clear: nothing—no one—is going to derail his plan to hand Cardano’s future to its community. “For those who know me well, this statement is nothing new,” Charles said , addressing both his supporters and critics. “I’ve spent ten years of my life on Cardano. Many mistakes were made, but I never crossed lines for a cash grab from the community or deviated from the original roadmap.” He’s digging in his heels for 2025, a year that will decide if Cardano can fully transition to a decentralized governance model. The final steps involve getting the blockchain’s budget and constitution approved—no small feat in a space where critics and competitors are quick to pounce. Charles has no plans to give up. “My last duty is to remove any roadblock for this transition. There is no way in hell anyone or anything is going to derail that process.” A decade of updates: How Cardano got here The platform has been grinding through years of updates, building out a blockchain that can scale, handle smart contracts, and—if you ask Charles—compete with the big dogs like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In 2024, the project reached some major milestones. First, there’s Plutus, Cardano’s smart contract platform. Plutus V2 launched in September 2022 with features like inline datum and reference inputs, but 2024 was the real game-changer. By August, Plutus V3 hit the scene, giving developers even more tools to build decentralized applications (DApps). As of press time, Cardano had about 105,500 smart contracts deployed. Compare that to just 8,083 at the start of the year, and it’s clear the upgrades worked. Then there’s Midnight, a new protocol aimed at making privacy a reality for Cardano users. Announced in late 2024, it’s designed to use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to unlock around $20 trillion in crypto assets currently out of reach due to regulatory barriers. Midnight is also about giving developers and users tools to keep their data secure. If it works, it could be one of Cardano’s biggest selling points. The Chang hard fork also landed in 2024, rocking Cardano’s governance model. This update let the community take the wheel, introducing Delegate Representatives (DReps) to handle voting on proposals. And let’s not forget Hydra, the layer-2 scaling solution. It’s been in development all year, promising to make Cardano faster and less congested. Hydra allows the network to process transactions simultaneously across multiple layers, which is very important as more DApps join the ecosystem. Charles faces critics and a changing market While Cardano has been busy updating its tech, Charles has had to fend off a steady stream of criticism. Some of it comes from outside the community—critics love to call Cardano overvalued, especially compared to its actual usage. A Forbes article even labeled ADA, Cardano’s native token, a “zombie crypto,” pointing to its $40 billion market cap despite relatively few functional applications. The internal drama hasn’t let up either. In November, a user on X (formerly Twitter) called Charles “the cancer of Cardano,” a comment that quickly went viral. While many in the community defended him, a poll later revealed that 43% of respondents were dissatisfied with his leadership. That’s a pretty big chunk of the user base. And then there’s the market itself. ADA’s price has been all over the place. It dropped to $0.34 after an $18 million token unlock flooded the market, but it managed to climb back up to $0.85 by the end of December. Meanwhile, Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) fell from $700 million to $478 million over the course of the year.

Shiba Inu burn rate drops, bullish signal appears According to data from Shibburn, there has been a massive drop in the amount of SHIB coins burned by the community.

On the other hand, the Shiba Inu price has declined by 5.24% on the weekly chart and 31.11% on the monthly level.

Ethereum is trading above the 50-SMA ($3,439.59) and 200-SMA ($3,012.00) which is a bullish sign. Additionally, the relative strength index is rising towards the midline, a sign that bulls are active. IntelMarkets entices investors with potential 20x surge Over the last few weeks, IntelMarkets has been one of the trending altcoins, following its 700% price pump. IntelMarkets is currently priced at $0.073273 and has raised more than $5.5 million in a record-breaking fundraising spree.

Data released on Dec. 30 revealed that December marked the highest monthly trading volume for DEXs, continuing the momentum from November. In November, the DeFi space recorded a volume of $374 billion, spurred by optimism surrounding a potential crypto-friendly regulatory regime in the United States after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Top DEXs by Trading Volume Uniswap remained the top decentralized exchange by volume, recording $106.4 billion over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama. PancakeSwap followed with $96.4 billion in trading volume for the month. Solana’s largest DEX, Raydium, claimed third place, registering $58 billion in monthly volume.

At the time of writing, the total market cap for memecoins stood at $95 billion, reflecting a 20% decline since Dec. 1.
