The recent price decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking by investors after the rally. However, despite this dip, the blockchain continues to attract significant interest from major holders. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend in a Wednesday tweet, revealing that the dip has triggered a wave of accumulation among Cardano whales . “Cardano whales took profits on the way up from $1.15 to $1.33, but after $ADA dropped to $0.91, they started buying again. In fact, they’ve bought 160 million ADA since the dip,” Martinez wrote. Further data reveals that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA, often called “sharks,” have seen a significant increase in activity during this accumulation phase. While frequently overlooked, this investor tier wields substantial influence in the market. Their cumulative buying or selling activity can notably impact price trends, often shaping broader market dynamics and signaling potential shifts in momentum. The continued accumulation of ADA reflects growing confidence in the Cardano ecosystem, which has been gaining momentum across multiple areas. Data from crypto analysis platform Taptools reveals that, over the past 30 days, the ecosystem has seen a substantial inflow of more than 3.78 million ADA into the market. During this period, Cardano has consistently maintained over 50,000 active daily traders on its decentralized exchanges (DEXs), underscoring its rising liquidity and expanding user base. Additionally, the surge in liquidity and active addresses signals a strong influx of new investors, further strengthening Cardano’s market position. Furthermore, as per data from DefiLlama, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has seen remarkable growth this year, reaching approximately $708 million earlier this month and surpassing previous all-time highs. Cardano has also been steadily gaining prominence in the cryptocurrency space, driven by its advancements in sectors such as DeFi, smart contracts, and scaling solutions like Hydra, attracting significant interest from larger institutional investors. On the price front, the accumulation of ADA by whales during market dips is a positive signal for retail investors. It suggests that the perceived “floor” price is around $0.90, which has recently been breached as a key support level, indicating the potential for a price rebound. ADA was trading at $0.85 at press time, reflecting a 0.14% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:23:21

According to the data , MakerDAO reached a peak of $40.86 million in fees, a key metric of user activity, and $26.77 million in revenue, reflecting retained earnings, between December 1 and December 31. A Historic Month for MakerDAO 2024 has also been the crypto lending protocol’s best year since its inception, making about $304 million in fees and over $174 million in revenue. At that time, the highest amount recorded for fees was in April, when the protocol received $32.62 million, while its best month in terms of turnover was November when it made $18.91 million. However, December’s numbers beat both those figures by $8.24 million and $7.86 million, respectively, setting a new precedent for the platform. Interestingly, MakerDAO also saw its highest single-day performance on December 9, bringing in $1.67 million in levies and $1.18 million in income. These earnings have been driven primarily by interest payments on loans made on the protocol’s DAI stablecoin, reflecting the increasing demand for its lending services. In August, the platform announced it would rebrand to Sky after two years of development aimed at adding new functionalities and improving user interactions. It also introduced two new cryptocurrencies: USDS, a stablecoin that users could convert from their existing DAI holdings, and a new governance token named SKY. USDS has also been launched on Solana as a DeFi-native stablecoin. The network has the second-largest decentralized finance ecosystem after Ethereum, with about $8.5 billion locked into its DeFi projects. MKR’s Market Performance Elsewhere, Maker’s native asset MKR experienced a less-than-impressive December. According to data from CoinGecko, the token lost 16.8% of its value over the last 30 days, with its worst performance coming in the previous two weeks, where it dipped by more than 21%. In the last 24 hours, its price fluctuated between $1,488 and $1,547, finally settling at $1,522. The current price is 1.1% below its previous level from yesterday and remains more than 75% below its all-time high, recorded in May 2021. However, it still shows healthy market activity, with its latest one-day trading volume of $113.1 million helping it maintain a significant value with a market cap of $1.37 billion.

Despite a fabulous rally in November, the entire market pulled back, and BTC now trades at around $93,000. Altcoins have dominated the headlines recently with continued gains as we near the altcoin season. Large-cap altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Stellar (XLM), grabbed attention for their immense gains in November and have the market on their toes as to what will happen with their prices when we finally enter the altcoin season. Join us as we explore the top gainers and potential winners as the altcoin season inches closer. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is another major gainer since Donald Trump’s election victory. On-chain metrics show Cardano’s weekly active addresses elevated since the crypto market rally triggered by Trump’s win on November 6 began. The surge in network usage and whale buying activity has resulted in a bullish outlook for ADA. ADA further surged after the Cardano blockchain developers, the Cardano Foundation, released an updated proposal for the Cardano Constitution to improve network governance. The revised proposal includes changes to constitutional workshops, social media discussion, and expert and community feedback. The changes aim to “improve the accessibility and clarity of the Cardano governance framework,” shifting its focus to a less technical audience. Interest in Cardano (ADA) surged after its founder, Charles Hoskinson, revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) made headlines in recent months for its massive gains. The Stellar network is similar to the Ripple (XRP) network - a decentralised payment platform and cryptocurrency that facilitates quick and low-cost cross-border payments, promoting financial inclusion for individuals and businesses globally. The Stellar network was created to support digital representations of any currency but has its native token called Lumens (XLM). Developed as a fork of the Ripple protocol, Stellar aims to create a global network connecting financial institutions, payment processors, and individual users, making cross-border money transfer easier and providing access to essential financial services. XLM, in conjunction with XRP, is expected to play a significant role in the new global financial system. XRP is uniquely designed to optimize institutional liquidity for cross-border transactions. At the same time, XLM’s infrastructure was built to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and retail-level remittances efficiently. Financial experts envision a two-tiered monetary framework using XRP and XLM at different levels for specific purposes. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $12.4 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 230%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Expected Surge Upon Exchange Listing As BTC trades at around $93,000 and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this powerful blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $680,000 and will soon reach its fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

While established tokens like Shiba Inu have already made waves, new contenders like BTFD Coin and SLERF are emerging with massive potential. BTFD Coin’s presale has been particularly impressive, raising over $4.6 million within its first month, and analysts are already predicting major gains. This all reminds us of the 1973 economic collapse when the world faced a significant downturn, but smart investors who bought during the chaos later reaped huge rewards. Is history repeating itself? If you’re wondering which meme coins offer the best investment opportunities right now, you’re in the right place. In this article, we’ll take a close look at BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and SLERF, comparing their presales, potential returns, and future prospects. We’ll also highlight BTFD Coin’s recent performance, which is turning heads as it continues to break records. With its exciting presale, community-focused features, and an all-new P2E game , BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin – it’s a movement. Meme coins have come a long way, from being niche crypto jokes to becoming a dominant force in the market. Over the years, we’ve seen projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu make waves, and now BTFD Coin and SLERF are looking to take that momentum even further. BTFD Coin, in particular, is building on this wave, offering not just meme coin appeal, but a gamified experience, staking rewards , and a referral program that could take it to the next level. Investors are flocking to it, and it’s easy to see why – it’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolutionising Crypto As the 13th stage of the presale unfolds, the coin is available for $0.000142. With over $4.6 million raised, the presale reached impressive milestones, including $1 million in under 10 days and $2.5 million in less than 14 days. The project boasts a vibrant community of 7,000+ holders, with more than 60 billion coins sold so far. What sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins is its focus on building a vibrant community and offering utilities like a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a referral program. This isn’t just about buying coins and waiting for a pump; it’s about engaging with the platform and earning rewards as you go. And with a killer bonus code – BIG50 – you can grab 50% extra coins . Looking back to the 1973 economic collapse, it’s easy to see how BTFD Coin’s current presale mirrors that kind of opportunity. When markets were down in the ’70s, those who bought into undervalued assets found themselves in a prime position when the economy recovered. Today, we’re seeing a similar scenario with BTFD Coin, where smart investors are buying in early to take advantage of the low presale price. And with the presale tally already crossing $4 million, it’s clear that this meme coin is gaining serious traction. BTFD Coin offers one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential , and if you’re not on board yet, now’s the time to act. As the presale progresses, the price will only rise, so getting in with the BIG50 bonus code is a no-brainer. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity – it’s only going to get better from here. Don’t miss the BIG50 festive bonus! Use code BIG50 to earn 50% more tokens. For example, purchasing 100 coins will reward you with 150. Secure $BTFD now and set yourself up for success. Shiba Inu: The King of Meme Coins Shiba Inu is often regarded as the “Doge killer” for its rapid rise in popularity and its reputation as one of the top meme coins on the market. Since its launch, Shiba Inu has seen massive growth, making early investors some serious profits. However, while Shiba Inu’s community and ecosystem are impressive, its potential for exponential growth is starting to plateau as the market matures. At its peak, Shiba Inu saw a massive surge in price, with people scrambling to get in before it skyrocketed. But now, its price has stabilised, and while it still has a large and loyal community, many investors are looking for the next big thing. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. With its innovative approach, including a P2E game, staking rewards, and an aggressive presale strategy, BTFD Coin is challenging the status quo and could easily surpass Shiba Inu in terms of growth potential. Just like Shiba Inu, BTFD Coin has captured the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts, but it stands out because of its unique offerings that provide value beyond just holding coins. This focus on utility, community engagement, and rewards is a key differentiator. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $4 million, and its trajectory shows no signs of slowing down. It’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, and if you’re still hanging on to Shiba Inu, now might be the time to diversify and add some BTFD to your portfolio. SLERF: The Underdog with Serious Potential SLERF is another up-and-coming meme coin that’s gaining traction in the crypto world. While it hasn’t yet reached the same level of recognition as BTFD Coin or Shiba Inu, its presale has been steadily growing, attracting a loyal following. Like BTFD Coin, SLERF offers a community-driven approach, with an emphasis on decentralisation and rewards for holders. SLERF has made a strong start in its presale, but it still has a long way to go before it can catch up with the kind of explosive growth that BTFD Coin has seen. With a similar low entry price and early-stage promise, SLERF presents an interesting option for investors looking for a meme coin with 100x potential. However, when comparing SLERF to BTFD Coin, it’s clear that BTFD’s presale strategy, utility offerings, and community-driven incentives put it in a prime position to outperform SLERF in the coming months. Both projects have a lot of potential, but BTFD Coin’s presale has already proven itself to be one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, thanks to its early success and growing community. It’s hard to deny that BTFD Coin is the front-runner in this race. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to get in on the action?

Bitcoin Reserves on Exchanges Shrink To New Lows,https://zycrypto.com/btc-skyrocketing-rally-bitcoin-reserves-on-exchanges-shrink-to-new-lows/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price faces a potentially massive rally as on-chain factors remain positive. Whales and institutional investors have repositioned assets to favor an uphill narrative ahead of 2025. This year, the crypto market dominated financial spaces with multiple all-time highs for some assets. Bitcoin Reserves Plunge to 2.4 Million BTC On-chain data shows declining Bitcoin reserves across exchanges, tipping a higher price action. This year, reserves on centralized exchanges dropped to 2.4 million from 3 million in January. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January led to declining numbers. Sequel to the approvals, the BTC price rose to new highs above $7k. Most whales withdrew assets from exchanges as funds trickled into the ecosystem. Outflows from exchanges point to an increased price action due to whales considering long-term holdings. Conversely, inflow to these platforms leads to sell pressure because of the popular sentiment associated with the transfers. Crypto analyst KriptoBaykusv2 explained that the presence of institutional investors sparked the status quo, seeing rapid inflows as a sign of more gains. Most traditional investors bought the dip and have maintained a hodl strategy. On the other hand, retail investors tend to move tokens on slight price changes, leading to BTC redistribution. “ This shift is particularly evident among institutional investors, who have increasingly embraced the “hodl” approach, demonstrating strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. As reserves dwindled, Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge. Starting the year around $40K, the price accelerated in November, surpassing the $100K milestone and setting a new peak at $104K.” As exchange balances drop, Bitcoin miner reserves spike following the price surge. The last bear market saw miners sell reserves to stay afloat. High prices result in a hodl strategy to maximize gains. Bitcoin Bulls Expect Massive Price Upticks Bitcoin enthusiasts have projected a massive price surge next year due to bullish industry and on-chain factors. The transfer of assets to other custodians shows a supply shock, which could be the catalyst for the needed price action. Several whales have also ramped up accumulations alongside top firms releasing their 2025 market outlook. In a new release, Bitfinex analysts noted that the market is positioned to see a price upswing, hitting $200K due to institutional activities. Similar firms have projected the same price range for the asset, citing favorable United States policies, among others.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:38:22

Rumors about a customer repayment plan for January 2025 have been dismissed by one of its major creditors, causing even more confusion. The news had circulated over the weekend. Many claimed that FTX would begin repayments on January 3 and distribute $16 billion to creditors within 60 days. However, a key creditor, Sunil, denied these claims, saying the timeline and payout were inaccurate. Sunil Clears the Air on January Repayment Plan In a recent X post, Sunil, an FTX creditor advocate, denied claims about a January repayment date. He explained that the date was wrong and provided an update on FTX’s recovery. He revealed the exchange has recovered $13 billion from debtors, potentially reaching $14 billion by March 2025. However, he warned creditors not to expect an immediate payout as the situation remains uncertain. The confusion stems from FTX’s plan to keep half the recovered funds. Sunil explained that FTX will hold 50% of the $13 billion for future needs, leaving just $7 billion for the first round of payouts. This means the repayment will be slower and smaller than expected, with creditors initially receiving only part of their claims. FTX Debtors to Receive Full Reimbursement in 2-3 Years For those hoping for full compensation soon, Sunil added more caution. He said that reimbursing creditors could take two to three years, much longer than the earlier promise of quick repayment. This has left many customers questioning the truth behind FTX’s recovery plans. Amid the confusion, many users are looking for a clearer repayment schedule. Earlier this month, a tweet from the official FTX account suggested repayments would start in January. This led a user to ask Sunil about the conflicting information. With no clear answers yet, these uncleared questions fuel ongoing frustrations. Legal Hiccups and Missed Opportunities To add another layer to the ongoing controversy, earlier decisions in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings have left many creditors feeling cheated. Earlier, presiding judge John Dorsey made a notable ruling. He allowed the exchange to repay creditors based on the monetary value of a user’s balance at the time of the bankruptcy filing. This meant creditors missed out on the potential profits from the rise in cryptocurrency prices, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, Bitcoin was priced at $16,871 and Solana at $16.25. This is much lower than their values as of writing.

In that time frame, monthly volumes totaled $182 million, $167 million, and $135 million in October, November, and December, respectively. The network’s popularity among retail users is rising due to its efficiency and cost. Institutions have also played a part as inflows lead to more market transactions. According to the analysts, the decline of TON enabled Tron to take the top spot, coupled with Tether’s activity. In previous months, Telegram-based games took over the ecosystem, with the network being a huge beneficiary. Inflow to the ecosystem began to decline as momentum shifted to other networks. Furthermore, Tron’s USDT volume is another driver of bullish activity. This comes on the heels of retail crypto traders ramping up gains on the back of the market surge. What Next For TRX Price? Amid huge inflows, TRX surged to new highs, recording huge community activities. The asset’s rise was linked to its transaction volumes, and gains were seen in wider crypto events. The United States election was a major driver of crypto prices this quarter. After the polls, the asset hit a new all-time high above $0.45 before sharply declining. It should be noted that Justin Sun’s announced of a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance. However, the wider market crash saw the asset record a 40% correction, although the bull signal increased on-chain data. According to CryptoQuant, a custom indicator based on the combination of RSI and MACD points to a move away from the overbought zone. This is a sign of incoming bull activity with healthier conditions from investors. Ahead of next year’s projected rally, institutional investors are repositioning assets and whales ramping up tokens. “ The next steps are crucial. If we see an “oversold” signal in the coming days, it could present a solid buying opportunity for those aiming to capitalize on the continuation of Tron’s bullish momentum. For now, patience is key. Monitoring this custom indicator and staying updated on market trends will be vital to identifying the right moment to re-enter Tron,” the report added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|TON,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:54:37

Now, Nvidia is reportedly going to open-source the software. Run:ai posted the latest news on its website and revealed Nvidia’s plans to open source its software. Regulators from both sides of the Atlantic probed Nvidia on antitrust grounds While neither of the companies explained the intention, Venture Beat suggests this might not be hard to figure out as Nvidia has ballooned to be the most valuable company in the world at $3.56 trillion. Despite its size, it also becomes difficult for the chip-making giant to acquire companies because of antitrust oversight. The acquisition faced some hurdles after the EU Commission indicated in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the proposed transaction would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to Reuters , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks, but eventually concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. The Department of Justice also investigated Nvidia over the transaction on antitrust grounds. Now, after finally sealing the deal, a Nvidia spokesperson only said in a statement: “We’re delighted to welcome the Run:ai team to Nvidia.” However, Run:ai founders Omri Geller and Ronen Dar indicated in a statement that open-sourcing the software will help the community build better AI, faster. “While Run:ai currently supports only Nvidia GPUs, open-sourcing the software will enable it to extend its availability to the entire AI ecosystem.” Geller and Dar. The Israeli startup founders also added that this will continue to help their customers get the most of their AI infrastructure and offer the ecosystem maximum flexibility, efficiency, and utilization for GPU systems, whenever they are. The Nvidia – Run:ai transaction to help customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure The two founders also revealed that they will continue to strengthen their partnerships and work alongside the ecosystem to give customers various AI solutions and platform choices. “True to our open-platform philosophy, as part of Nvidia, we will keep empowering AI teams with the freedom to choose the tools, platforms, and frameworks that best suit their needs,” said Geller and Dar. The Israel-based startup revealed that its goal when it started in 2018 was to be a driving force in the AI revolution and empower organizations to unlock the full potential of their AI infrastructure. According to VB , the company helps its customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure, enhance efficiency, and utilization as well as boost the productivity of their teams. “We are thrilled to build on this momentum, now as part of Nvidia. AI and accelerated computing are transforming the world at an unprecedented pace, and we believe this is just the beginning,” the Run:ai founders said. “GPUs and AI infrastructure will remain at the forefront of driving these transformative innovations and joining Nvidia provides us an extraordinary opportunity to carry forward a joint mission of helping humanity solve the world’s greatest challenges,” they added. While Nvidia has for long been making graphics chips that have become useful in running AI software, the company is also now emphasizing software. Nvidia controls about 80% market share of AI graphics processors. The Run:ai acquisition therefore now relates to giving their customers efficiency and flexibility for GPU orchestration software. The two companies have been collaborating since 2020 and have joint customers. Nvidia first announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). This delayed the conclusion of the transaction as it was under probe before it got approved earlier this month. When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources.

This Engineer Thinks So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/will-bitcoin-enter-its-most-massive-bull-cycle-this-engineer-thinks-so/,"Although Bitcoin is having a rough moment this week, with prices oscillating between $93k and $96k, at least one popular crypto commentator is predicting a massive price run soon. According to Ted Boydston, the market should prepare for a manic bull run in the coming days, with Bitcoin’s price targeting $225k. Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset? CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move Boydston highlights the price oscillator on M2, which offers real-time buy and sell signals for traders and investors. He then explained that the tool recently displayed a buy signal. And if history repeats itself, Boydston expects Bitcoin to begin its price surge, benefitting holders and investors. Bitcoin And Its M2 Price Oscillator Chart Boydston, a popular crypto commentator and engineer, offers a fascinating insight into Bitcoin’s recent price action. Although Bitcoin’s price has recently slipped, he sees a potential price surge soon. Except for the 2016 Bitcoin cycle, a price oscillator on M2 has provided well timed buy and sell signals.

Since the M2 money stock considers liquid cash circulation, including checking deposits, physical cash (M1), money markets, and savings, the chart provides an interesting perspective on an asset’s possible direction. As such, this technical chart and indicator offer helpful insights into the possible performance of assets, including those in the crypto niche. A Bitcoin Bull Run Soon?

Investors can expect increased volatility and Bitcoin price appreciation if this scenario plays out. Traders and investors have relied on this technical analysis for years, offering correct predictions, except in 2016. The chart didn’t flash the buy signal then, but the price went up after the Bitcoin halving event. Bitcoin’s Future Price Action Crypto analysts targeted the $100k mark for Bitcoin a few months ago. Now that this was already achieved in December, many analysts are setting their sights on new targets. Some analysts claim that Bitcoin’s short-term target is $150k, while others speculate that the asset could hit $1 million.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 23:08:00

The debate gained momentum following public statements from Rick McCracken, a prominent figure in the Cardano community, who raised issues about leadership and organizational transparency. This has sparked widespread discussions about community oversight and the future of Cardano’s ecosystem governance. Charles Hoskinson Addresses Cardano Foundation Oversight Charles Hoskinson has been keen to assert the Cardano Foundation ’s commitment to the principle of decentralisation and, in particular, the need for community supervision over the foundation. He pointed out that the Foundation is not affiliated with IOHK (Input Output Global) or Emurgo, the other two main stakeholders in the ecosystem. Hoskinson said, “This isn’t a Charles versus CF debate… This is a discussion on the issue of whether the community foundation should be answerable to the community. He noted, however that the Cardano Foundation’s $600 million ADA treasury has no direct representation of the community regarding its utilization. In his view, the Foundation’s lack of enthusiasm in supporting grants and funding for projects like Catalyst can hinder the growth of the ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson also pointed out that this approach may lead to future problems in the ecosystem sustainability, especially in the case when major contributors like IOHK are expected to work without proper motivation. Rick McCracken’s Concerns About Transparency and Leadership Rick McCracken, a Cardano supporter, raised some questions about the transparency of IOHK, which he said is evident by the negative reviews published on Glassdoor. McCracken raised issues over decision making within leadership and the overall direction of the ecosystem, and advocated for change in governance. Charles Hoskinson’s reply to McCracken’s statement was that the comments made were quite “distasteful” and “disappointing”. He pointed to the fact that IOHK has had some issues, such as the need to cut down on its workforce during bear markets, but has always remained focused on the ecosystem. Hoskinson apologized for McCracken’s words and said, “I’m sorry that your ego got hurt, Rick; you are not doing any good to the community with your actions.” CIP-1694 and Cardano Constitution Updates Charles Hoskinson has recently provided updates on Cardano’s governance initiatives. He highlighted the progress made since the launch of the governance workstream during the Age of Voltaire conference in late 2022. This initiative has resulted in CIP-1694, which outlines processes for decentralized governance, and a draft Cardano Constitution. The governance proposal aims to bring an end to the technical bootstrapping phase of Cardano’s on-chain governance. If enacted, it will establish a framework for decentralized decision-making, allowing the community to have a greater role in governance. Charles Hoskinson reiterated that the governance process has involved extensive community discussions over the past two years As governance discussions continue, ADA price has experienced fluctuations amid broader market trends. Over the past two weeks, ADA price has dropped significantly from $1.3264 to lows of $0.7620. However, some analysts believe the decline may have reached a bottom. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Consulting, has suggested that ADA price could bounce back from the $0.7460 support level. He noted that the token’s performance in 2024 suggests potential for further growth, with possible resistance near $1.2430. At press time, Cardano price was trading at $0.854, a 0.11% decline from the intra-day high of $0.8962. Despite this, Van de Poppe expressed optimism about ADA’s long-term growth potential, citing its recent 300% rise from November lows as part of a broader bull market cycle.

Per El Pais , “digital” alternatives are now displacing the “gray dollar” for Venezuelan citizens. Venezuelans Still Keen on Crypto The report’s author noted that while the “crypto accepted here” signs that were “once prominent in shops, hotels, and restaurants in Venezuela” have long disappeared, “this does not mean that Venezuela’s crypto economy is not flourishing.” The media outlet wrote that Venezuelans are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and other coins to make easy transactions, receive remittances, and “take refuge from the devaluation of the [fiat] bolivar.” The newspaper added that while crypto exchanges are “not illegal” in the country, they are also “unregulated.” The Government of Nicolás Maduro reportedly “tolerates” unregulated crypto exchange “because it has become a way to bring foreign currency into the country.” The Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro with the late US President Jimmy Carter. (Source: Nicolás Maduro/Facebook) Maduro claimed victory in elections earlier this year. However, the United States has claimed that the elections were marred by “electoral fraud.” As a result, the newspaper explained, Maduro’s inauguration on January 10, 2025, has become “a date that is generating political and financial tension.” Maduro once pursued an aggressively pro-crypto policy, and even spearheaded the launch of a state-operated cryptoasset, the Petro (PTR). Reuters: Venezuela Opposition Adviser Holed Up in Argentine Residence Calls It 'Prison' https://t.co/j2EeDllp2h — nuprizm (@nuprizm) December 29, 2024 Mass Arrests However, this policy fell victim to widespread corruption, and led to mass arrests and the PTR’s eventual shutdown. But Maduro has recently spoken of “returning” to the crypto “path.” And the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis noted that “in the second quarter of 2024,” the Venezuelan Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) , and USDT markets grew by “an impressive 110% compared to the same period last year.” Chainalysis claims this rate is “higher than in any country in the [LATAM] region.” UN orders Venezuela not to destroy election vote tallies https://t.co/aE3KPPNJ0L — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) December 4, 2024 $20 Billion Inflow The media outlet explained that in 2024, an “estimated volume of $20 billion” has “entered the Venezuelan ecosystem” through crypto markets. This represents a sizeable chunk of the nation’s estimated $100 billion 2024 Gross Domestic Product. Despite its well-documented financial woes, Venezuela has battled against hyperinflation with some success. But the economy remains highly dependent on oil exports, and the specter of inflation refuses to vanish entirely. Inflation rose by around 4% in October, shooting up from under 1% in September. Some estimate that November ushered in a steeper rise yet. Venezuela's monthly inflation rate returned to double digits in November: 12.5%, a figure that had not been recorded since the beginning of 2023, according to the Venezuelan Financial Observatory (OVF). pic.twitter.com/l3rNCbxZPj — BowTiedMara (@BowTiedMara) December 6, 2024 And this, like elsewhere in LATAM, has driven many citizens to the stablecoins markets. Chainalysis claimed that between July 2023 and July 2024, 47% of crypto transactions worth under $10,000 involved stablecoins. “Stablecoins have become popular because they are pegged to more stable fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. They offer a hedge against the volatility of the Venezuelan bolivar. They play a crucial role in daily transactions and remittances.” Dan Cartolin, Enterprise Account Executive, Chainalysis. Guyana’s economy is the fastest-growing in the world, driven by a booming oil sector. But Venezuela is laying claim to its neighbor’s oil-rich region and the threat of a “resource curse” looms large.

The newspaper quoted a Venezuelan citizen named Vanesa as explaining that she provides crypto exchange services to her countrypeople using platforms like Binance. However, Vanesa lamented that the crackdown on crypto exchanges and the government’s own crypto operations have left people like her in limbo. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Latin American crypto exchange as stating that it had tried to apply for a virtual asset service provider license in Venezuela. But this platform said that it had given up because it was “impossible to deal with sudden changes” in the regulatory guidelines. In the wake of the crackdown, crypto-related “posters” have been “taken down” everywhere. Operations involving crypto are “becoming more discreet,” Vanesa added, concluding: “Everything is in the grey zone here. It is impossible to know if I am laundering someone’s money [when I am exchanging crypto for clients].” The post Venezuelans Ditching the Dollar in Favor of Crypto – Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Adoption|Venezuela,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-30 23:30:00

According to market data, the MSTR stock is down by 2.46% in After Hours trading after closing Monday’s session at 8.19% to $302.96. This stock price turnout has driven many debate on the cause despite the alleged correlation it maintains with the US Dollar. MicroStrategy Stock and the Bitcoin Levered Play Global industry commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter provided insights into what is happening with MicroStrategy and Bitcoin. Kobeissi noted that the decoupling in MicroStrategy stock and Bitcoin started about a month ago. Within that time, Bitcoin price has inked a mild 2% growth with MSTR down by more than 20%. While MicroStrategy is considered a levered Bitcoin play, the stock price’s divergence is to much. The Kobeissi Letter pointed out the firm’s business model which is to take on debt to buy more BTC. At the moment, the business intelligence firm has maxed out its debt funding sources including its shares. As reported by Coingape, MicroStrategy acquired 2,138 BTC on December 30, valued for $209 million. In order to keep making these purchases, it proposed raising its share count by 10 billion. This way, The Kobeissi Letter noted that MicroStrategy can continue borrowing against the stock to buy more Bitcoin. This will ultimately push BTC price higher and give its shares an allowance for growth. However, the current share slump hinges on how investors perceive the 10 billion share count proposal. If approved, it would dilute MSTR stock too much and if not, MicroStrategy will get stuck with its Bitcoin funding strategy. If the plan is approved, bears will say that this is a highly dilutive move for existing shareholders. However, if it is not approved, then MicroStrategy will be unable to continue buying #Bitcoin on leverage. Buying Bitcoin is obviously an integral part of $MSTR ‘s strategy. pic.twitter.com/D6qcb6fNoG — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 Despite this dilemma, The Kobeissi Letter hinted that Michael Saylor alone has a 46.8% voting power. With just 4% needed, chances are this stock count will gain the board’s approval. Here’s What The Future Holds Barring the funding challenges of the past week, MicroStrategy stock remains one of the best performing in the market this year. According to market data, MSTR is up 342% Year-to-Date (YTD) as compared to the S&P 500 Index that is up 24.54%. In the new year, MicroStrategy is poised to stabilize the best funding strategy to keep up with its treasury reserve agenda. Meanwhile, MSTR’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 might reboot the stock’s attractiveness overall. With Bitcoin also likely to rebound ahead of the pro-crypto Donald Trump inauguration, the stock’s big rebound is also possible. As MicroStrategy navigates its levered Bitcoin play, it is arguably setting a precedent for firms like Riot Platforms .

Table of Contents XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential Toncoin Shiba Inu Sui Hedera Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with some digital coins poised to make significant leaps. Several lesser-known cryptocurrencies are showing remarkable potential to climb the ranks. These altcoins are gaining momentum and could soon break into the top echelons of the market. XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential XYZ is emerging as a serious contender for a top 10 position. This sports-driven, meme-powered project is breaking barriers, looking to combine the viral appeal of meme coins with the global fervor of sports betting. With its unique approach and massive growth potential, XYZ is gearing up to redefine the altcoin landscape. XYZ isn’t just another altcoin — it’s a project built to thrive at the intersection of two explosive trends: meme coins and sports. Picture the excitement of a billion-dollar sports betting market infused with the viral momentum of crypto memes. XYZVerse will create a unique ecosystem where sports enthusiasts and crypto degens unite, unlocking massive potential for growth and community engagement. Recognized among the best new meme projects, XYZ has proven it has what it takes to dominate this niche. The XYZ presale is where the action begins. With a projected 7,400% surge by the Token Generation Event (TGE), early adopters have a golden opportunity to secure their position before the token explodes. XYZ stands leagues ahead with a solid foundation: audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for listings on major CEX and DEX platforms. With its unique value proposition and a rapidly growing community, XYZ is perfectly positioned to climb the ranks of the crypto market. The combination of transformative use cases, strong fundamentals, and an active user base makes this token a prime candidate for top-tier status. As XYZ continues to build momentum, it’s not just a hidden gem — it’s a shining star in the making. With its presale stages selling out at record speed, investors are looking to get in before XYZ cements its place among the top 10 altcoins. Interested investors can grab XYZ tokens and be part of the next crypto championship. Toncoin Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized and open-source blockchain. It was originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the ‘Gram’ token. However, Telegram discontinued the project in May 2020 due to regulatory issues. Since then, the non-commercial TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over its development. Based on historical price movements, Toncoin’s price could reach as high as $30.30 by 2025. This represents a potential gain of 348.18% compared to today’s price. By 2030, it could hit up to $26.04, a potential gain of 285.24%. Toncoin’s ambitious goals and strong technology make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Its focus on speed, security, and low fees sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. With strong community support and ongoing development, Toncoin might become a significant player as the crypto market evolves. You might also like: XYZVerse prepares to dominate 2025 with a 25,000% surge, leaving SOL and AVAX behind Shiba Inu Shiba Inu was inspired by Dogecoin’s success but runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, show its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB’s approach sets it apart from other meme coins. Sui Sui is a blockchain platform designed for global use, offering security, power, and scalability. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model. This allows for efficient transaction processing. It also employs the Move programming language, known for its security features. Moreover, Sui focuses on user experience, aiming to remove common barriers in blockchain interactions with features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions. In a market where coins like Ethereum face high fees and slow speeds, Sui offers a promising alternative. Its technology could make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Hedera Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses something called hashgraph. This makes transactions really fast, cheap, and good for the environment. There’s no mining involved, so it uses less energy. HBAR is used to pay for transactions and to keep the network secure through Proof of Stake. Hedera’s technology promises quicker and more secure transactions than many other coins. Its low fees and high speed make it attractive for businesses, especially in finance. While some worry that its patented technology might limit community involvement compared to open-source projects like Ethereum, big companies are backing Hedera. As the crypto world looks for more efficient and eco-friendly options, HBAR could stand out as a promising choice for the future. Conclusion Though TON, SHIB, SUI, and HBAR are promising in the 2024 bull run, XYZ is the first all-sport meme coin, aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans globally.

The Gold Ticket from BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a standout option, delivering not only the best chances to win $1M USDT but also significant BDAG coin rewards, attracting both experienced participants and newcomers. While promising projects like Aave and Aptos navigate their own obstacles—Aave with market downturns, and Aptos trying to keep up its growth—BlockDAG’s approach of blending real incentives with a solid presale offers a richer value proposition to those taking part. BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket: Your Top Shot at $1M USDT BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket shines as the top pick in the $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, presenting the best chance to win the grand prize of $1 million.

In conclusion, within BlockDAG’s New Year campaign, the Gold Ticket stands out as the most advantageous option. It is designed for those who appreciate both the opportunity and strategic planning, making it the optimal choice for entering the new year poised for success and the best possible outcome. Aave Faces Steep Price Drop Amid Market Sell-Off Aave, a top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is undergoing a significant price correction as market participants cash in on recent rises. Following a sustained increase, Aave’s price is now experiencing heavy pressure, with indications of a looming sharp decline. This pattern is typical in the crypto market, where swift price increases often lead to large-scale sales, increasing market unpredictability. This downturn mirrors broader difficulties across the DeFi landscape, underscoring the importance of prudent trading practices. Analysis of Aave’s technical indicators also points to potential additional losses, with vital support levels endangered. However, such downturns may provide entry opportunities for those wishing to join the market more affordably. Aptos Eyes $19 as TVL Reaches $1.29 Billion Aptos is gaining traction as its Total Value Locked (TVL) reaches $1.29 billion, indicating strong growth in its ecosystem and user base. This increase reflects the platform’s rising role in the decentralized finance sector, bolstered by new user acquisition and strategic alliances. Aptos’ blockchain, celebrated for its scalability and efficiency, enhances confidence, suggesting a bullish outlook. With the price of APT nearing $19, market sentiment is bullish, fueled by broader adoption and solid platform fundamentals. Market analysts note the increasing DeFi activities on Aptos and its technological improvements as significant factors in its positioning as a prominent crypto player. As Aptos progresses on its developmental goals and enriches its ecosystem, it remains a key project to consider for sustained growth potential. The Bottom Line In today’s fluctuating market, BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket presents an appealing mix of strategic benefits and concrete incentives. As Aave navigates price volatility and Aptos advances its ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out by syncing market dynamics with user rewards. The Gold Ticket offers enhanced chances of winning and BDAG coin bonuses, providing a realistic option for both seasoned participants and newcomers. Focusing on substantial rewards and a solid structure, BlockDAG offers a focused and beneficial route for those seeking immediate and enduring value in the cryptocurrency market.

Solana Memecoins: Fading Hype Amid Market Challenges Solana memecoins have captured the imagination of the crypto world with their vibrant communities and potential for exponential gains.

While cryptos like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have made waves globally, newer tokens are looking to make their mark. One coin in particular, BTFD Coin, is drawing a lot of attention in th e meme coin community . This post is going to dive into some of the biggest best meme coin presales to Invest in December 2024 you should be keeping an eye on this December. We’ll compare BTFD Coin with two other meme coins: Pepe Coin and Just a Chill Guy. So, buckle up, because you might just find your next big investment. Meme coins have been a major part of the crypto landscape for years, but they’ve gained an even stronger following recently. Some investors are jumping into meme coins simply for the fun of it, while others see a serious opportunity for returns. But here’s the thing: you have to know which ones to invest in. BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin—it’s a token that combines community power, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , staking rewards, and an intriguing referral program. Plus, it’s already making waves in its presale stages. The rise of meme coins over the past few years has been nothing short of spectacular, but BTFD Coin is positioning itself to take things to the next level. With its already massive presale success, BTFD has become one of the most talked-about coins in the meme sector. Let’s dive deeper into BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Just a Chill Guy and see how they compare. BTFD Coin: A Strong Contender in the Meme Coin Space When you think about meme coins, you might envision a quick surge in price followed by a crash. But BTFD Coin is different. This token has shown incredible growth, and analysts are already predicting it could outperform many other meme coins in the long run. The presale is now in its 13th phase, with the token priced at $0.000142. So far, it has raised $4.6 million, surpassing milestones of $1 million in the first 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days. The project proudly counts over 7,000 holders, with 60 billion coins sold already. But what makes BTFD stand out? It’s the combination of community support, rewarding mechanisms, and its unique presale structure. The coin offers a referral program, staking rewards, and a P2E game that’s likely to bring in new users and maintain investor interest in the long term. It’s not just about memes; it’s about building a loyal, engaged community. Now, let’s talk about the economics behind this surge. Back in 1973, the global economy faced a catastrophic collapse, sparking a series of recessions worldwide. Investors who managed to buy during the chaos made massive profits when the economy rebounded. Today, the crypto market is a similar beast. With the presale stages advancing, this is the perfect time to get in before BTFD Coin hits the market. A lot of investors have been comparing this moment to the opportunity of buying during a market crash—buying the dip when prices are still low to maximise future returns. With the BIG50 bonus code available during the presale, investors can get 50% more coins, making this an even more enticing opportunity. The BIG50 bonus adds extra value! Use code BIG50 to receive 50% more tokens on every purchase. For instance, buy 100 coins, and you’ll get 150. Take advantage of this opportunity to invest in $BTFD today. Pepe Coin: A Familiar Meme Coin with a Loyal Following Pepe Coin has built a reputation as one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market. Drawing inspiration from the infamous Pepe the Frog meme, it quickly became a fan favourite in the crypto space. The meme coin has garnered a solid community of supporters and investors who believe in the potential for long-term gains. Unlike BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin’s presale has not seen the same astronomical numbers. However, it’s still holding strong, with a clear focus on maintaining a vibrant online community. Pepe Coin’s value is often driven by its meme status and viral marketing campaigns, so it tends to experience short bursts of growth followed by corrections. While Pepe Coin has its advantages in terms of visibility and community engagement, it lacks some of the innovative elements that BTFD Coin brings to the table. For example, while Pepe Coin might offer community-based rewards, it doesn’t offer the same staking options or referral programs that are built into BTFD Coin’s ecosystem. Moreover, like any meme coin, Pepe Coin’s price volatility makes it a risky investment. However, the community is loyal, and if the token continues to gain popularity, there’s a chance that it could see more significant growth in the future. But for those looking for a coin with more stability and a proven presale success, BTFD Coin might be the better option. Just a Chill Guy: A New Player with Potential Just a Chill Guy is the new kid on the block, offering a unique take on the meme coin space. With a catchy name and an easy-going vibe, it’s certainly got the attention of investors looking for something fresh. But, much like Pepe Coin, Just a Chill Guy’s presale has yet to match the explosive growth of BTFD Coin. The coin’s community is growing steadily, and its developers are focused on creating a relaxed, welcoming environment for investors. The concept is cool—who doesn’t want to invest in something called “Just a Chill Guy?” But while it’s an interesting project, it’s still in the early stages compared to BTFD Coin. Where Just a Chill Guy stands out is its laid-back marketing approach. Instead of focusing heavily on hype, it’s building a community based on inclusivity and fun. However, when it comes to features like staking, P2E games, and referral programs, Just a Chill Guy is still playing catch-up. For those who like the idea of meme coins with a lighthearted theme, Just a Chill Guy might be a good option. But if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious presale potential and rewards, BTFD Coin should be your go-to.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 00:23:00

Dogecoin Has Been Trading Inside A Long-Term Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez discussed a long-term pattern in which the weekly price of Dogecoin has been trading inside. The pattern in question is the Ascending Parallel Channel from technical analysis. A Parallel Channel refers to a consolidation pattern that forms when the price of an asset moves inside two parallel trendlines. The upper line is made by joining together successive tops, while the lower one connects bottoms. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators While the asset is inside the channel, it’s likely to face resistance at the top line and support at the bottom one. A break out of either of these levels could imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are three types of Parallel Channels: those parallel to the time axis, those with a positive slope, and those with a negative slope. The first type doesn’t have a specific name, but the latter two do; they are known as the Ascending and Descending Parallel Channels, respectively. Given how these two types have slopped trendlines, they correspond to phases of consolidation in the asset occurring to the upside or downside. Dogecoin has appeared to have been traveling inside one such pattern over the past decade, as the chart shared by the analyst shows. From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has been stuck inside this Ascending Parallel Channel throughout its history. The most recent retest occurred just earlier in the year when DOGE found a rebound off the bottom line. As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, DOGE’s current trajectory is reminiscent of the trend witnessed during the last two bull cycles. In each of those bull runs, the cryptocurrency saw an initial upward burst followed by a small decline that led to the bull rally proper. Over the last few weeks, Dogecoin has been going down, perhaps indicating that it’s in that stepping-stone decline phase right now. Going by what happened next in the past cycles, it’s possible the meme coin would soon start a rally that would find its top at the upper level of the Ascending Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals Based on how far away the channel’s upper level currently is, the analyst has noted that it would take Dogecoin a rally of 6,770% to reach there. It now remains to be seen if the Ascending Channel would continue to hold for the meme coin and if anything similar as in history would take place this time around as well.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Evaluating three crypto tokens that could deliver 10,000% gains before Bitcoin hits $150,000. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Dogwifhat: The next big meme coin Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Conclusion The development of the cryptocurrency marketplace carries on as new opportunities for significant growth appear. While there is a lot of talk about Bitcoin’s potential to hit $150,000, investors’ attention is now shifting to emerging tokens likely to give returns as high as 10,000% in a shorter time. Among these tokens, Rexas Finance (RXS) , Dogwifhat (WIF), and Hedera (HBAR) stand out. Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Rexas Finance seeks to shift the blockchain paradigm through transformative tokenization methods, bridging physical assets to the digital ecosystem. Starting at $0.03 when RXS began its presales, it now stands at $0.175 in stage 11. $33 million has been raised, with 381 million tokens sold so far, indicating high market confidence and investor interest. The Rexas ecosystem is about transformation, with tools such as the Rexas Token Builder, which will allow users to create tokens without programming knowledge. The QuickMint Bot will enable the community to build tokens on platforms like Telegram and Discord, allowing a broader audience and adoption. Rexas Finance’s listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has significantly increased its visibility and credibility. With an ongoing $1 million giveaway to attract a community and reward early adopters, RXS is set for significant growth. Its unique ecosystem and positioned approach make it a strong contender for the top crypto positions. You might also like: XRP, DOGE to lose their dominance to $0.175 crypto poised to turn $800 into $32,000 Dogwifhat: The next big meme coin Dogwifhat is taking the meme coin spotlight, having gained considerable traction with its branding and community backing. Currently, WIF is trading at $1.80 and has a market capitalization of $1.79 billion. Dogwifhat stands out through its roadmap, which includes plans for developing utility-driven applications and staking features. These aspects will provide an avenue for real value creation for meme coin holders while maintaining the essence of memes. Its community-oriented approach may help sustain demand and foster further adoption. Price forecasts for WIF suggest potential volatility. Analysts say the token can hit $15 within two years as it matures and its ecosystem thrives. This prediction aligns with its community growth and roadmap. Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Hedera has captured a significant market share through its cutting-edge Hashgraph consensus technique, offering high speed, security, and scalability. Currently valued at $0.2655 with a market cap of around $10.15 billion, HBAR has gained a significant position as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution provider. Hedera’s credibility, potential for global adoption, and recognition as one of the most powerful platforms are further enhanced by alliances with Google, IBM, and Boeing. Such partnerships will most likely circumvent the limitation of a lack of leverage in using Hedera’s platform in supply chain management, finance, and healthcare. There is optimism regarding the price of HBAR, with some analysts believing that by the year 2025, its value could rise to between $3 and $5. Such growth is anticipated as enterprises adopt Hedera and it continues to develop. Conclusion As Bitcoin continues its climb toward the $150,000 milestone, tokens such as RXS, WIF, and HBAR show relatively high potential for returns in shorter timeframes. In asset tokenization, Rexas Finance stands out with the development of new tools and its successful presale. Dogwifhat, as a memecoin with application utility, offers early investors a chance for significant returns. Coupled with enterprise solutions and industry partnerships, Hedera presents a compelling case for growth in the long term. RXS, WIF, and HBAR are all poised to generate massive gains before Bitcoin sets another record, with each having unique systems and robust market momentum.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Altcoin Sherpa tells his 236,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s got his eye on Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), a memecoin that was created by an anonymous developer referencing the “ideal memecoin” suggested by the artificial intelligence (AI) large language model Truth Terminal. Altcoin Sherpa says he’s looking to accumulate FARTCOIN even if it drops to as low as $0.65. “I’m filling a bit around $0.80ish, approaching my buys. Total buys = some at $1, more at $0.80, and I also moved some other buys to $0.65 in case they come. I want my average to be around $0.80 or lower though. Still think this is a good meme and I’m hopeful it doesn’t pull a goat/act/etc after being listed… Frankly, I am a bit scared that this trade is a bit too consensus to be honest. It’s a fantastic meme and hits many incredible narratives but it seems almost ‘too’ obvious. But still gonna fire and add.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, FARTCOIN is trading at $0.86, still within the trader’s accumulation zone. Besides FARTCOIN, the trader names two other altcoins on his radar for potential rallies. They include the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) and ai16z ( AI16Z ) – which claims to be an AI agent-staffed venture capital fund. Altcoin Sherpa also thinks that the bullish conditions in crypto will eventually return to rescue traders who are now trapped amid the market pullback. “If you’re underwater, all you have to do is wait a few more weeks and you’ll be saved by the market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SHIB and ADA holders shift to XYZ, a crypto gem ready for 9,600% growth. Table of Contents XYZ as the next big crypto contender Shiba Inu Cardano Conclusion Investors who once championed Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Cardano (ADA) are eyeing a new cryptocurrency that could deliver astounding returns. This up-and-coming token is stirring excitement with projections of a possible 9,600% increase in value. XYZ as the next big crypto contender Unlike the short-lived hype of many meme coins that have buckled under selling pressure, the XYZ token is designed with staying power. Backed by a robust roadmap and a community of dedicated supporters, it has everything in place to not just survive but thrive in the competitive crypto market. XYZ is currently in its presale phase, offering early participants a chance to secure significant discounts before its price skyrockets. Starting at $0.0001, it has already reached $0.001333 in its current stage, delivering impressive returns for those who got in early. With a final target price of $0.1, the projected 7,400% growth is more than just speculation — it’s a calculated opportunity for massive profits. XYZVerse isn’t just about hype — it’s about delivering real value. Unlike many meme coins that falter after their initial surge, this project is built on a foundation of strong fundamentals. Audited smart contracts, a detailed roadmap, and upcoming listings on major exchanges ensure that this token has a clear path to success. For those looking to break away from the stagnation of SHIB and ADA, this gem offers a chance to be part of a new wave of growth. Interested investors can take the XYZ side via presale . You might also like: 5 altcoins on the verge of joining the top 10 with massive growth Shiba Inu Inspired by Dogecoin’s success, Shiba Inu runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange showing its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for an NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB’s approach sets it apart from other meme coins. While Dogecoin relies mainly on community and celebrity endorsements, SHIB aims to build a robust ecosystem. This makes it an interesting player to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Cardano Cardano is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible, scalable blockchain designed for smart contracts. This means it can support decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. Its structure is also divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This boosts capacity, with the goal of potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. In the current market, ADA looks attractive due to its sustainable technology and growth potential. As more investors seek eco-friendly crypto options, Cardano stands out. While Ethereum is still dominant, Cardano’s advancements may position it as a strong alternative in the crypto landscape. Conclusion While SHIB and ADA remain solid choices, XYZVerse’s unique mix of sports and memes positions it for remarkable growth in the 2024 bull run.

Table of Contents Early Rollblock investors set to earn huge XRP sees progress Sui could benefit from Trump’s inauguration Rollblock stands out Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as a dominant crypto force, potentially surpassing XRP in 2025. Unlike SUI, Rollblock stands out with its play-to-earn online casino and robust tokenomics. Backed by a deflationary RBLK token model and growing popularity, Rollblock seeks to offer both immediate rewards and long-term potential. With analysts predict exponential growth for Rollblock, its unique blend of utility and earning potential positions it as a top contender in the crypto market. Early Rollblock investors set to earn huge Rollblock is the first Ethereum-based play-to-earn casino. The platform will host over 7000 casino games and thousands of players daily. Rollblock will feature traditional casino games, unique Web3 options, and live sports betting across dozens of countries, providing something for everyone. The RBLK token will power the Rollblock ecosystem. The platform’s deflationary model will use casino revenue to buy back and burn tokens weekly, reducing supply while redistributing a portion as staking rewards. This model strengthens tokenomics and ensures real utility. RBLK is priced at $0.044 in presale stage 9, and it’s generating excitement among investors as analysts anticipate an 800% value appreciation. Rollblock’s presale increases liquidity for its online casino and offers a sensational opportunity for early investors. Once the presale ends and the token is listed, holders will receive weekly dividends. You might also like: AI predicts this new altcoin to mimic XRP and Solana’s success XRP sees progress XRP is gaining momentum on the charts after a recent market correction. Its value has increased by 11.6% in the past week, mirroring the broader crypto market as Bitcoin climbs towards $100k. Analysts suggest that XRP could reach $3 if this momentum continues. A prominent analyst, XRP Whale, forecasts that XRP’s price might rally to $3.3 in the coming weeks. Their chart analysis shows XRP trading within an asymmetrical triangle, with the $2.5 level being a critical breakout point. Another expert, Mikybull Crypto, shared a bullish outlook, suggesting XRP’s next target could be $4. Technical indicators support these bullish predictions. The Hull Moving Average and VWMA both display buy signals, pointing to a potential surge. Beyond price action, Ripple’s XRP Ledger has hit a significant milestone. The ledger count exceeded 93 million and is set to surpass 100 million in the future. This milestone shows the adoption and utility of XRP within the crypto ecosystem. Sui could benefit from Trump’s inauguration SUI has been making significant strides, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) hitting $1.8 billion. Investors remain confident, reflecting “Extreme Greed” in market sentiment and maintaining consistent on-chain volumes between $400 million and $600 million. Currently trading near $4.13, analysts expect SUI to surge to $23.77 by 2030, driven by its adoption in DeFi and gaming. Recent market corrections caused SUI to drop by about 13% in the last week, mainly due to profit-taking and holiday-related withdrawals. This dip presents an opportunity to buy SUI at a lower price. Many believe that SUI is an ideal investment, especially with the upcoming inauguration of a pro-crypto US president on January 20th. This event could fuel the crypto bull run and push the market to new heights. Rollblock stands out The market is preparing for a bull run, and altcoins are suitable investment choices. Sui, XRP, and Rollblock could provide diversification and growth potential to crypto portfolios. Rollblock, in particular, offers a unique opportunity. Investors can purchase Rollblock directly from the platform’s website for $0.044. With its promising features and affordability, Rollblock stands out as a valuable addition for those seeking long-term crypto investments.

Qubetics ($TICS), the world’s first Web3 aggregator, is making waves with its cutting-edge QubeQode platform.

This article delves into why these projects are must-haves for any discerning investor. Qubetics($TICS): The Web3 Aggregator Redefining Blockchain Utility Qubetics($TICS) has emerged as a trailblazer in the blockchain space, offering solutions that bridge decentralised technologies through its Web3 aggregator platform. Currently in its 15th presale phase, Qubetics($TICS) has raised $8.3 million, with 391 million tokens sold and over 12,600 holders onboard.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 01:52:00

Table of Contents Avalanche to hit $75 by February Sui about to overtake Shiba Inu Lunex Network raises over 5.6M in funding Top altcoins to watch A top analyst has predicted the value of Avalanche (AVAX) could reach $75 by January, which indicates a very bullish move. At the same time, Sui (SUI) might outshine Shiba Inu (SHIB) in terms of market cap in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the most exciting project analysts are bullish about is Lunex Network (LNEX) . They have tagged it the next 10x coin given its unique features and low market cap. Avalanche to hit $75 by February The ongoing market correction has affected Avalanche pushing it to former lows. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the crypto’s price has dipped by 8.50% on the weekly chart. AVAX is currently consolidating between $33.90 and $42.50. Nevertheless, analysts like Lucky predict the Avalanche price could reach between $150 and $200 in the coming months. AMCrypto told his followers the ongoing correction in the market was almost over. He forecasts the price of AVAX might rally to $75 by February 2025. Most of AVAX’s technical indicators are in the neutral zone. The relative strength index is currently moving close to the midline. Crossing this level could set Avalanche for a massive price rally. Sui about to overtake Shiba Inu The Sui coin is among the fastest-growing altcoins in the market right now. Sui has remained range-bound around its record high of $4.93 set last week. This rally pushed the market cap of the altcoin to $12 billion. The sustained increase in the Sui coin price has made it a contender to overtake Shiba Inu in terms of market capitalization. This close proximity makes Sui among the top crypto coins. CoinMarketCap data shows SUI’s value has dropped by 12.80% on the weekly chart. However, it is up 18.45% on the monthly level and 396.52% on the yearly timeframe. Ash Crypto forecast the value SUI could skyrocket to between $6 and $8 in the coming weeks. Another analyst called Mags noted the Sui crypto price might rally to $40 this cycle.

Solana Network Activity & LINK Price Rises,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-ama-reveals-major-plans-for-2025-solana-network-activity-link-price-rises/,"Solana’s network activity has reached unprecedented levels, with a transaction count of 67.77 million in a single day, showcasing robust user participation. At the same time, activity from Chainlink whales has increased significantly, with substantial transactions indicating a strong belief in its long-term value. In the middle of these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) remains a focal point. The latest AMA in December shared vital updates, such as new community initiatives and strategic plans for 2025. The presale for BDAG has been notably successful, gathering $174 million with 17.6 billion BDAG coins distributed to over 170,000 unique holders. As a top crypto coin to watch, BDAG is recognized for its innovative solutions to blockchain scalability and engaging its users effectively. Solana Network Activity Peaks with Record Transaction Volumes Transaction activity on the Solana network has demonstrated resilience, reaching a 12-month high with 67.77 million transactions processed in 24 hours. This surge in Solana network activity has sparked expectations of a positive market shift, especially as SOL’s price finds support within a crucial Fibonacci retracement range between $192.56 and $175.74. The Total Value Locked (TVL) has also hit an impressive 56.05 million SOL, indicating strong engagement within the ecosystem. Analysts believe the increasing Solana network activity could foster more natural demand, possibly aiding in SOL’s price recovery. With derivatives funding rates turning favorable and reduced spot market outflows, the enhanced network performance combined with supportive technical indicators suggests Solana might be setting up for an upcoming breakout. Are Chainlink Whales Preparing for a Significant Price Increase? Chainlink whales are on the move, undertaking substantial transactions that hint at an upcoming price surge. The latest figures show that nine new whale accounts have moved 362,380 LINK tokens, valued at over $8.19 million, from Binance in just two days. This move corresponds with a technical formation known as a double-bottom at $20.12, suggesting a bullish turn. Market watchers are targeting the $30 mark, predicting a 35% rise from its present valuation. On-chain dynamics are favorable, with rising transaction volumes and dwindling exchange reserves pointing to diminishing selling pressure. The accumulating actions of Chainlink whales, along with positive technical signs, reinforce the anticipation of a notable price recovery soon. BlockDAG’s AMA Showcases Project’s Success BlockDAG’s recent AMA session strengthened its commitment to a clear, community-focused approach. This session spanned topics such as sponsorships, upcoming exchange listings, improved support systems, and an official mainnet launch set for 2025. This user-oriented strategy is visible through community-led governance, where thousands contribute to key decisions. The project’s frequent AMAs foster a clear and open environment, enhancing trust and participation within the BlockDAG ecosystem. BlockDAG’s presale achievements are impressive, raising over $174 million and distributing more than 17.6 billion BDAG coins. Early adopters have seen substantial returns, achieving a 2240% ROI. With the current price at $0.0234 in batch 26, it presents an attractive opportunity for newcomers. As the presale approaches the next batch, the growing interest underscores BDAG as a top crypto coin to watch. Continuing with the tradition of community-driven AMAs, the latest in December highlights BlockDAG’s dedication to integrating community feedback into critical decisions. This approach, along with a successful presale, positions BlockDAG as a standout among crypto coins to watch. As the project nears significant exchange listings and unveils more of its ecosystem potential, the increasing excitement hints at a promising future for the platform and its expanding community. Top Crypto Coins to Watch Now Solana’s network activity illustrates the blockchain’s robustness with peak transaction numbers, while Chainlink whale movements suggest heightened interest from key players. Concurrently, BlockDAG keeps drawing attention with its presale surpassing $174 million and over 17.6 billion BDAG coins sold. The latest AMA spotlighted community-centric strategies and the awaited Mainnet launch in 2025, securing BlockDAG’s spot as one of the top crypto coins to watch . For those seeking a project with growth potential and strong community support, BlockDAG presents a compelling chance. With accelerated adoption and presale batches selling quickly, now might be the perfect time to secure BDAG before prices escalate.

Despite already being underperformed in the recent bull run, Ethereum has now experienced a notable correction, dropping to as low as below the $3,500 price level in recent weeks. While this price performance from ETH might have led investors to lose interest in Ethereum for now, recent data from the CryptoQuant platform suggests a possible turnaround, with key indicators pointing towards renewed market confidence. Related Reading: Is Ethereum Ready To Break Out? Key Indicators Suggest Strong Market Confidence Funding Rates Indicate Renewed Confidence Among Traders A CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanBTC, highlighted Ethereum’s futures market developments in a recent analysis titled “Ethereum Futures Market Signals Potential Rebound After $3K Correction.” The analysis from Shayan reveals that the futures funding rates, which act as a sentiment gauge for traders, have shown signs of stabilization after the price drop, hinting at a potential recovery. According to the analyst, Ethereum funding rates have shown an increase after the recent sharp correction, indicating a higher appetite among traders for long positions. Notably, funding rates are a mechanism in perpetual futures contracts where traders holding long positions pay short sellers, or vice versa, depending on market sentiment. When funding rates rise, it typically suggests that traders are leaning towards a bullish outlook. Shayan disclosed that the spike in funding rates implies increased demand for Ethereum at its current price level, signaling that traders expect a bounce-back from the $3,000 region. The analyst further explained that such behavior often precedes significant upward price movements, particularly when combined with a period of market consolidation. In his words: The recent spike in funding rates suggests an influx of buyers, which, if sustained, could drive a substantial bullish rebound. This renewed buying pressure has the potential to push Ethereum toward the crucial $4K resistance in the short to mid-term. Ethereum Market Performance After weeks of consistent decline, Ethereum currently trades at a price of $3,310, at the time of writing down by 1.5% in the past day. This market price marks a 32.2% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Interestingly despite the drop in ETH’s price, the asset has still managed to see a slight increase in trading volume in the past day.

On Binance, the token reached an intraday low of $1.99, showcasing the strong selling pressure currently endured by the crucial support level. XRP, which rallied 230% since November on hopes of Trump’s victory securing the regulatory free pass for the US crypto companies, has been seemingly stuck in a consolidation phase since the beginning of December after exhausting the bullish momentum from post-election euphoria. The rally, initially fueled by speculation around the possible resolution of the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, can no longer be sustained in the absence of positive regulatory and policy development, and retesting the levels below $2 may not be out of the table for XRP in the near perspective. Not even Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin debut could drastically improve the situation, only resulting in a short-lived pump that failed to hold. For context, RLUSD launched XRP Ledger and Ethereum on December 17 and currently sits at a modest market cap of $53 million. Despite the early stage of adoption, RLUSD saw a sharp rise in trading volume that soared 191% over the last 24 hours. While RLUSD is enjoying the spotlight, XRP faced significant liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $4.46 million of long and $3.34 million worth of short positions wiped out as the price briefly dipped below $2 and then bounced back. The price decline coincides with a decrease in open interest, which currently stands at $1.9 billion, a far cry from $4.3 billion at the beginning of December, as per CoinGlass data. The combination of low XRP price and low OI suggests that traders are closing their positions, seemingly confirming the suspicion that the current price drop is driven by liquidations and profit-taking rather than bears betting against XRP. Should this be the case, the XRP price is likely to stabilize soon in the absence of sustained selling pressure. The exchange volume dropped as well to $3 billion over the past 24 hours, a 50% decline from a week ago. This reduced exchange volume, combined with shrinking open interest, points to waning interest from both bulls and bears amid the holiday-induced slowdown. As fever traders are active, there’s more room for potential volatility, since even modest buying or selling activity would be amplified by reduced market depth. While current indicators point to a rather short-lasting price slip, crypto analyst Dom maintains a rather bearish outlook, describing XRP's recent price action as “incredibly weak.” In their post on Twitter/X, the analyst explained that XRP risks a much more drastic drop in price if it falls into one of the so-called “liquidity voids,” the weak spots left behind if the price of an asset moves too quickly. During a strong bull run that XRP experienced in November, it didn’t have much time for the process of creating value, which happens when the price consolidates for some time at specific levels. The resulting areas of higher trading activity form “volume nodes” that often act as support or resistance. The current support at $1.90 for XRP holds the price from slipping into the liquidity void. However, it becomes weaker every time it is retested, so a slow grind-down through this key level may send XRP as low as t $1.60, the analyst estimates. Conversely, reclaiming the $2.40 resistance will likely trigger a new rally for the cryptocurrency. According to Dom, should BTC fall below $95,000, the odds of XRP breaking below $1.90 increase significantly. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $92.3k, down 1.33% over the last 24 hours. What does 2025 hold for XRP? Looking ahead, XRP’s next move will likely depend on renewed trading activity in early January, with Bitcoin’s performance shaping the direction for the altcoin till the Inauguration Day on January 20. After this date, traders’ attention will be focused on the policy changes brought by the new administration and developments in the Ripple vs SEC case. Among other potential catalysts for XRP price growth are Ripple’s IPO, XRP ETF approval, and the growing adoption of RLUSD. Ripple’s potential IPO, once postponed indefinitely due to the prolonged legal battle with the regulator, can be on the table again once the case is settled, which could boost both the company’s valuation and XRP’s credibility as a reliable investment. Similarly, the approval of an XRP-backed ETF would provide non-crypto-naive investors with hassle-free access to the asset, potentially driving billion inflows into the XRP market cap. Finally, the demand for RLUSD will strengthen the role of XRP as a bridge currency and allow the DeFi ecosystem of XRP Ledger to flourish.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 02:24:26

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. PropiChain (PCHAIN) predicted to outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) through its transformative platform. Table of Contents Dogecoin slides, liquidates long traders Analyst: PCHAIN will grow exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN could outperform DOGE in 2025 After an explosive rally starting in early November, Dogecoin (DOGE) is losing momentum after reaching a local high. This has prompted an analyst to pick PropiChain (PCHAIN) as one of the few altcoins that will surge in 2025. PropiChain is a real estate tokenization platform. The project is attracting investors eager to maximize profits in Q1 2025. One of its major selling points is its ability to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. With Dogecoin losing momentum, PCHAIN offers early investors potentially sustainable growth through its unique features and investor-driven tokenomics. Dogecoin slides, liquidates long traders Dogecoin has lost the momentum that took it to a high of $0.4759. The meme coin has lost 23.3% in the last 24 days. This has resulted in total liquidation reaching $11.18 million, with long position traders contributing $9.90 million. The waning momentum stems from low trading volume and market-wide decline. Analysts claim that Dogecoin could slide below $0.25 in Q1. With Dogecoin losing ground in the past weeks, holders are booking profits as they take a cautionary approach. Analysts say Dogecoin could underperform in 2025 if the altcoin season fails to kick in. Analyst: PCHAIN will grow exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN is a strong contender to earn investors substantial returns in 2025. The real estate altcoin is on course to surge 20,000%. At $0.011 during its ongoing token presale, early investors have a unique opportunity to earn massive returns. The altcoin has already raised over $1 million, a clear sign of its growing appeal. Investors are choosing PCHAIN, drawn by its approach to real estate tokenization . As a tokenization platform, PCHAIN will enable fractional ownership, allowing investors to own pieces of property. This model will democratize the market while allowing more investors to build wealth through real estate investments. Another key reason for PCHAIN’s growing appeal is its incorporation of AI features. With its AI-driven predictive market analysis, the platform will offer users valuable insights into future market trends, providing users with a competitive edge. You might also like: XRP price declines, but PropiChain gains momentum with its AI-powered real estate features Additionally, PCHAIN’s AI will be used in smart contract automation. This is an important feature that removes manual checks and intermediaries, making transactions faster and more efficient. It has made property management easier and is appreciated by property managers, landlords, and tenants. To keep the platform safe, BlockAudit has independently audited PropiChain’s smart contract. This builds trust among users and adds to its credibility. PCHAIN also ventures into the metaverse, seeking to offer users virtual property tours, staging, and meetings. This immersive technology will allow investors to scout properties remotely, saving users time and money. Furthermore, PCHAIN will turn to automated valuation models to offer AI-driven property appraisals. This feature will provide highly accurate, fair valuations free from human errors or bias. PropiChain’s users will benefit from receiving valuations that align with the current market conditions. PCHAIN could outperform DOGE in 2025 Dogecoin has enjoyed impressive gains in Q4 but has seen its momentum wane as the entire market goes into a downward correction. This is evidenced by Dogecoin losing 22% of its value in the past month. On the other hand, PCHAIN is just beginning its upward trajectory. Early investors gained 200% when its presale progressed from the first round to the second. That is not all. The project’s tokenomics and transformative features will help early investors potentially earn 20,000% gains, prompting whales and smart money to invest in its ongoing token presale. PCHAIN has been listed on CoinMarketCap. This has played a key role in showing investors that the project can be trusted. Analysts boldly claim that the project is set to hit its major milestones.

Today, December 31, 2024, alongside XRP, the majority of assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL), seem to be bleeding and raising concerns about when the price decline will pause. XRP Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, XRP has recently broken out of a descending triangle price action pattern and has shifted market sentiment. Meanwhile, the daily chart shows that XRP has successfully retested the breakdown level, potentially confirming that its price decline could continue until support is found. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment remains unchanged, XRP could drop another 10% to 12%, reaching the support level at the $1.83 mark. Hundred Million Worth XRP Outflow Despite this bearish outlook, traders’ and investors’ interest in the asset remains optimistic, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP’s spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of XRP tokens over the past few days. Source: Coinglass The outflow is an on-chain metric that reveals how much of the asset is being transferred from exchanges to unknown wallets, potentially indicating buying pressure and an ideal buying opportunity. Combining this on-chain metric with technical analysis, it appears that XRP is bearish in the short term. However, investors seem to be accumulating, indicating that they view this price decline as an opportunity to buy the dip. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.03, having experienced a price decline of over 4.5% in the last 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume surged by 90%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid the price decline.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-31 03:09:33

As of December 25, 2024, Cardano’s ADA token is trading at approximately $0.911857 USD, reflecting a slight decrease of 3.38% from the previous close. Latest Developments Cardano has recently implemented several Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) aimed at enhancing the network’s functionality. Notably, CIP-33 introduces reference scripts that can be attached to outputs, streamlining the validation process and reducing transaction sizes. Additionally, CIP-40 introduces collateral outputs, a new type of output designed to improve the overall scalability of the network. Why Did This Coin Make it to This List? Cardano’s continuous development and commitment to scalability and sustainability make it a strong contender for investment in December 2024. 3. Litecoin (LTC): The Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold Litecoin has long been considered the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, offering faster transaction times and a more efficient mining process. As of December 25, 2024, Litecoin’s LTC token is trading at approximately $108.46 USD, with a slight decrease of 1.37% from the previous close. Latest Developments Litecoin has recently seen increased adoption, with several major exchanges listing LTC and offering trading pairs with various fiat currencies. This increased accessibility has contributed to a rise in trading volume and market cap. Additionally, Litecoin’s integration into various payment platforms has enhanced its utility as a medium of exchange. Why Did This Coin Make it to This List? Litecoin’s established presence in the market, combined with its recent developments and increased adoption, solidify its position as a top cryptocurrency to consider for investment in December 2024. Conclusion Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics, Cardano, and Litecoin each present unique opportunities for investors in December 2024. Qubetics’ innovative solutions to blockchain interoperability, Cardano’s commitment to scalability and sustainability, and Litecoin’s established market presence and recent developments make them worthy considerations for your investment portfolio. As always, it’s essential to conduct thorough research and consider your financial goals before making investment decisions.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 03:17:00

Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Seen A Decline Recently The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin To Rally 6,770% If This Pattern Holds: Crypto Analyst This metric takes into account for the data of five factors in order to calculate its value: volatility, trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. When the value of the index is greater than 53, it means the sentiment shared by the majority of the investors is that of greed. On the other hand, it being under 47 implies fear is dominant in the sector. Naturally, the indicator being between these two cutoffs suggests a net neutral mentality. Now, here is how the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is like at the moment: As is visible above, the latest value of the indicator is 65, which implies the investors share a sentiment of greed. This is a sharp decrease from where the metric was yesterday, as the below chart shows. Even ignoring the decrease in the past day, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has been going downhill for a while now. The reason behind this worsening in the sentiment is the price decline that BTC has been going through lately. The index’s value was 73 yesterday, which is quite close to a special region known as the extreme greed. The market is said to be holding this sentiment when the index is at 75 or higher. For most of this month, the indicator has actually been inside this zone, as a result of the hype of the cryptocurrency exploring new highs above the $100,000 mark. Historically, Bitcoin has actually tended to move in the direction opposite to what the crowd is expecting, with the probability of such a contrary move occurring only growing the more the investors become sure about a side. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators Extreme greed is a territory where tops have often occurred for the BTC price as this likelihood is the strongest there. There is a similar region for the fear side as well, called extreme fear and occurring at 25 or lower. With the Bitcoin sentiment seeing a notable decline recently, the asset’s price may no longer be at risk of seeing another major correction. The sentiment is still that of greed, however, so another rally may also not be too likely to happen. BTC Price Bitcoin has furthered its drawdown in the last 24 hours, with its price now dropping to $91,900.

38330046,https://square.htx.com/?p=42272,1735616674,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,Launch of the HTX DAO Forum: A New Dawn for Exchange Governance,https://square.htx.com/launch-of-the-htx-dao-forum/,"In December 2024, HTX DAO announced the official launch of its governance forum, ushering in a new era of innovation for global crypto community governance. This move represents more than just a new feature; it also marked a historic step for exchanges, transitioning from traditional centralized management towards decentralized autonomous governance model. *Forum Link: https://htxdao.discourse.group/ The Significance and Features of the HTX DAO Forum The forum serves as a vital bridge between community members and the decentralized governance structure. Key functions include: 1. Platform for Proposals and Discussions: The forum provides a public platform for users to submit governance proposals and engage in discussions. 2. Transparent Governance Mechanisms: By keeping a record of all proposals and discussions, the forum ensures a fully transparent governance process. Users can review the context and rationale behind every decision to ensure fair governance. 3. Development of HTX Improvement Proposals (HIPs): The forum acts as the breeding ground for proposal drafts. This is where users exchange ideas, build consensus, and refine proposals before they are put to the vote. In short, the HTX DAO Forum is the central hub of the decentralized governance ecosystem, seamlessly integrating users with the governance system. This fosters a transparent, efficient, and user-driven environment for HTX DAO’s growth. HTX DAO Reshapes the Relationship Between Exchange and Users The HTX DAO Forum is more than just a tool; it marks a paradigm shift in the relationship between the HTX exchange and its users. By granting decision-making power to $HTX token holders, the platform transitions from a pure financial service provider to a collaborative community governed hub. Exchange governance evolves from a one-way service model to collaborative participation, where user proposals and needs are embedded into the platform’s operations. This shift from a “service provider” to a “co-governor” repositions the exchange as a genuine Web3 organization, which leverages decentralized technology to build an open, transparent, and community-driven ecosystem. Unlike traditional institutions, Web3 prioritizes user autonomy, collective decision-making, and equitable sharing, allowing every participant to share in the ecosystem’s growth. This represents the nascent stage of a crypto finance hub in the metaverse, a future financial ecosystem belonging solely to the crypto ecosystem. Diverse Possibilities for Exchange Governance The launch of the HTX DAO Forum opens doors for community collaboration and multifaceted innovation. From proposing governance initiatives to steering ecosystem development, every user can play a pivotal role. This bottom-up approach will unleash the community’s collective wisdom and creativity. Potential Application Extensions 1. Ecosystem Incubator : Forum members can initiate proposals for new project incubation, such as launching a meme coin mining campaign on a specific blockchain or developing a feature deeply integrated with GameFi. Once approved through community voting, HTX DAO can provide startup capital or technical support for these projects. 2. Inter-Community Collaboration : The HTX DAO Forum can serve as a bridge for collaboration beyond the HTX ecosystem. For instance, it can facilitate joint proposals among various DAOs to tackle industry challenges or develop innovative financial tools. 3. Public Welfare and Social Responsibility : HTX DAO community members can propose allocating a portion of trading fees to blockchain education or environmental protection projects. These philanthropic initiatives not only improve the platform’s social image but also allow users to feel a sense of involvement. Envisioning the Future of Crypto Exchanges The launch of the HTX DAO Forum marks just the beginning of a new era of exchange governance. Here’s a glimpse into how HTX DAO will evolve: 1. Feature Optimization and Expansion : More governance modules will be introduced, such as smart proposal screening, real-time community feedback, on-chain decision visualization tools, and a more democratic token-based voting mechanism, to enhance user experience. 2. Ecosystem Development : HTX DAO is rooted in the exchange and built upon future ecosystem players like TRON and HTX. With highly scalable businesses, the ecosystem will gradually explore more utility-driven services. 3. Global Community Expansion : It actively attracts users from various cultures and regions, offering multilingual support and fostering an environment conducive to cross-regional collaboration. Through these initiatives, the exchange will gradually transition from a traditional financial intermediary to a digital economic ecosystem where users jointly govern and share in benefits. Possible Future Scenarios: 1. A Fully Autonomous Exchange : In the future, the role of the exchange’s management team could diminish, with most operational decisions made autonomously by the community. HTX DAO would become a fully decentralized ecosystem where all rules are transparently executed via on-chain governance. 2. Users as Governors : Every user could earn “governance credits” based on their contributions, building up governance capacity and decision-making power within the community. This mechanism encourages deeper user participation for continuous platform optimization. 3. AI-Assisted Governance Decision-Making : The integration of AI will enable the HTX DAO Forum to incorporate AI analysis tools to support governance decisions. For example, AI can simulate the potential outcomes of proposals based on market data, helping users make more informed voting choices. Conclusion: Starting a New Chapter in Decentralized Finance The launch of the HTX DAO Forum is not just a functional update but a groundbreaking leap forward in the governance model for the crypto industry. It outlines a vision for decentralized, transparent, and user-centric governance for exchanges. This initiative by HTX DAO sets a precedent for the industry’s future development, leading the crypto world toward a new era of more democratic and efficient governance. The future of exchange governance will no longer be dictated by a select few, but driven by every user. This transformation is not just technological but a fundamental shift in mindset and power dynamics. And it all begins with the HTX DAO Forum.

MicroStrategy announced the acquisition just an hour before Nasdaq trading began at 2:30 pm UTC. Within the first hour, its shares dropped 5.3%, falling from $318.89 to $302.09. While partially recovering during the session to close at $302.96, the stock declined another 3.19% in after-hours trading, settling at $293.59, according to Google Finance data. Bitcoin Purchases and Stock Dilution MicroStrategy funded the Bitcoin acquisition by selling 592,987 shares earlier that week, according to a regulatory filing. This marked the eighth consecutive week the company bought Bitcoin, adding 194,180 BTC to its holdings since Oct. 31. Concerns are growing about the company’s financial strategy, with The Kobeissi Letter noting in a Dec. 30 post on X that MicroStrategy’s plan to increase authorized shares by $10 billion has raised alarms. The firm’s heavy reliance on convertible notes and debt issuances leaves it needing to issue more debt or equity to sustain its Bitcoin buying spree. “The problem is, it has left the company in a ‘lose-lose’ situation for now,” Kobeissi added. Market Reactions and Predictions Despite a 20.18% decline in MSTR’s price over the past 30 days, the stock remains up 342.15% since Jan. 1. Hartmann Capital founder Felix Hartmann suggested in a Dec. 30 post that MicroStrategy’s stock could “eventually implode,” though he acknowledged the possibility of significant short-term gains. Unchained head of market research Joe Burnett described the company’s strategy as “hyperbitcoinization,” highlighting its use of leverage to grow Bitcoin-per-share. On Dec. 23, MicroStrategy was added to the Nasdaq-100 index, joining Palantir Technologies and Axon Enterprise as new additions to Nasdaq’s largest stocks by market capitalization.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 04:13:28

A tweet from the WallStreetBets community captured the debate surrounding XRP’s recent performance and potential trajectory. The tweet stated , “XRP just pulled a 250% glow-up, eyeing $8 if crypto hits $5T.” This optimistic prediction elicited mixed responses from the crypto community, highlighting both bullish enthusiasm and skepticism. $XRP just pulled a 250% glow-up, eyeing $8 if crypto hits $5T — wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) December 27, 2024 Current State of XRP At the time of the tweet, XRP was trading at $2.19, reflecting a significant $0.86 increase in the last 24 hours. While the gain is notable, it falls short of the 250% growth suggested in the tweet. To achieve a 250% increase, XRP has to rise from approximately $2.19 to $7.66—a scenario that has not occurred within this recent cycle. The discrepancy between the actual performance and the claim underscores the importance of fact-checking in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency speculation. Crypto Community Reactions The responses to the WallStreetBets tweet provide insight into the diverse perspectives within the crypto space. Silence Dogood, a responder, outright dismissed the notion of XRP reaching $8 soon. They wrote , “No it’s not… at all. It’ll never hit 8. Not this cycle or the next.” This reflects a sentiment shared by many who view XRP’s growth potential as limited due to its historical performance and market dynamics. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Mr. NTWEK, responded with humor, stating, “Nice! Thanks for the laugh.” Such comments highlight the skepticism and often playful nature of discussions within the cryptocurrency community, particularly regarding bold predictions. A user named Amer provided a more grounded perspective, noting , “No it did not. It’s currently at $2.19. Nowhere near its all-time high and has largely been a poor performer unless you invested back in November.” This response emphasizes XRP’s performance in the broader context of its historical price trends and market cycles. XRP Path to $8 For XRP to reach $8, it would require a substantial shift in market dynamics, including an overall crypto market capitalization of $5 trillion, as suggested in the original tweet. While the global crypto market has experienced rapid growth, reaching $5 trillion would depend on widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and continued innovation in blockchain technologies. Historically, XRP’s price has been influenced by market sentiment, legal challenges its affiliated company faces, and its utility as a digital asset. Although XRP has seen considerable adoption in cross-border payments, its performance has often lagged behind other major cryptocurrencies, limiting its appeal to some investors.

He said Hong Kong could use foreign exchange funds to acquire and hold BTC in the long term. BTC as Reserve Asset in Hong Kong Jiexhuang told Wen Wei Po that adding BTC to Hong Kong’s fiscal reserves could encourage the development of the local crypto industry, attract talent and investment, and increase transaction stamp tax revenue. Taking advantage of China’s one country, two systems policy, including BTC in Hong Kong’s reserves, could offer the region a first-mover advantage and help authorities reduce economic disruptions caused by broader adoption of the asset in traditional markets. “If major economic powers take the initiative to include Bitcoin in strategic reserves, the value of Bitcoin will be more stable, causing more and more other countries to follow suit and reduce their holdings of traditional assets. This will result in the fall of the price of traditional assets and will shrink the government’s fiscal reserves holding traditional assets,” Jiexhuang said. While the politician noted the benefits of buying and holding BTC, he also noted the risks associated with investing in the asset. He advised Hong Kong authorities to allocate a small percentage of the national reserves to the asset, starting with Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He urged the government to study the impact of the United States’ spot Bitcoin ETF market on the country’s finance industry and act accordingly. Notably, Hong Kong already has a spot Bitcoin ETF market; however, its inflows are pale in comparison to U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Following Trump’s Steps Jiexhuang is not the first lawmaker to propose including BTC in Hong Kong’s reserves; another legislative council member, Johnny Ng, did the same in July 2024. Ng’s suggestion followed U.S. President Donald Trump’s vow to create a national Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year. Both politicians believe Trump’s proposal to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States could have a major impact on traditional markets and insist Hong Kong could be positioned as a financial hub promoting such technological advancements. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Germany are also proposing the adoption of BTC as the country’s reserve asset.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 04:35:00

Meanwhile, in Europe, MoonPay has become one of the first crypto firms to secure a license under the European Union’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, signaling a new era of regulatory clarity and compliance for crypto businesses operating in the bloc. New York Judge Delays CFTC v. Gemini Trial, Raising Stakes Amid Political Transition A New York judge has postponed the start of the civil trial between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Gemini Trust Company. Initially set for Jan. 13, 2025, the trial will now commence on Jan. 21, according to a Dec. 30 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Alvin Hellerstein emphasized that “no further adjournments will be granted.” The decision places the trial’s opening under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, raising questions about potential shifts in regulatory attitudes toward the crypto industry. The case, filed in June 2022, centers on allegations that Gemini provided false or misleading statements to the CFTC during its 2017 bid to launch Bitcoin futures contracts. The CFTC has accused Gemini of violating the Commodity Exchange Act and has sought substantial penalties, including disgorgement of alleged ill-gotten gains, civil monetary fines, and injunctive measures to prevent further violations. This trial represents a pivotal moment for the CFTC’s enforcement strategy in the crypto space. Over the past year, the agency has aggressively targeted major players in the industry, securing over $17 billion in monetary relief during the 2024 fiscal year, primarily through enforcement actions against firms like FTX, Celsius, and Binance. Judge Hellerstein provided no specific rationale for the six-day delay, though its timing aligns with two significant political events: the inauguration of President-elect Trump on Jan. 20 and the start of the new session of Congress on Jan. 3. Both developments could influence the regulatory and legislative landscape surrounding the crypto industry. The shift in presidential administrations brings the potential for a change in tone at the CFTC. Current Chairman Rostin Behnam, appointed during President Biden’s tenure, is expected to serve until June 2026. However, reports suggest that Trump may consider replacing Behnam with a more crypto-friendly appointee. Such a move could significantly impact not only the CFTC’s approach to the Gemini case but also the broader regulatory framework for digital assets. The CFTC, alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been at the forefront of crypto regulation in the United States. While the SEC has focused on defining digital assets as securities, the CFTC has asserted jurisdiction over commodities, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The outcome of the Gemini trial could set a critical precedent for how regulators enforce compliance in the nascent crypto industry. Additionally, Congress may play a key role in clarifying the respective roles of the SEC and CFTC through proposed legislation. Such clarity could empower the CFTC to expand its influence, especially if Trump’s administration adopts a more favorable stance toward crypto innovation. What’s at Stake for Gemini? For Gemini , founded by the Winklevoss twins, the stakes are high. The exchange has positioned itself as a trusted player in the crypto market, emphasizing regulatory compliance and user security. A loss in court could result in substantial financial penalties and reputational damage, undermining its efforts to distinguish itself in a highly competitive industry. However, a favorable outcome could bolster Gemini’s standing as a compliant and innovative platform, potentially paving the way for broader adoption of its services, including Bitcoin futures contracts. The delay of the CFTC v. Gemini trial adds another layer of complexity to an already intricate legal and regulatory landscape. With Trump’s administration poised to take office, industry observers will be closely monitoring whether his appointments and policies signal a shift toward a more accommodating environment for crypto firms. The trial’s outcome could reverberate across the industry, influencing the strategies of both regulators and market participants. As the US grapples with how to balance innovation with consumer protection, the case shows the importance of clear and consistent regulatory frameworks for digital assets. The postponement of the CFTC v. Gemini trial sheds light on the interplay between legal proceedings, regulatory oversight, and political dynamics in shaping the future of the cryptocurrency industry. With billions of dollars and the industry’s credibility at stake, all eyes will be on the courtroom come Jan. 21, as the trial unfolds against the backdrop of a new presidential administration and potentially shifting regulatory priorities. MoonPay Secures MiCA License in the Netherlands: A Major Milestone for Crypto Regulation in the EU MoonPay, a leading provider of crypto payment solutions, has announced a significant regulatory milestone: the company has been approved to operate as a licensed cryptocurrency business in the Netherlands under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. The announcement, made on Dec. 30, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of crypto regulation within the EU. In its Dec. 30 statement, MoonPay revealed that the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets had granted the firm a license in accordance with MiCA regulations. With this approval, MoonPay will continue to provide fiat-to-crypto on-ramps and crypto-to-fiat off-ramps, reinforcing its role as a critical infrastructure provider for the crypto ecosystem. Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and CEO of MoonPay, celebrated the development as a “pivotal step in solidifying the crypto industry’s role in the global economy.” The approval positions MoonPay as one of the first crypto firms to operate under the MiCA framework, setting a precedent for other companies navigating the complex regulatory environment. MiCA: Transforming the EU’s Crypto Landscape The European Union’s MiCA framework represents one of the most comprehensive regulatory efforts globally to address the crypto industry. First adopted in 2023, MiCA aims to harmonize regulations across the EU’s member states, providing a unified framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs). Dec. 30 marked the end of MiCA’s implementation phase, ushering in an 18-month transitional period. During this transitional phase, companies already compliant with existing local regulations may continue operating while awaiting their MiCA licenses. These ”grandfathered” firms can maintain operations until July 2026 or until national authorities make final decisions regarding their licenses. MiCA’s regulatory scope includes provisions for stablecoins, asset-backed tokens, and crypto service providers. As of June 2024, stablecoins have been under scrutiny, leading some exchanges to delist Tether’s USDT in response to compliance requirements. MoonPay’s license approval signals the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry and its integration into traditional financial systems. By obtaining a MiCA license, MoonPay strengthens its foothold in the European market, building trust with users and regulators alike. The license not only ensures compliance but also opens doors for MoonPay to expand its offerings. The company has already gained prominence for its fiat-to-crypto infrastructure, partnering with major players like PayPal to provide seamless services to users in the US, UK, and EU. Reports of MoonPay’s discussions to acquire Helio Pay for $150 million further highlight its ambitions to scale operations and diversify its service portfolio. This move could potentially enhance MoonPay’s position as a leading provider of crypto payment solutions globally. The introduction of MiCA signals a new era for cryptocurrency regulation in the European Union. By establishing clear and consistent rules, the framework aims to foster innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring market stability. MiCA’s impact is already evident. Stablecoin issuers and exchanges have had to adjust to its requirements, while firms like MoonPay are leveraging the framework to demonstrate compliance and build legitimacy. The transitional period until mid-2026 offers a window of opportunity for companies to adapt, but it also places pressure on regulators and businesses to align with the new standards. MoonPay’s achievement in obtaining a MiCA license suggests there is an increasing globalization of crypto regulations. As jurisdictions like the EU take the lead in establishing comprehensive frameworks, other regions may look to MiCA as a model for balancing innovation with regulatory oversight. The regulatory clarity provided by MiCA could encourage more institutional participation in the crypto market, as firms gain confidence in a well-regulated environment. For MoonPay, this represents not just a regulatory victory but also a strategic advantage as the firm continues to expand its services and partnerships. MoonPay’s MiCA approval in the Netherlands marks a significant milestone for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry. As the EU embarks on its transitional phase under MiCA, the framework’s success could serve as a blueprint for global crypto regulation. For MoonPay, the license solidifies its position as a key player in the European crypto market and sets the stage for future growth. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, MoonPay’s proactive approach to compliance could position it as a leader in driving innovation and trust in the crypto space.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 04:39:42

This regulatory framework, which took effect on December 30, 2024, has profound implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Europe and potentially beyond. Here, we analyze Williams’ claims, provide context, and assess his suggested solutions. What is MICAr? MICAr is the European Union’s comprehensive regulation governing cryptocurrency markets. The regulation establishes a licensing regime for cryptocurrency businesses and introduces stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. It is part of the EU’s broader effort to provide clear legal frameworks for digital assets, ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and market integrity. Key provisions include: Travel Rule Compliance: Cryptocurrency businesses must collect and share identifying information about both the sender and recipient of all transactions, regardless of their size. Universal Wallet KYC: Both hot and cold wallets will require identity verification, providing authorities with complete visibility into user transactions. Stablecoin Delisting: Certain stablecoins, including USDT , will be delisted from many EU exchanges, likely due to non-compliance with regulatory standards. Implications for Crypto Users Williams emphasizes the far-reaching consequences of MICAr, particularly its impact on user privacy and the foundational principles of cryptocurrency. The mandatory sharing of personal data across exchanges raises significant concerns about data security, as centralized data pools become increasingly vulnerable to leaks and misuse. Additionally, the requirement to link identities to non-custodial wallets undermines the decentralized and private financial control that cryptocurrency was designed to offer. Furthermore, the delisting of USDT introduces the risk of disrupting trading and liquidity for European users, effectively steering them toward compliant alternatives like USDC . Williams also criticizes the narrative driving these regulations, arguing that they serve traditional financial institutions by discouraging decentralized alternatives. He claims that offline wallets do not inherently increase risks of criminal activity, as they lack fiat on-ramps, making these measures excessive and invasive. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Workarounds and Recommendations Williams suggests practical solutions for users to maintain control over their assets: Non-KYC Exchanges: Moving funds to non-KYC platforms like Toobit can help users avoid the new regulatory restrictions. However, users should exercise caution when using lesser-known platforms to ensure security and compliance with applicable laws. Offline Wallets: Utilizing fresh, unlinked cold wallets gives users more control over their privacy, although this may require additional steps to manage funds effectively. Mike Williams’ insights underscore the transformative and controversial nature of MICAr. While the regulation aims to bring transparency and accountability to the crypto industry, it also raises legitimate concerns about privacy, data security, and user autonomy. As the regulatory landscape evolves, crypto users must stay informed, adapt their strategies, and carefully consider how best to safeguard their assets and privacy. For now, Williams’ thread serves as both a wake-up call and a guide for those navigating the shifting tides of cryptocurrency regulation in Europe and beyond.

Judge Alvin Hellerstein announced on December 30 that the trial will now start on January 21, emphasizing that “no further adjournments will be granted.” The six-day delay pushes the trial into the new presidential administration, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office on January 20. Delay Could Benefit Crypto Firms The shift could have implications for the CFTC’s stance on Gemini and other cryptocurrency firms, as regulatory priorities may evolve under new leadership. Judge Hellerstein did not provide specific reasons for the date change. The case, filed in June 2022, accuses Gemini of providing false or misleading information to the CFTC regarding its 2017 bid to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. The commission is seeking financial penalties, the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and other measures to prevent future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The trial’s timing coincides with heightened discussions in Washington about cryptocurrency regulation. A new Congress convenes on January 3, and pending legislation could further define the roles of the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in overseeing the crypto industry. Crypto in the court, more trial date movements, in CFTC v. Gemini Trust Company, the trial previously scheduled to begin on Jan 13, 2025 is hereby adjourned to Jan 21, no further adjournments will be granted. Inner City Press on the case(s) pic.twitter.com/TzEWE8tnZW — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) December 30, 2024 The CFTC’s current chairman, Rostin Behnam, whose term ends in 2026, could face replacement under the Trump administration, potentially influencing the regulator’s approach to crypto enforcement. The CFTC has been active in pursuing crypto firms for alleged violations, including actions against FTX, Celsius, and Binance. In its 2024 fiscal report, the agency disclosed over $17 billion in monetary recoveries, largely from enforcement efforts targeting cryptocurrency companies. Gemini Gains Preliminary Approval From Singapore Regulator In October, Gemini secured in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s financial regulator. The preliminary nod allows Gemini to offer cross-border money transfer and digital payment token services. “While the US remains our largest market and global headquarters, Asia and Singapore in particular play a crucial role in our global strategy,” Saad Ahmed, who oversees Gemini’s operations in the Asia-Pacific region, said. With a footprint in around 70 countries, Singapore stands out as Gemini’s second-largest market by customer base. It trails only the US. The expansion efforts come as regulatory pressures have intensified in the domestic market. Ahmed said that Singapore is important in Gemini’s regional ambitions, noting that the city-state will serve as the company’s Asia-Pacific hub. “We are building the required capabilities here to drive operations across the region,” he added. In 2022, the Singapore regulator said that Gemini Trust Company had an exemption from licensing . At the same time, Genesis Asia Pacific, a subsidiary of Genesis Group, was granted an in-principle approval to offer DPT. Furthermore, Gemini was awarded a crypto license by the French watchdog Autorite des marches financiers in January.

Here’s What Experts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-poised-for-a-bullish-q1-2025-heres-what-experts-say/,"Ethereum (ETH) – the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – may finally seize its moment in Q1 2025. Crypto experts have taken to X to share their analyses of a potentially bullish start to the new year for ETH. Ethereum Bullish Price Action In Q1 2025? Although Ethereum is up by almost 43% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, its performance pales in comparison to Bitcoin (BTC) which has appreciated by more than 115% in the same period. In addition, various alternative Layer-1 blockchains, such as Solana (SOL) and SUI have vastly outperformed ETH throughout 2024. Related Reading: Ethereum Spot ETFs Witness Unbroken 16-Day Inflow Streak: New ETH ATH Soon? However, the momentum may soon shift in ETH’s favor, as experts suggest that Q1 2025 could mark a bullish phase for the world’s leading smart contract platform. According to crypto analyst Crypto Bullet, ETH appears to be forming a bullish pennant on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $6,000 expected by March 2025. Similarly, cryptocurrency expert Anup Dhungana highlighted another bullish pattern forming on the weekly chart. He pointed to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern – a widely recognized bullish indicator that suggests an impending price surge. Based on Dhungana’s analysis, ETH could soar to as high as $8,000 by May 2025. However, he also warned that the digital asset may first experience a dip to $2,800 before reaching new all-time highs (ATH). Veteran crypto analyst Quinten Francois also shared an interesting perspective. He noted that ETH has historically recorded exceptional gains during Q1 of the year following a US presidential election. If this historical pattern holds, Q1 2025 could be extraordinarily bullish for Ethereum. ETH Staking To Create Supply Crunch? In addition, Galaxy Research shared some price predictions about Ethereum heading into 2025, saying that the digital asset will trade above $5,500 in 2025 due to potentially favorable regulations surrounding staking and decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Ethereum Jumps 10% As DeFi Sentiment Rebounds With Trump’s Victory Galaxy Research also projected that Ethereum’s staking rate will surpass 50%, creating a supply crunch that could trigger a sharp price increase. The firm explained: The Trump administration is likely to offer greater regulatory clarity and guidance for the crypto industry in the U.S. Among other outcomes, it is likely that spot-based ETH ETPs will be allowed to stake some percentage of the ETH they hold on behalf of shareholders. Demand for staking will continue to rise next year, and likely exceed half of Ethereum circulating supply by the end of 2025, which will prompt Ethereum developers to more seriously consider changes to network monetary policy. Additionally, Galaxy Research suggested that the ETH/BTC trading pair will close 2025 trading above 0.06, buoyed by anticipated regulatory tailwinds. A rise in this trading pair from its current lows of approximately 0.03 could serve as a catalyst for the much-awaited altseason. Recent analysis by crypto analyst Carl Runefelt also foresees a big move for ETH at the beginning of the new year. At press time, ETH trades at $3,345, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

Investors worry that the company will take on too much debt for these purchases. The Bitcoin purchase happened just an hour before the Nasdaq opened at 2:30 pm UTC. In that hour, MicroStrategy’s stock fell 5.3% from $318.89 to $302.09. Source: Google Finance Some stocks recovered during the day but closed at $302.96. According to Google Finance data , the shares then fell another 3.19%, ending at $293.59. Concern is growing about MicroStrategy’s plan to raise its number of authorized shares According to the recent filing, the company disclosed its sale of 592,987 to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. It’s the eighth consecutive week that MicroStrategy has bought Bitcoin. According to the firm, it has spent 194,180 BTC since October 31, bringing the total amount to 2,093,180 BTC. There is growing concern about MicroStrategy’s plan to raise its number of authorized shares by $10 billion. In a December 30 X post, the Kobeissi Letter shared that the market was uneasy with this move. Something doesn't add up here: MicroStrategy, $MSTR , has been known as the most popular ""levered"" #Bitcoin play of the year. Meanwhile, over the last month Bitcoin has gained +2% while $MSTR is currently down nearly -50%. What is happening? Let us explain. (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 MicroStrategy has also borrowed a lot of money from convertible notes and debt issuances, explains Kobeissi. The company may need to borrow even more money or issue even more shares to keep buying Bitcoin. If the proposal is approved, the total number of shares could rise from 330 million to 10.33 billion. This is a difficult situation for the company, with risks on both sides.

In an article dubbed “ Trump Truth,” Hayes outlined his bearish outlook, saying that the crypto market had high expectations about the Trump Presidency. However, the administration would likely not enact policies as quickly as the market anticipated. “The market will instantly wake up to the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th. This realization will lead to a vicious sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades,” Hayes stated. According to the analyst, the US political landscape could also curtail the speed at which the Trump administration fulfills its campaign promises. This is because if Republicans fail to maintain the majority during the 2026 mid-term elections, it could cripple the efforts of the Trump administration. Past policies might hinder change Hayes also noted that the US administration was still dealing with the effects of poor monetary policies. Therefore, if friendly crypto policies fail to come into effect as fast as the market anticipates, traders could begin to dump. Furthermore, the issues that led to Trump and the Republican party getting overwhelming support during the November 5 elections were still in play and could not be solved immediately. “I don’t believe the markets realize how little time Trump actually has to accomplish anything,” he added. “The issues that gave rise to Trump’s popularity are decades in the making. As such, there are no immediate solutions regardless of what Elon Musk tells you on X.” Due to these factors, Hayes believes the market will dump around the inauguration on January 20. However, if the market continues to rally beyond this date, this bearish thesis will be defeated, and the current bull market will extend. Plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve While speaking during the 2024 Bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump announced plans to set up a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a bill to set up this reserve. Hayes has opined that it is unlikely that the US will directly purchase Bitcoin. However, if these purchases were to happen, it could bode well for BTC’s fiat price. “If the US government creates more dollars via a gold devaluation and uses some of those dollars to buy Bitcoin, its fiat price will rise. This will in turn spur competitive sovereign purchases by other nations who have to play catchup with the US,” he added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 05:08:14

This follows recent bullish price projections above $250 as traders align for positive movement next year. More institutional investors have rolled out Solana products with expectations of spot SOL ETF approvals in the United States. Crypto asset manager Bitwise has launched a Solana Staking Exchange Traded Product (ETP), adding to its growing list of institutional solutions. The product was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra venue and is set to provide institutional-grade exposure to the network’s native crypto, SOL. Trading under the ticker BSOL, the product will give more rewards than previous options, going as high as 6.4%. Staking has become popular among institutional investors in search of more gains in the ecosystem. This year, several traditional investors tipped Ethereum for having the most potential due to its staking features. “ Bitwise today announced the listing of its new Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (Ticker: BSOL, ISIN: DE000A4A59D2) on Xetra, providing institutional-grade total return exposure to Solana’s native cryptocurrency, SOL. With an innovative staking mechanism engineered to deliver significantly higher rewards compared to other Solana staking ETPs, BSOL reaffirms Bitwise’s position as a leader in the fast-growing crypto asset market.” Bitwise Set Sights On Expansion According to the release, BSOL offers low-cost ownership and high staking returns. While it offers 6,48%, 21Shares, its EU competitor, gives 5.49%. The product also has a management fee lower than the competition. Its fees stand at 0.85%, while others are slightly higher. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted the company’s vision to expand its products for more opportunities in the crypto market. This is the company’s third staking ETP this year, with previous Ethereum and Aptos products launched in February and November. Bitwise has seen significant success growth with over $12 billion in assets as institutional investors pour into the space. Meanwhile, all eyes have turned to anticipated Solana ETFs in the United States. Solana’s price projection continues above old levels with more adoption and whale accumulations. This year, the asset outperformed altcoin rivals like Ethereum after it recorded a string of weekly inflows. Solana meme coins have also played a huge role in the ecosystem’s surge, with tokens dominating the space.

Crypto bulls and market participants highly anticipate next year’s run, citing macro factors and increasing institutional appetite. Most users also tip favorable United States catalyst as the biggest driver next year. A new Bitfinex report on the crypto market outlook for 2025 points to a bullish Bitcoin price soaring up to $200,000. The exchange highlights institutional demand as a key metric for price action. This year, institutional flows tapped new highs with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. So far, these funds have attracted over $37 billion, with mounting prospects in 2025. Per the report, cycle indicators like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) show the bull cycle is still on. However, like previous cycles, giant peaks may not be expected in the short term. Still, bulls expect a reasonable jump in price next year between $150k to $200k. The exchange cites a minimum price estimate of $145,000 in June which could extend to $200,000 on the back of favorable conditions. Market Expects a Post-Halving Year Rally Traditionally, BTC prices have surged after each halving, with significant gains recorded for the next year. This bull case scenario in Q1 2024, ahead of the halving, led to miners repositioning holdings. Next year, market participants expect the effect to swing alongside tightening global financial conditions fully. Furthermore, inflationary trends are expected to attract more users to Bitcoin as a store of value to protect assets. This has been a recurring macro trend in the past 12 months. “ Inflation remains a central focus, with core CPI steady at 3.3% YoY reflecting persistent pressure in vehicle prices and durable goods. The Fed’s restrictive stance, despite planned rate cuts, underscores the difficulty in achieving its 2% inflation target. Strong economic growth, including a projected 3.8% Q4 annualized rate, supports cautious monetary easing but leaves room for recalibration should inflation persist.” Finally, the market expects positive crypto laws in the United States to shape the global sentiment. This is expected to attract more institutional investors, taking BTC prices to new all-time highs. The price of the crypto leader soared past $107K before slight corrections due to volatility. Similarly, whales have recorded large accumulations signaling long-term holdings.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-31 05:21:59

Crypto All-Stars Rallies Following CEX Listing Announcement,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/best-low-cap-meme-coin-to-buy-crypto-all-stars-rallies-following-cex-listing-announcement/,"The post Best Low-Cap Meme Coin to Buy? Crypto All-Stars Rallies Following CEX Listing Announcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After raising over $26 million during its presale, Crypto All-Stars (STARS) saw its first DEX listing and an immediate soar from its listing price of $0.001681 to $0.002740, representing a 62% jump just an hour into its launch. The gains were even greater for those who secured their share of the coin during the early rounds of the presale. Over the week, the token’s price fell below its listing level as investors took profit. However, STARS has recorded 30% gains today as its holder count increased following a CEX listing announcement and the second round of its “Last Meme Standing” competition. STARS Sees a 33% Soar Over The Past 48 Hours On December 28th, STARS price dropped to $0.0003315, an all-time low for the coin. However, following the potential CEX listing announcement by STARS’ developers, the token’s holder count increased by over 3,000, and its price shot up to $0.0005954 by December 29th, representing a 79% soar. Although the price of STARS fluctuated to $0.0004291, it has remained up 33% since the CEX listing announcement, with the potential for further gains as more details surface. STARS is currently sitting at an $18 million market cap, which falls into the acceptable range for centralized exchanges that have previously listed low-cap meme coins that immediately delivered impressive returns. For example, Neiro (NEIRO) was just a month old when it had a $14.4 million market cap and scored its Binance listing, which immediately saw its price soar by over 2,500%.

Depending on the exchange that lists it and the market sentiment, STARS could outperform PEPU and SLAP, which saw gains of over 600% and 5,500%, respectively. Last Meme Standing Showcases MemeVault’s Potential As STARS Teases a Second Round Crypto All-Stars is preparing to release the MemeVault, a cross-chain, multi-token staking protocol for meme coins that seeks to unify all meme coin holders under a single roof. Although the STARS team hasn’t confirmed its release date, they’ve hosted a Last Meme Standing competition, which saw investors stake their Pepe, Milady, Shiba Inu, Floki, and Turbo, with a $20,000 worth of STARS on the line for the winning coin’s backers. The competition rules were straightforward – staking a coin places it on top of the leaderboard, and it wins if another coin doesn’t dethrone it before the countdown finishes. The event was a massive success, with over $100,000 worth of meme coins staked, and Pepe’s holders took the prize. Last Meme Standing was such a success its got us thinking…. Round 2 and higher stakes anyone? pic.twitter.com/99iXecMHKW — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 29, 2024 Besides rewarding the community, Last Meme Standing has showcased the project’s multi-token staking capabilities, which the MemeVault is expected to deliver on release. According to the project’s website, the MemeVault will support 11 tokens once it goes live. The list includes the tokens that appeared in the first Last Meme Standing event and BONK, COQ, BRETT, TOSHI, DOGE, and MOG, which could appear in the second event. STARS Could See Gains of Over 290% if It Keeps Its Momentum With a CEX listing, Last Meme Standing 2, and the MemeVault release in the works, STARS is on track to increase its visibility and potentially return to its listing price, which would represent a 290% surge and could help drive its price further. The bullish sentiment is further bolstered by the project’s steady increase in its follower base, which now numbers over 27,000 users across X (Twitter) and Telegram . Plus, the token is seeing increasing large-volume purchase activity today, with two separate wallet owners buying $13,692 and $10,265 worth of STARS over the past few hours. Regarding investor security, the project enjoys a 99/99 reliability score on DexTools, which confirms there are no critical issues with its smart contract’s code and that no new coins can be minted or wallets blacklisted. Additionally, the project has shared proof of locked liquidity, which ensures a safer trading environment. Liquidity is now LOCKED! Link to proof: https://t.co/EZwZKedHsQ — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 23, 2024 Although the STARS price fell after delivering solid returns to early investors, the token seems ready for a breakout once MemeVault releases and further details regarding its CEX listing are announced. Thanks to the MemeVault, STARS is designed to be held, as it will act as a reward multiplier within the staking protocol. MemeVault’s release could create scarcity as more meme coin holders add it to their portfolios, which would positively impact its price, making this the best time to purchase and hold it.

Technology has progressed faster because of conflicts around the world, most notably the war in Ukraine. According to a recent report, Financial Times’ Vertical Research Partners predicts that in the next five years, the top 15 defense contractors will have $50 billion in free cash flow, double what they had together at the end of 2021. There will be more deal-making, and more prominent companies will continue to spend the money on buying back shares and paying out higher dividends. Michael Sion at Bain & Co. expects mergers and acquisitions in aerospace and military to rise. That also means he sees more money coming from private equity and venture capital firms. He said, “Many companies are looking to expand what they offer to get ready for advanced technologies.” Venture capital deals in the defense sector have increased by 18 times over the past 10 years Larger firms will target fast-growing military areas such as space and defense electronics. A new Bain report also states that the value of venture capital deals in the military sector has increased by 18 times over the past 10 years. Much of this is attributable to the blending of commercial and defense technologies. Investors, especially in Europe, have been hesitant about investing in this sector because of ethical concerns. However, their outlook has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago.

According to Arkham Intelligence , Tether’s Bitcoin wallets received two separate transfers on December 30, amounting to approximately 8,404.5 BTC. With Bitcoin trading around $92,500, the addition brings Tether’s total holdings to 83,759 BTC, valued at nearly $7.75 billion. Tether Remains Committed to Bitcoin Purchases This move aligns with Tether’s commitment, announced in May 2023, to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward Bitcoin purchases. The last significant addition occurred on March 31, when Tether acquired 8,888.88 BTC shortly after Bitcoin surpassed the $70,000 mark. Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled in 2024, reaching an all-time high of $108,000 in mid-December, though it has seen some recent declines. Tether now holds the second-largest Bitcoin reserve among private companies, trailing only Block.one, which owns 140,000 BTC. Overall, Tether ranks third when both private and public companies are considered, behind software giant MicroStrategy, which leads with an impressive 446,400 BTC. JUST IN: Tether buys 7,629 #bitcoin worth $705 million for its reserves, now owns $7.7 billion in bitcoin pic.twitter.com/0K2KTjCM2Z — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) December 30, 2024 Corporate Bitcoin treasuries have gained traction in 2024 as the cryptocurrency’s value surged. Companies like KULR Technology Group and Quantum BioPharma have recently added Bitcoin to their reserves. KULR’s $21 million purchase of 217.18 BTC on December 16 drove its stock price up over 40%, hitting a record high. Similarly, Quantum BioPharma announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other digital assets to diversify its treasury on December 20. Last week, Tether made its first foray into venture capital by investing $2 million in Arcanum Capital’s Arcanum Emerging Technologies Fund II. The fund is a tokenized investment vehicle focused on supporting decentralized Web3 projects aimed at advancing blockchain-based technologies, including remittances, privacy, and financial inclusion. Furthermore, Tether recently invested $775 million in Rumble , a video-sharing platform known for its free speech ethos. US States Consider Adding Bitcoin To Reserves Ohio has become the latest US state to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. The initiative mirrors recent moves by Texas and Pennsylvania to establish Bitcoin reserves. On 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings (MARA) has also bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. Likewise, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further.

Solana Gears Up While Lunex Rockets Into the Game,https://timestabloid.com/bnb-mooning-after-revolut-listing-solana-gears-up-while-lunex/,"As the Bitcoin-led market continues to decline, BNB price is bucking the trend, having recently been listed on Revolut. Meanwhile, SOL is poised for significant gains fueled by the growing interest in its ecosystem. However, the real buzz centers around Lunex Network (LNEX), lauded as one of the fastest-growing cryptos in the current cycle. With its entry into the game, Lunex Network is shaping up to be on strong footing alongside these established giants. This article examines the dynamics behind these assets and their prospects in the current market. Lunex Network Launches DeFi Solutions In One Swoop The difficulty of managing multi-chain portfolios often leaves traders juggling complex tools. Lunex Network’s unified asset tracker changes the game by integrating data from over 40 blockchains into a single dashboard. This innovation simplifies portfolio analysis, helping users make informed decisions without toggling between platforms. Liquidity fragmentation has long plagued decentralized exchanges, but Lunex’s aggregation protocol takes a novel approach. It bridges liquidity gaps across chains, enabling users to access competitive rates effortlessly. By optimizing liquidity pathways, Lunex eliminates inefficiencies that hinder fast and cost-effective trading. Another highlight is its non-custodial wallet, which offers more than just secure storage. This wallet functions as a gateway to decentralized trading and staking, ensuring users retain full control of their funds at all times. Transactions are cryptographically signed by users, reinforcing Lunex’s commitment to decentralization and security. Additionally, regular token burns steadily reduce the supply of $LNEX , creating scarcity while aligning the platform’s growth with long-term value. For traders and investors navigating the volatile crypto market, Lunex provides tools and systems that combine simplicity with powerful functionality. This balance positions it as a formidable force in the market. BNB Price Beats The Odds After Listing on Revolut Binance Coin ( BNB ) has experienced a notable surge following its listing on Revolut, a prominent fintech platform with over 40 million users. This development has increased BNB ‘s accessibility, contributing to its recent price appreciation. BNB is practically the only top 10 crypto with some increase during the ending days of December. The RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting strong BNB- buying momentum. The markets are optimistic, with CoinCodex predicting a potential rally above the $800 mark in early 2025. This surge is driven by increased institutional adoption in the US and positive BNB sentiment. SOL Gears Up After For Rally After Bullish Signal Solana ( SOL ) is currently trading around $190, reflecting a slight decline of 6%. Despite this downturn, SOL maintains a strong bullish trend, supported by over 90% of signals from moving averages. With an FGI of 73, SOL continues to trade above its 200-day SMA. The formation of a bull flag pattern on the daily chart suggests the potential for a breakout, with SOL analysts projecting a target of $320 in the near term. However, recent SOL price corrections indicate the possibility of increased volatility. Conclusion Lunex Network is pioneering the future of DeFi one LNEX token at a time. The Lunex Network presale edges closer to listing, with tokens selling for $0.0049 apiece. By staking LNEX tokens for at least 1 month, presale investors can secure up to 18% APY.

Rollblock emerges at the intersection of DeFi and iGaming, with analysts projecting significant growth during its presale and beyond. Table of Contents Rollblock offers the perfect blend of DeFi and iGaming Ripple sees 7% decline in 7 days Cardano sees a major December dip Sui drops 5% in 5 days Rollblock continues to gain momentum 2024 has been a huge year for both the DeFi and iGaming spaces. With the market expanding as 2025 approaches, investors are wondering where to focus their efforts. While Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Sui (SUI) have been strong investments historically, an exciting new project has been tipped to outperform them all: Rollblock (RBLK). This project has emerged from the intersection of iGaming and DeFi, blending the two together to create a decentralized gaming experience. The project is currently seeing major attention from across the investing spectrum, with analysts predicting an 800% increase during the presale and further gains post-launch. Rollblock offers the perfect blend of DeFi and iGaming A casino with a broad offering Rollblock is a Hybrid GambleFi platform that blends traditional casino entertainment with decentralized finance. As the world’s first community-backed casino and Play-to-Earn token, Rollblock empowers users to earn, play, and invest in a secure and transparent ecosystem. The platform offers a range of over 7000 games, including the best of both casino and virtual games, and accepts cryptocurrency deposits. In addition, there is a comprehensive sportsbook, and a range of exciting player-vs-player options on offer for those with a competitive nature. The native token: RBLK At the center of the Rollblock platform is the project’s native token, RBLK. This token differentiates itself from the rest with some appealing benefits for holders. A significant 30% of Rollblock’s weekly profits are used to buy back RBLK tokens, and of these tokens, 60% are burned permanently to introduce scarcity and boost the value of the token. The remaining tokens are rewarded to users who have chosen to stake RBLK, with generous APY rates offering a lucrative passive income stream for token holders. Hybrid infrastructure: Built for functionality The platform’s hybrid infrastructure model combines the best of both worlds: decentralized, on-chain transparency, but with the robust functionality of a traditional casino. With its decentralized approach, AI tools, and passive income potential, Rollblock is the perfect destination for Gen-Z bettors and crypto enthusiasts who want autonomy, transparency, and profitability in their gaming experience.

Despite Ripple’s strong annual performance, XRP could now see a harsh corrective price action. Ripple lost 7% of its value in the last 7 days, and XRP’s price dropped even more significantly over the last 24 hours. Having held a value of $2.15 at midday on the 29th December, it dropped down to $2.03 by the same time on the 30th December. Cardano sees a major December dip Cardano performed poorly through 2024 despite a broader crypto space expansion. With 2025 around the corner, Cardano’s value dropped 18% in the last month. Cardano now looks like it could fall below the $30 billion mark, causing some Cardano holders to sell up. Cardano sank from $0.94 on 24th December to $0.85 on the 29th, marking a disappointing end to the year for Cardano. Sui drops 5% in 5 days Sui had a strong year overall with a 421% increase, though it has dropped 5% in the last 5 days, raising questions as to how Sui might perform in 2025. The Sui developers have been focused on improving accessibility this year. Sui’s mainnet is now supported by over 100 validators, so there is a glimmer of hope for Sui holders. Rollblock continues to gain momentum Sporting more than 7000 games, AI-powered betting tools, and community projects, Rollblock is an entertaining gaming destination for all. Today, with the presale in its ninth stage, RBLK tokens are trading at $0.0044, and analysts expect 800% growth pre-launch and 100x growth post-launch. With this in mind, there is no better time than now to join a platform likely to shape the future of DeFi and iGaming. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials .

The scam that was mainly identified on YouTube, are comments that are created to attract users with seed phrases to wallets holding thousand-dollars of cryptocurrencies. How Crypto Scams Are Exploiting Seed Phrases to Lure Victims The process looks simple to do but is actually anything but simple. These hackers regard themselves as skilled traders posing as beginners trying to find a way to trade from wallets with high volumes of stablecoins such as USDT in the Tron blockchain. They even expose the seed phrase of the wallet so that all the undesirables get lured into getting a hold of the wallet. Inside the store, the “lucky” thief finds a wallet with up to $8, 000. But to withdraw the funds a small amount of Tron (TRX) is payable as gas fees which are charged in the network. When the thief wants to send TRX to the wallet, all their tokens are diverted to another wallet owned by the scammers. Understanding the TRX Gas Fee Trap: A New Fraud Tactic This is yet another sophisticated trap connected with the use of multi-signature wallets for which several approvals are needed for outgoing transactions. The gullible thief simply tries to withdraw the money and the poor guy ends up making the scammers even richer. Kaspersky, a cybersecurity firm; said the operation was a sting operation aimed at immoral people and not ‘crypto users.’ .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Tips to Stay Safe Though individually this may result in relatively small losses per incident, but the overall operation shows that the crypto scams are becoming increasingly more complex, using mechanics inherent in the blockchain combined with psychological tricks to encourage and reward unethical behaviour. Cybersecurity specialists advise crypto users who are interested in digital assets to refrain from usiing unknown seed phrases and generally have no interaction with wallets belonging to strangers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 05:55:00

XRP’s price is down 2% in the last 24 hours, while the won continues to trade below 1,470 per dollar. The arrest warrant issued against former President Yoon Suk Yeol has exacerbated market fears both locally and globally. On Tuesday, the Seoul Western District Court issued a search warrant for Yoon’s residence and an arrest warrant for his attempts to impose martial law during a live televised address on December 3. South Korea issues arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon https://t.co/yYqMG3U8qs — Financial Times (@FT) December 31, 2024 This marks the first time in South Korean history that an arrest warrant has been issued against an incumbent president. The warrants followed Yoon’s repeated refusals to comply with the summons from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is investigating him for treason and abuse of power. Yoon’s televised imposition of martial law, justified by claims of addressing “anti-state elements” and “North Korean threats,” drew sharp criticism. South Korea’s parliament quickly overturned the move on December 4, but the political fallout has been severe. The ripple effect on cryptocurrency markets South Korea’s political crisis has extended its influence to the cryptocurrency sector. Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, experienced a brief slump of up to 4% during Yoon’s short-lived martial law declaration. Domestically, crypto trading spiked to its second-highest level this year, with retail traders actively pursuing “high-momentum” altcoins such as XRP and Dogecoin. Although the crypto market recovered after parliament overturned the martial law order, recent price movements continue to reflect volatility. Bitcoin fell below $93,000, currently changing hands at $92,500, a 0.6% decline over the past 24 hours, with its trading volume surging by 62% to go past $55 billion. Ethereum dropped 2.4%, trading slightly above $3,300, while its trading volume increased by 56%, reaching $25.52 billion at press time, per Coingecko data . XRP, closely tied to South Korean retail trading trends, saw its price decline by 2% in the last 24 hours on the country’s largest digital currency exchange Upbit . It is currently trading below 3,000 won, going down 12% over the past week. XRP/KRW Upbit chart. Source: TradingView. The downturn coincides with broader market sentiment, as the global cryptocurrency market cap decreased by 1.3% to $3.22 trillion. However, trading volumes surged by 40%, and investors could be looking to cash in on profits as 2024 nears sunset. Won hits 16-year low as political tensions amplify economic struggles South Korea’s Won has taken a significant hit during this period of political instability. The won fell below 1,470 per dollar, marking its lowest levels in 16 years, according to market data from Trading Economics. The currency’s value has declined by over 12% this year, making it the weakest currency in emerging Asia. The economic downturn has been fueled by political tensions, concerns over economic mismanagement, and fears of US tariffs. The Bank of Korea’s decision to reduce its benchmark interest rate to 3% in December, following inflation levels dropping to 1.9%, has done little to offset the won’s decline. The central bank’s plans for further rate cuts next year aim to stabilize the monetary system, though challenges remain with a strong dollar driven by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies and the incoming US administration’s outlook.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2024 expects a maximum price of $2.8. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention late last year with the launch of its proprietary blockchain. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $1.46 Market Cap $611.61M Trading Volume $36.99M Circulating Supply 643.93M dYdX All-time High $4.53 All-time Low $0.8067 24-hour high $1.47 24-hour low $1.45 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $1.46 Price Prediction $ 5.72 (223.31%) Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 17.43% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $ 1.194069 200-Day SMA $ 1.4366 14-Day RSI 72.34 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faces a bearish pressure around $1.5 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX is facing selling demand. Resistance for dYdX is present at $1.59 Support for dYdX/USD is present at $1.27 The dYdX price analysis for 31 December confirms that dYdX faces increased selling pressure as the price drops toward $1.5. Currently, there’s a strong domination from both buyers and sellers. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price drops toward $1.5 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows that the token is facing bearish pressure as it aims to hold on to its momentum. In recent hours, the price of dYdX declined toward $1.5; however, it faces minor buying pressure from bulls. The 24-hour volume declined to $16 million, plunging interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $1.46, dropping by over 1.4% in the last 24 hours. dYdX shows bullish volatility The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and trades below the midline at 42, hinting that bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bears strengthen their position as they hold the price below the EMA trend lines. Bulls are maintaining buying confidence as the dYdX price aims for further surges. dYdX price chart The BoP indicator trades in a bullish region at 0.18, showing that long-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 1.450985 BUY SMA 5 $ 1.535278 BUY SMA 10 $ 1.518048 BUY SMA 21 $ 1.401292 BUY SMA 50 $ 1.194069 BUY SMA 100 $ 1.070799 BUY SMA 200 $ 1.4366 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.368526 BUY EMA 5 $ 1.263628 BUY EMA 10 $ 1.139506 BUY EMA 21 $ 1.047047 BUY EMA 50 $ 1.012846 BUY EMA 100 $ 1.130664 BUY EMA 200 $ 1.485763 BUY What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $1.5953, it will fuel a bullish rally to $1.9434. dydX price chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.2743, beginning a bearish trend to $1.0678. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? Today, dYdX faced intense selling pressure as it failed to surge above $2.2. However, buyers are defending further declines and aiming for a quick recovery. Will dYdX price recover? If buyers hold the buying momentum of dYdX and send it past the $2.5 mark, we might see a significant recovery in the coming hours. The current low might be a good time to buy and this might create a strong support level for dYdX’s price. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiments, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX, and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX announced a 35% cut in staff strength The decentralized trading platform dYdX, based in Switzerland, has announced a 35% cut in its core workforce. CEO Antonio Juliano shared the initial news in a short post on X, describing the decision as “sad” and committing to share a more detailed explanation later. dYdX price prediction December 2024 November was a bullish month for dYdX as the altcoin made robust surges following Donald Trump’s victory. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $2 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $2.6 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $1.5. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction December 2024 $1.5 $2 $2.6 dYdX price prediction 2024 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $2.61 by the end of 2024.

Meanwhile, MicroStrategy also expanded its Bitcoin portfolio with a $209 million purchase. Hong Kong lawmakers proposed incorporating Bitcoin into national reserves due to its potential to improve financial stability and attract global investment. As 2024 ends, Bitcoin's inability to sustain its recent all-time high also sparked some concerns, and technical analysts warned of a potential dip to $78,000 that could impact its trajectory into 2025. Tether Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has made a big addition to its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves by transferring close to $780 million worth of BTC to its corporate treasury. This was the company’s largest Bitcoin purchase since March and aligns with its May 2023 announcement to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward acquiring Bitcoin. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, Tether’s Bitcoin reserve wallets received two large transfers on Dec. 30, totaling approximately 8,404.5 BTC. As Bitcoin was trading at around $92,500, the latest additions are valued at about $777.4 million. This brought Tether’s total holdings to 90,083 BTC, which is worth nearly $8.3 billion. Private companies holding Bitcoin (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) This latest move happened after Tether’s previous purchase on March 31, when the firm bought 8,888.88 BTC shortly after Bitcoin passed the $70,000 mark. Bitcoin’s price doubled over 2024 and gained more than 108% year-to-date despite recent declines from its mid-December all-time high. Tether now ranks as the second-largest private Bitcoin holder, with its holdings trailing only the 140,000 BTC held by blockchain software firm Block.one. In the overall rankings, including public companies, Tether holds the third position, with MicroStrategy leading the list with a staggering 446,400 BTC. The surge in Bitcoin’s price certainly encouraged more corporations to add the cryptocurrency to their treasuries. KULR Technology Group also recently invested $21 million in Bitcoin by buying 217.18 BTC. This led to a 40% increase in its stock price. Similarly, Quantum BioPharma recently announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other crypto assets to diversify its own treasury. MicroStrategy Expands Bitcoin Portfolio Again MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm and prominent Bitcoin investor, also recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 2,138 BTC for $209 million. The company announced that it made the purchase between Dec. 23 and 29, and paid an average price of about $97,837 per BTC. The acquisition was funded by selling 592,987 shares during the same week. The firm’s Bitcoin yield has shown great performance, with a year-to-date increase of 74.1% as of Dec. 30 and a quarterly yield of 47.8% for the period from Oct. 1 to Dec. 29. This was the eighth consecutive week that MicroStrategy added Bitcoin to its holdings as the company purchased BTC weekly since Oct. 31. Over this period, the firm acquired a total of 194,180 BTC. However, the volume of Bitcoin that was bought has declined compared to November when MicroStrategy purchased over 100,000 BTC. Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, teased the latest acquisition on Dec. 29 by hinting at “disconcerting” patterns on Saylor Tracker, a platform monitoring the company’s Bitcoin investments. Saylor also once again reiterated that MicroStrategy is still very much committed to purchasing Bitcoin at any price, even if it reaches $1 million per coin. In addition to its latest acquisition, MicroStrategy is looking to increase its capacity to issue shares. A Dec. 23 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that the company plans to raise the number of authorized Class A common stock from 330 million shares to 10.33 billion shares and authorized preferred stock from 5 million to over 1 billion shares. This move will provide better flexibility for the company to issue additional shares and potentially fund more Bitcoin purchases in the future. Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Gains Traction in Hong Kong A Hong Kong legislator proposed integrating Bitcoin into the special administrative region's national reserves to boost financial security and attract new investment. Wu Jiexhuang, a member of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council, suggested leveraging China’s “one country, two systems” policy to explore Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset. Speaking to state-owned newspaper Wen Wei Po, Jiexhuang talked about the strategic steps smaller nations like El Salvador and Bhutan have taken by incorporating Bitcoin into their reserves, as well as proposals by US President-elect Donald Trump to make Bitcoin a strategic asset. Jiexhuang argued that Hong Kong could initially include Bitcoin in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to evaluate its market impact before considering a broader integration into its reserves. He also pointed out Bitcoin’s potential to attract global talent and investment while still providing financial stability amid market volatility. He also believes that holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could mitigate the risks associated with its growing adoption in traditional markets, giving Hong Kong a first-mover advantage. The legislator stated that major economic powers adopting Bitcoin in their reserves could stabilize its value and encourage other nations to follow suit and shift away from traditional assets. This, he suggested, could lead to declining values for traditional assets and affect governments’ fiscal reserves. Hong Kong’s Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau is expected to develop crypto regulations under the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules,” aligning with broader global standards. The region’s focus on Bitcoin aligns with China’s large Bitcoin holdings, which amount to about 190,000 BTC that was acquired through confiscations, placing it second only to the United States in terms of national Bitcoin reserves. This proposal was made after earlier discussions by another Legislative Council member, Johnny Ng , who announced plans to explore Bitcoin’s feasibility as part of Hong Kong’s financial reserves. Ng pointed to the growing global recognition of Bitcoin as a critical factor in its integration into traditional financial systems. Market Awaits Bitcoin’s Next Move Into 2025 As 2024 draws to a close, the crypto market is fixated on Bitcoin's price trajectory heading into 2025. Despite achieving a new all-time high earlier this month, Bitcoin has since dipped below that mark, and raised concerns among market participants. It seems like the leading cryptocurrency's inability to sustain its peak is being interpreted as a sign of market weakness. The broader crypto market, buoyed this year by institutional interest from firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and pension funds due to the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has not been immune to year-end declines. These downward trends dampened hopes for Bitcoin to close the year with a six-figure price. Veteran trader Peter Brandt added to the conversation with a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price chart. According to Brandt, a head-and-shoulders pattern is forming, which suggests a potential drop to $78,000 per Bitcoin if the pattern plays out. While he acknowledges the possibility of the pattern failing or morphing, he still warned traders to act on the pattern as it currently stands. A decline like this would represent a 15+% drop from current levels but could also serve to close a big price gap on the CME that has been unresolved for nearly two months. For some analysts, addressing this gap could provide a cleaner slate for Bitcoin as it moves into 2025, and could also potentially offer a foundation for future upward momentum.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-31 06:02:18

As for the crypto security expert Adrian Bednarek, the hacker was able to break 732 private keys, corresponding with 49,060 transactions.

After eight months, he had already generated 45,000 ETH through programmatic theft; this activity made him the biggest threat in the crypto world. This incident became a real thorn in the side of the rise in the number of crypto thefts that have been happening over the last few years. The comeback of the Blockchain Bandit highlights, at the same time, the crypto vulnerabilities that are an inevitable part of the blockchain ecosystem. In a report from onchain security firm Cyvers, the total amount of money stolen in 165 security incidents in 2024 was around $2.3 billion, which was a 40% rise from the previous year. 81% of the total lost money, or $1.9 billion, was the result of access control breaches on the centralized exchanges and custodial platforms, with major focus on pig butchering scams.

Polygon price prediction for 2024 expects the price of MATIC to surge toward $1.03. By 2030, we expect the MATIC price to record a maximum price of $10.51.

Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is Matic price down today? Following an intense sell off around $0.64, MATIC’s price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels. Will MATIC price touch $1? Yes, Matic price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2024. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will MATIC Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and MATIC gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is MATIC a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, MATIC can be a good long-term investment option.

That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

According to the forecast and technical analysis, Polygon’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $2.07 in 2026. The maximum price projection is $2.39, with an average value of $2.12. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2027 In 2027, one Polygon is anticipated to reach a minimum price of $3.03.

We anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024 to range between a minimum of $0.9012 and a maximum of $1.03, with an average trading price of around $0.9298. However, its future market sentiment entirely depends on the SEC’s stance, global regulation, and investor interest.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Yeti Ouro emerges as a standout in the crypto space, blending gaming utility with deflationary mechanics, as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu regain market attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin analysis: Is a rally on the horizon Shiba Inu forecast: Whale activity explodes Yeti Ouro: The new gaming sensation Here’s what investors love about Yeti Ouro: Why Yeti Ouro stands out Final thoughts Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are back in the spotlight. Dogecoin rallies while Shiba Inu reactor whales exodus sparks interest. But the most interesting find is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), the new altcoin transforming the gaming world. Its unique model and successful presale are gaining a lot of buzz. Crypto investors are keeping a close eye on these three tokens, but Yeti Ouro is a dark horse with massive growth potential. Dogecoin analysis: Is a rally on the horizon Dogecoin price has been on a tear recently. And market indicators suggest that it may be setting itself up for another big rally. It comes as activity in the DOGE community grows and trading volumes leap. Dogecoin rallies have often been inspired by community backing and social media attention. Analysts now suggest that DOGE price will break its recent resistance level. And with renewed interest in the rest of the crypto space, Dogecoin could surge again. Couple this rise with some positive sentiment for long-term holders. However, DOGE’s capacity to engage with mainstream media still arguably makes it a superior older meme coin. Shiba Inu forecast: Whale activity explodes Whale activity for Shiba Inu is once again riding a huge wave. In the last 24 hours, SHIB orders have increased by 265%, according to IntoTheBlock. This means that whale activity has increased the volume of large transactions to 375 trillion SHIB tokens. When there is whale activity, however, it often means a big move is coming to a token. Now, investors are left wondering what could be behind this latest next rush. This may be due to recent Shibarium upgrades or new happenings in the SHIB ecosystem. As SHIB struggles to reclaim old prices, those large transactions indicate growing confidence among institutional participants. If the trend is maintained, SHIB price may drop another zero and please its faithful holders. Yeti Ouro: The new gaming sensation Dogecoin and Shiba Inu slightly dominate the meme coin space, but Yeti Ouro promises to take things to a whole new level. Yeti Ouro pairs gaming and real utility — something fun, unlike traditional meme tokens. It drives a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game called Yeti Go, based on Unreal Engine.

YETIO staking: Investors can stake YETIO for passive income and high APY. Deflation: There is a regular burning of a percentage of tokens, resulting in a decrease in supply. Mass appeal: The game’s chaotic, fun-filled gameplay draws in gamers and crypto investors. Yeti Ouro is already sitting on a presale of over $1.4 million, a sign of investor confidence. Most of the previous altcoin projects storming or following the trail have ignored the monetization of super-quality gameplay and token utility. Meanwhile, the Yeti Ouro meme contest has wrapped up, with some of the participants sharing their innovative creations.

It has a solid advantage thanks to its combination of Play-to-Earn mechanics and community-driven additions. Yeti Ouro offers a physical product, unlike popular community tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Its P2E model allows players to enjoy themselves while making money. These two inextricably linked purposes bring casual gamers and serious investors on board. Moreover, the presale of Yeti Ouro has proven that the Yeti Ouro can draw attention. YETIO represents one of the most promising prospects for investors searching for the next big thing, with potential 100x returns. Final thoughts As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu storm the hubs, their competition is catching up. DOGE signals a rally, while SHIB`s whale movements indicate volatility. Yeti Ouro, however, is leveraging its gaming utility and presale hype. With the growth of the crypto market, projects like Yeti Ouro are blazing trails. Its blend of gaming, incentives, and community involvement uniquely positions it. Yeti Ouro is quickly rising and is a no-brainer for long-run investors. Keep an eye on this rising star.

The surge in incidents has shed light on systemic vulnerabilities and emphasized the urgent need for robust security measures in the blockchain space.

So far, it has raised $4.6 million , surpassing milestones of $1 million in the first 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days . The project proudly counts over 7,000 holders , with 60 billion coins sold already. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): A Quirky Twist on the Meme Coin Scene If you’re looking for something a little different in the meme coin market, Non-Playable Coin (NPC) might be what you’re after. This coin stands out by embracing the idea of “non-playable” as a theme, incorporating the concept of “non-playable characters” (NPCs) from the gaming world. NPC’s approach is all about leaning into the idea of gaming and digital worlds in a tongue-in-cheek, meme-driven way. It’s the type of coin that might make you scratch your head and laugh at the absurdity of it all—exactly the kind of humour that meme coins thrive on. But don’t let the quirky concept fool you. NPC is rapidly gaining traction among those who love the idea of meme coins with a gaming twist. The coin’s presale has seen some decent momentum, and analysts predict that NPC could see some serious growth as the gaming and meme coin sectors continue to collide. However, it’s still in its early stages, and much of the hype is based on the meme coin market’s overall growth rather than its immediate utility. The big question for NPC investors is whether its community will be strong enough to carry it to the moon or remain a niche meme coin for diehard fans. While it has some unique appeal, it still lacks the expansive ecosystem and utility BTFD Coin offers with its P2E game and rewards programs. So, if you’re eyeing the best new meme coins to invest in today, it’s worth keeping an eye on NPC, but it’s hard to compete with the excitement BTFD Coin is generating. Andy (ANDY): Meme Coin with a Dash of Personality Let’s talk about Andy, a meme coin bringing personality and attitude to the meme coin world. This coin’s charm lies in its distinctive character-driven branding, which taps into the meme-driven culture that has made cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu household names. The idea behind Andy is simple: to create a coin that resonates with people through humour, pop culture references, and a playful attitude towards crypto. While Andy is still in its early stages, it’s worth noting that it’s taking a more traditional meme coin approach. The project’s roadmap doesn’t offer as much utility as BTFD Coin’s gaming platform or staking rewards, but its community is strong, and that’s a huge factor in the meme coin market. With its fun vibe and easy-to-understand concept, Andy has much potential, especially as it develops further. One clear thing is that Andy’s meme-driven approach has already built a strong fanbase. Its tokenomics and growth potential will depend heavily on the success of its community and whether it can keep pace with the more innovative meme coins like BTFD Coin. It’s a fun coin to hold, but will it deliver long-term value for its investors? Only time will tell.

They believe the US crypto space will particularly lead crypto innovation next year with favorable ETF regulations. The company remarked, “ 2025 will mark a shift from speculation to utility, as crypto’s foundational technologies become integral to global financial and operational systems.” Franklin Templeton expects friendlier crypto regulations Franklin Templeton anticipates that the U.S. will lead in crypto innovation by implementing more accommodating regulations for ETFs and tokenized assets in 2025. They believe favorable regulations will drive the industry’s growth, expecting traditional finance players and the crypto infrastructure to converge. The firm also projects for the establishment of a stablecoin regulatory framework in the US which they believe will allow for many other financial institutions to launch their own stablecoins. Moreover, Templeton believes tokenized products and stablecoin adoption will continue to expand and be major drivers of decentralized finance (DeFi) growth globally. They also expect to see many countries starting their own Bitcoin reserves, and for BTC to grow into a global financial asset driven by increased institutional adoption. Franklin Templeton says AI and crypto interactions will increase Franklin Templeton added that they expected decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) to see growing demand due to their application in practical areas such as logistics and the Internet of Things (IoT). They also predict that artificial intelligence and crypto will merge faster, utilizing blockchain technology for transparency and verification. The investment company also said that AI agents would likely employ blockchain infrastructure to streamline on-chain transactions, manage portfolios, and connect digital content and social media with blockchain ecosystems. They added that stakeholders needed to monitor regulatory changes, and institutional strategies, and advance AI-crypto integration to remain competitive in this dynamic field. However, they recognized that digital assets are still tied to underdeveloped technologies, potential security vulnerabilities, intellectual property disputes, exchange credit risks, regulatory uncertainty, value instability, limited global adoption, and susceptibility to manipulation and fraud.

Ethereum Gains Ground Against Bitcoin Ethereum’s recent surge against Bitcoin in the ETH/BTC pair suggests a potential breakout, a historical precursor to altseason—a period where altcoins typically outperform Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index hit a high of 88/100 earlier this month (December 4) but has since settled at 47, indicating mixed sentiment regarding altcoin performance. Market dynamics further support this narrative. ETH gains against BTC often trigger broader altcoin rallies, reflecting growing investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies. This shift in focus could pave the way for increased market activity in altcoins as 2025 approaches. Ethereum Outperforms Bitcoin: Altseason on the Horizon?

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

Here’s a roundup of the biggest crypto news that made headlines throughout the year. Bitcoin ETF Approvals: A Milestone for the Industry The year kicked off with a historic move for Bitcoin as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first US-listed Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This approval marked a pivotal moment for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, opening the doors to a broader range of investors who were previously hesitant to buy Bitcoin directly. In total, 11 Bitcoin ETFs were approved in the US, offering a simpler entry point into the crypto market for traditional investors. SBF Sentenced: The Fall of FTX’s Founder In March, the crypto world was rocked by the sentencing of Samuel Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $11 billion in forfeiture for his involvement in fraudulent schemes. The sentencing followed his conviction for misappropriating billions of dollars of customer funds. Despite his conviction, Bankman-Fried has appealed his 25-year sentence, leaving the legal saga far from over. MicroStrategy’s Big Move: Nasdaq 100 Debut Amidst the turbulence, MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, made waves in the market by debuting on the Nasdaq 100 in 2024. This move solidified MicroStrategy’s profile as a major player in the world of Bitcoin, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin Halving: Reduced Block Rewards In April, Bitcoin’s third halving event of the year occurred, reducing miners’ block subsidy rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. This event had a significant impact on the network’s economic dynamics, although the drop in mining rewards was accompanied by a surprising decrease in average transaction fees. This halving event laid the foundation for a strong remainder of the year, with many anticipating a new price surge. Ripple vs. SEC: Legal Battle Continues One of the year’s most high-profile legal battles continued in 2024 with Ripple’s ongoing conflict with the SEC. In August, Ripple secured a major victory when the court ruled that it should only pay $125 million in fines, a far cry from the $2 billion originally sought by the SEC. However, the battle didn’t end there: in October, the SEC announced its intention to appeal the ruling, ensuring that the legal showdown between the two entities would continue into the next year. Binance CEO Sentenced: Zhao’s Legal Troubles In a surprising turn of events, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US money-laundering laws. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, had faced increasing scrutiny throughout 2024, and this sentencing marked a big move in the ongoing crackdown on crypto platforms that do not comply with regulations. WazirX Hack: $235 Million Stolen In a major cybersecurity incident, Indian crypto exchange WazirX was hacked, resulting in the theft of $235 million worth of various cryptocurrencies. The breach led to the exchange freezing transactions and working with forensic experts and law enforcement agencies to trace the stolen funds. This hack served as a reminder of the risks associated with crypto trading and the importance of enhanced security measures. Trump’s Win Boosts Crypto Prices The crypto market experienced a major surge following Donald Trump’s re-election as US President. His victory brought renewed optimism to the market, and cryptocurrencies saw sharp gains in the months that followed. The market was further influenced by the news that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would step down, adding to the sense of regulatory change and potential relief for the crypto industry. Bitcoin Breaks $100,000: A New All-Time High 2024 ended on a high note as Bitcoin achieved a new all-time high (ATH), surpassing the $100,000 price level for the first time. This was much-awaited and with Trump’s takeover, Bitcoin is expected to soar more.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-31 07:26:28

South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has announced that trading support for DAD will officially end on January 31, 2025. This decision was made after DAD was marked as a “trading alert asset” on December 10, 2024. Upbit stated that the DAD project team did not provide a satisfactory explanation regarding the exchange’s requests for transparency and important disclosures.

Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, calls it “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Per a recent Bloomberg report , the Bitcoin ETF, launched on January 11, 2024 , is the most successful ETF ever. BlackRock’s IBIT has amassed over $50 billion in assets under management (AuM) in the past 11 months, the report added. This is the first time an ETF is making a massive debut. According to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and at Strategas Securities, IBIT’s AuM was equivalent to over 50 European market-focused ETFs combined. Some of those European ETFs were more than 20 years old. “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented,” noted Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. “It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.” Seyffart forecasted that IBIT could earn about $112 million a year, given an expense ratio of 0.25% and with the current asset level. This comes a day after the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a remarkable $35.66 billion net inflows in 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT led the market with $37.31 billion in inflows. Further, BlackRock’s $11 trillion in assets under management has helped drive Bitcoin’s price past $100,000 for the first time. BlackRock’s IBIT Could Outshine Gold Shares While BlackRock’s IBIT leading the charge, Gold ETFs, with a current market size of $274 billion, are experiencing significant outflows for the first time in six months. Additionally, there is speculation that IBIT could outperform the largest gold ETF – SPDR Gold Shares, provided Bitcoin price remains strong. Nate Geraci recently shared a chart that makes a notable comparison between spot gold ETFs and bitcoin ETFs in the US. For reference, Gold ETFs were launched in 2004, while Bitcoin ETFs were launched in 2024. One of the more ridiculous charts you’ll ever see… Assets in spot gold ETFs vs bitcoin ETFs.

Zerebro, with its decentralized AI content system, is capitalizing on innovative use cases across blockchain ecosystems, while ai16z price movements reflect strong activity in the AI meme coin space, driven by its unique venture-focused DAO framework.

Supporting this growth, ai16z has been integrated into Ethereum validators through strategic partnerships, enhancing network scalability and reliability. The introduction of USDT-margined perpetual futures on OKX offers traders up to 50x leverage, boosting market engagement. As the AI meme coin space continues to expand, the ai16z price remains a key metric to watch, highlighting its position as an emerging force in the AI and blockchain crossover.

However, there are two new crypto assets that have outpaced the XRP price rise. Hyperliquid launched in November and was up 8X before a slight correction. The bull run has extended to those in presale too, with Rollblock , a next-gen GambleFi platform whose price is up over 400%, and of course, with its launch to come, 2025 might just turn out to be an incredible year for its investors. New Crypto Rollblock Presale is Taking the Market by Storm Rollblock is no doubt one of the hottest new crypto projects, with its presale surprising many during the Q4 bull run . The presale, now in stage 9, has already raised over $7.7 million, and seen a token price surge well over 400%. What is it about Rollblock that’s rocking the market at such an early stage? Well, it boasts strong utility and an ambitious vision of bringing DeFi innovation to the lucrative $500 billion online gambling industry. One of its key DeFi features is the Rollblock Revenue Sharing Model. This ensures all token holders earn a percentage of the platform’s revenues, and it’s paid out automatically to their wallets. It’s a great way to earn a passive income, and for those interested in that, there’s an even more lucrative staking mechanism built into Rollblock. To take advantage of this, token holders need to stake their tokens, which means locking them up for a certain period. This will help the platform with security and liquidity, and for their troubles, investors will be rewarded with up to 30% APY. There are many other standout features to this exciting new crypto asset, and analysts are predicting continued success for Rollblock. The bull run is expected to get crazy in 2025, and after it launches, even the most bullish Rollblock analysts’ predictions might seem a bit conservative. XRP Up Almost 400% in Q4 Bull Run XRP has been one of the standout performers in the recent bull run , with the price up nearly 400%. The token has benefited from the Trump factor after hints of it being included in the new government’s policy. The most likely utility for XRP would be cross-border payments, and there’s talk of a new USD stablecoin, which the Trump administration is known to want, being built into the XRP network. Hyperliquid Skyrockets 8X as Bull Run Gains Momentum Hyperliquid has been one of the biggest benefactors of the Q4 bull run, with the HYPE price skyrocketing 8x in value in a few short weeks. Not even a month old, Hyperliquid is a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain that’s looking to revolutionize DeFi thanks to its decentralized perpetual exchange services. Analysts are bullish on HYPE , and momentum suggests further gains ahead as the bull run garners pace again. Conclusion The Q4 bull run has been exciting to be part of. Even “Dinocoins” such as XRP have caught a bid. As the bull continues into 2025, we should see even more gains, and new crypto assets such as Hyperliquid and Rollblock might just take center stage. After all, it’s the newest cryptos that bring in the biggest gains of any bull run. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

His post highlighted the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern, commonly associated with bullish momentum in technical analysis. Pantoja stated, “Some $XRP holders are crying about consolidation, when it’s obviously forming a symmetrical triangle (bullish). Breakout to $3.20-$4 will come out of nowhere.” The symmetrical triangle is a chart pattern characterized by converging trendlines, indicating a period of price consolidation. It typically resolves with a breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend—in this case, upward momentum, as suggested by XRP’s prior rally. Based on Pantoja’s analysis, XRP’s current price action supports the possibility of a breakout , with a price target between $3.20 and $4. Some $XRP holders are crying about consolidation, when it's obviously forming a symmetrical triangle (bullish). Breakout to $3.20-$4 will come out of nowhere. #XRP pic.twitter.com/wAdPznO1aL — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) December 29, 2024 Community Sentiments and Reactions The post received significant engagement from the cryptocurrency community, sparking discussions about XRP’s price trajectory. Some users expressed optimism about the pattern, while others voiced skepticism based on past price performance. One commenter, Val, pointed out the recurring formation of symmetrical triangles in XRP’s history, which have not always resulted in the anticipated upward breakout. Val wrote, “Okay and how many times has it formed a symmetrical triangle in the past only for people to say it’s bullish & an indication that the price is going to rise, only for it not to have ended up pumping? Too many times. The price of XRP as of right now should be $5, but it’s not.” This sentiment reflects the frustrations of long-term XRP holders who have yet to see sustained price increases align with their expectations. Another user, RippleMeThis, took a different stance, commenting , “Crying with a $2 floor lol. They never would have lasted when it was $0.30.” This viewpoint highlights the substantial growth XRP has already achieved, emphasizing resilience amid market volatility. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Indika Torres contributed an optimistic perspective, stating , “Absolutely! Probably this week. Don’t understand the crying. We have buying opportunities right now. The people that are in fear, they lack knowledge. 2025 will be massive for ISO tokens.” ISO tokens mentioned by Torres refer to cryptocurrencies compliant with ISO 20022, a financial messaging standard gaining traction among global financial institutions. Current Market Context At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.09, representing a 2.55% decline in the past 24 hours. Despite this slight dip, the broader market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with investors eyeing a potential breakout from the symmetrical triangle pattern. Outlook While technical analysis suggests a bullish scenario, investors are advised to exercise caution. Market conditions, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments can significantly impact XRP’s price movements. As the cryptocurrency approaches the apex of the triangle, traders will closely monitor trading volume and price action for confirmation of a breakout. If Pantoja’s projection materializes, XRP holders could witness substantial gains, potentially solidifying the asset’s position as a leading cryptocurrency.

Everyone’s predicting it: investors, researchers, analysts, CEOs. Donald Trump’s return to the White House in November set the stage for what many are calling Bitcoin’s most explosive growth era yet. Why? Simple: Trump loves crypto. During his campaign, he promised to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the guy the crypto community sees as their biggest enemy, and create a national Bitcoin strategic reserve funded by selling off the Federal Reserve’s gold for it. A new narrative for Bitcoin The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 was a game-changer. Forget the drama of 2023—the FTX collapse, Binance scandals, and Sam Bankman-Fried in prison—because ETFs brought legitimacy. With Bitcoin ETFs on the table, institutional investors who’ve been sitting on the sidelines had a clean, regulated way to get in on the action. This isn’t just about Wall Street suits buying Bitcoin. It’s about your 401(k) eventually having a slice of it, thanks to those ETFs. So what’s the word on 2025? James Butterfill at CoinShares thinks Bitcoin could swing between $80,000 and $150,000 depending on Trump’s follow-through. “It’s all about the regulatory environment,” he said. If Trump delivers, the upper end of that range looks solid. If not? We’re looking at a dip to $80k. Institutional flows and the $200k prophecy Institutional money is flowing into Bitcoin like never before. Standard Chartered estimates that institutional inflows have already reached 683,000 BTC this year, much of it driven by ETFs and purchases from companies like MicroStrategy . The firm predicts Bitcoin will double to $200,000 by 2025, thanks to reforms that could allow U.S. retirement funds to allocate small portions of their $40 trillion pool to crypto. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and corporate balance sheets are all looking at Bitcoin . And the incoming Trump administration might make that easier by tweaking rules to let traditional finance (or “TradFi,” as the cool kids say) allocate more to crypto. Kendrick even pointed out that a tiny slice of the $40 trillion U.S. retirement fund market could push Bitcoin through the roof. Matrixport is playing it a little safer but still bullish, with a $160,000 target. Markus Thielen says Bitcoin’s base of buyers has expanded to the point where it can handle corrections without tanking. “Corrections will still happen, but not like the old days,” he said. Matrixport nailed its 2024 call of $125,000, so folks are now paying some serious attention to their 2025 prediction. Then there’s Galaxy Digital, which expects Bitcoin to hit $185,000 in Q4 2025. They’re betting on adoption from nations and corporations alike. Five Nasdaq 100 companies and at least five countries are expected to add Bitcoin to their reserves next year, according to their research. “Bitcoin is outpacing gold and stocks,” said Alex Thorn, their head of research. Big players, big bets Carol Alexander, a finance professor who called Bitcoin’s $100,000 surge early on this year, sees the price hitting $200,000, possibly even by summer. But she’s not blind to the risks. Alexander points out that unregulated crypto exchanges can drive insane volatility, thanks to leveraged trades. “It could hit $150,000 and swing $50,000 either way,” she said. Still, her track record makes her voice one to watch. Youwei Yang at Bit Mining also has high hopes, with a range of $180,000 to $190,000. But he’s quick to add that Bitcoin could dip as low as $80,000 during market shocks, like a major stock market crash or geopolitical tensions. “Overall, though, the trend is bullish,” he said. Sid Powell at Maple Finance shares the optimism with a dose of caution. He’s targeting $180,000 to $200,000 by year-end 2025, based on ETF inflows and Trump’s rumored Bitcoin reserve. But Powell knows the game—crypto loves its cycles. “Corrections are part of the process,” he said, but added that institutional flows should act as a safety net, preventing the 70%-80% drawdowns of the past.

This development has sparked market optimism over future movements. On-chain data on Tuesday indicated that a whale bagged nearly $77 million worth of the second-largest crypto by market cap as the asset’s price flirted around the $3,300 mark. As a response, market enthusiasts now eye a $10,000 price target for ETH as 2025 is set to kick off. Ethereum Whale Bags Heavily Signaling Remarkable Gains Ahead According to an X post by Lookonchain on December 31, an Ethereum whale was recorded accumulating 22,919 ETH, worth $77.2 million, amid the coin’s recent volatile action. As per the data , the wallet address 0x6c.. was recorded to have made the massive accumulation. Notably, this massive buying took place at an average ETH price of $3,368. Meanwhile, the trading strategy has garnered additional attention, primarily in light of the trader’s previous profit-making strategies. Data indicated that since August 12, the same whale was recorded as making 25 swing trades in ETH and WBTC. Moreover, 21 of these proved highly profitable, underscoring a win rate of 84% and a profit of $4.57 million. In light of these past profit-making strategies, market watchers are now eyeing the $3,300 price mark as the Ethereum whale bagged heavy amounts at this level, with investors expecting gains in the top crypto’s price as soon as next year. What’s Next For ETH? At the time of reporting, ETH price was down by roughly 2% intraday and is currently trading at $3,353. Its 24-hour low and high were $3,298.80 and $3,425.80, respectively. Notably, the waning price action aligns with the broader trend and a holiday sentiment brewing across the broader landscape. Nevertheless, market participants remain optimistic about the asset’s long-term prospects. A recent ETH price analysis by CoinGape indicated that the token could rally and hit a $10,000 price level ahead. This bullish prediction comes against the backdrop of historical trends and strong market technicals. As a result, market watchers anticipate phenomenal gains in the asset’s price, with bullish sentiments further supported by the massive Ethereum whale accumulation. However, despite the positive predictions, the investors also remained cautious amid the recent developments in the market. For context, Justin Sun has recently deposited 29,153 ETH to HTX, sparking discussions over the potential reason behind the transfer.

Data released on Dec. 30 revealed that December marked the highest monthly trading volume for DEXs, continuing the momentum from November. In November, the DeFi space recorded a volume of $374 billion, spurred by optimism surrounding a potential crypto-friendly regulatory regime in the United States after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. Top DEXs by Trading Volume Uniswap remained the top decentralized exchange by volume, recording $106.4 billion over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama. PancakeSwap followed with $96.4 billion in trading volume for the month. Solana’s largest DEX, Raydium, claimed third place, registering $58 billion in monthly volume. This surge coincided with an increase in Solana-based decentralized application (DApp) revenue. On Dec. 17, research platform Syndica reported that Solana DApps generated $365 million in revenue during November, largely fueled by memecoins launched on the Solana platform Pump.fun. Aerodrome and Orca took the fourth and fifth spots, with volumes of $31 billion and $22 billion, respectively. Lifinity, Curve Finance, and Hyperliquid collectively recorded $43.6 billion in trading volume. Memecoin Market Declines Despite Early Surge While DeFi trading volumes climbed, the memecoin market faced a significant correction in December. CoinMarketCap data showed that the memecoin market cap peaked at $137 billion on Dec. 9 but dropped sharply to $92 billion by Dec. 23. At the time of writing, the total market cap for memecoins stood at $95 billion, reflecting a 20% decline since Dec. 1.

Some traders expect the current price action to likely continue until February, weeks after president-elect Donald Trump takes office in the U.S. and sets into motion a barrage of policies that may help the market.""We are skeptical of any New Year fireworks especially with funding healthy,"" traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast.

This means traders are betting on bitcoin prices going up in March. They're buying more call options (which profit if the stock rises) than put options. The cost of these options is going down, showing optimism for the March period. BTC is on track to end December down 4%, its worst since 2021, as both retail investors and long-term holders cash out positions after a 117% yearly surge. Elsewhere, readings of the U.S. Chicago PMI indicate an economic slowdown, adding pressure on the market that tends to be correlated to such data. In what looks to have been its final purchase of the year, Bitcoin development company MicroStrategy increased its BTC stash for the eighth consecutive week on Monday, adding another 2,138 BTC for $209 million in the week ended Dec. 29. That brought its total holdings to 446,400 BTC. But news of the buying did little to stem losses. BTC prices slumped in the hours following MicroStrategy’s announcement, while shares of the company fell 8% to their lowest since early November. The fall spread over to majors, with ether (ETH), XRP, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA falling as much as 3% before recovering. BNB Chain’s BNB was little changed, while memecoins dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) fell 5%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, minus stablecoins, lost 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

Fidelity’s FBTC lost $154 million to lead outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC at $130 million and BlackRock’s IBIT at $36 million. The products have recorded more than $1.5 billion in net outflows since Dec. 19, pausing an impressive run in the first half of the month that saw nearly $2 billion in net inflows.

33767162,[object Object],1735632041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Buyers Waiting To Pounce: Binance Stablecoin Reserve Sets New Record,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-buyers-binance-stablecoin-reserve-new/,"Data shows the stablecoin reserve on Binance has shot up to a new record recently, a sign that could be bullish for Bitcoin and other coins. Stablecoin Exchange Reserve On Binance Has Seen Rapid Growth Recently As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post , the stablecoin Binance reserve has shot up recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “ Exchange Reserve ,” which measures the total amount of a given asset that’s sitting in the wallets of one or more centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes down, it means the investors are depositing a net amount of the token to these platforms. Such a trend implies there is demand in the market for trading away the cryptocurrency. For volatile assets like Bitcoin, this kind of trend can have a bearish effect on their prices. In the case of stablecoins, though, the same doesn’t hold true as their prices are, by definition, stable around the $1 mark. That doesn’t mean, however, that the selling of stablecoins is of no consequence for the sector. Investors generally store their capital in the form of these fiat-tied tokens when they want to avoid the volatility associated with BTC and others, but once they feel the time is right to buy back in, they make a swap using exchanges. As such, stablecoin inflows into exchanges can be a bullish sign for volatile assets like Bitcoin, since they showcase that the investors are potentially interested in trading their stables in favor of these tokens. On the other hand, the Exchange Reserve noting a decline implies the investors are withdrawing the asset into their self-custodial wallets, possibly to hold into the long-term. Once again, the trend is opposite between Bitcoin and stablecoins, with the former’s outflows being bullish and the latter’s bearish. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the ERC-20 stablecoins Exchange Reserve for Binance : As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoins Exchange Reserve for Binance has registered a rapid increase to a new all-time high (ATH) recently. The peak in this spike came ahead of BTC’s top , implying it was the buying from these stablecoin holders that played a role in the run. The supply on the platform has declined since the peak, but the drop has only been slight so far, meaning there may still be plenty of fuel waiting to be deployed into BTC and others. The trend isn’t exclusive to Binance, either, as another analyst has pointed out in a Quicktake post that the combined stablecoins Exchange Reserve for all platforms has also spiked recently. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $92,400, down over 1.5% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Buyers|btc|BTCUSDT|stablecoin,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-31 08:00:41

According to Russian news outlet Tsargrad TV , Delimkhanov stated that starting from Jan. 1, 2025 cryptocurrency mining will be deemed illegal in the Chechen Republic. Therefore, anyone found mining crypto in the region will be punished severely. “We will equate them with terrorists, since their actions harm the whole society,” the deputy said, adding that he was relaying the words of Chechen Head of State Ramzan Kadyrov. Delimkhanov explained that crypto mining could lead to problems with the stability of electricity in certain region, affecting the daily lives of citizens. This is due to the large demand of electricity needed to power crypto mining systems, he said, which could disrupt the flow of electricity. He warned that if crypto mining activities are found to result in electricity problems in Russian districts, villages or cities, then the authorities will respond quickly and put crypto miners behind bars. You might also like: Russia to impose regional controls over crypto mining starting Jan 2025 As previously reported by crypto.news last October, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Evgeny Grabcha said that Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining will be banned in several key regions due to energy shortages. The ban applies to individual crypto miners and mining companies based in areas such as Dagestan, Chechnya, as well as the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics. It also extends to areas in the Irkutsk Region, Buryatia, and Zabaikalsky during peak hours. Lawmakers claim crypto mining has caused significant electricity deficits, making it impossible to provide large power capacities until at least 2030. The ban is said to take effect in November and will remain effective until March 15, 2031. The crypto mining ban follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s signing of a crypto circulation bill that gives Russian lawmakers the power to ban cryptocurrency mining in specific regions. Not only that, the law also prohibits ads for companies that provide crypto services among other restrictions.

Van de Poppe tells his 169,000 YouTube subscribers that he expects Bitcoin to rally by approximately 60% over the course of 2025. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is primed to enjoy an extended bullish cycle over the coming months. “I do not expect Bitcoin to peak in 2025 because I expect that there’s way more money needed to actually move Bitcoin upwards or to move it into the markets. That’s why I think that the cycles are going to extend and they are more based on macro perspectives rather than the four-year cycle with halvings. So I think that within this year, we’re going to see Bitcoin breaking through $150,000 and stay there for a little while until we can start expanding into 2026.” According to Van de Poppe, Bitcoin’s rally will be partially driven by the macro-economic catalysts. “We can see that the global money supply starts to increase while the US money supply is just lagging behind. There’s still a lot to come from the US and I think that in 2025, the labor markets are going to be weaker, the chances of having a recession have increased and through that the US money supply will quickly expand through which Bitcoin [will] continue to have its momentum.” The crypto analyst and trader, however, says that Bitcoin will not have a smooth ride to the cycle peak. “That said I also expect to see significant corrections in between. I do assume that at the end of Q1 of 2025, we’re going to have a correction of 30%, very much comparable to what we’ve seen in 2024.” Bitcoin is trading at $93,790 at time of writing.

Top Expert Predicts Big Rally,https://coingape.com/will-xrp-price-surge-to-11-top-expert-predicts-big-rally/,"XRP price has continued to stay in the red, as investors appeared to have taken a pause amid the holiday sentiment. However, as the crypto still holds above the brief $2 mark, the experts remained optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin. A top expert has recently predicted a potential rally for Ripple’s native crypto in 2025, which could push the crypto to a new high of $11. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $11 The XRP price is likely to end the ongoing year on a low note after a robust rally over the past few months. However, despite that, the experts have maintained a bullish outlook for the crypto, showcasing their growing confidence towards the asset amid a flurry of positive market developments. For context, top expert Ali Martinez recently said that the crypto is gearing up for a massive rally ahead. In a recent X post, Martinez said that “one of the most promising setup” for XRP appeared as we are entering the New Year. Besides, he predicted that this setup indicates a potential rally for Ripple’s native crypto to $11 over the next few months. Source: Ali Martinez, X This comes in tandem with other expert’s forecasts, which also indicate a potential rebound in the crypto’s price ahead. For context, popular crypto market expert EGRAG CRYPTO recently said that Ripple’s coin could target the $4 next if it holds above the brief $2 support. On the other hand, other positive market developments also suggest a potential rally for the asset. For context, a flurry of market participants anticipates the dismissal of the XRP Lawsuit under the incoming US SEC Chair Paul Atkins. If this holds true, this could significantly boost the investors’ sentiment, which in turn could also push the price higher. Market Sentiment Remains Strong For Ripple’s Coin XRP price today slumped about 1.2% and exchanged hands at $2.03, while its one-day trading volume rose 47% to $6.11 billion. Notably, the crypto has maintained the $2 over the last 24 hours, while touching a high of $2.14 in the same timeframe. Besides, Future Open Interest for Ripple’s coin was up 2% despite the recent dip in price, according to CoinGlass data . Simultaneously, a flurry of market experts also remained confident about the future trajectory of the coin. In a separate X post, Ali Martinez said “The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the XRP daily chart”, which suggests a “big price movement” ahead. Source: Ali Martinez, X On the other hand, another top expert Dark Defender recently said that as long as Ripple’s native crypto holds above the $1.95, “a breakout is imminent.” Besides, he has also set an initial target of $5.85 for the crypto. In addition, he also said that the crypto could face a correction in the daily charts for around 10 days. Source: Dark Defender, X However, he also noted that a “bull flag” appeared for the XRP price.

Reiterating its long-held anti-crypto stance , the RBI highlighted the various risks involved with digital assets in its Dec. 30 Financial Stability Report for 2024. While crypto adoption flourished at the grassroots level in India this year, the RBI raised a red flag, warning that unchecked use of digital assets, including stablecoins, could loosen monetary reins, open backdoors for capital flight, and “divert resources available for financing the real economy.” According to the regulator, while the crypto market in India “remains small,” the narrowing gap between decentralized and traditional finance could pose systemic risks, with stablecoins carrying the added danger of potential run risks . Citing the International Monetary Fund – Financial Stability Board report, the RBI added that stablecoin issuers are becoming significant holders of mainstream financial assets, such as government securities and other collateral, raising concerns about their impact on economic stability. Stablecoins also pose unique challenges, particularly in emerging markets where “country-specific macroeconomic and demographic factors” have led to increased usage, the report stated, adding: “These developments can undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy, circumvent capital controls, strain fiscal resources, and threaten financial stability.” You might also like: India risks losing $2b in tax revenue as crypto traders shift to offshore platforms: report Over the years, India’s central bank has pushed central bank digital currencies as a more reliable alternative to stablecoins. During the G30 39th Annual International Banking Seminar in October, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das labeled stablecoins as private money, which could undermine government sovereignty by allowing private issuers to dominate the payments market. Tokenization is another area that concerns the RBI due to the sector’s potential to “deepen the interconnectedness between the traditional financial system and the decentralized financial system.” Although the market for tokenization remains in its early stages, the RBI is worried about the risks it could introduce, including “liquidity and maturity mismatches,” excessive borrowing or debt built on tokenized assets, “asset price and quality risks,” and “operational fragilities.” The report stressed that these vulnerabilities could spill over into the broader financial system, amplifying systemic risks. The RBI’s warning comes as India’s cryptocurrency sector continues to drift in regulatory limbo. Despite calls for regularity clarity, the government recently admitted that there is “no fixed timeline” for introducing a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets. Meanwhile, India’s crypto market remains burdened by a tax regime seen as overly harsh, with a 30% capital gains tax, a 1% TDS on every transaction, and no provision to offset losses. According to a recent report , this is triggering capital flight, yielding considerable revenue losses for both the government in the form of uncollected taxes and domestic crypto service providers due to declining trading activity as traders shift to offshore exchanges.

Cardano and Dogwifhat are on the road to recovery, both these coins and ICO star DTX Exchange are must-haves for any growth portfolio in 2025. Table of Contents Cardano gains 8.5% in weekly charts Dogwifhat trying to revive the meme coin hype DTX Exchange: Investors gain 17% overnight Conclusion As Christmas week comes to an end, the markets are optimistic, and the Dogwifhat (WIF) and Cardano (ADA) charts turn green. Many other coins also saw green phases but could not sustain it for long. As the markets resume their positive movements and there is a bullish trend overall, experts predict there will be a more cautious approach to crypto investment. The predictions are also more muted, and upward projections are revised. Both Cardano and Dogwifhat have different things going for them. While Cardano is a technically strong and high utility, scalable network with PoS support, Dogwifhat is a popular meme coin that is supported by a robust community. While both these coins have positives, experts predict that the new hybrid trading platform DTX Exchange (DTX) is also poised for phenomenal growth in 2025. It is already listed on the aggregator platform CoinMarketCap. It is also gaining attention for its Phoenix Wallet, which offers non-custodial transaction support. Cardano gains 8.5% in weekly charts ADA has recovered 8.5% in the weekly charts and gained over 3.5% in the daily charts. Issues with the network and internal conflict have raised concerns about the financial management of investors’ funds and other governance issues. This had caused some negative movement. Source: CoinMarketCap The Cardano price touched $1.3 in early December before dropping to the $1.2 range. It eventually fell to the $0.77 low after the FOMC meeting and has recovered to its current range of $0.89. Market volume is up 24% to $855.67 million, while the market cap is currently $31.6 billion, up by almost 4%. Dogwifhat trying to revive the meme coin hype Dogwifhat is one of the cutest meme coins, with its Shiba Inu dog with a pink knitted hat symbol. The altcoin is built on the Solana blockchain and keeps a light-hearted approach that matches its fun-loving origins. Like most meme coins, the Dogwifhat price is usually volatile and reflects the market and external pricing influences effectively. With a strong community making the meme coin exciting, Dogwifhat (WIF) is a good choice for its big rewards and risks. Source: CoinMarketCap The WIF is trading around $1.89, up by over 2% in the daily charts. Community sentiment is bullish, while the market volume is up 3% to $248.88 million, and the market cap is currently $1.88 billion, up by almost 2%.

The platform supports trades in over 120,000 trading instruments, like stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex, and bonds.

As is known, the cryptocurrency market grew incredibly under the leadership of Bitcoin in 2024, and the BTC price exceeded $ 100,000, leaving behind the psychological barrier that was once considered insurmountable. However, some altcoins broke records in terms of the number of daily active addresses on their blockchain networks in 2024. The list contains some surprising rankings in terms of size. It is particularly noteworthy that the Ethereum network did not make it into the top 10 on the list, and instead, many layer 2 protocols were on the list. Here are the blockchain networks with the highest number of daily active addresses and their average user numbers in 2024: Near (NEAR) – 2.7 million Solana (SOL) – 2.6 million Tron (TRX) – 1.9 million BNB Chain (BNB) – 1 million Polygon (POL) – 855 thousand Base – 655 thousand Sui (SUI) – 519 thousand Bitcoin (BTC) – 496 thousand The Open Network (TON) 414 thousand Arbitrum (ARB) – 413 thousand The reason why the layer 2 protocols on the list are so popular is that they are much faster and lower cost than the layer 1 protocol Ethereum. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that Bitcoin, which does not have many DeFi features, is also at the bottom of the list. *This is not investment advice.
