The recent price decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking by investors after the rally. However, despite this dip, the blockchain continues to attract significant interest from major holders. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this trend in a Wednesday tweet, revealing that the dip has triggered a wave of accumulation among Cardano whales . “Cardano whales took profits on the way up from $1.15 to $1.33, but after $ADA dropped to $0.91, they started buying again. In fact, they’ve bought 160 million ADA since the dip,” Martinez wrote. Further data reveals that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA, often called “sharks,” have seen a significant increase in activity during this accumulation phase. While frequently overlooked, this investor tier wields substantial influence in the market. Their cumulative buying or selling activity can notably impact price trends, often shaping broader market dynamics and signaling potential shifts in momentum. The continued accumulation of ADA reflects growing confidence in the Cardano ecosystem, which has been gaining momentum across multiple areas. Data from crypto analysis platform Taptools reveals that, over the past 30 days, the ecosystem has seen a substantial inflow of more than 3.78 million ADA into the market. During this period, Cardano has consistently maintained over 50,000 active daily traders on its decentralized exchanges (DEXs), underscoring its rising liquidity and expanding user base. Additionally, the surge in liquidity and active addresses signals a strong influx of new investors, further strengthening Cardano’s market position. Furthermore, as per data from DefiLlama, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has seen remarkable growth this year, reaching approximately $708 million earlier this month and surpassing previous all-time highs. Cardano has also been steadily gaining prominence in the cryptocurrency space, driven by its advancements in sectors such as DeFi, smart contracts, and scaling solutions like Hydra, attracting significant interest from larger institutional investors. On the price front, the accumulation of ADA by whales during market dips is a positive signal for retail investors. It suggests that the perceived “floor” price is around $0.90, which has recently been breached as a key support level, indicating the potential for a price rebound. ADA was trading at $0.85 at press time, reflecting a 0.14% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:23:21

According to the data , MakerDAO reached a peak of $40.86 million in fees, a key metric of user activity, and $26.77 million in revenue, reflecting retained earnings, between December 1 and December 31. A Historic Month for MakerDAO 2024 has also been the crypto lending protocol’s best year since its inception, making about $304 million in fees and over $174 million in revenue. At that time, the highest amount recorded for fees was in April, when the protocol received $32.62 million, while its best month in terms of turnover was November when it made $18.91 million. However, December’s numbers beat both those figures by $8.24 million and $7.86 million, respectively, setting a new precedent for the platform. Interestingly, MakerDAO also saw its highest single-day performance on December 9, bringing in $1.67 million in levies and $1.18 million in income. These earnings have been driven primarily by interest payments on loans made on the protocol’s DAI stablecoin, reflecting the increasing demand for its lending services. In August, the platform announced it would rebrand to Sky after two years of development aimed at adding new functionalities and improving user interactions. It also introduced two new cryptocurrencies: USDS, a stablecoin that users could convert from their existing DAI holdings, and a new governance token named SKY. USDS has also been launched on Solana as a DeFi-native stablecoin. The network has the second-largest decentralized finance ecosystem after Ethereum, with about $8.5 billion locked into its DeFi projects. MKR’s Market Performance Elsewhere, Maker’s native asset MKR experienced a less-than-impressive December. According to data from CoinGecko, the token lost 16.8% of its value over the last 30 days, with its worst performance coming in the previous two weeks, where it dipped by more than 21%. In the last 24 hours, its price fluctuated between $1,488 and $1,547, finally settling at $1,522. The current price is 1.1% below its previous level from yesterday and remains more than 75% below its all-time high, recorded in May 2021. However, it still shows healthy market activity, with its latest one-day trading volume of $113.1 million helping it maintain a significant value with a market cap of $1.37 billion.

Despite a fabulous rally in November, the entire market pulled back, and BTC now trades at around $93,000. Altcoins have dominated the headlines recently with continued gains as we near the altcoin season. Large-cap altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Stellar (XLM), grabbed attention for their immense gains in November and have the market on their toes as to what will happen with their prices when we finally enter the altcoin season. Join us as we explore the top gainers and potential winners as the altcoin season inches closer. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is another major gainer since Donald Trump’s election victory. On-chain metrics show Cardano’s weekly active addresses elevated since the crypto market rally triggered by Trump’s win on November 6 began. The surge in network usage and whale buying activity has resulted in a bullish outlook for ADA. ADA further surged after the Cardano blockchain developers, the Cardano Foundation, released an updated proposal for the Cardano Constitution to improve network governance. The revised proposal includes changes to constitutional workshops, social media discussion, and expert and community feedback. The changes aim to “improve the accessibility and clarity of the Cardano governance framework,” shifting its focus to a less technical audience. Interest in Cardano (ADA) surged after its founder, Charles Hoskinson, revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s incoming administration. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) made headlines in recent months for its massive gains. The Stellar network is similar to the Ripple (XRP) network - a decentralised payment platform and cryptocurrency that facilitates quick and low-cost cross-border payments, promoting financial inclusion for individuals and businesses globally. The Stellar network was created to support digital representations of any currency but has its native token called Lumens (XLM). Developed as a fork of the Ripple protocol, Stellar aims to create a global network connecting financial institutions, payment processors, and individual users, making cross-border money transfer easier and providing access to essential financial services. XLM, in conjunction with XRP, is expected to play a significant role in the new global financial system. XRP is uniquely designed to optimize institutional liquidity for cross-border transactions. At the same time, XLM’s infrastructure was built to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and retail-level remittances efficiently. Financial experts envision a two-tiered monetary framework using XRP and XLM at different levels for specific purposes. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $12.4 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 230%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Expected Surge Upon Exchange Listing As BTC trades at around $93,000 and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this powerful blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $680,000 and will soon reach its fundraising target. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

While established tokens like Shiba Inu have already made waves, new contenders like BTFD Coin and SLERF are emerging with massive potential. BTFD Coin’s presale has been particularly impressive, raising over $4.6 million within its first month, and analysts are already predicting major gains. This all reminds us of the 1973 economic collapse when the world faced a significant downturn, but smart investors who bought during the chaos later reaped huge rewards. Is history repeating itself? If you’re wondering which meme coins offer the best investment opportunities right now, you’re in the right place. In this article, we’ll take a close look at BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and SLERF, comparing their presales, potential returns, and future prospects. We’ll also highlight BTFD Coin’s recent performance, which is turning heads as it continues to break records. With its exciting presale, community-focused features, and an all-new P2E game , BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin – it’s a movement. Meme coins have come a long way, from being niche crypto jokes to becoming a dominant force in the market. Over the years, we’ve seen projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu make waves, and now BTFD Coin and SLERF are looking to take that momentum even further. BTFD Coin, in particular, is building on this wave, offering not just meme coin appeal, but a gamified experience, staking rewards , and a referral program that could take it to the next level. Investors are flocking to it, and it’s easy to see why – it’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolutionising Crypto As the 13th stage of the presale unfolds, the coin is available for $0.000142. With over $4.6 million raised, the presale reached impressive milestones, including $1 million in under 10 days and $2.5 million in less than 14 days. The project boasts a vibrant community of 7,000+ holders, with more than 60 billion coins sold so far. What sets BTFD Coin apart from other meme coins is its focus on building a vibrant community and offering utilities like a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a referral program. This isn’t just about buying coins and waiting for a pump; it’s about engaging with the platform and earning rewards as you go. And with a killer bonus code – BIG50 – you can grab 50% extra coins . Looking back to the 1973 economic collapse, it’s easy to see how BTFD Coin’s current presale mirrors that kind of opportunity. When markets were down in the ’70s, those who bought into undervalued assets found themselves in a prime position when the economy recovered. Today, we’re seeing a similar scenario with BTFD Coin, where smart investors are buying in early to take advantage of the low presale price. And with the presale tally already crossing $4 million, it’s clear that this meme coin is gaining serious traction. BTFD Coin offers one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential , and if you’re not on board yet, now’s the time to act. As the presale progresses, the price will only rise, so getting in with the BIG50 bonus code is a no-brainer. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity – it’s only going to get better from here. Don’t miss the BIG50 festive bonus! Use code BIG50 to earn 50% more tokens. For example, purchasing 100 coins will reward you with 150. Secure $BTFD now and set yourself up for success. Shiba Inu: The King of Meme Coins Shiba Inu is often regarded as the “Doge killer” for its rapid rise in popularity and its reputation as one of the top meme coins on the market. Since its launch, Shiba Inu has seen massive growth, making early investors some serious profits. However, while Shiba Inu’s community and ecosystem are impressive, its potential for exponential growth is starting to plateau as the market matures. At its peak, Shiba Inu saw a massive surge in price, with people scrambling to get in before it skyrocketed. But now, its price has stabilised, and while it still has a large and loyal community, many investors are looking for the next big thing. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. With its innovative approach, including a P2E game, staking rewards, and an aggressive presale strategy, BTFD Coin is challenging the status quo and could easily surpass Shiba Inu in terms of growth potential. Just like Shiba Inu, BTFD Coin has captured the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts, but it stands out because of its unique offerings that provide value beyond just holding coins. This focus on utility, community engagement, and rewards is a key differentiator. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $4 million, and its trajectory shows no signs of slowing down. It’s one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, and if you’re still hanging on to Shiba Inu, now might be the time to diversify and add some BTFD to your portfolio. SLERF: The Underdog with Serious Potential SLERF is another up-and-coming meme coin that’s gaining traction in the crypto world. While it hasn’t yet reached the same level of recognition as BTFD Coin or Shiba Inu, its presale has been steadily growing, attracting a loyal following. Like BTFD Coin, SLERF offers a community-driven approach, with an emphasis on decentralisation and rewards for holders. SLERF has made a strong start in its presale, but it still has a long way to go before it can catch up with the kind of explosive growth that BTFD Coin has seen. With a similar low entry price and early-stage promise, SLERF presents an interesting option for investors looking for a meme coin with 100x potential. However, when comparing SLERF to BTFD Coin, it’s clear that BTFD’s presale strategy, utility offerings, and community-driven incentives put it in a prime position to outperform SLERF in the coming months. Both projects have a lot of potential, but BTFD Coin’s presale has already proven itself to be one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, thanks to its early success and growing community. It’s hard to deny that BTFD Coin is the front-runner in this race. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Ready to get in on the action?

Bitcoin Reserves on Exchanges Shrink To New Lows,https://zycrypto.com/btc-skyrocketing-rally-bitcoin-reserves-on-exchanges-shrink-to-new-lows/,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) price faces a potentially massive rally as on-chain factors remain positive. Whales and institutional investors have repositioned assets to favor an uphill narrative ahead of 2025. This year, the crypto market dominated financial spaces with multiple all-time highs for some assets. Bitcoin Reserves Plunge to 2.4 Million BTC On-chain data shows declining Bitcoin reserves across exchanges, tipping a higher price action. This year, reserves on centralized exchanges dropped to 2.4 million from 3 million in January. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January led to declining numbers. Sequel to the approvals, the BTC price rose to new highs above $7k. Most whales withdrew assets from exchanges as funds trickled into the ecosystem. Outflows from exchanges point to an increased price action due to whales considering long-term holdings. Conversely, inflow to these platforms leads to sell pressure because of the popular sentiment associated with the transfers. Crypto analyst KriptoBaykusv2 explained that the presence of institutional investors sparked the status quo, seeing rapid inflows as a sign of more gains. Most traditional investors bought the dip and have maintained a hodl strategy. On the other hand, retail investors tend to move tokens on slight price changes, leading to BTC redistribution. “ This shift is particularly evident among institutional investors, who have increasingly embraced the “hodl” approach, demonstrating strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future potential. As reserves dwindled, Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge. Starting the year around $40K, the price accelerated in November, surpassing the $100K milestone and setting a new peak at $104K.” As exchange balances drop, Bitcoin miner reserves spike following the price surge. The last bear market saw miners sell reserves to stay afloat. High prices result in a hodl strategy to maximize gains. Bitcoin Bulls Expect Massive Price Upticks Bitcoin enthusiasts have projected a massive price surge next year due to bullish industry and on-chain factors. The transfer of assets to other custodians shows a supply shock, which could be the catalyst for the needed price action. Several whales have also ramped up accumulations alongside top firms releasing their 2025 market outlook. In a new release, Bitfinex analysts noted that the market is positioned to see a price upswing, hitting $200K due to institutional activities. Similar firms have projected the same price range for the asset, citing favorable United States policies, among others.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:38:22

Rumors about a customer repayment plan for January 2025 have been dismissed by one of its major creditors, causing even more confusion. The news had circulated over the weekend. Many claimed that FTX would begin repayments on January 3 and distribute $16 billion to creditors within 60 days. However, a key creditor, Sunil, denied these claims, saying the timeline and payout were inaccurate. Sunil Clears the Air on January Repayment Plan In a recent X post, Sunil, an FTX creditor advocate, denied claims about a January repayment date. He explained that the date was wrong and provided an update on FTX’s recovery. He revealed the exchange has recovered $13 billion from debtors, potentially reaching $14 billion by March 2025. However, he warned creditors not to expect an immediate payout as the situation remains uncertain. The confusion stems from FTX’s plan to keep half the recovered funds. Sunil explained that FTX will hold 50% of the $13 billion for future needs, leaving just $7 billion for the first round of payouts. This means the repayment will be slower and smaller than expected, with creditors initially receiving only part of their claims. FTX Debtors to Receive Full Reimbursement in 2-3 Years For those hoping for full compensation soon, Sunil added more caution. He said that reimbursing creditors could take two to three years, much longer than the earlier promise of quick repayment. This has left many customers questioning the truth behind FTX’s recovery plans. Amid the confusion, many users are looking for a clearer repayment schedule. Earlier this month, a tweet from the official FTX account suggested repayments would start in January. This led a user to ask Sunil about the conflicting information. With no clear answers yet, these uncleared questions fuel ongoing frustrations. Legal Hiccups and Missed Opportunities To add another layer to the ongoing controversy, earlier decisions in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings have left many creditors feeling cheated. Earlier, presiding judge John Dorsey made a notable ruling. He allowed the exchange to repay creditors based on the monetary value of a user’s balance at the time of the bankruptcy filing. This meant creditors missed out on the potential profits from the rise in cryptocurrency prices, especially for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, Bitcoin was priced at $16,871 and Solana at $16.25. This is much lower than their values as of writing.

In that time frame, monthly volumes totaled $182 million, $167 million, and $135 million in October, November, and December, respectively. The network’s popularity among retail users is rising due to its efficiency and cost. Institutions have also played a part as inflows lead to more market transactions. According to the analysts, the decline of TON enabled Tron to take the top spot, coupled with Tether’s activity. In previous months, Telegram-based games took over the ecosystem, with the network being a huge beneficiary. Inflow to the ecosystem began to decline as momentum shifted to other networks. Furthermore, Tron’s USDT volume is another driver of bullish activity. This comes on the heels of retail crypto traders ramping up gains on the back of the market surge. What Next For TRX Price? Amid huge inflows, TRX surged to new highs, recording huge community activities. The asset’s rise was linked to its transaction volumes, and gains were seen in wider crypto events. The United States election was a major driver of crypto prices this quarter. After the polls, the asset hit a new all-time high above $0.45 before sharply declining. It should be noted that Justin Sun’s announced of a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance. However, the wider market crash saw the asset record a 40% correction, although the bull signal increased on-chain data. According to CryptoQuant, a custom indicator based on the combination of RSI and MACD points to a move away from the overbought zone. This is a sign of incoming bull activity with healthier conditions from investors. Ahead of next year’s projected rally, institutional investors are repositioning assets and whales ramping up tokens. “ The next steps are crucial. If we see an “oversold” signal in the coming days, it could present a solid buying opportunity for those aiming to capitalize on the continuation of Tron’s bullish momentum. For now, patience is key. Monitoring this custom indicator and staying updated on market trends will be vital to identifying the right moment to re-enter Tron,” the report added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|TON,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 22:54:37

Now, Nvidia is reportedly going to open-source the software. Run:ai posted the latest news on its website and revealed Nvidia’s plans to open source its software. Regulators from both sides of the Atlantic probed Nvidia on antitrust grounds While neither of the companies explained the intention, Venture Beat suggests this might not be hard to figure out as Nvidia has ballooned to be the most valuable company in the world at $3.56 trillion. Despite its size, it also becomes difficult for the chip-making giant to acquire companies because of antitrust oversight. The acquisition faced some hurdles after the EU Commission indicated in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the proposed transaction would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to Reuters , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks, but eventually concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. The Department of Justice also investigated Nvidia over the transaction on antitrust grounds. Now, after finally sealing the deal, a Nvidia spokesperson only said in a statement: “We’re delighted to welcome the Run:ai team to Nvidia.” However, Run:ai founders Omri Geller and Ronen Dar indicated in a statement that open-sourcing the software will help the community build better AI, faster. “While Run:ai currently supports only Nvidia GPUs, open-sourcing the software will enable it to extend its availability to the entire AI ecosystem.” Geller and Dar. The Israeli startup founders also added that this will continue to help their customers get the most of their AI infrastructure and offer the ecosystem maximum flexibility, efficiency, and utilization for GPU systems, whenever they are. The Nvidia – Run:ai transaction to help customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure The two founders also revealed that they will continue to strengthen their partnerships and work alongside the ecosystem to give customers various AI solutions and platform choices. “True to our open-platform philosophy, as part of Nvidia, we will keep empowering AI teams with the freedom to choose the tools, platforms, and frameworks that best suit their needs,” said Geller and Dar. The Israel-based startup revealed that its goal when it started in 2018 was to be a driving force in the AI revolution and empower organizations to unlock the full potential of their AI infrastructure. According to VB , the company helps its customers orchestrate their AI infrastructure, enhance efficiency, and utilization as well as boost the productivity of their teams. “We are thrilled to build on this momentum, now as part of Nvidia. AI and accelerated computing are transforming the world at an unprecedented pace, and we believe this is just the beginning,” the Run:ai founders said. “GPUs and AI infrastructure will remain at the forefront of driving these transformative innovations and joining Nvidia provides us an extraordinary opportunity to carry forward a joint mission of helping humanity solve the world’s greatest challenges,” they added. While Nvidia has for long been making graphics chips that have become useful in running AI software, the company is also now emphasizing software. Nvidia controls about 80% market share of AI graphics processors. The Run:ai acquisition therefore now relates to giving their customers efficiency and flexibility for GPU orchestration software. The two companies have been collaborating since 2020 and have joint customers. Nvidia first announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). This delayed the conclusion of the transaction as it was under probe before it got approved earlier this month. When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources.

This Engineer Thinks So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/will-bitcoin-enter-its-most-massive-bull-cycle-this-engineer-thinks-so/,"Although Bitcoin is having a rough moment this week, with prices oscillating between $93k and $96k, at least one popular crypto commentator is predicting a massive price run soon. According to Ted Boydston, the market should prepare for a manic bull run in the coming days, with Bitcoin’s price targeting $225k. Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset? CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move Boydston highlights the price oscillator on M2, which offers real-time buy and sell signals for traders and investors. He then explained that the tool recently displayed a buy signal. And if history repeats itself, Boydston expects Bitcoin to begin its price surge, benefitting holders and investors. Bitcoin And Its M2 Price Oscillator Chart Boydston, a popular crypto commentator and engineer, offers a fascinating insight into Bitcoin’s recent price action. Although Bitcoin’s price has recently slipped, he sees a potential price surge soon. Except for the 2016 Bitcoin cycle, a price oscillator on M2 has provided well timed buy and sell signals.

Since the M2 money stock considers liquid cash circulation, including checking deposits, physical cash (M1), money markets, and savings, the chart provides an interesting perspective on an asset’s possible direction. As such, this technical chart and indicator offer helpful insights into the possible performance of assets, including those in the crypto niche. A Bitcoin Bull Run Soon?

Investors can expect increased volatility and Bitcoin price appreciation if this scenario plays out. Traders and investors have relied on this technical analysis for years, offering correct predictions, except in 2016. The chart didn’t flash the buy signal then, but the price went up after the Bitcoin halving event. Bitcoin’s Future Price Action Crypto analysts targeted the $100k mark for Bitcoin a few months ago. Now that this was already achieved in December, many analysts are setting their sights on new targets. Some analysts claim that Bitcoin’s short-term target is $150k, while others speculate that the asset could hit $1 million.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 23:08:00

The debate gained momentum following public statements from Rick McCracken, a prominent figure in the Cardano community, who raised issues about leadership and organizational transparency. This has sparked widespread discussions about community oversight and the future of Cardano’s ecosystem governance. Charles Hoskinson Addresses Cardano Foundation Oversight Charles Hoskinson has been keen to assert the Cardano Foundation ’s commitment to the principle of decentralisation and, in particular, the need for community supervision over the foundation. He pointed out that the Foundation is not affiliated with IOHK (Input Output Global) or Emurgo, the other two main stakeholders in the ecosystem. Hoskinson said, “This isn’t a Charles versus CF debate… This is a discussion on the issue of whether the community foundation should be answerable to the community. He noted, however that the Cardano Foundation’s $600 million ADA treasury has no direct representation of the community regarding its utilization. In his view, the Foundation’s lack of enthusiasm in supporting grants and funding for projects like Catalyst can hinder the growth of the ecosystem. Charles Hoskinson also pointed out that this approach may lead to future problems in the ecosystem sustainability, especially in the case when major contributors like IOHK are expected to work without proper motivation. Rick McCracken’s Concerns About Transparency and Leadership Rick McCracken, a Cardano supporter, raised some questions about the transparency of IOHK, which he said is evident by the negative reviews published on Glassdoor. McCracken raised issues over decision making within leadership and the overall direction of the ecosystem, and advocated for change in governance. Charles Hoskinson’s reply to McCracken’s statement was that the comments made were quite “distasteful” and “disappointing”. He pointed to the fact that IOHK has had some issues, such as the need to cut down on its workforce during bear markets, but has always remained focused on the ecosystem. Hoskinson apologized for McCracken’s words and said, “I’m sorry that your ego got hurt, Rick; you are not doing any good to the community with your actions.” CIP-1694 and Cardano Constitution Updates Charles Hoskinson has recently provided updates on Cardano’s governance initiatives. He highlighted the progress made since the launch of the governance workstream during the Age of Voltaire conference in late 2022. This initiative has resulted in CIP-1694, which outlines processes for decentralized governance, and a draft Cardano Constitution. The governance proposal aims to bring an end to the technical bootstrapping phase of Cardano’s on-chain governance. If enacted, it will establish a framework for decentralized decision-making, allowing the community to have a greater role in governance. Charles Hoskinson reiterated that the governance process has involved extensive community discussions over the past two years As governance discussions continue, ADA price has experienced fluctuations amid broader market trends. Over the past two weeks, ADA price has dropped significantly from $1.3264 to lows of $0.7620. However, some analysts believe the decline may have reached a bottom. Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Consulting, has suggested that ADA price could bounce back from the $0.7460 support level. He noted that the token’s performance in 2024 suggests potential for further growth, with possible resistance near $1.2430. At press time, Cardano price was trading at $0.854, a 0.11% decline from the intra-day high of $0.8962. Despite this, Van de Poppe expressed optimism about ADA’s long-term growth potential, citing its recent 300% rise from November lows as part of a broader bull market cycle.

Per El Pais , “digital” alternatives are now displacing the “gray dollar” for Venezuelan citizens. Venezuelans Still Keen on Crypto The report’s author noted that while the “crypto accepted here” signs that were “once prominent in shops, hotels, and restaurants in Venezuela” have long disappeared, “this does not mean that Venezuela’s crypto economy is not flourishing.” The media outlet wrote that Venezuelans are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and other coins to make easy transactions, receive remittances, and “take refuge from the devaluation of the [fiat] bolivar.” The newspaper added that while crypto exchanges are “not illegal” in the country, they are also “unregulated.” The Government of Nicolás Maduro reportedly “tolerates” unregulated crypto exchange “because it has become a way to bring foreign currency into the country.” The Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro with the late US President Jimmy Carter. (Source: Nicolás Maduro/Facebook) Maduro claimed victory in elections earlier this year. However, the United States has claimed that the elections were marred by “electoral fraud.” As a result, the newspaper explained, Maduro’s inauguration on January 10, 2025, has become “a date that is generating political and financial tension.” Maduro once pursued an aggressively pro-crypto policy, and even spearheaded the launch of a state-operated cryptoasset, the Petro (PTR). Reuters: Venezuela Opposition Adviser Holed Up in Argentine Residence Calls It 'Prison' https://t.co/j2EeDllp2h — nuprizm (@nuprizm) December 29, 2024 Mass Arrests However, this policy fell victim to widespread corruption, and led to mass arrests and the PTR’s eventual shutdown. But Maduro has recently spoken of “returning” to the crypto “path.” And the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis noted that “in the second quarter of 2024,” the Venezuelan Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) , and USDT markets grew by “an impressive 110% compared to the same period last year.” Chainalysis claims this rate is “higher than in any country in the [LATAM] region.” UN orders Venezuela not to destroy election vote tallies https://t.co/aE3KPPNJ0L — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) December 4, 2024 $20 Billion Inflow The media outlet explained that in 2024, an “estimated volume of $20 billion” has “entered the Venezuelan ecosystem” through crypto markets. This represents a sizeable chunk of the nation’s estimated $100 billion 2024 Gross Domestic Product. Despite its well-documented financial woes, Venezuela has battled against hyperinflation with some success. But the economy remains highly dependent on oil exports, and the specter of inflation refuses to vanish entirely. Inflation rose by around 4% in October, shooting up from under 1% in September. Some estimate that November ushered in a steeper rise yet. Venezuela's monthly inflation rate returned to double digits in November: 12.5%, a figure that had not been recorded since the beginning of 2023, according to the Venezuelan Financial Observatory (OVF). pic.twitter.com/l3rNCbxZPj — BowTiedMara (@BowTiedMara) December 6, 2024 And this, like elsewhere in LATAM, has driven many citizens to the stablecoins markets. Chainalysis claimed that between July 2023 and July 2024, 47% of crypto transactions worth under $10,000 involved stablecoins. “Stablecoins have become popular because they are pegged to more stable fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. They offer a hedge against the volatility of the Venezuelan bolivar. They play a crucial role in daily transactions and remittances.” Dan Cartolin, Enterprise Account Executive, Chainalysis. Guyana’s economy is the fastest-growing in the world, driven by a booming oil sector. But Venezuela is laying claim to its neighbor’s oil-rich region and the threat of a “resource curse” looms large.

The newspaper quoted a Venezuelan citizen named Vanesa as explaining that she provides crypto exchange services to her countrypeople using platforms like Binance. However, Vanesa lamented that the crackdown on crypto exchanges and the government’s own crypto operations have left people like her in limbo. The newspaper quoted an unnamed Latin American crypto exchange as stating that it had tried to apply for a virtual asset service provider license in Venezuela. But this platform said that it had given up because it was “impossible to deal with sudden changes” in the regulatory guidelines. In the wake of the crackdown, crypto-related “posters” have been “taken down” everywhere. Operations involving crypto are “becoming more discreet,” Vanesa added, concluding: “Everything is in the grey zone here. It is impossible to know if I am laundering someone’s money [when I am exchanging crypto for clients].” The post Venezuelans Ditching the Dollar in Favor of Crypto – Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Adoption|Venezuela,EN,0,0,BTC|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-30 23:30:00

According to market data, the MSTR stock is down by 2.46% in After Hours trading after closing Monday’s session at 8.19% to $302.96. This stock price turnout has driven many debate on the cause despite the alleged correlation it maintains with the US Dollar. MicroStrategy Stock and the Bitcoin Levered Play Global industry commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter provided insights into what is happening with MicroStrategy and Bitcoin. Kobeissi noted that the decoupling in MicroStrategy stock and Bitcoin started about a month ago. Within that time, Bitcoin price has inked a mild 2% growth with MSTR down by more than 20%. While MicroStrategy is considered a levered Bitcoin play, the stock price’s divergence is to much. The Kobeissi Letter pointed out the firm’s business model which is to take on debt to buy more BTC. At the moment, the business intelligence firm has maxed out its debt funding sources including its shares. As reported by Coingape, MicroStrategy acquired 2,138 BTC on December 30, valued for $209 million. In order to keep making these purchases, it proposed raising its share count by 10 billion. This way, The Kobeissi Letter noted that MicroStrategy can continue borrowing against the stock to buy more Bitcoin. This will ultimately push BTC price higher and give its shares an allowance for growth. However, the current share slump hinges on how investors perceive the 10 billion share count proposal. If approved, it would dilute MSTR stock too much and if not, MicroStrategy will get stuck with its Bitcoin funding strategy. If the plan is approved, bears will say that this is a highly dilutive move for existing shareholders. However, if it is not approved, then MicroStrategy will be unable to continue buying #Bitcoin on leverage. Buying Bitcoin is obviously an integral part of $MSTR ‘s strategy. pic.twitter.com/D6qcb6fNoG — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 Despite this dilemma, The Kobeissi Letter hinted that Michael Saylor alone has a 46.8% voting power. With just 4% needed, chances are this stock count will gain the board’s approval. Here’s What The Future Holds Barring the funding challenges of the past week, MicroStrategy stock remains one of the best performing in the market this year. According to market data, MSTR is up 342% Year-to-Date (YTD) as compared to the S&P 500 Index that is up 24.54%. In the new year, MicroStrategy is poised to stabilize the best funding strategy to keep up with its treasury reserve agenda. Meanwhile, MSTR’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 might reboot the stock’s attractiveness overall. With Bitcoin also likely to rebound ahead of the pro-crypto Donald Trump inauguration, the stock’s big rebound is also possible. As MicroStrategy navigates its levered Bitcoin play, it is arguably setting a precedent for firms like Riot Platforms .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Exploring 5 altcoins with the potential to join the top 10 rankings. Table of Contents XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential Toncoin Shiba Inu Sui Hedera Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with some digital coins poised to make significant leaps. Several lesser-known cryptocurrencies are showing remarkable potential to climb the ranks. These altcoins are gaining momentum and could soon break into the top echelons of the market. XYZ: An altcoin with 7,400% growth potential XYZ is emerging as a serious contender for a top 10 position. This sports-driven, meme-powered project is breaking barriers, looking to combine the viral appeal of meme coins with the global fervor of sports betting. With its unique approach and massive growth potential, XYZ is gearing up to redefine the altcoin landscape. XYZ isn’t just another altcoin — it’s a project built to thrive at the intersection of two explosive trends: meme coins and sports. Picture the excitement of a billion-dollar sports betting market infused with the viral momentum of crypto memes. XYZVerse will create a unique ecosystem where sports enthusiasts and crypto degens unite, unlocking massive potential for growth and community engagement. Recognized among the best new meme projects, XYZ has proven it has what it takes to dominate this niche. The XYZ presale is where the action begins. With a projected 7,400% surge by the Token Generation Event (TGE), early adopters have a golden opportunity to secure their position before the token explodes. XYZ stands leagues ahead with a solid foundation: audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and plans for listings on major CEX and DEX platforms. With its unique value proposition and a rapidly growing community, XYZ is perfectly positioned to climb the ranks of the crypto market. The combination of transformative use cases, strong fundamentals, and an active user base makes this token a prime candidate for top-tier status. As XYZ continues to build momentum, it’s not just a hidden gem — it’s a shining star in the making. With its presale stages selling out at record speed, investors are looking to get in before XYZ cements its place among the top 10 altcoins. Interested investors can grab XYZ tokens and be part of the next crypto championship. Toncoin Toncoin is the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a decentralized and open-source blockchain. It was originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network with the ‘Gram’ token. However, Telegram discontinued the project in May 2020 due to regulatory issues. Since then, the non-commercial TON Foundation and community enthusiasts have taken over its development. Based on historical price movements, Toncoin’s price could reach as high as $30.30 by 2025. This represents a potential gain of 348.18% compared to today’s price. By 2030, it could hit up to $26.04, a potential gain of 285.24%. Toncoin’s ambitious goals and strong technology make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Its focus on speed, security, and low fees sets it apart from many other cryptocurrencies. With strong community support and ongoing development, Toncoin might become a significant player as the crypto market evolves. You might also like: XYZVerse prepares to dominate 2025 with a 25,000% surge, leaving SOL and AVAX behind Shiba Inu Shiba Inu was inspired by Dogecoin’s success but runs on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum opens doors to exciting possibilities. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, show its potential beyond being a simple meme token. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system where holders can have a say in development. In the current market cycle, where utility and real-world applications are gaining importance, SHIB’s approach sets it apart from other meme coins. Sui Sui is a blockchain platform designed for global use, offering security, power, and scalability. At its core, Sui uses a novel object-centric data model. This allows for efficient transaction processing. It also employs the Move programming language, known for its security features. Moreover, Sui focuses on user experience, aiming to remove common barriers in blockchain interactions with features like zkLogin and sponsored transactions. In a market where coins like Ethereum face high fees and slow speeds, Sui offers a promising alternative. Its technology could make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Hedera Instead of using a traditional blockchain, Hedera uses something called hashgraph. This makes transactions really fast, cheap, and good for the environment. There’s no mining involved, so it uses less energy. HBAR is used to pay for transactions and to keep the network secure through Proof of Stake. Hedera’s technology promises quicker and more secure transactions than many other coins. Its low fees and high speed make it attractive for businesses, especially in finance. While some worry that its patented technology might limit community involvement compared to open-source projects like Ethereum, big companies are backing Hedera. As the crypto world looks for more efficient and eco-friendly options, HBAR could stand out as a promising choice for the future. Conclusion Though TON, SHIB, SUI, and HBAR are promising in the 2024 bull run, XYZ is the first all-sport meme coin, aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans globally.

The Gold Ticket from BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a standout option, delivering not only the best chances to win $1M USDT but also significant BDAG coin rewards, attracting both experienced participants and newcomers. While promising projects like Aave and Aptos navigate their own obstacles—Aave with market downturns, and Aptos trying to keep up its growth—BlockDAG’s approach of blending real incentives with a solid presale offers a richer value proposition to those taking part. BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket: Your Top Shot at $1M USDT BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket shines as the top pick in the $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, presenting the best chance to win the grand prize of $1 million. At a cost of 500 USDT, it brings incredible worth by including a 200% BDAG coin bonus with every purchase.

In conclusion, within BlockDAG’s New Year campaign, the Gold Ticket stands out as the most advantageous option. It is designed for those who appreciate both the opportunity and strategic planning, making it the optimal choice for entering the new year poised for success and the best possible outcome. Aave Faces Steep Price Drop Amid Market Sell-Off Aave, a top decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, is undergoing a significant price correction as market participants cash in on recent rises. Following a sustained increase, Aave’s price is now experiencing heavy pressure, with indications of a looming sharp decline. This pattern is typical in the crypto market, where swift price increases often lead to large-scale sales, increasing market unpredictability. This downturn mirrors broader difficulties across the DeFi landscape, underscoring the importance of prudent trading practices. Analysis of Aave’s technical indicators also points to potential additional losses, with vital support levels endangered. However, such downturns may provide entry opportunities for those wishing to join the market more affordably. Aptos Eyes $19 as TVL Reaches $1.29 Billion Aptos is gaining traction as its Total Value Locked (TVL) reaches $1.29 billion, indicating strong growth in its ecosystem and user base. This increase reflects the platform’s rising role in the decentralized finance sector, bolstered by new user acquisition and strategic alliances. Aptos’ blockchain, celebrated for its scalability and efficiency, enhances confidence, suggesting a bullish outlook. With the price of APT nearing $19, market sentiment is bullish, fueled by broader adoption and solid platform fundamentals. Market analysts note the increasing DeFi activities on Aptos and its technological improvements as significant factors in its positioning as a prominent crypto player. As Aptos progresses on its developmental goals and enriches its ecosystem, it remains a key project to consider for sustained growth potential. The Bottom Line In today’s fluctuating market, BlockDAG’s Gold Ticket presents an appealing mix of strategic benefits and concrete incentives. As Aave navigates price volatility and Aptos advances its ecosystem, BlockDAG stands out by syncing market dynamics with user rewards. The Gold Ticket offers enhanced chances of winning and BDAG coin bonuses, providing a realistic option for both seasoned participants and newcomers. Focusing on substantial rewards and a solid structure, BlockDAG offers a focused and beneficial route for those seeking immediate and enduring value in the cryptocurrency market.

Solana Memecoins: Fading Hype Amid Market Challenges Solana memecoins have captured the imagination of the crypto world with their vibrant communities and potential for exponential gains. These tokens, born from humor and culture, have carved out a unique niche, attracting traders eager to ride the waves of virality.

While cryptos like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have made waves globally, newer tokens are looking to make their mark. One coin in particular, BTFD Coin, is drawing a lot of attention in th e meme coin community . This post is going to dive into some of the biggest best meme coin presales to Invest in December 2024 you should be keeping an eye on this December. We’ll compare BTFD Coin with two other meme coins: Pepe Coin and Just a Chill Guy. So, buckle up, because you might just find your next big investment. Meme coins have been a major part of the crypto landscape for years, but they’ve gained an even stronger following recently. Some investors are jumping into meme coins simply for the fun of it, while others see a serious opportunity for returns. But here’s the thing: you have to know which ones to invest in. BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin—it’s a token that combines community power, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , staking rewards, and an intriguing referral program. Plus, it’s already making waves in its presale stages. The rise of meme coins over the past few years has been nothing short of spectacular, but BTFD Coin is positioning itself to take things to the next level. With its already massive presale success, BTFD has become one of the most talked-about coins in the meme sector. Let’s dive deeper into BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin, and Just a Chill Guy and see how they compare. BTFD Coin: A Strong Contender in the Meme Coin Space When you think about meme coins, you might envision a quick surge in price followed by a crash. But BTFD Coin is different. This token has shown incredible growth, and analysts are already predicting it could outperform many other meme coins in the long run. The presale is now in its 13th phase, with the token priced at $0.000142. So far, it has raised $4.6 million, surpassing milestones of $1 million in the first 10 days and $2.5 million within 14 days. The project proudly counts over 7,000 holders, with 60 billion coins sold already. But what makes BTFD stand out? It’s the combination of community support, rewarding mechanisms, and its unique presale structure. The coin offers a referral program, staking rewards, and a P2E game that’s likely to bring in new users and maintain investor interest in the long term. It’s not just about memes; it’s about building a loyal, engaged community. Now, let’s talk about the economics behind this surge. Back in 1973, the global economy faced a catastrophic collapse, sparking a series of recessions worldwide. Investors who managed to buy during the chaos made massive profits when the economy rebounded. Today, the crypto market is a similar beast. With the presale stages advancing, this is the perfect time to get in before BTFD Coin hits the market. A lot of investors have been comparing this moment to the opportunity of buying during a market crash—buying the dip when prices are still low to maximise future returns. With the BIG50 bonus code available during the presale, investors can get 50% more coins, making this an even more enticing opportunity. The BIG50 bonus adds extra value! Use code BIG50 to receive 50% more tokens on every purchase. For instance, buy 100 coins, and you’ll get 150. Take advantage of this opportunity to invest in $BTFD today. Pepe Coin: A Familiar Meme Coin with a Loyal Following Pepe Coin has built a reputation as one of the most recognizable meme coins in the market. Drawing inspiration from the infamous Pepe the Frog meme, it quickly became a fan favourite in the crypto space. The meme coin has garnered a solid community of supporters and investors who believe in the potential for long-term gains. Unlike BTFD Coin, Pepe Coin’s presale has not seen the same astronomical numbers. However, it’s still holding strong, with a clear focus on maintaining a vibrant online community. Pepe Coin’s value is often driven by its meme status and viral marketing campaigns, so it tends to experience short bursts of growth followed by corrections. While Pepe Coin has its advantages in terms of visibility and community engagement, it lacks some of the innovative elements that BTFD Coin brings to the table. For example, while Pepe Coin might offer community-based rewards, it doesn’t offer the same staking options or referral programs that are built into BTFD Coin’s ecosystem. Moreover, like any meme coin, Pepe Coin’s price volatility makes it a risky investment. However, the community is loyal, and if the token continues to gain popularity, there’s a chance that it could see more significant growth in the future. But for those looking for a coin with more stability and a proven presale success, BTFD Coin might be the better option. Just a Chill Guy: A New Player with Potential Just a Chill Guy is the new kid on the block, offering a unique take on the meme coin space. With a catchy name and an easy-going vibe, it’s certainly got the attention of investors looking for something fresh. But, much like Pepe Coin, Just a Chill Guy’s presale has yet to match the explosive growth of BTFD Coin. The coin’s community is growing steadily, and its developers are focused on creating a relaxed, welcoming environment for investors. The concept is cool—who doesn’t want to invest in something called “Just a Chill Guy?” But while it’s an interesting project, it’s still in the early stages compared to BTFD Coin. Where Just a Chill Guy stands out is its laid-back marketing approach. Instead of focusing heavily on hype, it’s building a community based on inclusivity and fun. However, when it comes to features like staking, P2E games, and referral programs, Just a Chill Guy is still playing catch-up. For those who like the idea of meme coins with a lighthearted theme, Just a Chill Guy might be a good option. But if you’re looking for a meme coin with serious presale potential and rewards, BTFD Coin should be your go-to.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-31 00:23:00

Dogecoin Has Been Trading Inside A Long-Term Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez discussed a long-term pattern in which the weekly price of Dogecoin has been trading inside. The pattern in question is the Ascending Parallel Channel from technical analysis. A Parallel Channel refers to a consolidation pattern that forms when the price of an asset moves inside two parallel trendlines. The upper line is made by joining together successive tops, while the lower one connects bottoms. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Observing Bullish Signals On These Indicators While the asset is inside the channel, it’s likely to face resistance at the top line and support at the bottom one. A break out of either of these levels could imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. There are three types of Parallel Channels: those parallel to the time axis, those with a positive slope, and those with a negative slope. The first type doesn’t have a specific name, but the latter two do; they are known as the Ascending and Descending Parallel Channels, respectively. Given how these two types have slopped trendlines, they correspond to phases of consolidation in the asset occurring to the upside or downside. Dogecoin has appeared to have been traveling inside one such pattern over the past decade, as the chart shared by the analyst shows. From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-week price of Dogecoin has been stuck inside this Ascending Parallel Channel throughout its history. The most recent retest occurred just earlier in the year when DOGE found a rebound off the bottom line. As Martinez has highlighted in the chart, DOGE’s current trajectory is reminiscent of the trend witnessed during the last two bull cycles. In each of those bull runs, the cryptocurrency saw an initial upward burst followed by a small decline that led to the bull rally proper. Over the last few weeks, Dogecoin has been going down, perhaps indicating that it’s in that stepping-stone decline phase right now. Going by what happened next in the past cycles, it’s possible the meme coin would soon start a rally that would find its top at the upper level of the Ascending Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals Based on how far away the channel’s upper level currently is, the analyst has noted that it would take Dogecoin a rally of 6,770% to reach there. It now remains to be seen if the Ascending Channel would continue to hold for the meme coin and if anything similar as in history would take place this time around as well.

Table of Contents Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Dogwifhat: The next big meme coin Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Conclusion The development of the cryptocurrency marketplace carries on as new opportunities for significant growth appear. While there is a lot of talk about Bitcoin’s potential to hit $150,000, investors’ attention is now shifting to emerging tokens likely to give returns as high as 10,000% in a shorter time. Among these tokens, Rexas Finance (RXS) , Dogwifhat (WIF), and Hedera (HBAR) stand out. Rexas Finance: Setting the trend of asset tokenization Rexas Finance seeks to shift the blockchain paradigm through transformative tokenization methods, bridging physical assets to the digital ecosystem. Starting at $0.03 when RXS began its presales, it now stands at $0.175 in stage 11. $33 million has been raised, with 381 million tokens sold so far, indicating high market confidence and investor interest. The Rexas ecosystem is about transformation, with tools such as the Rexas Token Builder, which will allow users to create tokens without programming knowledge. The QuickMint Bot will enable the community to build tokens on platforms like Telegram and Discord, allowing a broader audience and adoption. Rexas Finance’s listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko has significantly increased its visibility and credibility. With an ongoing $1 million giveaway to attract a community and reward early adopters, RXS is set for significant growth. Its unique ecosystem and positioned approach make it a strong contender for the top crypto positions.

Currently, WIF is trading at $1.80 and has a market capitalization of $1.79 billion. Dogwifhat stands out through its roadmap, which includes plans for developing utility-driven applications and staking features. These aspects will provide an avenue for real value creation for meme coin holders while maintaining the essence of memes. Its community-oriented approach may help sustain demand and foster further adoption. Price forecasts for WIF suggest potential volatility. Analysts say the token can hit $15 within two years as it matures and its ecosystem thrives. This prediction aligns with its community growth and roadmap. Hedera: Reshaping the efficiency of blockchains Hedera has captured a significant market share through its cutting-edge Hashgraph consensus technique, offering high speed, security, and scalability. Currently valued at $0.2655 with a market cap of around $10.15 billion, HBAR has gained a significant position as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution provider. Hedera’s credibility, potential for global adoption, and recognition as one of the most powerful platforms are further enhanced by alliances with Google, IBM, and Boeing. Such partnerships will most likely circumvent the limitation of a lack of leverage in using Hedera’s platform in supply chain management, finance, and healthcare. There is optimism regarding the price of HBAR, with some analysts believing that by the year 2025, its value could rise to between $3 and $5. Such growth is anticipated as enterprises adopt Hedera and it continues to develop. Conclusion As Bitcoin continues its climb toward the $150,000 milestone, tokens such as RXS, WIF, and HBAR show relatively high potential for returns in shorter timeframes. In asset tokenization, Rexas Finance stands out with the development of new tools and its successful presale. Dogwifhat, as a memecoin with application utility, offers early investors a chance for significant returns. Coupled with enterprise solutions and industry partnerships, Hedera presents a compelling case for growth in the long term. RXS, WIF, and HBAR are all poised to generate massive gains before Bitcoin sets another record, with each having unique systems and robust market momentum.
