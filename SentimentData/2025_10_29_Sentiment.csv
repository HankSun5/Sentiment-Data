He is threatening to file an explosive defamation lawsuit against U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren . This potential Changpeng Zhao lawsuit stems from what Zhao describes as false claims about him seeking a pardon from U.S. authorities. What Sparked This Potential Changpeng Zhao Lawsuit? The controversy began when Senator Warren, a well-known critic of the cryptocurrency industry, made specific allegations. She referred to Zhao on X (formerly Twitter) as a ‘convicted felon seeking a pardon.’ Warren also suggested potential ties between Zhao and the Trump family’s cryptocurrency ventures. These remarks, reported by Watcher.Guru, quickly escalated the ongoing tension between crypto figures and their political detractors. Zhao’s legal team is taking these accusations very seriously. They view the senator’s statements as baseless and damaging to his reputation. The core of their argument is that these claims are factually incorrect and constitute defamation, which could lead to significant legal action. Senator Warren’s Claims: Referred to Zhao as a ‘convicted felon seeking a pardon.’ Additional Allegation: Suggested potential links to the Trump family’s crypto ventures. Zhao’s Stance: Vehemently denies these claims, calling them false and defamatory. Why Is Changpeng Zhao Taking Such a Firm Stance? For Changpeng Zhao , this isn’t just about political rhetoric; it’s about protecting his personal and professional integrity. He recently pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws and stepped down as CEO of Binance, agreeing to pay a substantial fine as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice . However, he has consistently maintained his innocence regarding many of the broader accusations leveled against him and Binance. The idea of seeking a pardon implies an admission of guilt for certain actions, which Zhao seems unwilling to concede. A defamation lawsuit would serve as a powerful public rebuttal, aiming to clear his name and challenge the narrative presented by Senator Warren. This move highlights the high stakes involved for individuals at the forefront of the crypto industry, who often face intense scrutiny and criticism from political figures. What Are the Broader Implications of This Legal Battle? A potential Changpeng Zhao lawsuit against a sitting U.S. Senator carries significant weight. It could set a precedent for how public figures in the crypto space respond to criticism from lawmakers. This situation underscores the ongoing struggle between innovation in the digital asset sector and the regulatory concerns of traditional political systems. Moreover, this legal confrontation brings the spotlight back to the broader debate around cryptocurrency regulation. Senator Warren is a prominent voice advocating for stricter controls on digital assets, often citing concerns about illicit finance and consumer protection. Zhao’s response, however, signals a growing willingness among crypto leaders to challenge what they perceive as misinformed or overly aggressive attacks. The outcome of this threatened legal action could influence: Future Political Discourse: Lawmakers might become more cautious about their public statements regarding crypto figures. Crypto Industry Response: Other industry leaders might be emboldened to challenge perceived defamation. Regulatory Landscape: It could intensify the debate over how cryptocurrencies should be regulated and perceived by the mainstream. As the situation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely. This potential Changpeng Zhao lawsuit is more than just a personal dispute; it’s a reflection of the intense pressures and evolving dynamics between the digital asset world and established political powers. This development serves as a powerful reminder of the complex legal and reputational challenges faced by prominent figures in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency industry. The confrontation between Changpeng Zhao and Senator Elizabeth Warren is far from over, and its resolution could have lasting impacts on both crypto and political discourse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Changpeng Zhao ? A1: Changpeng Zhao , often known as CZ, is the founder and former CEO of Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

He denies seeking a pardon and believes her claims constitute defamation, which is a false statement that harms a person’s reputation. Q4: What are the potential outcomes of this situation?

It highlights the ongoing tensions between crypto leaders and political figures regarding regulation and public perception. Q5: How does this relate to Zhao’s previous legal issues?

53756829,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87861,1761694248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO David Schwartz Drops Bombshell On Escrow XRP,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-david-schwartz-drops-bombshell-on-escrow-xrp/,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has clarified that the company has the legal ability to sell or transfer the rights to receive XRP currently locked in its escrow accounts. His comments came in response to a community debate about how circulating supply is calculated for different cryptocurrencies. The discussion began after software engineer Vincent Van Code questioned why major crypto-tracking platforms, such as CoinMarketCap, exclude Ripple’s escrowed XRP from circulation figures while counting all Bitcoin, including those believed to be in Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant wallets. Van Code argued that this approach creates a double standard. He noted that if CoinMarketCap excluded the one million BTC presumed to belong to Satoshi, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization would decrease by roughly 15%. In contrast, XRP’s market cap is based on about 60 billion tokens in circulation rather than the total 65 billion, which currently values the asset at $157 billion with a price of $2.62 per token instead of $170 billion. Ripple could sell the right to receive the tokens released from escrow or even sell the accounts the escrows complete into. But the XRP still can't circulate until their release dates. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 27, 2025 Another participant responded that Bitcoin’s figures include all mined coins because, theoretically, they can be sold at any time. This raised the question of whether Ripple’s escrowed XRP could be treated the same way and if Ripple could liquidate those holdings before their scheduled release dates. Schwartz Confirms Ripple’s Legal Flexibility Addressing the issue, Schwartz confirmed that Ripple can sell or assign the rights to receive XRP that is currently locked in escrow. He clarified, however, that the XRP tokens themselves cannot be accessed or enter circulation until the monthly release schedule allows it. According to Schwartz, Ripple could sell the accounts linked to future escrow releases or the contractual rights to those tokens, but such transactions would not immediately affect XRP’s circulating supply. His explanation provided rare insight into how Ripple can legally structure agreements involving its escrowed holdings. Implications for Market Transparency Public records from XRPScan show that Ripple controls approximately 35 billion XRP in escrow, valued at around $92 billion. The existence of these holdings has long sparked debate within the XRP community about Ripple’s influence over market supply and future liquidity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz’s statement has reignited discussions about potential institutional involvement. Some community analysts have speculated that Ripple may already have agreements in place to sell or allocate rights to parts of its escrow, particularly to major financial institutions. Others have suggested that these rights could even be used to back future partnerships or reserves involving government or private entities. Ongoing Speculation Around Ripple’s Strategy These comments follow reports about Evernorth’s plan to acquire $1 billion worth of XRP to establish an XRP reserve. Ripple expressed support for the initiative but did not specify whether the escrow holdings would be used for it. Market watcher Nietzbux suggested this might be because Ripple has already sold portions of its escrow rights to institutional buyers, although the company has made no public confirmation of such deals. Schwartz’s clarification ultimately reinforces that while Ripple cannot bypass its escrow mechanism, it retains considerable flexibility in managing the financial rights tied to those future token releases. This nuance could have important implications for how market participants interpret XRP’s supply metrics and Ripple’s long-term financial strategy.

Each brings unique momentum and fresh community power, but MoonBull’s blazing Stage 5 presale is catching the most significant buzz. With over $500K raised, more than 1,600 holders, and a planned ROI surpassing 9,256%, investors are calling this the next bull in the meme ring. Crypto traders and blockchain dreamers who missed the early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu hype are turning their heads toward the MoonBull presale. Stage 5 offers a first-come, first-served chance to secure $MOBU at $0.00006584, and when prices rise through 23 stages, those holding early could see life-changing returns. For anyone watching the next bull charge, MoonBull looks like the best meme coin to buy under $1 this cycle. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Best Meme Coin To Buy Under $1 Investors Can’t Ignore MoonBull has quickly become the talk of Telegram and X feeds as its $MOBU presale gallops through Stage 5. This isn’t another hype-driven token; it’s a structured ecosystem blending meme culture with real tokenomics. Backed by liquidity injections, reflections, and burns, every trade strengthens the token’s foundation. For example, selling $MOBU triggers 2% to liquidity, 2% to holders, and 1% burned forever – that’s real scarcity baked in. No wonder MoonBull’s energy has traders calling it the best meme coin to buy under $1 this year. Now, imagine dropping $50,000 into the Stage 5 presale. By the final listing price of $0.00616, that investment could potentially balloon to over $4.6 million, showing just how powerful early entry can be. This is what crypto FOMO feels like – a shot at financial freedom built on tokenomics that actually make sense. Deployed on Ethereum: Security, Liquidity, and Scale Built on Ethereum’s rock-solid framework, MoonBull uses audited smart contracts, automated rewards, and seamless DEX integration. Ethereum’s network ensures strong liquidity, transparent governance, and deep DeFi compatibility. $MOBU holders can stake with up to 95% APY once Stage 10 launches, and the governance phase at Stage 12 will let every token holder vote on key decisions. The security, scalability, and liquidity of Ethereum give MoonBull the upper hand, reinforcing its status as the best meme coin to buy under $1 for anyone hunting long-term utility mixed with viral energy. SPX6900 ($SPX) Surge: Retail Bulls Drive 13% Rally Toward $1.30 SPX6900 just pulled off a classic bull charge. After rebounding from $0.80, it roared past $1.16, locking in a 13% gain in a single day. Retail traders stormed back in, boosting Buy Volume to 3 million, while derivatives volume exploded 124% to over $146 million. That kind of inflow is no joke – it shows traders believe SPX still has gas left in the tank. But not all’s smooth sailing. Whales started cashing out near $1.18, sending Netflow to $257K, a signal of short-term pressure. Even so, sentiment stays bullish as open interest rises and the Long/Short Ratio hits 1.0008, meaning traders expect upside continuation. If momentum holds, $1.30 is the next major resistance level. Those looking for the best meme coin to buy under $1 are comparing SPX6900’s current performance to MoonBull’s entry-level presale firestorm, but SPX’s room for explosive growth is tightening as whales test profit zones. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) Takes Flight: Whale Accumulation and Breakout Setup Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) just reclaimed the spotlight with a technical setup that screams “breakout.” On-chain data shows 2.16 million PENGU flowing into whale wallets, sparking speculation of a fresh bull phase. Prices recently cleared resistance around $0.038, confirming a cup-and-handle pattern – a classic bullish sign. Momentum keeps building as the chart points toward potential targets near $0.06 to $0.07, and with smart money flowing in, the penguins are waddling straight toward market confidence. The current price of $0.02139 with over $111 million in daily volume underscores real trading strength, not just hype. Compared with the best meme coin to buy under $1, MoonBull, Pudgy Penguins shows strong potential but may face tougher scaling without Ethereum’s advanced mechanics and presale momentum. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, both SPX6900 and Pudgy Penguins have captured investor attention through whale activity, retail momentum, and bullish technical setups. SPX6900’s surge from $0.80 to $1.16 and PENGU’s on-chain accumulation paint a strong short-term picture. However, neither project matches MoonBull’s combination of structured presale mechanics, Ethereum deployment, and sky-high ROI potential, securing its place as the best meme coin to buy under $1 for early 2025. MoonBull’s presale isn’t just a chance – it’s a movement. With Stage 5 live, over $500K already raised, and staking rewards nearing launch, this is the project setting the next crypto narrative. The MoonBull presale offers the lowest price window before listing, and missing it could mean watching another meme legend moon without you. Jump into the $MOBU presale while the gate’s open and ride the bull before it takes off for good. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official MOBU Website Telegram: Join the MOBU Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow MOBU ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for Best Meme Coin To Buy Under $1 Which meme coin will reach $1? Analysts expect coins with strong communities and real tokenomics to have the best chance. MoonBull ($MOBU) shows solid fundamentals, while SPX6900 and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) could also test that level if the current bullish cycle continues. Which coin is best to invest in under $1? Right now, MoonBull tops the list. Its presale model, Ethereum deployment, and growing investor base make it one of the most promising crypto projects under a dollar. Which meme coin is best to invest in? MoonBull ($MOBU) is currently leading the charge thanks to its deflationary mechanics, staking rewards, and early-stage pricing. SPX6900 and PENGU offer volatility and short-term plays, but MoonBull shows better long-term potential. Will Pepe ever hit $1? Reaching $1 would require an enormous market cap expansion for Pepe, which makes it unlikely in the near term. Newer tokens like MoonBull have smaller supplies and structured growth paths, giving them a more realistic shot at massive ROI. Do meme coins have a future? Definitely, the meme market has evolved from pure hype to real innovation. Projects like MoonBull prove that meme coins can combine humor, community, and solid tokenomics for sustainable growth. Glossary of Key Terms Presale: Early sale of tokens before public listing. Staking: Locking tokens to earn rewards. APY: Annual Percentage Yield, the return earned over a year. Referral Program: An Incentive system where participants earn bonuses by inviting others. Token Burn: Permanent removal of tokens from supply to create scarcity. Reflections: Rewards distributed to token holders from transaction fees. Governance: A System allowing token holders to vote on project decisions. Article Summary MoonBull, SPX6900, and Pudgy Penguins are leading the 2025 meme coin surge. While SPX6900 and PENGU gain traction through rallies and whale action, MoonBull’s presale delivers unmatched potential through Ethereum deployment, token burns, staking, and governance. With its Stage 5 presale open and ROI projections skyrocketing, MoonBull stands tall as the best meme coin to buy under $1, giving investors a second chance at a generational moonshot.

U.S. cryptocurrency firm Help has announced a significant step forward for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. They are gearing up to launch a groundbreaking crypto-backed loan service this December, offering a flexible way to leverage digital assets without selling them. What is This Revolutionary Crypto-Backed Loan Service? Imagine needing funds but not wanting to part with your valuable Bitcoin or Ethereum. Help’s upcoming service addresses this common dilemma. It allows users to obtain loans by using their existing digital assets as collateral. Initially, this innovative crypto-backed loan service will kick off as a pilot program in Florida. However, Help has ambitious plans for a rapid nationwide expansion across the United States, making these financial tools accessible to a broader audience. The service will support major cryptocurrencies, including XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , and USD Coin (USDC) . This broad selection provides users with diverse options for collateralizing their portfolios. How Does a Crypto-Backed Loan Service Work? At its core, a crypto-backed loan service functions much like a traditional secured loan. Instead of a house or car, your collateral is your digital currency. Users deposit their chosen crypto assets with Help, and in return, they receive a loan in traditional fiat currency or stablecoins. This mechanism offers a unique advantage: you retain ownership of your crypto assets. This means you can still benefit from potential price appreciation of your collateral while accessing immediate liquidity. Moreover, Help’s service is designed to allow users to generate yield on the collateral they’ve deposited, adding another layer of financial benefit. Collateralize Your Assets: Use XRP , ETH , BTC , or USDC to secure a loan. Access Instant Liquidity: Get the funds you need without selling your crypto. Retain Ownership: Keep your digital assets and benefit from market movements. Generate Yield: Potentially earn returns on your deposited collateral. Why Choose Help’s Empowering Crypto-Backed Loan Service? Help’s entry into the market with its crypto-backed loan service is particularly compelling for several reasons. For many crypto holders, the decision to sell assets for cash can be a difficult one, often triggering capital gains taxes or missing out on future growth. This service provides a powerful alternative. It empowers individuals to unlock the value of their digital holdings without liquidating them. This approach is especially appealing during volatile market conditions or when investors believe their assets have long-term growth potential. The dual benefit of raising funds and generating yield on collateral makes Help’s offering stand out. It transforms dormant digital assets into active financial instruments, working harder for the user. This innovative model, reported by Pinpoint News, underscores a growing trend towards more sophisticated financial products in the crypto space. Navigating the Future of Crypto Lending: What to Consider? While a crypto-backed loan service offers exciting opportunities, it’s crucial for users to understand the associated considerations. Market volatility is a primary factor. If the value of your collateral drops significantly, you might face a margin call, requiring additional collateral or partial repayment to maintain your loan-to-value ratio. Therefore, understanding the terms and conditions, including liquidation thresholds and interest rates, is paramount. Help , as a U.S. firm, will operate under specific regulatory frameworks, offering a degree of security and compliance that users should appreciate. Key Considerations for Borrowers: Market Volatility: Be aware of potential price fluctuations in your collateral. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios: Understand how much you can borrow against your assets. Interest Rates and Fees: Compare terms to ensure they align with your financial goals. Regulatory Compliance: Benefit from the oversight of a U.S.-regulated entity. This service represents a maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, bridging the gap between digital wealth and traditional financial needs. It’s an exciting development for anyone looking to optimize their crypto portfolio. In conclusion, Help’s upcoming launch of its crypto-backed loan service marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital finance. By enabling users to leverage their XRP , ETH , BTC , and USDC holdings for loans while simultaneously generating yield, the firm is providing a powerful and flexible financial tool. This service promises to unlock new opportunities for crypto investors, offering liquidity and growth potential without the need to sell valuable assets. As it expands beyond Florida, Help is set to redefine how individuals interact with their digital wealth across the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What cryptocurrencies can I use as collateral for Help’s crypto-backed loan service? A: Initially, Help ‘s service will accept XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , and USD Coin (USDC) as collateral for their crypto-backed loan service . This selection offers flexibility for a wide range of crypto holders. Q2: Where will Help’s crypto-backed loan service be available? A: The service will first launch as a pilot program in Florida in December. Following this initial phase, Help plans for a future nationwide expansion across the United States. Q3: Can I earn yield on my collateral with Help’s service? A: Yes, a unique feature of Help ‘s crypto-backed loan service is the ability for users to generate yield on the digital assets they have deposited as collateral. This adds an extra layer of financial benefit. Q4: What happens if the value of my collateral drops significantly? A: Like all secured loans, if the market value of your crypto collateral drops below a certain threshold (the loan-to-value ratio), you may receive a margin call. This would require you to deposit more collateral or repay a portion of your loan to maintain the agreed-upon ratio. It’s crucial to understand these terms before taking out a loan. Q5: Is Help a regulated firm? A: Help is described as a U.S. cryptocurrency firm. Operating in the United States implies adherence to relevant financial regulations, offering a level of compliance and security for users of their crypto-backed loan service .

53757718,615283,1761696014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53757718.jpeg,"Forget Gold’s Run To ATH, Analyst Reveals Why It’s Bitcoin’s Turn To Run Now",https://bitcoinist.com/why-its-bitcoins-turn-to-run-now/,"Gold’s price climbed to new all-time highs in mid-October, breaking above $4,000/oz for the first time in history, before eventually reaching a peak of $4,342/oz. The yellow metal’s rally came at a time when BTC was enduring a flash crash that pulled its price down to $101,000 very briefly. This contrast between gold’s strong rise and BTC’s pause has caught the attention of crypto commentator Sykodelic, who believes the pattern is about to flip . In his latest analysis, he suggests that gold may have already peaked while Bitcoin is preparing for its next major rally. Gold’s Blow-Off Top And The Cycle Inversion Sykodelic pointed to the nearly 18-month inverse correlation between gold and Bitcoin as the foundation of his argument. The analyst’s chart, which overlays both assets, shows a pattern of alternating expansions and corrections. Each time gold surged, BTC entered a cooling phase, and whenever gold stabilized or corrected, Bitcoin followed with a major upward leg. The most recent sequence places gold in what looks like a blow-off top structure. This blow-off top structure is a parabolic rally followed by exhaustion, confirmed by the precious metal’s current correction below its all-time high. This phase has always correlated with the point of transfer between the two assets. During periods when retail enthusiasm peaked in gold, Bitcoin’s price quietly consolidated at support zones. This timing, according to Sykodelic, is “almost down to the day.” The comparison chart below shows the synchronization. Gold’s breakout phases, shown in green channels, are followed by cooling phases highlighted in red, and Bitcoin’s chart below follows the same rhythm with a slight time delay. The structure implies that Bitcoin’s recent consolidation around the $110,000 to $115,000 range may be mirroring the early stages of gold’s last expansion phase in early September. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? From a technical perspective, this setup means that Bitcoin is now entering the same pattern gold just completed, with momentum building at the lower boundary of its new green channel highlighted in the chart image above. This implies that a breakout could lift Bitcoin well above its current all-time high, setting up what is another crypto rally similar to gold’s move earlier this month. “It’s Bitcoin’s turn to pump very hard,” Sykodelic said. The channel projection on his chart shows an advance that will see the BTC price breaking above $140,000 by the end of 2026 before the next capital rotation into gold. Of course, this all depends on how market news and events play out in favor of the crypto market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $114,196, up by 6% in the past seven days. Gold, on the other hand, is trading at $3,930, down by 9.5% in the same timeframe. This divergence might be the first sign that the capital rotation is already underway.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|gold|Sykodelic,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-29 00:00:14

Avalanche (AVAX) continues to lose ground amid declining ETF optimism, while Bittensor (TAO) consolidates in a tightening triangle pattern that could trigger a major move. Yet, the spotlight remains on BlockDAG , where the verified $430 million presale has sparked urgency among early buyers. With dual audits from CertiK and Halborn confirming the network’s transparency and robust architecture, trader confidence is surging. The $0.0015 price point stands as the golden opportunity before the listing jumps to $0.05, creating a decisive moment for participants. As the market favors audited, utility-driven networks, BlockDAG’s hybrid Layer-1 framework, verified ecosystem, and exchange readiness secure its position among the top crypto picks for 2025. AVAX Price Drop Tests Market Nerves Avalanche (AVAX) trades near $19.33, down 1.2% in the past 24 hours and 12.8% weekly as sentiment remains fragile. On-chain data shows $3.7 million in daily exchange outflows for four consecutive days, confirming weak conviction among short-term holders. The price remains below all major moving averages, 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, signalling a bearish structure. RSI at 42 reflects subdued momentum, while traders watch the $19.00 support zone closely. A breakdown could open targets near $17.80, whereas a rebound above $20.50 might indicate early recovery. Despite short-term weakness, Avalanche’s fundamentals remain sound. The Octane upgrade has cut transaction fees by 98%, driving efficiency across its DeFi ecosystem. Analysts note that while ETF optimism fades, Avalanche’s scalability and ecosystem depth continue to underpin long-term value once broader risk appetite returns. TAO Triangle Tightens Near Resistance Bittensor (TAO) trades around $376.53, posting a 7.6% weekly decline amid thinning volume and neutral funding. The 4-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle, indicating consolidation before a potential breakout. Resistance stands at $420–$430, while support lies near $370. A breakout above resistance could target $470, whereas a slip below support risks a fall toward $350. Open interest has dropped 5.9% to $216 million, showing reduced leverage exposure, while the funding rate near 0.0024% signals a balance between long and short positions. Momentum indicators, including early green Heikin Ashi candles, hint at tentative buying pressure. Institutional investors such as TAO Synergies continue accumulating, reflecting belief in Bittensor’s decentralized AI model. For traders, TAO’s structure suggests a classic pre-breakout phase, making it one of the top crypto opportunities to monitor in late 2025. BlockDAG’s Dual Audits Fuel $430M Presale Surge! BlockDAG has solidified its credibility through dual audits by CertiK and Halborn, making it one of the most thoroughly verified presales in the market. Both firms confirmed the project’s robust architecture, secure coding standards, and transparent governance, resolving the trust concerns that often shadow early-stage crypto projects. This verification has been instrumental in driving BlockDAG’s presale beyond $430 million, setting a new benchmark for transparency and execution. Currently priced at $0.0015 in Batch 31, BlockDAG’s verified presale represents the final chance to secure early entry before the $0.05 listing. With over 3.5 million X1 app miners and 20,000 hardware miners already active, the network’s operational ecosystem is expanding rapidly ahead of Genesis Day. BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG architecture achieves 2,000–15,000 TPS, ensuring scalability without compromising decentralization. Additionally, Dashboard V4 introduces a gamified trading experience with live analytics, order tracking, and leaderboard rankings, enhancing user engagement. Backed by confirmed listings on 20 exchanges and a global marketing push through the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team partnership, BlockDAG has redefined what a verified presale can achieve. For traders seeking a blend of trust, technology, and long-term potential, BlockDAG stands as one of the best crypto projects to buy in 2025. The Bottom Line Avalanche’s decline and Bittensor’s consolidation highlight the broader market’s cautious tone, yet BlockDAG continues to advance with verifiable progress. The $0.0015 presale price marks the last confirmed entry before the expected $0.05 listing, offering substantial upside potential for early participants. Backed by CertiK and Halborn audits, over 3.5 million miners, and expanding hardware deployment, BlockDAG combines transparency with delivery. As traders seek reliability amid market uncertainty, BlockDAG’s hybrid network and audited infrastructure provide a clear advantage. With Genesis Day approaching, it exemplifies how verified presales can restore confidence in crypto fundraising. For those eyeing the top crypto assets of 2025, BlockDAG’s mix of proof, performance, and participation makes it a standout in a market hungry for authenticity.

Drawing from multiple independent analyses, the host presented a detailed argument suggesting that XRP could reach as high as $15 in the long term. This analysis follows a rebound across the cryptocurrency market after the sharp correction on October 10. To support this outlook, the host referenced well-known analysts in the XRP community, including CryptoInsightUK, Vincent Van Code, and EGRAG Crypto. Each expert presented different data points and perspectives that collectively reinforced the argument for a sustained bullish trend. CryptoInsightUK Predicts Sustained Uptrend Analyst CryptoInsightUK addressed recent concerns about XRP’s performance and argued that the current price movement indicates a stable upward trajectory. He noted that XRP shows limited downside liquidity, suggesting that there are few opportunities for the asset to drop significantly in price. According to him, this dynamic could drive XRP upward as traders and market makers seek to capitalize on liquidity at higher levels. He further pointed out that despite the widespread sell-offs during the October 10 liquidation event , XRP’s structure on higher timeframes remains largely intact. I know a few people in the space are saying $XRP isn't looking amazing right now. However, I can discuss a few things for you this morning. First off, $XRP has literally no downside liquidity. Whilst this doesn't mean price can't fluctuate / be pushed around, it does mean that… pic.twitter.com/BXJLb9y2Gq — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 27, 2025 On the weekly chart, the token continues to maintain a higher low formation, and on the quarterly chart, it remains well above its previous major resistance level from 2018. This, he argued, reflects an ongoing uptrend rather than a reversal. Additionally, CryptoInsightUK referred to a technical pattern based on the relative strength index (RSI). The last time XRP’s daily RSI hit oversold territory, the token experienced a sharp rally. Applying the same setup today, he projected that XRP could potentially climb toward the $15 region if the pattern repeats under similar market conditions. At the time of the Working Money broadcast, XRP was trading in the $2.62 to $2.63 range, having briefly reached $2.675 earlier in the day. The host observed that the general sentiment in the crypto market is improving. The Fear and Greed Index has risen to the neutral zone, while the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands around $3.89 trillion, nearing the $4 trillion mark. This recovery, combined with growing momentum among altcoins, suggests renewed investor confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Van Code Highlights XRP Liquidity Shortage Software engineer Vincent Van Code was also cited in the discussion for his recent remarks about XRP’s limited availability on exchanges. According to his findings, Binance currently holds only around 4 million XRP in its order books. He explained that such thin liquidity could cause significant price movement if large buyers attempt to acquire millions of tokens at once. Van Code warned that a purchase of 10 million XRP at current prices could quickly push the token’s price upward due to limited supply. He also noted that institutional interest, such as Evernorth’s plan to acquire $1 billion worth of XRP, could further intensify this effect. Moreover, he mentioned that over-the-counter (OTC) and wholesale markets, typically used by institutions to avoid price fluctuations, are seeing reduced availability as many long-term holders refuse to sell. EGRAG Crypto Confirms Strong Market Structure The discussion concluded with insights from EGRAG Crypto , which has consistently argued against bearish projections. He maintained that XRP’s market structure remains solid as long as it closes above $2.20 and $1.97 on monthly timeframes. According to him, the asset’s current trajectory mirrors earlier financial cycles, specifically those seen in 1999 and 2007, when risk assets experienced a final surge before a broader market correction. EGRAG emphasized that the current market has not yet reached the kind of euphoria that typically signals a cycle peak, implying that XRP may still have room to appreciate further before the next major downturn. The analyses from CryptoInsightUK, Vincent Van Code, and EGRAG Crypto all align in suggesting that XRP remains in a structurally strong position. The combination of tight exchange liquidity, renewed market optimism, and supportive technical indicators collectively strengthens the argument for a potential long-term move toward $15.

This innovative new platform is poised to introduce a much-needed layer of risk-controlled yield generation, directly addressing one of the primary concerns for users venturing into the safety of their deposited capital. SolsticeFi is reimagining how investors earn on Solana by introducing a defensively engineered approach to yield, one that directly protects the value of user deposits. According to crypto commentator Madissa’s post on X, one of SolsticeFi’s most compelling features is its ability to allow users to continue earning staking rewards while keeping their assets liquid and usable across the broader DeFi ecosystem. How SolsticeFi Balances Risk While Generating Yield This innovation created continuous opportunities for user to deploy their capital in other protocols without interrupting their base yield, instead of locking up funds. SolsticeFi platform is designed to prioritize full transparency and validator diversification, minimizing exposure to single-validator risks and opaque yield platforms. Furthermore, depositing capital into SolsticeFi provides support for SOL’s network security while generating sustainable returns for users. Related Reading: Solana Stays Strong: Network Outperforms Rivals Amid AWS Outage Turmoil Crypto analyst Hokage has also mentioned how Solana is improving and completely revolutionizing financial transaction speeds in traditional finance (TraFi), where transfers take days, settlements drag, and middlemen slow everything down. SOL has changed the game by creating a new block every 400 milliseconds, and currently, the central to this acceleration is Bam, the new block assembly marketplace. This Bam will speed up how quickly user transaction gets picked up and integrated into a block, and slash inclusion times to an astonishing 50-100 milliseconds. Building on this is Alpenglow, which takes finality down to an incredible 100-150 milliseconds faster than a blink, and the point where the network confirms the user transaction is 100% done and irreversible. One project that stands out in these ultra-fast ecosystem steps is SolsticeFi’s USX, a stablecoin specifically built to move at that speed, which enables users to send dollars, deploy capital, and settle instantly. Hokage concluded that “while these advancements might sound like pure sci-fi, if you’ve been around the SOL ecosystem, you would know it’s not.” Market Confidence Returns To Solana While SolsticeFi provides speed and reduces risk to Solana yield platforms, KOLS Manager at Binance, investor, and trader BitGuru, has noted that SOL’s price is currently showing a strong bullish setup, after following a steady downtrend and now stabilizing near key support. Related Reading: Solana Pauses To Recharge – Will $195 Support Hold The Line For A Comeback? As a result of that action, the SOL market is now pulling back with considerable strength, aiming to break above the critical $210 resistance level, a zone that has capped multiple attempts at recovery. A decisive breakout above $210 would likely trigger SOL’s next leg higher toward $230 and beyond.

Reports indicate a massive transfer of Ethereum (ETH) that has caught the attention of market watchers. Specifically, Onchain-Lense , a reputable blockchain analytics firm, has highlighted a substantial movement: 27,316 ETH, valued at approximately $108.92 million, was transferred from BitGo to a new wallet. This wallet is strongly suspected of belonging to none other than Bitmain , a major player in the crypto mining industry. This strategic move means Bitmain now holds an impressive 2.7% of the total ETH supply. The implications of such a significant Bitmain ETH accumulation are worth exploring. What Does Bitmain’s Massive ETH Accumulation Mean for the Market? Bitmain ‘s recent acquisition of Ethereum isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a powerful statement. When a company of Bitmain ‘s stature makes such a substantial investment, it often signals a strong belief in the asset’s future potential. This particular transfer of Bitmain ETH positions them as a significant holder, sometimes referred to as a “whale” in the crypto space. For context, Bitmain is primarily known for manufacturing cryptocurrency mining hardware. While their historical focus has been heavily on Bitcoin mining, this significant ETH acquisition suggests a diversification of their crypto holdings and perhaps a broader strategic outlook on the blockchain ecosystem. This could indicate a growing confidence in Ethereum ‘s long-term value and its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Why is Bitmain Accumulating Ethereum Now? Several factors might be at play behind this strategic move. One possibility is a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum ‘s price. With Ethereum ‘s ongoing developments, including scalability improvements and its dominance in smart contract platforms, institutional players like Bitmain might see it as a valuable asset for future growth. Moreover, this purchase could reflect Bitmain ‘s strategy to diversify its treasury assets, moving beyond its primary focus on Bitcoin -related ventures. This helps mitigate risks and capitalize on different market segments. The timing of this Bitmain ETH purchase is also crucial, potentially reflecting an opportune entry point based on their market analysis. Long-Term Confidence: Bitmain likely sees Ethereum as a robust and essential part of the future digital economy. Portfolio Diversification: Spreading investments across different major cryptocurrencies reduces reliance on a single asset. Strategic Positioning: Holding a significant portion of the total ETH supply gives Bitmain considerable influence and exposure. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of Bitmain ETH Holdings? The accumulation of such a large amount of Ethereum by a single entity like Bitmain can have several ripple effects across the market. Firstly, it could be perceived as a strong vote of confidence, potentially encouraging other institutional and retail investors to consider ETH . This positive sentiment could contribute to price stability or even upward momentum for Ethereum . Furthermore, a large holder like Bitmain gains significant influence. While not necessarily used for manipulation, their future buying or selling activities could impact market dynamics. However, the sheer size of the Ethereum market means that even a substantial holding like this is unlikely to cause extreme volatility on its own. Instead, it adds another significant institutional player to the Bitmain ETH ecosystem, further maturing the market. Challenges could arise if such large holdings become concentrated among a few entities, raising concerns about centralization. However, the decentralized nature of Ethereum ‘s network means that individual holdings, even substantial ones, do not directly control the protocol itself. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitmain ETH and Ethereum Bitmain ‘s significant Ethereum accumulation underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency space. As more established companies recognize the value and potential of digital assets, the market gains further legitimacy and stability. This move by Bitmain could inspire other traditional tech or financial giants to explore similar investments, driving further capital into the Ethereum network. For investors, this development serves as a reminder of the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Keeping an eye on major institutional movements, like this Bitmain ETH transfer, can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. It reinforces the idea that Ethereum is not just a speculative asset but a foundational technology attracting serious long-term capital. In conclusion, Bitmain ‘s acquisition of $109 million in Ethereum is a monumental event in the crypto world. It signals a robust belief in Ethereum ‘s future, diversifies Bitmain ‘s portfolio, and adds another powerful institutional player to the ETH ecosystem.

The company is shifting into artificial intelligence infrastructure while still running its bitcoin business. The CEO explained the plan on CNBC’s “Crypto World” and said this model will likely become common among miners. CleanSpark recently won a 100‑megawatt site in Cheyenne, Wyoming, beating Microsoft for the contract. The CEO said the deciding factor was speed. CleanSpark built a 100‑megawatt mining site in about six months, while building a full AI data center can take between three and six years. “We were able to scale up and deploy 100 megawatt bitcoin mining facility in about six months,” CEO Matt Schultz said. “Certainly, Cheyenne didn’t select CleanSpark because we had a stronger balance sheet than Microsoft.” The company once operated as an energy firm before shifting to bitcoin mining five years ago. Schultz said this pivot brings the company back to its roots because the competition now revolves around access to power. CleanSpark currently operates 1.03 gigawatts of active facilities and has 1.7 gigawatts planned. Schultz described the model as “monetizing megawatts,” using bitcoin mining to scale power infrastructure fast, and then converting selected locations into high‑performance computing for AI where it makes sense. He said bitcoin miners can build and energize data centers quickly, but power access is the main barrier for everyone in the space. CleanSpark expands into AI campuses CleanSpark announced a partnership with Submer, a data center engineering company, to develop AI‑focused campuses across North America. The plan combines CleanSpark’s energy and land assets with Submer’s liquid‑cooled, high‑density systems. Schultz said , “We are positioned to deliver AI capacity at gigawatt scale, faster, cleaner, and more efficiently than traditional approaches.” He said the goal is to turn CleanSpark’s infrastructure platform into the backbone of the next phase of computing. One region Schultz pointed to as a growing AI cluster is Atlanta, which he described as second only to Northern Virginia on the East Coast for data center development. Running AI models consumes large amounts of power. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are spending heavily on new data centers and signing deals with utilities to build new nuclear reactors or restart old ones. Even with that spending, many of the new projects face long delays connecting to the grid. Schultz said, “Hyperscalers are spending 60% of their free cash flow on capex to try and keep up with AI.” He added that miners already control what is hardest to secure: land, substations, and direct access to electricity. Crypto margins tighten as dual‑track model grows Shares of CleanSpark are up more than 100% this year. The shift to AI helps offset tighter bitcoin mining profits after the April halving cut block rewards by half. CleanSpark reported $198.6 million in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up nearly 91% year over year, and holds 12,703 bitcoin in its treasury. Schultz said the AI move does not replace crypto earnings. “It’s [bitcoin mining] a terrific part of our business,” he said. CleanSpark’s power model allows it to shut down mining operations during grid stress and push power back to utilities, something AI centers cannot easily do. Schultz said blending mining with AI gives utilities flexibility. During hurricane Helene in Georgia, CleanSpark powered down and redirected energy. “The lights came back on at the hospital within an hour,” he said.

Today, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely recognized barometer for investor psychology, stands at a pivotal 51. This score, a slight uptick from yesterday, firmly places the market in a neutral zone. But what does this equilibrium truly signify for those navigating the volatile waters of digital assets? Let’s delve deeper into what this crucial metric reveals about the current state of crypto sentiment. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal Today? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me , offers a fascinating snapshot of the market’s emotional pulse. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it helps investors gauge whether the market is leaning towards extreme fear (0) or extreme greed (100). A score of 51, hovering precisely in the middle, indicates that neither fear nor euphoria is dominating investor decisions right now. This neutral stance suggests a period of consolidation or indecision, where market participants are perhaps waiting for clearer signals before making significant moves. It’s a moment for cautious observation rather than impulsive action. Unpacking the Components: How is This Crucial Index Calculated? Understanding how the Crypto Fear & Greed Index arrives at its score is vital for accurate interpretation. It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several key market indicators, each weighted differently to reflect its impact on overall sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the factors that contribute to this powerful metric: Volatility (25%): Measures the current price fluctuations of Bitcoin and compares them to average values. Higher volatility often signals a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volumes and market momentum. High buying volumes in a rising market can indicate greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related keywords and sentiment. An abundance of positive chatter can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these surveys historically asked investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates a flight to safety, suggesting fear in altcoin markets. Google Search Trends (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sudden spikes in “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” searches can signal fear. By combining these diverse data points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view of market psychology, moving beyond simple price action. Navigating Neutrality: What Does a Score of 51 Mean for Your Strategy? A neutral score of 51 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it suggests a lack of extreme emotional biases, which can lead to more rational market behavior. On the other hand, it often precedes significant moves, as the market is essentially ‘coiling’ before a breakout in either direction. For investors, this period calls for a balanced and informed approach: Opportunity for Research: Use this calmer period to thoroughly research potential investments, understand underlying technologies, and assess long-term viability. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Resist the urge to chase small price movements. Neutrality often means chop, where prices fluctuate without clear direction. Prepare for Shifts: While neutral, the market rarely stays static. Be ready for potential shifts towards fear or greed, and have a strategy in place for both scenarios. Diversify Wisely: Re-evaluate your portfolio. A neutral sentiment can be a good time to adjust allocations without the pressure of extreme market conditions. The key is to use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as one tool among many, rather than a standalone indicator for making investment decisions. Beyond the Numbers: Limitations and Strategic Use of This Crucial Metric While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool for understanding market sentiment, it’s essential to recognize its limitations. It measures current emotions, but it doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Market dynamics are complex, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological advancements, and unforeseen events. Relying solely on this index without considering fundamental analysis or technical indicators would be an incomplete strategy. Instead, consider using this crucial metric as a complementary indicator. For example, a shift from extreme fear to neutral might signal a potential bottom, while a move from neutral to extreme greed could warn of an impending correction. Experienced traders often use the index to identify contrarian opportunities, buying when others are fearful and taking profits when others are overly greedy. It’s about understanding the prevailing mood and how it might influence collective behavior. The current neutral stance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 51 serves as a timely reminder for all crypto enthusiasts. It highlights a market that is currently holding its breath, poised for its next significant move. While not a definitive predictor, this crucial indicator offers invaluable insights into the collective psychology of crypto investors. By understanding its components and implications, you can better navigate the market’s ebbs and flows, making more informed and strategic decisions in your crypto journey. Stay informed, stay strategic, and remember that patience often yields the greatest rewards in volatile markets.

Robyn said that if Elon Musk leaves or becomes less involved, Tesla is ready to name a new chief executive from inside the company to ensure what she described as an “orderly transition.” She said internal succession is the most likely path, though the board is not fully ruling out candidates from outside. Elon Musk’s compensation plan would give him about 25% voting control if he achieves major growth milestones linked to Tesla’s market value, including expansion in electric cars, robotics, and the robotaxi program. Elon Musk has made it clear that if he does not receive the compensation structure he wants, he may shift more of his time toward his other companies, including SpaceX and xAI. Robyn said: “I’ve had the conversations with him directly. There’s no question in my mind that if we don’t get this across, there is a high probability he would back away from the company or become less engaged.” Board campaigns for shareholder support Robyn emphasized that the pay plan is tied to performance expectations, not simply a payout.The shareholder vote will take place at Tesla’s annual meeting on November 6. said the outcome is not guaranteed because many investors wait until the last minute to cast their votes.About 30% of Tesla’s shareholders are retail holders, which is unusually high, so the board has been making direct efforts to encourage them to vote. Robyn and other board members, including James Murdoch and former Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung, have been meeting with some of the largest institutional shareholders, including Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc., and State Street Corp. Many investors often follow recommendations from proxy advisory firms. Two of the largest, ISS and Glass Lewis, have recommended voting against the compensation plan. Robyn said : “There is no guarantee. There is a large contingent of passive investors who actually follow their guidance, so we have to counter that with them directly.” As part of the effort to encourage voting, Tesla placed its Optimus humanoid robot outside the Nasdaq building in New York. The robot handed out Tesla-branded gummy candies, waved at people, and posed for pictures as crowds gathered. Videos were taken and shared widely online. Succession planning and future business decisions Tesla shares rose 2.9% at midday in New York, and the stock is up 12% this year, compared to a 17% increase in the S&P 500 Index. Earlier this year, the company’s stock was affected by concerns over an aging vehicle lineup and public reactions to Elon Musk’s political activity. The board believes that Elon Musk’s continued engagement is tied to Tesla’s artificial intelligence development and its future products. If the proposal does not get enough support, Tesla has what Robyn described as Plan B. She said Tesla has a strong internal leadership group. One key figure is Tom Zhu, who oversees global production and operations in China. Tom has worked across multiple divisions in Tesla, a deliberate move to ensure internal candidates understand the company deeply. Robyn said Tesla has “a whole range of different alternatives out there,” including the possibility of splitting leadership roles among more than one person. Another item in the upcoming meeting is a nonbinding vote on whether Tesla should invest in xAI, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company. Robyn said, “We haven’t invested in it” because the technology being built at xAI is different from what Tesla focuses on. However, Robyn added that if shareholders approve the idea, it would start a review process to evaluate the related-party transaction before any investment happens.

Under the deal, the firms will also deploy the self-driving vehicles. According to The Verge, the agreement stipulates that Stellantis will manufacture the vehicles, while Foxconn and chip making giant will provide the self-driving technology as well as systems integration. Under this deal, Uber will then roll out the finished robotaxis on its global ride-hailing platform. For Uber , the initiative comes as the company is also actively championing the crucial role of AI in the transportation tech, hoping to leverage the technology for growth. Uber will start with a 5,000 vehicle rollout in the US Production is scheduled to start in 2028 and Uber will initially launch 5,000 vehicles in the US markets before expanding the program internationally. Recently, Uber teamed up with AI specialist Wayve to trial fully autonomous rides across the UK, with no human behind the wheel, beginning in spring 2026 as previously reported by Cryptopolitan . With this partnership with Wayve, a London-based startup backed by SoftBank, Uber aims to bring driverless journeys to passengers in London. According to Stellantis, its “AV-Ready” platforms such as the K0 Medium Size Van and the STLA Small –are designed with flexibility in mind, capable of supporting multiple passengers and configurations suited for autonomous operation. As for Nvidia, its Drive AGX Hyperion 10 platform will power the vehicles’ brains, combining the company’s DriveOS software with advanced AI hardware for autonomous decision-making. According to the agreement, Foxconn, which is better known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, will aid with hardware and systems integration – though the company’s exact role remains somewhat vague. Beyond semiconductors and smartphones, Foxconn has earlier revealed that it is actively pursuing growth in the electric-vehicle (EV) sector. Its subsidiary, Foxtron Vehicle Technologies, established in partnership with Yulon Motor , signed a memorandum of understanding with Mitsubishi Motors to design and manufacture a new EV model in Taiwan. Now, the partnership with Stellantis and the other firms signals a renewed enthusiasm for autonomous mobility after years of scepticism and shutdowns across the industry because of safety concerns and high development costs. By pooling expertise from multiple sectors, automotive, technology, and ridehailing – the partners aim to overcome previous hurdles that have stalled the commercialisation of self-driving vehicles. Analysts are however still cautious that such partnerships often resemble supplier agreements more than equal partnerships. Already, Nvidia supplies autonomous tech to several other automakers, including General Motors and Lucid, while Uber has made it clear that its platform will host robotaxis from a range of manufacturers, such as Waymo and Volkswagen. For Stellantis, the deal highlights its growing focus on automation. The vehicle making giant has been developing Level 3 semi-autonomous systems for its major brands. It previously signed another separate robotax partnership Pony.ai to develop and test driverless vehicles in Europe. On successful implementation, the new venture could mark a turning point in the long-delayed promise of driverless mobility—potentially ushering in a new era where hailing a ride might not require a human driver at all.

This was the electrifying reality at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025, where Thomas Middleditch, the beloved star of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” made an unexpected yet impactful appearance. His presence wasn’t just for a casual chat; Middleditch took center stage to champion an innovative Australian startup, demonstrating the powerful convergence of entertainment, technology, and the evolving landscape of digital innovation. Who is Thomas Middleditch and Why Was He at Bitcoin World Disrupt? For fans of HBO’s critically acclaimed series “Silicon Valley,” Thomas Middleditch is synonymous with Richard Hendricks, the socially awkward but brilliant CEO of Pied Piper. The show itself famously parodied and celebrated the very essence of tech conferences like Disrupt, making Middleditch’s appearance at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 a meta-moment of epic proportions. His presence was a deliberate and engaging surprise, designed to capture attention and highlight a compelling new venture. This wasn’t just a celebrity endorsement; it was a testament to the growing mainstream interest in the intersection of AI, blockchain, and creative industries. Middleditch’s role went beyond a mere cameo. He executed a planned takeover of Othelia’s presentation, an Australian startup competing in the prestigious Battlefield 200. This strategic move instantly elevated Othelia’s profile, drawing significant attention to their mission and technology. The actor, amid being pitched, photographed, and mildly swarmed by enthusiastic attendees in the Expo hall, also found time to share his valuable perspective on the conference, the transformative power of AI, and how he integrates AI platforms into his own creative projects, such as his popular “Improv With Robots” YouTube channel. Unveiling Othelia: The Next Frontier in AI Storytelling Platform At the heart of Middleditch’s captivating pitch was Othelia, an ambitious Australian startup with a clear vision: to build a Cursor-like platform specifically tailored for storytellers. In an era where content creation is king, Othelia’s AI storytelling platform aims to empower creators by providing advanced tools that streamline and enhance the narrative development process. Imagine an AI assistant that understands your creative intent, helps you flesh out characters, plotlines, and even generate dialogue, all while maintaining your unique artistic voice. This is the promise of Othelia. The concept of an AI storytelling platform is revolutionary, offering several key benefits: Enhanced Creativity: By automating mundane tasks, AI frees up storytellers to focus on high-level creative decisions. Increased Efficiency: Rapid prototyping of story ideas, character arcs, and world-building elements. Accessibility: Lowering the barrier to entry for aspiring writers and content creators.

Today, that humor feels closer to reality as markets shift at lightning speed. Gold is hitting record highs, Bitcoin is rallying ahead of a major breakout, and TRON is making headlines with its public debut via a reverse merger. Amid this volatility, early-stage projects are quietly gaining momentum, creating opportunities for savvy investors. Now is the perfect moment to explore which projects could become the best 100x crypto this year. For those aiming to position for exponential upside, timing, strategy, and careful research are more important than ever. Choosing the right opportunity can mean the difference between modest gains and extraordinary returns in today’s fast-moving crypto markets. This makes it essential for investors who want to capitalize on the best 100x crypto this year to explore the potential of these projects while managing risk. In this article, we take a close look at Bitcoin, BullZilla, and TRON, analyzing their investment potential, technological innovation, market positioning, and community support, offering valuable insights for investors, developers, and analysts seeking to navigate this dynamic world effectively. Don’t Wait – Only 500 Allocations Remain for the Next BullZilla Presale Stage! Bitcoin Tests $116K Resistance Amid Neutral-Bullish Consolidation Bitcoin is currently navigating a neutral-to-bullish consolidation, trading between its 100- and 200-day moving averages. The $116K level now serves as the primary resistance for any upward continuation, while the $109K zone marks the threshold that would invalidate the bullish outlook. With gold up more than 33% this year, this zone marks a critical inflection point: a sustained close above $116K would signal a structural shift, potentially propelling Bitcoin toward the $120K–$122K supply area. However, the rejection candle forming near the 100-day moving average underscores ongoing selling pressure from short-term holders. That said, its upside may be tempered by its scale and maturity relative to smaller projects, making 100× returns less likely, though structural value remains strong. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin News Today What makes Bitcoin a safe-haven asset? Bitcoin’s capped supply, robust institutional inflows, and increasing inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reinforce its role as a digital reserve asset. These factors position it as a potential hedge in volatile markets, offering investors a combination of scarcity-driven value. Why might Bitcoin break out now? The BTC/gold ratio has formed a bullish triangle, suggesting potential upside for Bitcoin. As gold’s price momentum slows, conservative investors may rotate capital into Bitcoin, viewing it as an alternative store of value. BullZilla ($BZIL) – Best 100x Crypto this Year BullZilla ($BZIL) opens an exciting chapter in early-stage crypto, making it a potential best 100x crypto this year . The project emphasizes scarcity, utility, and community through its presale mechanics. So far, it has raised over $980K, with more than 31 billion tokens sold and 3,300+ holders onboard. At the current stage price of $0.00019906, BullZilla promises an estimated ROI of 2,548% for late-stage participants and over 3,361% for early adopters, making structured gains a possibility rather than mere hype. A $1,000 investment in BullZilla could generate 5.023 million $BZIL tokens, highlighting the carefully engineered potential upside through mechanisms such as staking in the HODL Furnace, token burns via the Roar Burn Mechanism, and layered referral programs that reward community engagement. For instance, allocating $5,000 today with a listing target of $0.00527 could yield a gross value of approximately $26,350. While these numbers are promising, they remain projections, underscoring the importance of strategic planning, risk awareness, and fully understanding BullZilla’s structured growth approach. How to Join the BullZilla Presale To join the BullZilla presale, participants should visit the official purchase portal , connect a supported wallet, and follow the guided purchase steps. Authentication and identity checks protect the ecosystem, while instructions highlight verifying contract addresses and avoiding phishing sources. After purchase, tokens may appear after network confirmations and vesting schedules apply. It is essential to use the official site and verify via project channels. With the next phase priced at $0.00020573 (a 3.35% bump), early entry matters. Frequently Asked Questions About Bullzilla Presale Why might my presale tokens not show in my wallet immediately? Tokens might not appear immediately in a wallet due to factors such as blockchain confirmation delays, vesting schedules, or the requirement to manually add the token contract to the wallet. How can one spot fake Telegram channels about BullZilla? Authentic channels can be identified by official verification badges, consistent branding, and direct links from the project’s official website. In contrast, scam or fake channels often exhibit spelling mistakes, inconsistent or distorted logos, and unresponsive or unreachable administrators, signaling a high risk of fraud or misinformation. How are presales potentially life-changing? Early-stage access provides investors with significant discounts and a structured path to potential upside. When a project’s utility, token scarcity, and community support align effectively, participating early can result in outsized returns. Claim Your Share!

On-chain metrics show TRON’s circulating supply near 94.66 billion and a market cap of around $28 billion. Its ecosystem boasts high stablecoin activity and expanding DeFi infrastructure, recently cutting transaction fees to boost adoption. Although ranked as a comparatively larger project, and thus less likely to deliver 100× growth, TRON offers established infrastructure, real-world applications, and institutional anchoring features that the smallest presales lack. Frequently Asked Questions About TRON News Today What is TRON’s current market cap and supply? TRON’s market capitalization is around $28 billion, with a circulating supply of 94.66 billion TRX tokens. This large scale supports strong liquidity, stability, and sustained investor confidence across global markets. How does TRON differ from smaller presale coins? TRON offers a mature blockchain, real-world integrations, and massive stablecoin transaction volumes, ensuring stability. Smaller presale tokens rely on scarcity and speculation, presenting higher potential returns but significantly greater volatility and investment risk. Conclusion – Which is the Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now? The recent breakout signals around Bitcoin, combined with TRON’s strategic institutional initiatives, have created an exciting environment for high-potential crypto engagement. Bitcoin’s growing role as a digital safe-haven asset and TRON’s structural resilience both emphasize the rapid evolution of the blockchain ecosystem. Investors are increasingly seeking opportunities that balance stability with strong upside potential, while developers and analysts evaluate innovative blockchain protocols. These market dynamics underline why timing, strategic positioning, and informed decision-making are vital in today’s competitive crypto world. Within this dynamic environment, BullZilla stands out as the best 100x crypto this year . Its blend of early-stage tokenomics, structured presale phases, and defined real-world utility mechanisms makesfla it uniquely positioned for exponential growth. Nevertheless, investors must stay alert to common risks such as volatility, smart contract vulnerabilities, and market timing challenges. A well-informed approach enables participants to navigate these risks effectively while leveraging BullZilla’s potential as a project engineered for innovation, scalability, and long-term ecosystem expansion. Secure your allocation now, join BullZilla before the next price jump and ride the potential upside with fewer spots left!

This move, alongside a transfer of another 2,361.73 BTC ($266.20 million) to a new address, was meticulously tracked by Onchain Lens and has ignited considerable market discussion. When such a considerable amount of Bitcoin moves to an exchange, it is often interpreted as a potential signal of an intention to sell, prompting many to ponder the intentions of this seasoned market participant. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Investor Deposit Signify? Deposits of this scale to centralized exchanges are invariably under intense scrutiny by market analysts. Historically, these movements suggest that the holder might be preparing to liquidate some of their assets. For an individual like Gunden, whose associated address still retains a staggering 7,150 BTC (worth around $806.44 million), such a deposit can undoubtedly send ripples across the entire market. Potential Selling Pressure: A large influx of BTC onto an exchange could increase the available supply, potentially leading to downward price pressure if a significant sell-off materializes. Market Sentiment Impact: The actions of prominent early holders can significantly influence broader market sentiment, prompting other investors to reassess their own positions. However, it is crucial to understand that a deposit does not always culminate in an immediate sale. Various factors could be at play, including portfolio rebalancing, utilizing exchange services for other financial instruments, or even preparing for large over-the-counter (OTC) deals that bypass direct impact on spot market prices. The Enduring Influence of Early Bitcoin Holders Early Bitcoin holders, often termed “whales,” control a substantial portion of the total Bitcoin supply. Their strategic movements are frequently perceived as indicators of market confidence or impending caution. Owen Gunden exemplifies these pioneers who acquired Bitcoin when its value was dramatically lower than today. Their decisions, due to the sheer volume of their holdings, carry significant weight. The fact that Gunden’s address still holds a massive 7,150 BTC after these recent transfers underscores the profound long-term conviction many early adopters possess. While a portion was directed to Kraken, an even larger sum was moved to a fresh address, potentially signaling a strategic reallocation of assets rather than a complete divestment. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Every Investor For everyday participants in the dynamic crypto market, observing these large-scale movements offers invaluable lessons. While it is tempting to engage in immediate speculation, adopting a measured and informed approach is consistently the most prudent strategy. Stay Informed: Diligently monitor on-chain analytics and consult reputable news sources to comprehend significant market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid concentrating all your capital in one asset. Diversification is a powerful tool to help mitigate risks associated with large market shifts. Implement Robust Risk Management: Develop a clear, predefined investment strategy and adhere to it, rather than reacting impulsively to the actions of large holders or market FUD. Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey has been characterized by notable volatility. Focusing on the long-term growth trajectory can help investors navigate and withstand short-term fluctuations. What’s Next for This Noteworthy Investor and the Broader Market? The cryptocurrency community will undoubtedly continue to closely observe Owen Gunden’s address and the Kraken exchange for any subsequent activity. Will the deposited BTC be sold, or is this merely a strategic repositioning within a larger financial plan? The resolution of these questions could have short-term implications for Bitcoin’s price action and market sentiment. Ultimately, the actions of a single influential holder, even a significant Bitcoin investor , represent just one facet of the intricate puzzle that defines the crypto market. Broader macroeconomic trends, evolving regulatory frameworks, and increasing institutional adoption continue to exert pivotal influence over Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Compelling Summary: A Whale’s Strategic Move Sparks Market Watch The recent substantial deposit by early Bitcoin investor Owen Gunden to Kraken has undeniably captured significant market attention. While such large-scale movements often hint at potential selling, the subsequent transfer of an even greater sum to a new address suggests a more intricate, strategic repositioning. This event powerfully highlights the immense influence of major holders and serves as a vital reminder for all investors to remain informed, practice diligent risk management, and maintain a resilient long-term perspective within the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Owen Gunden? A1: Owen Gunden is identified as an early Bitcoin investor , known for holding a substantial amount of BTC acquired in the early days of cryptocurrency. His recent movements of significant Bitcoin holdings have drawn considerable market attention. Q2: What does a large BTC deposit to an exchange like Kraken signify? A2: A large deposit of Bitcoin to a centralized exchange such as Kraken is frequently interpreted as a potential intention to sell. Investors often move their assets to exchanges when they plan to liquidate holdings, though it can also be for other purposes like portfolio rebalancing or engaging in over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Q3: How do the actions of early Bitcoin investors (whales) impact the market? A3: Early Bitcoin investors, often called “whales” due to their massive holdings, can significantly influence market sentiment and price action. Their large transactions, whether deposits, withdrawals, or transfers, can create speculation, increase volatility, or signal broader trends due to the sheer volume of their assets. Q4: Should individual investors react immediately to whale movements? A4: While it’s important to stay informed about significant market movements, individual investors are generally advised against making impulsive decisions based solely on whale activity. It’s more prudent to stick to a well-defined investment strategy, manage risk, diversify, and maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting emotionally to short-term market fluctuations. Q5: What is Onchain Lens? A5: Onchain Lens is a platform or entity that provides on-chain analytics and reporting, tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions and movements on various blockchain networks, offering insights into market activity and large holder behavior.

According to the Norwegian Tax Administration (Skatteetaten), more than 73,000 taxpayers reported owning digital assets in their 2024 tax filings — a 30% increase compared to the previous year. The declared holdings were valued at over $4 billion, including about $550 million in gains and $290 million in losses, highlighting both growing participation and heightened compliance. Officials attribute the surge to ongoing awareness campaigns, technological improvements that simplify reporting, and the upcoming introduction of third-party reporting requirements for crypto exchanges and custodians, which are set to take effect by 2026. These measures will make it mandatory for service providers to share transaction data with the government, closing long-standing gaps in crypto-related tax compliance. Additionally, the number of taxpayers that reported owning digital assets in their 2024 tax filings is considerably higher than in 2019, when only about 6,470 individuals out of the European country’s total population of around 5.5 million reported having cryptocurrency. Regarding digital assets reporting, the Norwegian Tax Administration noted that 2024 saw an improvement in reporting, as more individuals reported their cryptocurrency holdings than in the previous year. Norwegian tax authority recognizes an improvement in digital assets reporting In a statement, Nina Schanke Funnemark, Director of the Norwegian Tax Administration, acknowledged that it is encouraging when more individuals declare their own cryptocurrency holdings. Funnemark explained that this move is important as it ensures accurate tax reporting. “We have implemented several measures in recent years to boost these numbers, and we are noticing positive results,” she added. To strengthen the enforcement of the reporting policy, the tax authority stated that, as of January 1, 2026, crypto custodians and exchange operators must report certain information through third-party channels. Sources from Norway, in the meantime, have reported that the country has a central bank with a sovereign wealth fund that invests partially in digital assets. This came to light after reports surfaced in August indicating that the foundation had an indirect exposure of 7,161 BTC. This was achieved by investing in companies such as Metaplanet, Coinbase, and Strategy. The latest data reflects a growing global trend toward stricter crypto tax compliance, as governments move to integrate digital assets more firmly into traditional financial frameworks. UK’s HMRC emphasizes the need for crypto tax compliance Like Norway, several governments have announced significant updates to their tax regulations as cryptocurrencies gain more popularity among individuals. Earlier this month, the UK’s tax agency reportedly sent approximately 65,000 letters to cryptocurrency holders who were believed to have failed to report or evade taxes on their gains from the digital assets. This move was initiated after the country’s tax authority intensified its investigation into cryptocurrency investors, issuing double the number of warning letters to suspected non-compliers or evaders of taxes related to gains on digital assets. The 65,000 letters from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the UK’s tax, payments, and customs authority, were sent between the 2024 and 2025 tax years. Regarding this figure, a reliable source noted that the letters exceeded the 27,700 sent the previous year, citing data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Notably, the letters are referred to as “nudge letters” and were introduced to encourage investors to correct their tax filings before official investigations commenced voluntarily. Still, the HMRC increases emphasis on crypto tax compliance. The agency has sent over 100,000 letters in the last four years, as digital assets adoption and asset prices increased.

While XRP’s price performance in the current times is indicating the possibility of a good comeback, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction with its groundbreaking dual-lending protocol and presale history that is smashing all-time highs. Now selling at Stage 6 for $0.035 and more than 80% sold out already, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the market’s top cryptocurrencies. More and more investors are opining that MUTM’s revolutionary architecture and initial traction is evoking the type of potential that was available for XRP in its early growth phase, positioning it as a new crypto coin to watch in 2025. XRP Price Forecast: Institutional Support Pushes for 35% Rally XRP is drawing stiff bullish cues as price action bounces off the significant $2.33 support zone, a historically strong launching pad for mass rallies. Technicals project a possible 35% rally to the $3.45 mark, supported by a clear pick-up in trading activity and renewed market sentiment. In addition to the charts, Ripple’s introduction of Ripple Prime, a global prime brokerage solution for institutions, is supporting XRP’s credibility in cross-border payments and making it more attractive to professional investors. While Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrates its power above $111,000, institutional adoption would be the key that would drive XRP to its next breakout phase. As faith returns to veteran alts, investors are also adding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to their watchlists, which is rapidly gaining popularity as a new crypto coin and one of the top cryptocurrencies for 2025. Mutuum Finance Attracts Early Birds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning out to be one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to keep an eye on in 2025, capturing the interest of investors globally. The presale has received over 17,500 individuals participating and has raised over $18.15 million to date with increasing market demand. During Phase 6, the existing price of the MUTM token is $0.035, its most devalued state prior to the price increasing to $0.04 in the subsequent phase. This phase has experienced a rush of demand, and sales have already hit 80% sell-out in record time, an indicator of growing investor confidence in the long-term future of the project. This drive places MUTM at the top of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in today and highlights it as a new crypto coin with serious growth potential. Consistent Passive Income With Mutuum Finance Aside from token appreciation, Mutuum Finance also offers steady passive income in the form of its liquidity pools, with investors earning annual percentage yields (APY) based on market demand. For instance, an investor investing $20,000 of USDT can earn $2,000 annually at a 10% APY, while its assets earn yield automatically over time. Unlike the majority of the other legacy altcoins, Mutuum Finance is a real DeFi protocol based on functional, open financial technology. Utilizing both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) paradigms, the platform accommodates adaptive lending, passive income generation, and efficient risk management, all carried out in a secure, automated, and publicly verifiable setting. This makes it a new crypto coin with strong fundamentals, as well as one of the top cryptocurrencies in 2025. Security Features Enhance Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) devs have established an official bug bounty program with CertiK. They dedicated $50,000 USDT to rewards, divided among four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Every vulnerability level has a reward attached to make thorough testing affordable. This comes on the heels of a completed CertiK audit, reflecting on dedication to reliability. Concurrently, the V1 protocol is gearing up for Sepolia testnet launch in Q4 2025 with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will support borrowing and lending initially. Borrowers lend into peer-to-contract pools for yield or peer-to-peer markets for customized terms. As investors prepare for 2025’s bull season, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ripple (XRP) are two of the altcoins attracting serious attention. XRP is signaling a 35% shift to $3.45 as institutional support ramps up, but Mutuum Finance is the star of the show with its dual-borrowing DeFi architecture and blazing presale. Positioned in Phase 6 at $0.035, more than 80% sold out and $18.15M funded, Mutuum Finance has growth prospects and passive returns via yield pools.

53759504,615317,1761699611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53759504.jpeg,"Old Bitcoin Supply Awakens – Long-Term Holders Move 4,657 BTC After Years of Inactivity",https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-supply-long-term-holders-move-4657/,"Bitcoin is attempting to push higher after weeks of consolidation and sustained selling pressure that followed the sharp October 10 crash. The market remains in a delicate recovery phase, with volatility compressing as traders await the next major catalyst. This week could prove decisive, as all eyes turn to Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, where policymakers are expected to announce their next move on interest rates — a decision that could shape global risk sentiment for the remainder of the year. On-chain data adds another layer of intrigue to the current setup. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s dormant supply is waking up, with long-inactive coins — held between three and five years — showing significant movement in recent blocks. Such activity often signals renewed engagement from long-term holders, sometimes preceding key market inflection points. While the short-term outlook remains mixed, analysts note that the reactivation of old coins amid tightening macro conditions suggests growing investor anticipation. If the Fed signals a softer stance on monetary policy, Bitcoin could see renewed capital inflows. However, another hawkish surprise might extend the consolidation phase, keeping BTC locked below resistance until clearer macro conditions emerge. Long-Term Holders Make A Move Top analyst Maartunn shared data revealing that Bitcoin’s 3–5 year dormant supply has seen a sudden spike in activity, with 4,657.48 BTC spent in a single recent block. This metric tracks coins that have been untouched for several years — a cohort often associated with early bull-cycle investors or strategic long-term holders. When such coins move, it typically signals renewed activity from investors who have weathered multiple market phases. In the historical context, similar awakenings in long-term supply have preceded major shifts in market structure. For instance, during past consolidation periods, old coins were reactivated as investors prepared for volatility — either to take profits near local highs or to reposition ahead of a trend reversal. The magnitude of this recent movement suggests that seasoned holders are once again reassessing their allocations amid tightening macro conditions and elevated expectations for the Federal Reserve’s rate decision this week. What makes this particularly interesting is the contrast with current sentiment. Despite the spike in long-term holder activity, on-chain indicators such as the Bull-Bear Structure Index and Unified Sentiment Index remain in mildly bullish territory. This implies that while some early investors are realizing profits or reallocating, broader market conviction is improving — especially as Bitcoin holds above the $113,000–$114,000 range. This movement shouldn’t be interpreted as panic selling but as healthy on-chain rotation. Long-term holders moving coins after years of dormancy often signal the beginning of liquidity redistributions that accompany the next phase of market growth. If Bitcoin maintains its current support levels and macro conditions remain stable, these shifts could fuel the liquidity needed for a new impulse phase toward higher prices. BTC Bulls Regain Momentum Bitcoin is showing renewed strength on the 3-day timeframe, currently trading near $114,485, as it attempts to recover from the sharp sell-off seen earlier in October. The chart shows BTC holding firmly above both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages — a key structural signal suggesting that the medium-term trend remains intact despite recent volatility. The next major resistance level sits at $117,500, a zone that has repeatedly capped Bitcoin’s advances over the past two months. A successful breakout and daily close above this level could open the door for a retest of $125,000, marking the potential start of a new bullish impulse. However, rejection here could signal another short-term consolidation, as traders take profits and reassess risk amid macroeconomic uncertainty. On the downside, immediate support lies near $111,000–$112,000, while the 200-day moving average (red) around $96,000 continues to provide long-term structural backing. Momentum indicators and on-chain data, including a rebound in sentiment and stable liquidity conditions, suggest that buying interest is gradually returning. If the broader market remains calm following the upcoming Federal Reserve rate decision, Bitcoin could confirm its recovery and aim higher toward the $120,000–$125,000 range.

Right now, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , is holding steady at 27. But what does this number truly mean for your investments and how should you navigate the current market climate? Understanding the Crucial Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool provided by CoinMarketCap that helps investors gauge the prevailing market sentiment. It’s not just a random number; it represents a specific market condition. This index measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, carefully excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, have successfully outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Essentially, it tells us who is currently leading the race: Bitcoin or the broader altcoin market. A reading closer to 100 suggests a vibrant altcoin season, where many alternative cryptocurrencies are seeing significant gains against Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower value, like our current 27, indicates a “Bitcoin season.” This means Bitcoin is generally outperforming most altcoins. What Does an Altcoin Season Index of 27 Tell Us? A score of 27 for the Altcoin Season Index is a clear signal: we are currently in a Bitcoin-dominated market. This isn’t necessarily a negative situation, but it demands a different investment approach. When Bitcoin is leading, it often acts as the primary driver for the entire crypto ecosystem. Altcoins, while still active, might experience slower growth or even declines relative to Bitcoin’s performance. This period often sees investors consolidating their positions into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer haven or the primary vehicle for market appreciation. It’s a time when the “digital gold” narrative of Bitcoin often comes to the forefront, attracting capital from across the market. Navigating a Bitcoin-Dominated Market with the Altcoin Season Index For savvy investors, understanding the implications of a low Altcoin Season Index is paramount. It helps in formulating strategies that align with current market dynamics. Instead of chasing every altcoin pump, which might be less frequent or less sustained during a Bitcoin season, attention can shift to Bitcoin’s price action and its impact on the wider market. During such phases, some investors might choose to: Increase Bitcoin Holdings: Capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential outperformance. Re-evaluate Altcoin Portfolios: Trimming underperforming altcoins or rebalancing towards stronger projects. Focus on Blue-Chip Altcoins: Projects like Ethereum ( ETH ) or Solana ( SOL ) might still show resilience, but often move in tandem with Bitcoin. Research and Accumulate: Use this period to research promising altcoins at potentially lower entry points, preparing for a future shift in the Altcoin Season Index . When Will the Altcoin Season Index Shift? The shift from a Bitcoin season to an altcoin season isn’t always predictable, but certain factors often play a role. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes an altcoin season. Once Bitcoin achieves significant gains and consolidates, investors often take profits and rotate that capital into altcoins, seeking higher returns. This rotation can drive the Altcoin Season Index upwards. Macroeconomic factors, technological advancements within specific altcoin projects, and increasing institutional interest in diverse crypto assets can also contribute to a shift. Monitoring the overall market sentiment and major news events is crucial for anticipating these changes. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio The steady reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 27 reinforces the importance of a well-thought-out investment strategy. Don’t let the number deter you; instead, let it inform your decisions. This period could be an excellent opportunity to refine your portfolio and prepare for future market shifts. Remember to always conduct your own research, understand the risks involved, and consider your personal financial goals. The crypto market is volatile, and while the Altcoin Season Index offers valuable insight, it’s one tool among many in a comprehensive investment approach. The current Altcoin Season Index at 27 clearly signals a Bitcoin-dominated period. This isn’t a static condition, but a phase that savvy investors can leverage. By understanding this crucial metric and adjusting your strategy accordingly, you can better navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market, positioning yourself for potential future growth, whether it’s led by Bitcoin or a resurgence of altcoins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric, primarily tracked by CoinMarketCap , that indicates whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A high number suggests an altcoin season, while a low number points to a Bitcoin season. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: It’s calculated by comparing the performance of individual altcoins in the top 100 (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over a 90-day rolling window. If 75% or more of these altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, the index moves towards 100. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 27 signify for my investments? A3: An index of 27 means we are currently in a “Bitcoin season.” This suggests that Bitcoin is generally outperforming most altcoins. Investors might consider increasing their Bitcoin exposure, re-evaluating altcoin holdings, or researching projects for future accumulation. Q4: When can we expect the Altcoin Season Index to shift towards an altcoin season? A4: Shifts are not precisely predictable. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes an altcoin season as profits rotate into altcoins. Macroeconomic trends, significant altcoin project developments, and overall market sentiment also influence this shift. Q5: Should I sell all my altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is low? A5: Not necessarily. A low index indicates a general trend, but individual altcoins can still perform well. It’s an indicator to help you adjust your strategy, perhaps by reducing exposure to weaker altcoins, increasing Bitcoin holdings, or accumulating strong altcoins at lower prices. Always do your own research. Q6: Where can I track the Altcoin Season Index? A6: You can track the Altcoin Season Index directly on CoinMarketCap’s website , which provides real-time updates and historical data.

Solana Has Been Trading Inside A Parallel Channel Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the trajectory of Solana is looking from the perspective of a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is considered a source of resistance, meaning that tops can be probable to appear on retests of it. Similarly, the lower level is assumed to provide support to the price, helping it to arrive at bottoms. A breakout of either of these bounds can signal a continuation of the trend in that direction. That is, a surge above the Parallel Channel can be a bullish signal, while a drop under it may lead to bearish action. There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, depending on how the channel is oriented with respect to the graph axes. Channels that have a positive slope are known as Ascending Channels, while those that slope downward are called Descending Channels. In the context of the current topic, the third and simplest type is the one of interest: a Parallel Channel that’s also parallel to the time-axis. This case corresponds to a phase of true sideways consolidation in the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 4-hour price of Solana has been stuck inside for the last couple of weeks: As displayed in the above graph, Solana retested the lower level of the Parallel Channel last week and successfully found support. The cryptocurrency has since been rising and nearing the resistance level, located at $210. Considering the coin’s current trajectory, the analyst has noted that its price may be heading for a retest at $210 before making its next big move. However, the direction of such a move, if one happens, remains uncertain. Given that the $210 level corresponds to the resistance line of the Parallel Channel, it’s possible that a retest could reject Solana all the way back down to the support level around $176. It’s also possible, though, that this retest could instead lead to a breakout. In this case, SOL could naturally see a sustained bullish push. It now remains to be seen which of the two scenarios will play out for the asset if the Parallel Channel holds and a retest takes place. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $200, up over 7.5% in the last seven days.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has recently unveiled a crucial update to its financial guidelines for cryptocurrencies, known as Info Sheet 225. This move is a game-changer, signalling a broader regulatory approach that will impact numerous platforms and participants in the country’s burgeoning digital asset sector. Understanding these revised Australian crypto regulations is paramount for anyone operating or investing in this space. What Do These Expanded Australian Crypto Regulations Entail? ASIC’s updated guidelines mark a pivotal shift in how digital assets are viewed and regulated. Previously, the focus was primarily on “crypto assets.” Now, the document explicitly uses the term “digital assets,” encompassing a much wider range of digital representations of value or rights. This subtle yet significant change carries substantial implications. Most digital assets will likely fall under the purview of Australia’s financial services laws, meaning they will need to comply with the Australian Financial Services (AFS) license requirements. This broadens ASIC’s oversight considerably, ensuring a more regulated environment for various digital asset activities. Strengthened Oversight: Key Areas of Focus The revised Info Sheet 225 isn’t just theoretical; it provides practical guidance through 18 detailed examples of regulatory applications. These examples offer much-needed clarity for platforms navigating the evolving regulatory environment. Key areas highlighted include: Enhanced Custody Obligations: Platforms holding digital assets on behalf of clients will face stricter requirements to safeguard those assets, ensuring greater investor protection. Application to Overseas Platforms: Local laws will now extend to overseas platforms that offer digital asset services to Australian consumers, levelling the playing field and protecting local investors. Specific Guidance for ETP Issuers: Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) issuers dealing with digital assets receive tailored advice, clarifying their compliance responsibilities. These detailed examples provide a roadmap for compliance, helping businesses understand their obligations and foster a more secure and transparent digital asset ecosystem under the new Australian crypto regulations . DeFi and the Regulatory Horizon: What’s Next? While the updated guidelines bring significant clarity, some areas still remain under active discussion. Notably, the document does not explicitly state whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms must adhere to the same licensing requirements. This signals an ongoing evolution in regulatory thinking as ASIC grapples with the unique characteristics of decentralized protocols. ASIC has clarified that these guidelines do not introduce new laws. Instead, they serve as crucial interpretative guidance. Their purpose is to provide clarity for crypto platforms and stablecoin issuers, preparing them for a formal licensing regime that is expected to be introduced in the future. This proactive approach aims to bridge the gap between innovation and investor protection. Actionable Insights for Digital Asset Platforms For businesses operating in the Australian digital asset space, these updated Australian crypto regulations present both challenges and opportunities. Compliance is no longer an option but a necessity. Platforms should: Review Operations: Assess current services against the expanded definition of “digital assets” and AFS licensing requirements. Strengthen Custody Practices: Ensure robust security and operational frameworks are in place for client assets. Seek Expert Advice: Engage with legal and compliance professionals to navigate the complexities of the new guidelines. Embracing these changes proactively will not only ensure regulatory adherence but also build greater trust with consumers, fostering sustainable growth within the Australian digital asset market. Crucial Steps for a Secure Digital Future ASIC’s updated Info Sheet 225 represents a vital step towards a more mature and secure digital asset market in Australia. By broadening the scope to “digital assets” and providing clear examples, the regulator aims to enhance consumer protection and market integrity. While the path for DeFi remains somewhat open, the overall direction is clear: increased oversight and a push towards greater compliance. These Australian crypto regulations are designed to build a robust framework, ensuring that innovation can thrive responsibly within a well-defined regulatory landscape. This proactive guidance is a welcome development for investors and businesses alike, promising a more transparent and trustworthy environment for digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions About Australian Crypto Regulations Q1: What is Info Sheet 225 and why is it important? A1: Info Sheet 225 is a guidance document from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that outlines its regulatory approach to digital assets. Its importance lies in providing clarity and expanding the scope of financial services laws to a broader range of “digital assets,” preparing the industry for a formal licensing regime. Q2: How do the new guidelines differ from previous ones? A2: The key difference is the shift from “crypto assets” to the broader term “digital assets.” This expansion means more digital representations of value will likely fall under Australian Financial Services (AFS) license requirements, significantly increasing ASIC’s regulatory oversight. Q3: Do these new Australian crypto regulations apply to overseas platforms? A3: Yes, the revised guidelines indicate that local laws will apply to overseas platforms that offer digital asset services to Australian consumers. This ensures consistent consumer protection regardless of where the platform is based. Q4: Are DeFi platforms explicitly covered by these guidelines? A4: The guidelines do not explicitly state whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms must adhere to licensing requirements. ASIC acknowledges the complexity of DeFi and continues to evaluate its regulatory approach in this evolving sector. Q5: What should digital asset platforms do in response to these updates? A5: Platforms should review their services against the expanded definition of “digital assets,” strengthen their custody practices, and seek expert legal and compliance advice to ensure adherence to the updated Australian crypto regulations .

Balchunas added that BSOL garnered over $223 million in assets before its launch, indicating increased institutional engagement and trust in exposure to staking, which pays individuals who lock up cryptocurrency on the blockchain to authenticate transactions. Wall Street’s appetite for cryptocurrency has expanded beyond market heavyweights Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with asset managers considering the establishment of exchange-traded products related to riskier cryptocurrencies or featuring unique mechanisms, such as staking. BSOL’s $55.4 million trading volume exceeded Balchunas’ pre-launch projection of $52 million. Meanwhile, the Canary Capital HBAR ETF (HBR) concluded its first trading day with $8 million in volume, meeting the analyst’s prediction. The Canary Capital Litecoin ETF (LTCC) raised $1 million, which is less than Balchunas’ estimated $7 million. Bitwise’s Solana staking ETF (BSOL) opened to significant demand on Tuesday, with $10 million traded in the first 30 minutes, according to Balchunas. Compared to Canary’s HBAR ETF (HBR) and Litecoin ETF (LTCC), which posted $4 million and $400,000, respectively, within the same period. The early trading activity indicates various levels of investor interest in the new crypto-focused exchange-traded funds, with Bitwise’s Solana product experiencing the most initial demand of the three new offerings. Regulatory clarity on staking fuels U.S. launch after months of uncertainty The debut follows the recent approval of several crypto ETFs, despite limited operational capability owing to the government shutdown. BSOL’s debut trading volume, however, was a fraction of the $1.08 billion in trading volume noted by the nine spot Ether ETFs that launched last July, the first of the altcoin funds to launch in the U.S.. Grayscale’s converted Ethereum ETF Trust accounted for $458 million of that tally, while the BlackRock-issued iShares Ethereum Trust ETF raked in $248.7 million. Bitwise’s spot Ether ETF product also saw $94.3 million, considerably higher than its Solana product’s performance today. The debut follows months of regulatory hesitation over how staking income should be treated under U.S. securities law. On May 29, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued a staff statement clarifying that some proof-of-stake (PoS) activities do not constitute securities offerings. In August, the agency extended that guidance to certain liquid staking programs, effectively clearing the path for ETFs like BSOL to move forward. Bitwise had previously launched a similar Solana staking product in Europe last year but delayed its U.S. counterpart amid ongoing regulatory uncertainty. The company’s U.S. fund now debuts just weeks after the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK) began trading on June 30, recording approximately $12 million in first-day volume. As one of the leading U.S. issuers of crypto-linked ETFs, Bitwise already offers funds tied to Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The Solana fund marks its latest effort to expand investor access to staking yield within a fully regulated structure. Investors shift beyond Bitcoin and Ether as institutional demand for altcoin ETFs rises The product’s launch comes amid a surge in crypto ETF activity this year. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs shattered records in early 2024, attracting tens of billions of dollars in inflows. Spot Ether ETFs, while initially slower to gain momentum, have since drawn significant investor interest as market sentiment improved through the mid-year period. Analysts note that investors are increasingly diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ether, turning their attention to alternative networks such as Solana, Avalanche, and XRP. In January, JPMorgan projected that Solana and XRP ETFs could collectively attract between $3 billion and $8 billion in inflows within six months of their listings, mirroring the adoption patterns seen in earlier crypto fund launches.

Zhao’s lawyer claims the allegations are false, and the founder plans to sue the senator. Zhao’s lawyer, Teresa Goody Guillen, is writing a letter asking Warren to take down her post on X or face a lawsuit. CZ’s lawyer asks Warren to remove her false post and issue a retraction Senator Elizabeth Warren posted on X and stated that the court convicted Zhao of money laundering , but his lawyer, Teresa Goody Guillen, claims that’s not true. She says Warren’s post will spread false information that will hurt the founder’s name and reputation. According to Guillen, Zhao only pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, not to money laundering. He already served his four months in jail and paid a $50 million fine as per his plea deal. Warren made her comments after President Donald Trump pardoned Zhao, but Goody Guillen said the founder will not remain silent while a senator tarnishes his name. She said she has written a formal letter demanding that the senator take down her post and correct her words on social media and in Congress. If she doesn’t, Zhao will sue her. Additionally, the lawyer stated that lawmakers like Warren cannot use their positions of power to make false statements and escape accountability. She explained that the Speech or Debate Clause in the U.S. Constitution only covers actions and comments made inside Congress, not public statements or social media posts. Finally, Zhao’s legal team claims that Warren sought to portray his pardon as an act of corruption and to attack both Zhao and Trump simultaneously. Goody Guillen said this case should remind politicians that truth matters and they should not use their power to spread misinformation. Warren stands by her comments and attacks Trump’s pardon decision In response to Goody Guillen’s warning, Senator Elizabeth Warren stood by her comments. She said she wasn’t trying to insult or attack CZ, but rather question why President Donald Trump pardoned him. She wanted to know whether personal or political interests backed that decision. According to the Senator, Congress should take action to stop what she described as “this kind of corruption” before lawmakers become part of the problem. Her post garnered millions of reactions, and some people praised her for speaking out against what they saw as another example of Trump misusing his presidential powers to benefit his allies. Others, however, accused her of spreading false information and unfairly damaging Zhao’s reputation. Warren’s post received a community note correction on X. The note made clear that Zhao’s offense was related to weak company compliance, rather than personal involvement in moving or hiding dirty money. This correction led many people to change their views about Warren’s statement on CZ, and they immediately began accusing her of spreading false information. The senator did not comment on the possible lawsuit but said that Zhao “pleaded guilty to violating the law” and that she was “calling him out for what he did.” She was not backing down and saw it as her duty to hold powerful figures accountable in such situations. A larger national debate ensued on social media following Trump’s pardon of Zhao. The president openly criticised digital currencies during his first term. But he has suddenly changed his stance completely and now promotes it publicly. What’s even worse is that his family is largely involved and has even launched a digital asset company called World Liberty Financial. People close to Zhao say that he has no personal or business relationship with Trump or his family, and that Binance has never partnered with World Liberty Financial in any official capacity. According to them, the two are only linked by individual investors who happen to use Trump’s stablecoin to buy or trade assets connected to Binance’s platform. Get seen where it counts.

Sources with knowledge of the situation mentioned that the tech company is testing new versions of each product, featuring OLED screens. They also pointed out that Apple adopted this technology because it provides richer colors and improved contrasts compared to the current LCDs. Notably, OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode. This comes after Apple asked a federal judge to dismiss a racketeering lawsuit filed by a company that accused the iPhone maker of stealing its technology to create the lucrative mobile wallet, Apple Pay. In a Monday night filing in Atlanta federal court, the tech firm noted that if the case is not thrown out, it should be transferred to a Texas judge who recently dismissed Fintiv’s related patent case. Apple examines new upgrades for its products Apple’s recent upgrade plans are expected to be implemented on three devices : the MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Air. Sources close to the situation hinted that the iPad mini will be the first to receive this upgrade, with the launch of an OLED model scheduled for next year. This move is part of a broader shift toward OLED technology, providing customers with a new incentive to upgrade their devices. Following the tech giant’s plan, analysts have predicted that the sales of Mac and iPad products will increase this year. However, data released recently indicates that sales are still lower than those experienced in 2021 and 2022, when the pandemic led to an upswing in computer purchases. Some analysts have also raised concerns that this shift may lead to price increases. According to them, the update for Apple’s devices, such as the iPad mini, may increase its cost by up to $100 due to the more expensive display technology. Despite these concerns raised, Apple is still actively examining new updates for its products. To support this claim, sources indicate that the tech company has been exploring a new water-resistant design for the iPad mini. This feature bears some resemblance to those available on the latest iPhones. Apple has also experimented with a new speaker system that utilizes vibration technology. This change enables the firm to eliminate speaker holes that could allow water to enter. This characteristic distinguishes it from the water-resistant design of the latest iPhones, which have openings but use seals and glue to prevent damage. Meanwhile, the latest update on Apple’s iPad mini was implemented towards the end of 2024. It featured a faster processor and support for its Intelligence platform. Like other tech firms, analysts anticipated that the tech giant might change or postpone these upgrade plans, as they are not yet final. They also highlighted that this trend is commonly practiced during product development, citing Apple’s reported delay in developing the foldable iPad until 2029, as announced last week. Apple intends to switch its devices to feature OLED technology Sources familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous as the information on the upgrade had not yet been made public, mentioned that the next iPad Air, expected in the spring, will still utilize LCD screens. However, they highlighted that Apple is preparing to shift these devices to OLED in a future version. On the other hand, the iPad Pro, which was updated with the M5 chip last week, transitioned to OLED in May 2024. For now, the iPad Air is the last tablet in the lineup to undergo this shift. Currently, Apple has no plans to use OLED on its entry-level iPad. In the meantime, sources have revealed that the upcoming redesign of the MacBook Pro will be the first Mac to feature an OLED screen. Apple has also started early preparations for an OLED version of the MacBook Air, its best-selling laptop. However, this upgrade is unlikely to occur until 2028.

The Dogecoin price briefly traded above $0.21 earlier this week, but has since slipped by more than 2%, highlighting the mounting selling pressure in the market. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Predicts When DOGE Rallies Again According to on-chain data, whales have sold over 500 million DOGE tokens in the past week, fueling fears of further downside. The selloff coincides with a sharp 61% drop in futures open interest, plunging from $5.03 billion to $1.95 billion, signaling widespread position liquidations and trader fatigue. DOGE's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Futures Liquidations and Weak Technicals Weigh on Momentum Derivatives data show declining participation across major exchanges, with traders closing out long positions rather than adding new exposure. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume surged 17.5% to nearly $2 billion, a sign that sellers remain in control even as overall market recovery stalls. Technical indicators paint a similarly cautious picture. On the daily chart, the Dogecoin price is forming a potential “death cross” between the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages, a bearish pattern that often precedes a further drop. If sustained selling continues, analysts warn the Dogecoin price could fall toward the $0.166 support, which aligns with the lower boundary of its long-term ascending trendline. However, this same trendline has historically triggered strong rebounds. Previous retests have led to price recoveries of nearly 100%, leaving some traders optimistic that a similar setup could emerge if support holds firm. Consolidation or Collapse? Key Dogecoin Price Levels to Watch Currently, Dogecoin price hovers near $0.20 with a market cap of $30.3 billion, holding above the critical psychological zone but struggling to regain upward momentum. The immediate resistance lies between $0.204 and $0.210, while a decisive close below $0.19 could accelerate losses toward $0.18–$0.166.

53761326,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87825,1761703234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Aster Rockets Upward and Cardano Shows Stability, but BlockDAG Steals the Spotlight with CertiK and Halborn Verified Audits",https://timestabloid.com/blockdag-steals-the-spotlight-with-certik-and-halborn-verified-audits/,"Recent updates on Aster (ASTR) price trends and Cardano (ADA) support levels reveal a market shaped by both resilience and opportunity. Cardano remains stable near its $0.60 mark, protecting key technical zones, while Aster’s sharp rise and billion-dollar valuation have attracted strong attention despite growing concerns over sustainability. These shifts highlight how stability and momentum each define success in crypto, but they also bring one crucial question to light: how secure are the platforms driving these gains? That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. Is BlockDAG secure? Has it been verified by credible auditors? The answer is clear. BlockDAG has successfully completed independent audits by both CertiK and Halborn, marking a new benchmark for top rated crypto projects focused on transparency and trust. BlockDAG’s Verified Security and Transparency Raise the Bar Blockchain security questions often surface, but BlockDAG delivers tangible proof of trust and dependability. Its complete system architecture has been rigorously examined by not one but two industry-leading security firms, CertiK and Halborn. Receiving high marks from either of these independent audits would be an achievement in itself, but earning approval from both confirms BlockDAG’s exceptional technical standards. This dual certification positions it among the top rated cryptos globally for safety, transparency, and performance. These audits go beyond routine checks; they represent verified readiness for real-world scalability and resilience under market stress. Each review evaluated BlockDAG’s code integrity, smart contract security, and network reliability, ensuring long-term sustainability. The outcome has strengthened user confidence, reinforced community engagement, and attracted institutional attention. Alongside its audit triumph, BlockDAG’s $432M+ presale demonstrates powerful market validation, with 27.1 billion+ coins sold to 312K+ holders across 31 batches. As it approaches its $0.05 mainnet price, the project’s rare combination of certified security and structural transparency cements its status among the top rated cryptos ready for mainstream adoption and sustained growth in the next phase of blockchain evolution. Cardano (ADA) Price Range: Testing Strength Around $0.60 The Cardano (ADA) price levels remain among the most closely followed areas in the crypto market right now. Analysts point to the $0.60–$0.62 zone as an important support line that buyers are actively defending. Staying above this point is vital; a drop below could bring the next support near $0.55, with a deeper risk zone around $0.51. On the flip side, if ADA breaks through resistance between $0.74 and $0.80, experts believe it could set off a new upward move. These technical levels are providing traders with a clear setup, showing where buying and selling pressure are building. Some market watchers note that ADA’s longer trend remains positive as long as it stays firm above its current base. Early consolidation signals are visible on the charts, suggesting this area could turn into a potential launchpad if trading activity rises. The Cardano (ADA) price action reflects a mix of cautious optimism and technical testing, where the coin’s strength will determine if it continues consolidating or moves toward a breakout past $0.80. Aster (ASTR) Performance Review: Balancing Progress with Volatility The Aster (ASTR) performance review shows one of the most remarkable surges in recent weeks. After receiving strong backing from key supporters and completing the APX-to-ASTER token swap, Aster soared over 1,500% within a week, driving its market cap above $2.3 billion. This fast climb was powered by intense trading and fresh listings, but analysts are now monitoring whether Aster can maintain its pace. Resistance areas are expected near $2.40 and $2.75, with crucial support between $1.15 and $1.00. Staying within these ranges will play a big role in deciding if the coin stabilizes or corrects further. Even with its strong rise, the Aster (ASTR) market update points out some risks. Analysts are debating the strength of liquidity, whale movements, and whether trading volumes represent steady demand or speculative behavior. Certain indicators show buying interest, while others suggest that valuations may be stretched if momentum slows. The coming weeks will reveal whether Aster’s growth turns into sustained progress or fades as a brief rally. Regardless, it remains at the core of market discussions about how quickly hype and innovation can influence the crypto landscape. Bottom Line The Cardano (ADA) price holds steady near $0.60, signaling cautious optimism as traders guard key levels and await a possible move above $0.74. Meanwhile, the Aster (ASTR) review shows a dramatic rally that has stirred both enthusiasm and caution, testing the project’s ability to maintain long-term consistency. Together, these cases highlight two distinct growth paths in the market: one grounded in steady development, the other in rapid momentum and speculation. In contrast, BlockDAG takes a security-first approach. Backed by audits from CertiK and Halborn, it has become one of the top rated crypto projects for reliability and technical strength. Having raised over $432 million in presale and sold over 27 billion coins with its batch now at 31, BlockDAG stands out as both scalable and verified, assuring users that its foundation is built on proven security and enterprise-level standards.

53761346,615443,1761703241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53761346.jpeg,Polygon CTO Vs. Zcash: Clash Erupts Over 21 Million Coin Integrity,https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-cto-vs-zcash-clash-21-million-coins/,"An exchange on X between Polygon’s CTO Mudit Gupta and Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox reignited a long-simmering debate over whether privacy-preserving shielded pools can be perfectly audited — and, by extension, whether ZEC’s 21 million cap can be trusted under all conceivable failure modes. The dispute hinged on a familiar fault line in privacy-coin design: zero-knowledge protocols can obfuscate individual balances and flows, but they still must preserve a hard monetary base. Polygon CTO Attacks Zcash Gupta opened with a stark framing: “Nobody knows how many Zcash tokens actually exist. Shielded assets like Zcash are hard to audit. In March 2019, an infinite mint bug was detected in Zcash shielded assets. It was fixed in October 2019 but there is no guaranteed way to tell if the bug was ever exploited.” Nobody knows how many zcash tokens actually exist. Shielded assets like zcash are hard to audit. In March 2019, an infinite mint bug was detected in zcash shielded assets. It was fixed in October 2019 but there is no guaranteed way to tell if the bug was ever exploited. — Mudit Gupta (@Mudit__Gupta) October 26, 2025 He later softened the immediate risk assessment — “Based on heuristic, it’s unlikely the bug was exploited so no reason to panic” — while stressing what he called an enduring category risk: “I’m just highlighting an attack vector with Zcash and similar privacy pools… I’m not claiming any bug was exploited, just mentioning the possibility and risk.” Wilcox pushed back, calling the initial post “not accurate,” and pointed Gupta to “publicly-verifiable on-chain audits” that track the monetary base. “They show the integrity of the Zcash monetary base. A straightforward game-theoretic analysis further shows zero counterfeiting,” he wrote, linking to community dashboards and documentation. In a follow-on, Wilcox encapsulated the ZEC position with a thought experiment about the legacy Sprout pool: “Suppose someone counterfeited ZEC in the Sprout pool before October 28, 2018. Then there is a ‘race to the exits’ between the counterfeiter and his victims. Whoever moves their ZEC out of the Sprout pool first gets to keep all the money. Conclusion: there was no counterfeiting.” He added that “even if there was counterfeiting… there would still be only 16,355,911 ZEC in existence, and still only 21 M ever. Thanks, turnstiles!” Stripped to its essentials, the technical disagreement is less about Zcash’s intended monetary policy and more about the edge-case guarantees when privacy meets auditability. Zcash’s published economics mirror Bitcoin ’s: a fixed 21 million upper bound and a halving-style issuance schedule. That cap is unambiguous in official materials. The Backstory The controversy traces back to the counterfeiting vulnerability affecting ZEC’s earliest shielded pool, Sprout. According to the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and the Zcash Foundation, the flaw was discovered privately in 2018 and publicly disclosed on February 5, 2019; critically, the Sapling upgrade that activated on October 28, 2018 removed the vulnerable construction, and Zcash introduced “turnstile” accounting to constrain exits from shielded pools to, at most, the amount verifiably entered. ECC reported at disclosure that it had seen “no evidence that counterfeiting has occurred,” a stance it has reiterated, and it described turnstile enforcement as a defense to preserve the monetary base even under hypothetical counterfeiting. This is the heart of Wilcox’s argument. Because ZEC can only enter or leave a shielded pool via transfers that reveal values at the boundary, the chain can compute an expected pool balance. If more value tries to exit than has ever entered, the discrepancy becomes observable at the turnstile. The “race to the exits” intuition — while informal — captures the idea that any attacker who minted bogus ZEC inside Sprout would be competing against legitimate holders to withdraw before the turnstile constraint bites; absent an unexplained drain to zero or a negative reconciliation, long-lived counterfeiting is inconsistent with observed pool totals. Zcash’s documentation describes these value-pool turnstiles and their role in monitoring pool integrity, and community discussions dating back years have treated them as the canonical mitigation. Gupta’s rejoinder is about epistemic certainty, not policy intent. “Perhaps I should have been clearer,” he wrote. “Due to [the] possibility of bugs, there’s no guarantee that the shielded pools have the same amount of Zcash circulating inside them as transparent Zcash that went in. Therefore, you can’t be 100% sure of the actual total supply… [though] the likelihood of a bug like this being exploited is essentially 0.” At press time, ZEC traded at $325.",Crypto News|polygon|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BTC|MATIC|MINING|ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-29 02:00:41

A recent survey has unveiled a significant trend: a remarkable 39% of wealthy UAE crypto owners are already holding digital assets. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it signals a profound embrace of the future of finance by the region’s affluent. This insight comes from a survey conducted by Swiss software firm Avaloq , as reported by CoinDesk . The findings highlight not only the growing adoption but also a notable independence from traditional financial services. Among these existing crypto holders, only 20% currently rely on traditional asset managers, suggesting a preference for self-management or specialized crypto advisory services. Why Are Wealthy UAE Crypto Owners Embracing Digital Assets So Rapidly? The UAE is quickly solidifying its position as a global leader in the cryptocurrency space, and there are clear reasons why. The nation, particularly Dubai, has been proactive in developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework. This forward-thinking approach, spearheaded by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( VARA ), provides a secure and legitimate environment for digital asset investments. This regulatory clarity offers a crucial layer of trust and stability, which is highly appealing to affluent investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. The proactive stance of the United Arab Emirates has positioned it as an attractive hub for innovation and investment in the digital asset sector. For wealthy UAE crypto owners , this means a more predictable and secure investment landscape. The Generational Influence: Educating the Elite on Crypto Interestingly, the survey points to a unique dynamic driving this adoption: intergenerational education. It observes a growing trend where the younger members of wealthy families are actively educating their parents’ generation about the opportunities and mechanisms of cryptocurrency investments. This familial transfer of knowledge is accelerating the acceptance and understanding of digital assets among the older, more established investor base. This trend suggests a natural evolution in wealth management, where traditional financial strategies are being complemented by new digital frontiers. For many wealthy UAE crypto owners , the exposure to cryptocurrencies often comes from trusted family members who are already familiar with the technology. This organic adoption pathway builds confidence and encourages exploration into a sector that might otherwise seem complex or intimidating. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Considerations for Wealthy UAE Crypto Owners The journey into digital assets, while promising, also comes with its own set of considerations. While the opportunities for diversification, high growth potential, and access to global markets are compelling, investors must also be mindful of market volatility, security risks, and the continuously evolving regulatory landscape. However, the UAE’s commitment to creating a robust framework helps mitigate some of these concerns. For wealthy UAE crypto owners , the benefits often outweigh the perceived risks, especially with careful planning and informed decisions. Key advantages include: Portfolio Diversification: Adding digital assets can reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Access to Innovation: Investing in groundbreaking technologies and emerging sectors. Potential for High Returns: Cryptocurrencies have historically shown significant growth potential. Global Accessibility: Seamless transactions and investments across borders. The survey, conducted between February and March, gathered insights from 3,851 investors and 456 wealth management professionals, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the sentiment towards digital assets in the region. A Compelling Digital Future for the UAE’s Affluent The findings from the Avaloq survey paint a clear picture: the UAE is not just participating in the global crypto revolution; it’s leading it, particularly among its wealthy populace. The significant percentage of wealthy UAE crypto owners , coupled with a progressive regulatory environment and a unique intergenerational knowledge transfer, positions the Emirates as a true pioneer in the digital asset space. As Dubai continues to innovate and attract global talent, the integration of digital assets into mainstream wealth management is set to become even more pronounced. This trend highlights a forward-thinking approach that prioritizes innovation, security, and financial freedom, promising an exciting and prosperous future for digital asset adoption in the region.

These early adopters, who have held their digital assets for years, sometimes make significant movements that capture the market’s attention. Recently, one such individual executed a transaction that has many investors asking questions about potential market shifts. What’s Behind the Latest Bitcoin OG Deposit to Kraken? A specific address, known for its deep history in the Bitcoin ecosystem, recently deposited an additional 200 BTC, valued at approximately $22.52 million, onto the Kraken exchange. This isn’t an isolated incident; according to Onchain Lens, this particular Bitcoin OG address (beginning with 1E2JG2) has moved a staggering total of 5,803 BTC, worth around $649.6 million, to exchanges over just the past two weeks. Such large transfers from long-dormant wallets to trading platforms are rarely overlooked. They typically suggest an intention to sell. Consequently, this activity from a significant Bitcoin OG often triggers discussions about potential market impacts and investor sentiment. Why Does a Bitcoin OG ‘s Move Spark Market Speculation? When a substantial amount of Bitcoin moves from cold storage to an exchange, it increases the supply available for trading. This dynamic can potentially influence market prices, especially if the selling pressure is significant. Long-term holders, or “whales,” possess enough capital to affect liquidity and price stability with their actions. Consider these key points: Intent to Sell: Deposits to exchanges are almost universally interpreted as preparation for selling. Market Impact: Large sell orders can absorb significant buying demand, potentially leading to price drops. Sentiment Shift: Such moves can also signal a shift in confidence among experienced holders, influencing other investors. The actions of a prominent Bitcoin OG can therefore create ripple effects across the entire crypto landscape, affecting both Bitcoin’s price and broader altcoin markets. Is This a Warning Sign, or Just a Natural Market Cycle for a Bitcoin OG ? Interpreting these large deposits requires a nuanced perspective. While an immediate reaction might be concern, it’s essential to consider various possibilities. This could simply be a strategic profit-taking move after substantial gains over many years. After all, early investors are entitled to realize their profits. However, it could also indicate a lack of conviction in short-to-medium term price appreciation, or even a desire to reallocate capital into other assets. Market observers often scrutinize the timing of such large transactions, looking for patterns or correlations with broader economic indicators or upcoming crypto events. What Should Investors Monitor Following This Bitcoin OG Activity? For those closely watching the market, several factors warrant attention after such a significant move: Exchange Inflows/Outflows: Continue monitoring overall exchange balances to see if selling pressure persists or if the market absorbs these large sales. Price Action: Observe how Bitcoin ‘s price reacts in the immediate aftermath and over the coming days. Look for support and resistance levels. Market Sentiment: Gauge the broader investor mood through social media, news, and sentiment indicators. Understanding the implications of a Bitcoin OG ‘s decisions is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. It serves as a reminder that even the most seasoned holders eventually take profits, influencing market dynamics along the way. Conclusion: The Enduring Influence of the Bitcoin OG The recent substantial deposit of 200 BTC to Kraken by a long-term holder highlights the enduring influence of early adopters on the cryptocurrency market. While such moves often generate apprehension, they are also a natural part of the market cycle as early investors realize their gains. Monitoring these whale activities provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements, underscoring the importance of on-chain analysis in understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin OG Activity Understanding the actions of large Bitcoin holders is key to grasping market movements. Here are some common questions: What is a Bitcoin OG? A Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) refers to an early adopter or investor who acquired a significant amount of Bitcoin in its nascent stages and has held onto it for a very long time, often years. These individuals or entities typically possess large quantities of BTC. Why are deposits to exchanges often seen as bearish? Depositing a large amount of Bitcoin to an exchange like Kraken is usually interpreted as an intent to sell. When a substantial supply becomes available on exchanges, it can increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop if buying demand does not absorb it. How does a single whale’s actions affect the Bitcoin price? While the market is vast, a single “whale” (an entity holding significant crypto) moving hundreds or thousands of Bitcoin can indeed impact price. Their large sell orders can absorb considerable liquidity, causing temporary price volatility or even initiating a downward trend if other investors follow suit due to perceived negative sentiment. What is On-chain analysis? On-chain analysis refers to the process of examining publicly available data on a blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and exchange flows, to gain insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements. Reports from entities like Onchain Lens provide crucial data points for this type of analysis. Learn more about on-chain analysis . Is this the first time this specific Bitcoin OG has moved funds? No, the report indicates that this address (1E2JG2) has deposited a total of 5,803 BTC ($649.6 million) to exchanges over the past two weeks, suggesting a pattern of liquidation rather than a single, isolated event.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-open-interest-just-reset-again-heres-the-significance/,"XRP’s open interest on Binance has fallen sharply, reaching the same level it last saw in May 2025. At that time, the market reset in leverage preceded one of XRP’s strongest rallies of the year, when the asset climbed to over $3.5. While the recent chart shared by crypto commentator CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) highlights this renewed decline in open interest, XRP’s price remains relatively elevated at around $2.6 following a notable recovery where it outperformed the top 10 cryptocurrencies . In the post, CryptosRus noted that the current market environment shows “leverage is gone, yet strong hands are still holding,” suggesting that the absence of leveraged positions could make way for more stable accumulation by investors . XRP OPEN INTEREST JUST RESET, AGAIN #XRP ’s open interest on Binance has dropped back to the same lows we saw in May 2025. Back then, that flush kicked off a massive move from $0.70 to $3.50. This time, OI is at the floor again but price is still holding around $2.6+. That means… pic.twitter.com/iaWooa5JRV — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) October 26, 2025 Low Leverage Signals Market Reset The CryptoQuant chart indicates that open interest has returned to its floor near $550 million, matching the trough from earlier in the year. However, unlike the May decline, XRP’s price has remained much higher this time, holding above $2.50. This divergence between price and leverage suggests that speculative positions have been flushed out, but spot demand has sustained market strength . Historically, a drop in open interest reflects reduced leverage and a clearing of overextended positions. When accompanied by stable or rising prices, it often points to accumulation by long-term holders rather than short-term traders. That combination can create a foundation for renewed upward momentum once liquidity returns to the market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Constructive Setup for XRP According to the analysis shared, the current structure may favor XRP if new capital flows into the market. CryptosRus explained that “if new liquidity comes in, this setup could easily flip into the next leg up,” pointing to the conditions that typically precede bullish moves, including low leverage, strong spot demand, and short sellers caught in unfavorable positions. The pattern aligns with the behavior observed earlier in the year, when a similar reset in open interest set the stage for an extended advance. At that time, once traders re-entered the market and open interest began to climb again, XRP’s price responded with significant strength. While no outcome is guaranteed, the data suggest that XRP’s current position may be constructive. Open interest levels near historical lows combined with a resilient spot price create conditions that could support a continuation of the longer-term uptrend if buying pressure intensifies.

With momentum building, traders now wonder, will one final dip come before the next major breakout? XRP Faces A Crucial Decision Zone Amid Ongoing Range CasiTrades, in a recent market update, highlighted that XRP continues to range within a critical zone, keeping its setup for a potential final wave down valid. The analyst noted that the price remains at a key decision point, with ongoing tests of the Wave 4 highs acting as a firm ceiling against further upside movement. Related Reading: Boom Incoming? XRP’s Market Setup Looks ‘Explosive,’ Analyst Says According to CasiTrades, the pivotal level to watch is $2.82 on Binance. A confirmed breakout and sustained hold above this resistance would invalidate the bearish setup and signal renewed bullish momentum. However, XRP has so far failed to push through, maintaining a range-bound structure between support and resistance, a sign that the market has yet to commit to a clear directional trend. The analyst emphasized that a V-shaped recovery typically breaks through resistance with strong conviction, but such a move has not been seen here. Instead, XRP’s hesitancy indicates that selling pressure may still be present, preventing a clean continuation to the upside. Exchange Variations Add Complexity To Market Analysis CasiTrades went on to explain that most major exchanges are now aligning around their key Fibonacci retracement levels, particularly the 0.618 zone. On Binance, this range sits between $1.35 and $1.46, which the analyst identified as the area where the next corrective wave could complete. According to the expert, this move would finalize the macro Wave 2 correction, paving the way for a powerful Wave 3 impulse that might propel XRP toward $6.50 or even $10. Related Reading: XRP Sparks Bullish Frenzy As Top Software Dev Says It Beats ETF Hype The analyst emphasized that these lower price levels shouldn’t be viewed as a cause for concern but rather as valuable accumulation opportunities for long-term investors. Historically, zones like these have marked points of strong institutional buying and major trend reversals, presenting some of the best risk-to-reward setups before a large bullish expansion. CasiTrades also noted that exchange discrepancies add a layer of complexity to the analysis. For instance, during a recent liquidation event, Binance briefly fell to $0.77, while Coinbase never reached its .618 retracement. This variation means traders should always chart on the specific exchange they plan to execute trades on, as price reactions can differ slightly between platforms. In conclusion, the analyst noted that until XRP breaks and holds above $2.82, the market structure still supports the idea of one final downward wave before a major upward cycle begins.

Industry insiders confirm that fund issuers have filed the requisite documents and received listing notices, paving the way for a landmark expansion of crypto products into the traditional finance sphere. Altcoin ETF wave surges ahead The stalwart asset managers behind this push, Bitwise Asset Management, Canary Capital, and Grayscale Investments, have signalled that their funds will launch this week. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, exchange listing notices have been posted for Bitwise’s Solana ETF and Canary’s Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, with launches slated for Tuesday. Grayscale’s Solana fund conversion is expected on Wednesday. What’s key is how this is happening despite the U.S. government shutdown. Issuers are relying on regulatory mechanisms, notably Form 8-A filings and amended S-1 registration statements allowing automatic effectiveness after 20 days, to go live without requiring the SEC’s manual sign-off. This regulatory workaround, combined with the generic listing standards approved in September, has created a rare window for altcoin ETFs to break into the market. What the new ETFs mean for crypto markets For Solana , this ETF launch could prove transformative. As the sixth-largest blockchain by market cap, Solana already draws institutional interest for its high-speed ecosystem. The proposed product from Bitwise (ticker: BSOL) reportedly includes staking features, offering long-term holders a compelling “own crypto via a regulated fund” route. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Hedera , though smaller in market cap, gain legitimacy through this ETF channel. Canary Capital’s CEO confirmed the spot LTC and HBAR funds will trade on the Nasdaq starting Tuesday under the tickers “LTCC” and “HBR”. Institutional access is widening. Investors who previously needed to hold crypto wallets and navigate exchange custody can now access regulated funds via brokerage accounts. The market views this as a major step in bridging DeFi/crypto assets with mainstream finance. Bottom Line That said, timing matters. The surrounding conditions, regulatory innovation, shutdown-driven inertia at the SEC, and investor appetite for fresh crypto exposure, have aligned uniquely. Market watchers caution that while the launches are historic, they are not without risk, token prices, liquidity flows, and investor behaviour around product debut remain uncertain. In sum, the crypto industry stands at a tipping point. With Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera gaining regulated ETF wrappers, the era of altcoin funds may be officially underway, despite Washington being partially shut down. The countdown is on.

This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s the bold prediction for MicroStrategy , thanks to its pioneering MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. Joe Burnett, a Bitcoin strategist at Semler Scientific , recently sparked a conversation on X, suggesting that if Bitcoin’s true value as collateral is recognized, MicroStrategy’s financial standing could transform dramatically. This perspective challenges conventional wisdom, highlighting a pivotal shift in how corporate assets are perceived. Unlocking the Power of MicroStrategy Bitcoin as Premier Collateral Burnett’s compelling argument centers on Bitcoin’s unique attributes as collateral, asserting its superiority in the modern financial system. He explains that the full integration of BTC into traditional credit mechanisms is still in its nascent stages. However, MicroStrategy has already amassed a colossal asset base: approximately $72 billion worth of BTC. This isn’t merely a speculative holding; it’s a globally traded, highly liquid resource that boasts several critical advantages: Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be accessed and transferred across borders without intermediaries. Rapid Settlement: Transactions can be settled in minutes, a significant improvement over traditional banking systems. No Counterparty Risk: As a decentralized asset, Bitcoin eliminates the risks associated with third-party intermediaries. These characteristics collectively position MicroStrategy Bitcoin as an unparalleled form of collateral, offering a level of security and efficiency rarely seen with conventional assets. Furthermore, MicroStrategy’s financial structure includes $8 billion in long-term convertible bonds and $7 billion in preferred stock, all underpinned by this substantial Bitcoin treasury. Why Are Traditional Credit Agencies Overlooking MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Advantage? Despite its immense digital asset holdings, MicroStrategy currently holds a B- speculative-grade rating from S&P Global Ratings . Intriguingly, this is the same rating assigned to an airline like JetBlue , a company that typically generates minimal free cash flow. Burnett critically observes that traditional credit rating agencies have not yet adapted their methodologies to fully account for this fundamental shift in corporate treasury management. They are, in essence, evaluating MicroStrategy through an outdated lens, failing to acknowledge the immense value, liquidity, and stability provided by its MicroStrategy Bitcoin treasury. This discrepancy highlights a significant lag in how established financial institutions perceive and integrate innovative asset classes. A re-evaluation is not just likely, but inevitable, once Bitcoin’s role as superior collateral is fully understood and accepted across the financial industry. The Broader Impact: Bitcoin’s Role in Modern Corporate Finance The scenario unfolding with MicroStrategy offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolving landscape of corporate finance. As more institutions and treasuries recognize Bitcoin’s robust qualities – its decentralization, immutability, scarcity, and transparent ledger – its role as a strategic treasury asset is poised for significant expansion. Companies that proactively incorporate substantial Bitcoin reserves into their balance sheets could see a fundamental re-assessment of their risk profiles, potentially leading to more favorable borrowing terms, enhanced liquidity, and overall greater financial stability. This evolving understanding of digital assets is not merely a niche trend; it’s a crucial development for the entire financial sector, paving the way for a more integrated, resilient, and efficient global credit system. The innovative MicroStrategy Bitcoin approach serves as a powerful testament to this ongoing paradigm shift, prompting crucial discussions about the future of corporate treasury. What Does MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy Mean for Investors and Businesses? For investors, businesses, and financial analysts alike, MicroStrategy’s bold move provides a compelling and insightful case study. It demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to treasury management, strategically leveraging a non-sovereign, censorship-resistant asset to bolster corporate strength. Here are some key takeaways: For Businesses: It encourages exploring the long-term benefits of diversifying treasury reserves with digital assets, considering their potential for inflation hedging and global liquidity. For Investors: It prompts a critical examination of how traditional financial metrics and credit ratings are adapting (or, in some cases, failing to adapt) to the rapid advancements in the digital asset space. For the Market: This narrative powerfully underscores the ongoing maturation of Bitcoin as a legitimate and significant financial instrument, moving beyond its early days as a speculative asset to a foundational element of corporate and institutional finance. MicroStrategy’s journey, led by its visionary CEO Michael Saylor , clearly illustrates the need for continuous education, flexibility, and adaptation within financial analysis and corporate strategy. Embracing these new paradigms is essential for navigating the complexities of the 21st-century economy. A Vision of Future Financial Safety with MicroStrategy Bitcoin Joe Burnett’s insightful analysis paints a vivid picture of a future where MicroStrategy, through its strategic MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings, could genuinely redefine corporate safety and financial resilience. While traditional credit systems are undeniably catching up, the inherent strengths of Bitcoin—global liquidity, rapid settlement, and zero counterparty risk—position MicroStrategy uniquely as a pioneer. This isn’t merely about one company’s balance sheet; it’s about the broader financial world acknowledging and integrating the transformative power of digital assets. This integration promises a more secure, efficient, and forward-looking financial landscape for all participants, with MicroStrategy leading the charge in demonstrating Bitcoin’s profound value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is MicroStrategy’s core business? MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is primarily a business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services company. However, it has gained significant prominence for its corporate strategy of acquiring and holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Q2: Why does MicroStrategy hold so much Bitcoin? MicroStrategy began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 as a hedge against inflation and as a strategic asset it believes will appreciate over time. Led by CEO Michael Saylor , the company views Bitcoin as a superior form of money and a robust long-term store of value, making it a central component of their corporate treasury strategy. Q3: Who is Joe Burnett and Semler Scientific? Joe Burnett is a Bitcoin strategist at Semler Scientific , a medical device company that has also adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, following MicroStrategy’s lead. Burnett is known for his insights into Bitcoin’s financial properties and its potential impact on corporate finance. Q4: How does Bitcoin act as “collateral” in this context? Bitcoin acts as collateral due to its inherent properties: it’s globally liquid, can be settled quickly, and carries no counterparty risk because it’s a decentralized asset. This makes it a highly desirable asset that can be pledged against loans or used to secure other financial instruments, potentially improving a company’s creditworthiness as its value becomes more widely recognized by traditional finance. Q5: Will MicroStrategy’s credit rating change soon? According to Joe Burnett , a re-evaluation of MicroStrategy’s credit rating is anticipated once traditional credit agencies, such as S&P Global Ratings , fully acknowledge and integrate Bitcoin’s value as superior collateral into their assessment models. While the exact timing is uncertain, the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin suggests that such a shift is likely in the future.

SoFi to Launch Bitcoin and Crypto Trading After Record $950M Q3 Revenue SoFi Technologies announced plans to begin Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading by the end of 2025, following record-breaking Q3 results. The fintech giant reported a 38% year-over-year revenue surge to $950 million and earnings of $0.11 per share, surpassing analyst expectations.

The company, once focused on student loans, now operates as a full financial ecosystem and plans to expand blockchain-based international transfers for faster, cheaper payments. SoFi’s move into crypto marks another step toward mainstream financial adoption, reinforcing market optimism and helping lift Bitcoin prices slightly today. Central Banks Turn to Tokenization as Gold Slips Below $4K BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said central banks are increasingly exploring tokenization and digital assets as gold prices dip below $4,000. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, Fink noted that central banks face growing pressure to digitize their currencies and adapt to a tokenized global economy. BlackRock CEO: “Crypto and gold aren’t for profit, they’re protection.” He says investors hold these assets not out of greed but out of fear to guard against currency dilution and global instability. #BlackRock #Crypto #Gold #Finance #Markets pic.twitter.com/FBo3Yi1CJu — Cyrus (@Cyrus_In_The_X) October 28, 2025 He described gold and cryptocurrencies as “assets of fear,” used by investors to hedge against traditional market risks. Despite continued record gold purchases by central banks, the metal’s recent decline has raised concerns about overreliance on the dollar. Following Fink’s remarks, Bitcoin briefly surged past $115,500 as traders interpreted his endorsement of tokenization and recognition of crypto’s expanding role as bullish for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Pulls Back to $112K but Bulls Still Target $124K Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading near $112,400 after retreating from the $117,600 double-top resistance, where buyers failed to sustain momentum. The daily chart shows BTC forming lower highs within a short-term descending channel, signaling a cooling phase after last week’s rally. The 20-day EMA has flattened near $114,900, acting as dynamic resistance, while the 50-day EMA at $112,300 is being tested as near-term support. Candlestick formations reveal indecision, spinning tops and small-bodied candles, suggesting a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The RSI hovers around 49, reflecting neutral momentum but warning of potential downside if it slips below 45. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A break beneath $112,200 could expose the $108,600 zone, where prior demand supported a rebound earlier this month. Conversely, reclaiming $114,900 would shift bias back toward the $117,600 neckline, opening the path toward $120,500 and the $124,100 Fibonacci extension target. For traders, a clean breakout above $117,600 signals renewed bullish momentum, while holding above $108,600 keeps the broader uptrend intact. With sentiment stabilizing and macro optimism building, Bitcoin’s path toward $130,000 remains a plausible medium-term scenario as global liquidity and institutional demand expand. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong.

The exchange will proceed with the Binance delisting of three prominent altcoins: Flamie (FLM), Kadena (KDA), and Perpetual Protocol (PERP). This decision is set to take effect at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 12. For many traders and investors, such news can be unsettling, raising immediate questions about portfolio adjustments and market stability. Understanding the implications of this Binance delisting is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. What Does a Binance Delisting Mean for Your Investments? A delisting event, especially from a major platform like Binance, carries substantial weight. Essentially, it means that the affected cryptocurrencies will no longer be available for trading on the exchange. This move can trigger a range of reactions across the market, impacting liquidity, price, and overall investor sentiment for the delisted assets. When an exchange announces a delisting, it typically provides a timeline for users to take action. For FLM, KDA, and PERP holders on Binance, this period is critical. Here’s what usually happens: Cessation of Trading: All trading pairs involving FLM, KDA, and PERP will be removed. This includes spot, margin, and futures trading, depending on what was offered. Withdrawal Period: Users are generally given a window to withdraw their delisted tokens to other wallets or exchanges that still support them. It’s vital to act within this timeframe. Price Volatility: Often, delisting announcements lead to increased selling pressure, causing the price of the affected assets to drop sharply due to reduced demand and market access. This Binance delisting highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the importance of staying informed about exchange policies. Why Does Binance Delist Cryptocurrencies? Exchanges like Binance do not take delisting decisions lightly. These actions are usually the result of a comprehensive review process. Binance, like many other reputable exchanges, regularly assesses listed assets to ensure they meet specific standards. These standards often include: Project Quality and Commitment: Is the development team active? Is the project roadmap being followed? Network Stability and Security: Are there any vulnerabilities or consistent network issues? Trading Volume and Liquidity: Does the asset maintain sufficient trading volume to ensure fair price discovery and prevent market manipulation? Regulatory Compliance: Does the asset comply with evolving regulatory frameworks in various jurisdictions? User Feedback: Input from the community can also play a role in these decisions. While Binance has not provided specific reasons for the FLM, KDA, and PERP delisting in this particular announcement, such factors are typically at play. The goal is to protect users and maintain a healthy, vibrant trading environment on the platform. Therefore, this decision reflects Binance’s commitment to upholding its listing criteria. Navigating the Binance Delisting: Your Action Plan For individuals holding FLM, KDA, or PERP on Binance, proactive steps are essential. Ignoring the announcement could lead to difficulties in accessing or liquidating your assets after the deadline. Here’s an actionable guide: Assess Your Holdings: Identify the exact amount of FLM, KDA, and PERP you hold on Binance. Research Alternatives: Look for other reputable exchanges or decentralized platforms that still list these tokens. Verify their security and withdrawal fees. Plan Your Transfer: Decide whether to sell your tokens before the deadline or withdraw them to another platform. Consider the current market price and potential transaction costs. Execute Withdrawals: If you choose to withdraw, do so well before the November 12 deadline. Ensure you have the correct wallet addresses for the receiving platform or personal wallet. Double-check all details to avoid irreversible losses. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring official Binance announcements and the news surrounding FLM, KDA, and PERP for any further updates. Remember, timely action can mitigate potential losses and help you manage your portfolio effectively in light of this significant Binance delisting . Conclusion: Adapting to Market Changes The upcoming Binance delisting of FLM, KDA, and PERP serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be challenging for investors, they also underscore the importance of due diligence, diversification, and staying updated with exchange policies. By understanding the reasons behind delistings and taking swift, informed action, traders can better navigate these changes and protect their investments. Always prioritize security and verify information from official sources. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Binance Delisting Q1: What exactly is a crypto delisting?

Over the past 24 hours, a staggering event unfolded, highlighting the inherent volatility and risk. We witnessed massive crypto liquidations topping an incredible $330 million across various digital assets, predominantly impacting long positions. This significant market movement has left many investors pondering the underlying mechanisms and potential future implications. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? At its core, a crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when the market moves against a trader’s bet, and their margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. Essentially, the trader’s collateral is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Most liquidations happen in perpetual futures markets, where traders use leverage to amplify their potential gains. While leverage can boost profits, it also magnifies losses, making traders vulnerable to sudden price swings. When the price hits a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses to the exchange itself. The Astonishing $330 Million Crypto Liquidations Breakdown The recent market turbulence led to a dramatic wave of forced closures. In just 24 hours, the total value of crypto liquidations surged past $330 million. Let’s break down where these significant losses occurred: Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $114 million in liquidations. A substantial 64.89% of these were long positions, indicating a bullish bias among traders that was swiftly punished. Ethereum (ETH): Experienced even higher figures, with $158 million in liquidations. An overwhelming 71.73% of these were long positions, showcasing intense optimism that quickly unwound. Solana (SOL): Faced $58.76 million in liquidations. Here too, long positions dominated, accounting for 69.18% of the total, reflecting a similar trend of over-leveraged bullish bets. These figures underscore the rapid and often unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in volatile markets. The dominance of long positions being liquidated paints a clear picture of market sentiment preceding the downturn. Why Did Long Positions Bear the Brunt of These Crypto Liquidations? The fact that long positions accounted for such a large percentage of the recent crypto liquidations isn’t a coincidence. Long positions are essentially bets that the price of an asset will increase. Traders open long positions when they are bullish on the market’s direction, often using leverage to maximize their potential returns from even small price movements. However, if the market suddenly reverses and prices drop, these leveraged long positions quickly become unprofitable. As the price falls, the value of their collateral decreases, eventually triggering a margin call or an automatic liquidation. This cascading effect can exacerbate market downturns, as forced selling adds further downward pressure on prices. What’s the Wider Impact of Such Significant Crypto Liquidations? Beyond the individual traders who faced losses, a wave of crypto liquidations of this magnitude has broader implications for the entire market. Firstly, it can signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to increased fear and uncertainty among investors. Large liquidation events often precede or accompany significant price corrections. Moreover, these events can highlight periods of excessive speculation and over-leveraging within the market. While a healthy amount of trading activity is vital, widespread leveraged positions can create systemic risks. The forced closure of positions can create a domino effect, leading to further price declines and more liquidations across the board. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Your Guide to Avoiding Crypto Liquidations For both new and experienced traders, understanding and mitigating the risks associated with crypto liquidations is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Practice Prudent Risk Management: Avoid over-leveraging. Using high leverage ratios can quickly deplete your capital in volatile markets. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you to a predetermined level. This limits potential losses and prevents liquidation. Understand Market Conditions: Pay close attention to market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. High volatility periods require extra caution. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into a single leveraged trade. Diversification can help spread risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news and technical analysis to make informed trading decisions. By adopting these strategies, traders can better protect their capital and navigate the often-unpredictable world of cryptocurrency trading. A Call for Caution in a Dynamic Market The recent episode of crypto liquidations , totaling over $330 million, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in the highly dynamic cryptocurrency market. The dominance of long positions among those liquidated underscores the dangers of excessive leverage and bullish speculation in the face of unexpected market shifts. While the crypto market offers exciting opportunities, it demands respect for its volatility and a disciplined approach to risk. Understanding the mechanics of liquidations and implementing robust risk management strategies are not just good practices; they are essential for long-term survival and success in this thrilling digital frontier. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations What causes crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations are primarily caused by leveraged positions moving against the trader’s bet. When the market price of an asset falls below a certain threshold (the liquidation price) for a long position, or rises above it for a short position, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. What are long positions in cryptocurrency trading? A long position in cryptocurrency trading is a bet that the price of a particular digital asset, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum , will increase over time. Traders ‘go long’ when they are bullish on an asset, hoping to buy low and sell high. When these positions are leveraged, small price drops can lead to significant losses and potential liquidation. How can traders protect themselves from crypto liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by employing several risk management strategies. These include avoiding excessive leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying their portfolio, and staying informed about market conditions and potential volatility. Understanding your liquidation price is also key. Which cryptocurrencies were most affected by the recent liquidation event? The recent event saw Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Solana (SOL) as the most affected cryptocurrencies, experiencing the largest volumes of crypto liquidations . Long positions dominated the forced closures across all three, indicating a significant bearish turn that caught many bullish traders off guard.

Announced during the company’s third-quarter earnings call, the initiative will include the creation of a US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) and a new infrastructure called the Digital Asset Network. Both will be developed in collaboration with Anchorage Digital Bank. Stablecoin Launch Expected in 2026 According to the company, USDPT will go live in the first half of 2026. Customers will be able to access the stablecoin through partner exchanges, similar to how PayPal’s PYUSD is listed on Binance and other platforms. Western Union said the Digital Asset Network will also operate as a global off-ramp for its 150 million customers across 200 countries and territories. Speaking at the Money 20/20 USA conference in Las Vegas, CEO Devin McGranahan explained why Solana was chosen for the project. He said his team had evaluated numerous alternatives before concluding that Solana was the “right choice” to build an institutional-grade platform. Traditional Finance Moves Deeper into Crypto Western Union joins a growing number of traditional payment firms exploring blockchain for remittances. Supporters argue that blockchain technology allows faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions compared to conventional payment systems. In recent months, other financial giants have made similar announcements. Zelle’s parent company revealed plans to introduce stablecoins for international payments, while MoneyGram rolled out a USDC wallet for customers in Colombia through its crypto app. Regulatory Clarity Accelerates Adoption The stablecoin industry’s momentum in the US has been fueled by clearer regulations following the passage of the GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. McGranahan said the company had previously avoided entering the crypto market due to concerns over volatility and regulatory uncertainty but that the new legislation has opened the door for participation. According to the US Treasury Department, the stablecoin market was valued at $311.5 billion in April and could reach $2 trillion by 2028. Western Union’s move comes roughly three months after it first hinted at stablecoin integration earlier this year, marking a major shift in the remittance leader’s digital strategy.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-29 03:43:54

Grayscale’s ETHE experienced a net outflow of $2.66 million. This might indicate that some investors are shifting capital from older, perhaps less efficient, Grayscale products to newer spot ETH ETFs, which often offer better fee structures or direct exposure without the previous trust structure limitations.

Recently, the Bank of Korea (BOK) Governor, Lee Chang-yong , voiced a serious concern regarding the potential for foreign exchange market volatility and capital flight if a won stablecoin is launched without proper safeguards. Why the Alarm? Understanding the Won Stablecoin Concern Governor Lee’s apprehension stems from the belief that a freely accessible won stablecoin could easily be taken overseas by individuals. This outflow of capital could destabilize South Korea’s foreign exchange markets, impacting the national economy. Speaking at a parliamentary audit of the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee , Lee emphasized the critical need for a controlled approach. His comments, reported by Yonhap News , highlight a cautious stance on integrating digital currencies into the existing financial system. Capital Flight Risk: A major concern is that a won stablecoin , designed to maintain a stable value against the Korean Won, could become an easy vehicle for money to leave the country. Market Volatility: Uncontrolled capital outflows can lead to sudden fluctuations in the exchange rate, making it harder for businesses to plan and impacting the cost of imports and exports. Financial Stability: The central bank’s primary role is to maintain financial stability. Any development that threatens this, like a poorly managed stablecoin rollout, demands careful consideration. A Cautious Path: The Phased Rollout Strategy for Won Stablecoin Instead of an immediate, wide-scale launch, Governor Lee advocates for a strategic, phased rollout. This approach prioritizes stability and control over rapid adoption. He suggested starting with a bank-centered system. Under this model, commercial banks would play a central role in issuing and managing the won stablecoin , acting as intermediaries between the central bank and users. This initial phase would allow authorities to closely monitor and manage foreign exchange outflows. If this controlled environment proves effective, the program could then be expanded, gradually integrating the digital currency into broader economic activities. What are the benefits of a bank-centered approach? Enhanced Control: Banks already have robust systems for managing currency flows and complying with regulations, making them ideal for overseeing a new digital asset. Risk Mitigation: By limiting initial exposure, the central bank can identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they become systemic problems. Gradual Adaptation: It allows both financial institutions and the public to adapt to the new technology at a manageable pace, fostering trust and understanding. Safeguarding South Korea’s Financial Future The BOK’s stance reflects a global trend among central banks: embracing innovation while prioritizing financial stability. The potential benefits of digital currencies, such as faster and cheaper transactions, are acknowledged, but not at the expense of economic security. The conversation around a won stablecoin is part of a larger global dialogue on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privately issued stablecoins. Many nations are exploring similar concepts, but concerns about regulatory frameworks, privacy, and economic impact remain paramount. South Korea, with its advanced technological infrastructure and robust financial markets, is uniquely positioned to lead in this space. However, careful planning, as advocated by Governor Lee, is essential to ensure that any new digital currency serves to strengthen, rather than jeopardize, the nation’s economic foundation. Navigating the Future of Digital Currency with a Won Stablecoin The path forward for a won stablecoin is complex, balancing innovation with prudence. The Bank of Korea’s cautious approach aims to harness the advantages of digital currency while effectively mitigating risks like capital flight and market volatility. A phased rollout, beginning with a bank-centered system, appears to be the most sensible strategy. This measured introduction could pave the way for a secure and stable digital won, benefiting South Korea’s economy in the long run. Ultimately, the success of a won stablecoin will depend on meticulous planning, robust regulatory frameworks, and a clear understanding of its potential impact on the broader financial ecosystem. Governor Lee’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that while innovation is exciting, stability must always remain the cornerstone of financial policy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won stablecoin? A won stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to the Korean Won. Its purpose is to offer the benefits of digital currency (like fast transactions) without the price volatility often seen in other cryptocurrencies. Q2: Why is the Bank of Korea concerned about capital flight? Bank of Korea Governor Lee Chang-yong is concerned that if a won stablecoin is introduced without proper controls, it could easily be moved overseas, leading to significant outflows of capital. This could destabilize South Korea’s foreign exchange market and impact its financial stability. Q3: What does a “phased rollout” mean for the won stablecoin? A phased rollout, as suggested by Governor Lee, means introducing the won stablecoin gradually. It would likely start with a limited, controlled system, possibly centered around commercial banks, to test its functionality and manage potential risks like capital flight before expanding its availability to a wider public. Q4: How does a bank-centered system help control foreign exchange outflows? In a bank-centered system, commercial banks would act as key intermediaries, managing the issuance and redemption of the won stablecoin . This structure allows existing banking regulations and oversight mechanisms to be applied, making it easier to monitor and control the movement of funds, including potential foreign exchange outflows. Q5: What is the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee’s role in this discussion? The National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee is a parliamentary body responsible for overseeing South Korea’s economic and financial policies. Governor Lee’s comments were made during an audit, indicating that the committee plays a crucial role in scrutinizing and guiding the nation’s financial strategies, including those related to digital currencies. We hope this article has provided valuable insights into the ongoing discussions surrounding the won stablecoin and its implications for South Korea’s financial landscape.

The asset’s slow, but steady recovery signals that the market is stabilizing. This leaves analysts guessing which catalyst could drive the next rally. In the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report , market experts predicted that changes in the macroeconomic landscape could drive liquidity to bitcoin. Volatility in traditional asset classes, such as oil and fiat currencies, could help stabilize the crypto market and drive positive price movement in the coming weeks. Crypto Market Stabilizes According to Bitfinex, BTC spent last week trading below the short-term holders’ (STH) cost basis of $113,600, which hovers around the 0.85 quantile level. That dynamic indicated signs of market fatigue and fading momentum. However, the market turned for the better over the weekend as U.S.-China tariff discussions progressed and BTC reclaimed those resistance levels. Nonetheless, the STH cost basis remains crucial for BTC to sustain a bullish trajectory. BTC needs to stay above $113,600 to establish a shift in market structure from defensive to constructive. While market participants hope BTC makes a positive turn from this crucial level, historical patterns suggest there may be more bloodshed on the way. Persistent weakness below the STH cost basis has indicated structural weakness in the past and often preceded deeper corrections toward the 0.75 quantile, now located around $97,500. Currently, BTC hovers above $114,400; however, a drop below $113,600 could trigger a decline to $97,500. This level could serve as the low of this consolidation phase. Analysts say a move toward this lower boundary will be consistent with prior cycle patterns. The silver lining is that such a move will mark the exhaustion of selling pressure, providing the foundation for the next uptrend. Volatile Macro Landscape As the market prepares for its next move, changes in energy prices and foreign exchange markets are affecting global liquidity flows. Fortunately, cryptocurrencies appear to be absorbing some of the capital rotation. There is a surge in oil prices, and currencies like the Japanese yen have weakened. These developments, coupled with geopolitical tensions, have prompted investors to reassess their exposures to risk assets. Institutional traders are now evaluating their investments in bonds and equities and are likely leaning toward cryptocurrencies.

ETHZilla Dumps ETH For BuyBacks The company framed the buybacks as balance-sheet arbitrage rather than a strategic retreat from its core Ethereum exposure. “We are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, including reducing our ETH holdings, to execute share repurchases,” chairman and CEO McAndrew Rudisill said, adding that ETH sales are being used as “cash” while common shares trade below net asset value. He argued the transactions would be immediately accretive to remaining shareholders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Shows The Possibility Of The Ethereum Price Reaching $16,000 ETHZilla amplified the message on X, saying it would “use its strong balance sheet to support shareholders through buybacks, reduce shares available for short borrow, [and] drive up NAV per share” and reiterating that it still holds “~$400 million of ETH” on the balance sheet and carries “no net debt.” The company also cited “recent, concentrated short selling” as a factor keeping the stock under pressure. The market-structure logic is straightforward: when a digital-asset treasury trades below the value of its coin holdings and cash, buying back stock with “coin-cash” can, in theory, collapse the discount and lift NAV per share. But the optics are contentious inside crypto because the mechanism requires selling the underlying asset—here, ETH—to purchase equity, potentially weakening the very treasury backing that investors originally sought. Death Spiral Incoming? Popular crypto trader SalsaTekila (@SalsaTekila) commented on X: “This is extremely bearish, especially if it invites similar behavior. ETH treasuries are not Saylor; they haven’t shown diamond-hand will. If treasury companies start dumping the coin to buy shares, it’s a death spiral setup.” Skeptics also zeroed in on funding choices. “I am mostly curious why the company chose to sell ETH and not use the $569m in cash they had on the balance sheet last month,” another analyst Dan Smith wrote, noting ETHZilla had just said it still holds about $400 million of ETH and thus didn’t deploy it on fresh ETH accumulation. “Why not just use cash?” The question cuts to the core of treasury signaling: using ETH as a liquidity reservoir to defend a discounted equity can be read as rational capital allocation, or as capitulation that undermines the ETH-as-reserve narrative. Beyond the buyback, a retail-driven storyline has rapidly formed around the stock. Business Insider reported that Dimitri Semenikhin—who recently became the face of the Beyond Meat surge—has targeted ETHZilla, saying he purchased roughly 2% of the company at what he views as a 50% discount to modified NAV. He has argued that the market is misreading ETHZilla’s balance sheet because it still reflects legacy biotech results rather than the current digital-asset treasury model. Related Reading: Ethereum Emerges As The Sole Trillion-Dollar Institutional Store Of Value — Here’s Why The same report cites liquid holdings on the order of 102,300 ETH and roughly $560 million in cash, translating to about $62 per share in liquid assets, and calls out a 1-for-10 reverse split on October 15 that, in his view, muddied the optics for retail. Semenikhin flagged November 13 as a potential catalyst if results show the pivot to ETH generating profits. The company’s own messaging emphasizes the discount-to-NAV lens rather than a change in strategy. ETHZilla told investors it would keep buying while the stock trades below asset value and highlighted a goal of shrinking lendable supply to blunt short-selling pressure. For Ethereum markets, the immediate flow effect is limited—$40 million is marginal in ETH’s daily liquidity—but the second-order risk flagged by traders is behavioral contagion. If other ETH-heavy treasuries follow the playbook, selling the underlying to buy their own stock, the flow could become pro-cyclical: coins are sold to close equity discounts, the selling pressures spot, and wider discounts reappear as equity screens rerate to the weaker mark—repeat. That is the “death spiral” scenario skeptics warn about when the treasury asset doubles as the company’s signal of conviction. At press time, ETH traded at $4,156.

This coming week, a confluence of major central bank decisions, particularly from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ), is poised to send ripples across global currency valuations. These shifts can directly influence investor sentiment, liquidity, and ultimately, the trajectory of your crypto portfolio. So, buckle up, as we delve into the crucial dynamics shaping Asia FX and the mighty US Dollar . How Global Forex Decisions Echo in Your Crypto Wallet The financial world is bracing for a week packed with high-stakes announcements that could redefine global currency trends. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding these macro shifts isn’t just academic; it’s essential for strategic positioning. When major currencies experience significant volatility, it often triggers a flight to safety or risk-on appetite, both of which have profound implications for digital assets. A stronger US Dollar , for instance, can sometimes exert downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as it makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive and reduces the purchasing power for international investors. Conversely, a weakening dollar could signal a broader risk-on environment, potentially benefiting crypto. This week’s focus will be on two titans of monetary policy: the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Their impending decisions on interest rates and monetary policy are expected to dictate the immediate direction of the dollar and key Asian currencies, setting the stage for global market sentiment. Asia FX : Is Regional Stability Under Threat or Poised for Growth? The currencies of Asia have shown a mixed bag of resilience and vulnerability in recent times. While some, like the Chinese Yuan, are closely managed, others, such as the Korean Won or the Indonesian Rupiah, are more susceptible to global capital flows and commodity price fluctuations. The overall health of Asia FX is a critical barometer for global trade and economic growth, directly impacting supply chains and investor confidence worldwide. Several factors contribute to the current state of Asian currencies: Global Trade Dynamics: Asia remains the manufacturing hub of the world. Any slowdown in global demand or disruptions in trade relations can quickly reflect in export-oriented economies and their currencies. Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between local interest rates and those in major economies like the US can drive ‘carry trades,’ where investors borrow in low-interest currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones. This directly impacts capital flows into and out of Asian markets. Commodity Prices: Many Asian economies are significant importers or exporters of commodities. Fluctuations in oil, gas, or raw material prices can significantly affect their balance of payments and currency strength. China’s Economic Health: As the region’s largest economy, China’s performance and policy decisions have an outsized influence on its neighbors. A robust Chinese economy generally provides a tailwind for other Asia FX , while slowdowns can trigger regional weakness. This week, the interplay of these factors, especially against the backdrop of Fed and BOJ actions, will be crucial for the stability and direction of regional currencies. The Unyielding Strength of the US Dollar : A Safe Haven in Uncertain Times? The US Dollar has largely maintained its firm footing, acting as a perennial safe haven amidst global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Its strength is not merely a reflection of US economic performance but also a consequence of its role as the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant currency for international trade and finance. What drives the dollar’s firmness? Economic Resilience: Despite global headwinds, the US economy has often demonstrated surprising resilience, with robust job growth and consumer spending. This strength supports the argument for higher-for-longer interest rates, making dollar-denominated assets attractive. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes over the past couple of years have created a significant yield advantage for the dollar compared to many other major currencies, attracting global capital. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global stress or market volatility, investors typically flock to the perceived safety of the dollar, increasing its demand and value. Liquidity: The sheer depth and liquidity of US financial markets make the dollar an easy currency to trade in large volumes, further cementing its role. However, the narrative could shift significantly if the Fed signals a more dovish stance, particularly regarding a potential Fed rate cut . Any indication of easing monetary policy could temper the dollar’s strength and re-evaluate its safe-haven status, impacting everything from commodity prices to global equity markets and, of course, cryptocurrencies. Will the Anticipated Fed Rate Cut Materialize, and What Does It Mean? The prospect of a Fed rate cut has been a dominant theme in financial markets for months. After an aggressive hiking cycle to combat inflation, the market is now keenly anticipating when the Federal Reserve will begin to reverse course. The timing and magnitude of such a cut are critical for global financial conditions. Here’s what to consider regarding a potential Fed rate cut: Inflation Data: The Fed’s primary mandate is price stability. Sustained evidence of cooling inflation, moving towards its 2% target, is a prerequisite for any rate cuts. Labor Market Health: While a strong labor market is generally positive, an overheating one can fuel inflation. The Fed monitors employment figures closely for signs of softening that would justify easing policy. Economic Growth: The Fed aims for a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a severe recession. Signs of significant economic slowdown would increase the urgency for rate cuts. Market Expectations: Financial markets have often priced in rate cuts aggressively, sometimes ahead of the Fed’s own signals. Discrepancies between market expectations and Fed communication can lead to significant volatility. If a Fed rate cut materializes, it would likely: Weaken the US Dollar: Lower interest rates reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, potentially leading to capital outflows. Boost Risk Assets: A dovish Fed typically signals easier financial conditions, which can be a boon for equities, commodities, and riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Impact Global Borrowing Costs: As the dollar is central to global finance, a Fed rate cut can lower borrowing costs for countries and corporations worldwide. The market will be dissecting every word from the Fed’s upcoming statements for clues on the path forward, making this a truly pivotal moment for the forex market . The BOJ Meeting : What Surprises Could Shake the Markets? Across the Pacific, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) holds its own crucial meeting, watched closely for any signs of a departure from its ultra-loose monetary policy. Japan has long been an outlier among major economies, maintaining negative interest rates and a yield curve control (YCC) policy to combat deflation and stimulate growth. However, recent inflation figures in Japan have shown persistent upward pressure, fueling speculation that the BOJ might finally be ready to normalize policy. Key aspects of the upcoming BOJ meeting include: Interest Rate Adjustments: Will the BOJ finally hike its policy rate out of negative territory? This would be a historic shift with global implications. Yield Curve Control (YCC): The BOJ currently caps the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds. Any adjustments to this policy, or its complete abolition, would have significant effects on global bond markets. Inflation Outlook: The BOJ’s assessment of the sustainability of inflation above its 2% target will be key to its policy decisions. Yen Volatility: The Japanese Yen (JPY) has been particularly sensitive to interest rate differentials. Any hawkish surprise from the BOJ could lead to a sharp appreciation of the Yen, unwinding years of carry trades. A significant policy shift from the BOJ would not only impact the Yen and Japanese markets but could also reverberate across the global forex market . For instance, an unwinding of Yen carry trades could lead to repatriation of capital, affecting asset prices in other markets, including potentially impacting liquidity for certain crypto assets. Navigating the Complex Forex Market : Strategies for a Volatile Landscape The convergence of these major central bank meetings creates a highly dynamic and potentially volatile environment for the entire forex market . Traders and investors, including those with exposure to cryptocurrencies, need to be acutely aware of the interconnectedness of these global financial levers. Interplay of Major Currencies: The decisions from the Fed and the BOJ will not occur in isolation. Their actions will trigger a chain reaction across currency pairs: USD/JPY: This pair will be directly impacted by both central banks. A dovish Fed and a hawkish BOJ could see a significant drop in USD/JPY. USD/Asian Currencies: The strength or weakness of the US Dollar will heavily influence the trajectory of currencies within Asia FX . A weaker dollar could provide breathing room for Asian central banks, potentially reducing pressure for them to hike rates. Global Capital Flows: Changes in interest rate differentials will re-route global capital. Money tends to flow towards higher-yielding assets, so shifts in policy can lead to significant rebalancing of portfolios. Challenges and Opportunities in a Dynamic Market: This period of intense central bank activity presents both challenges and opportunities: Aspect Challenges Opportunities Volatility Increased risk of sudden price swings; stop-losses can be triggered easily. Potential for significant short-term gains for agile traders; arbitrage opportunities. Policy Divergence Conflicting signals from central banks make forecasting difficult. Clear trends can emerge in currency pairs where central bank policies diverge sharply. Risk Management Need for tighter risk controls and smaller position sizes. Opportunity to review and adjust hedging strategies across different asset classes. Crypto Impact Macro shifts can cause unexpected crypto market volatility. Potential for capital rotation from traditional assets into crypto if liquidity increases or confidence in traditional systems wavers. Actionable Insights: Preparing Your Portfolio for Macro Swings For investors navigating both traditional and digital asset markets, a proactive approach is key. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Closely monitor official statements from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Pay attention to the nuances in their language, not just the headline decisions. Diversify: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and geographies. This can help mitigate risks associated with sudden currency movements. Consider Hedging: If you have significant exposure to specific currencies or international assets, consider hedging strategies to protect against adverse currency swings. Assess Risk Appetite: In periods of high uncertainty, it’s wise to re-evaluate your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly. Volatility can be a friend or foe, depending on your strategy. Look for Intermarket Connections: Understand how movements in the forex market impact other assets. For instance, a stronger dollar often correlates with weaker commodity prices and can sometimes weigh on crypto. The confluence of a potential Fed rate cut and a pivotal BOJ meeting creates a landscape ripe for significant shifts. Being prepared means understanding the potential outcomes and their far-reaching implications. Conclusion: High Stakes, High Rewards – The Week Ahead for Global Currencies The coming week is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated for the global forex market in recent memory. With the Federal Reserve poised to potentially signal its first Fed rate cut and the Bank of Japan teetering on the edge of a historic policy shift, the ripple effects will be felt across every corner of finance, from major currencies like the US Dollar to the nuanced movements of Asia FX . These decisions will not only reshape traditional investment landscapes but also significantly influence the broader sentiment and liquidity within the cryptocurrency space. For astute investors, understanding these macro currents is paramount to navigating the complexities and capitalizing on the opportunities that lie ahead. Prepare for a week of crucial announcements and potential market-moving developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Federal Reserve’s primary goal?

A3: A strong US Dollar makes dollar-denominated goods and services more expensive for international buyers, can increase the debt burden for countries with dollar-denominated loans, and can draw capital away from other markets, including emerging markets and sometimes even cryptocurrencies. Q4: Who is the current Chair of the Federal Reserve? A4: The current Chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell . Q5: What does ‘Asia FX’ refer to?

MoonBull Smashes Past the $500K Barrier as BullZilla and La Culex Gain Fierce Momentum,https://timestabloid.com/top-meme-coin-to-buy-now-moonbull-smashes-past-the-500k/,"The top meme coin to buy now is stirring up the crypto streets, and names like BullZilla, La Culex, and MoonBull are grabbing attention fast. BullZilla’s 8th stage, “Echoes of the Bull,” shows a strong $980K presale tally and over 3,300 holders. Meanwhile, La Culex is buzzing at Stage 3. Together, these rising stars are shaking up the meme market, drawing in traders eager for the next moonshot. But for investors chasing early-stage wins, the MoonBull presale’s Stage 5 looks like the golden ticket. It’s where community energy meets serious tokenomics. Crypto enthusiasts, students, and analysts who missed earlier bull runs are watching closely, seeing MoonBull as a fresh chance to ride the hype wave with purpose and profit baked into every stage. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Top meme Coin to Buy Now MoonBull stands out as the top meme coin to buy now thanks to its wild mix of meme culture and financial muscle. Running on Ethereum, it’s a fresh breed of meme token with automated liquidity, reflections, and burns that turn every trade into a boost for holders. The MoonBull presale is now in Stage 5, priced at just $0.00006584 with over $500K raised and 1,600+ holders. Early joiners could see over 9,256% ROI by the time listing hits $0.00616. The next surge? A whopping 27.4% jump, making now the sweet spot to hop in. Here’s the fun part – imagine dropping $30,000 into MoonBull right now. By the time the 23-stage presale hits its final round, that small stack could snowball into serious peanuts turned into gold. With 95% APY staking set to launch at Stage 10, the project rewards holders not just for buying but for staying loyal. It’s not just a meme play; it’s a financial engine dressed in bull horns and moon boots. Voting Power: Community Control and Crypto Freedom Starting from Stage 12, every $MOBU token equals one vote, giving holders real say in the project’s future. This governance model ensures transparency and long-term trust, letting users decide on burns, campaigns, and ecosystem upgrades. That’s a rare power move in the meme coin jungle, where most communities have little voice. MoonBull’s structure transforms buyers into decision-makers, making it the top meme coin to buy now for investors who crave both fun and function. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Veteran Beast Charging Ahead BullZilla has proven its horns are sharp in this bull run. Now in its 8th stage, Echoes of the Bull, it boasts a presale tally of over $980K and more than 3,300 token holders. The current price sits at $0.00019906, with a surge expected to $0.00020573 soon. Early joiners already racked up over 3,300% ROI, showing how powerful timing can be. A $1,000 investment once fetched over 5 million $BZIL tokens, turning ordinary buyers into bullish believers. But as the bull keeps charging, the entry price rises, making future gains tighter. While BullZilla remains a reliable name in the herd, those who missed its early roar might find it harder to catch lightning again. For those seeking fresh entry potential, MoonBull offers a similar rise but at its ground floor. That’s why analysts keep linking BullZilla’s early hype to the growing buzz around MoonBull, marking it as the top meme coin to buy now. La Culex ($CULEX): The Newcomer Buzzing in the Shadows La Culex , now in Stage 3: Bug Spray Dip, trades at $0.00002274 and is gearing up for a next-stage price of $0.00002458. The presale has already surpassed $7,000, and its slow but steady flight continues to catch the attention of early meme investors. Though smaller in scale than BullZilla and MoonBull, La Culex carries an intriguing sense of mystery – like a mosquito that just won’t quit buzzing the closer you listen. There’s undeniable potential here, but it’s still early in its evolution within the crypto meme ecosystem. Investors who appreciate quiet, early-stage plays may find its gradual progress appealing, yet the real spotlight seems to shine elsewhere. As crypto discussions increasingly center on long-term sustainability and token utility, many traders are turning toward the MoonBull presale, where staking rewards, governance voting, and structured growth offer a more comprehensive value proposition. That’s why MoonBull continues to stand out as the front-running contender among today’s top meme coins to watch. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, BullZilla continues its powerful climb, and La Culex is finding its footing among smaller-cap plays. Both coins have shown grit and promise in their respective stages. Yet, when it comes to combining innovation, community engagement, and smart tokenomics, MoonBull emerges as the clear frontrunner. Its strong ROI projections, presale momentum, and built-in scarcity mechanisms make it a prime example of the top meme coin to buy now. MoonBull isn’t just another hype train. It’s an ecosystem built for longevity and community power. With staking, referrals, and voting rights shaping its structure, this project is turning meme energy into financial reality. The MoonBull presale at Stage 5 is still open, but not for long. Jump in before it’s too late – the next 1000x bull could already be warming up its engines.

Its community-driven governance, staking pool, and transparent roadmap create a solid foundation for sustained growth. Glossary of Key Terms Presale: Early sale of tokens before public listing.

In today’s environment—where stablecoin-based investments and regulated digital assets are gaining momentum—PMN offers a concrete, operationally backed solution for disciplined Bitcoin accumulation. We’re proud to show that Japan’s next financial exports may no longer be limited to stocks and bonds—but also include blockchain-powered, professionally managed investment opportunities.” This engagement marks a pivotal step in bringing Japan-origin infrastructure-based digital assets to the global stage .

That’s a 14% surge, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.59 billion by 0.97%. On the earnings side, Visa reported $2.98 per share, slightly above the $2.97 estimate, and well above the $2.71 it reported this time last year. This is the fourth quarter in a row that Visa has outstandingly outperformed analyst expectations on both earnings and revenue. The company delivered a +0.34% surprise this quarter, but last quarter’s surprise was even bigger at +4.2%, when analysts expected $2.86 per share and Visa again came through with a $2.98. But hey, don’t confuse consistency with outperformance, because despite all this, the stock has only surged by 10.1% this year, trailing the S&P 500’s 16.9% monster rally. Visa pushes stablecoin adoption across global network Visa’s quarterly earnings call wasn’t just about numbers though, as CEO Ryan McInerney made it clear they’re going deeper into stablecoins. “We are adding support for four stablecoins, running on four unique blockchains, representing two currencies, that we can accept and convert to over 25 traditional fiat currencies,” Ryan said Tuesday. Ryan also said that Visa card spending linked to stablecoins in Q4 was four times higher than it was a year ago. This is after Visa launched a pilot program in September to test cross-border payments using stablecoins, giving businesses a faster way to move funds internationally without the usual banking delays. Visa has been dabbling in the crypto space for a while, but this quarter’s update gave numbers. According to Ryan, since 2020, Visa has handled over $140 billion in crypto and stablecoin flows. That includes $100 billion worth of crypto purchases using Visa credentials. Ryan says Visa is now letting banks mint and burn stablecoins directly through Visa’s infrastructure. The payments giant allegedly has over 130 stablecoin-linked card issuing programs across more than 40 countries. And while they’ve worked with crypto-native firms before, McInerney emphasized that the regulatory clarity in the U.S. around USD-pegged tokens is pushing Visa to move faster. So what’s coming next? Depends who you ask. Right now, analysts expect $3.07 EPS on $10.59 billion revenue for the next quarter. For the full fiscal year, the estimate is $12.84 EPS and $44.18 billion in total revenue. But the revisions trend ahead of this report was mixed, so there’s no clear signal yet on where forecasts are heading next. Visa’s stock may react to all this… or it may not. As usual, what matters most for short-term movement is what management said on the earnings call, and how investors interpret that tone. And that is a question for the next quarter.

The statement came from CFO Claire McDonough, who spoke to reporters in Detroit. She said construction on the Georgia plant is expected to begin next year. Claire explained that Rivian plans to seek reimbursement through the Department of Energy loan after the plant is completed but before the company begins production there. “It’d be prior to starting production in 2028 that we’d be drawing down the loan,” she said. The loan was finalized in January, during the final days of President Joe Biden’s administration. That timing matters because former President Donald Trump has criticized federal financing of clean energy projects like this. Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in May that his agency does not plan to move forward with several loans approved under Biden. Rivian’s expected drawdown in 2028 will land directly in another U.S. presidential election year, putting political risk right at the center of this financing plan. No drama there, right? Sure. Rivian timelines tied to Georgia plant and R2-R3 production The company, based in Irvine, California, plans to start building the Georgia plant next year. The factory is intended to handle production of the company’s upcoming models, including the R2 and eventually another model called R3. The R2 will first be built at Rivian’s existing plant in Normal, Illinois starting in 2026. Rivian applied for this federal loan last year, shortly after pausing the initial Georgia construction plan because of cost pressures. Yes, cost-cutting led to the pause. Now the plan is back on track, just slower. Claire also reaffirmed Rivian’s target to reach operating profit by 2028, but only if the Normal plant reaches full annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles. That is the internal performance threshold. Claire said, “Ramping up the Normal facility to 200,000 would get us to Ebitda,” referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Right now, Rivian is nowhere near that. In August, the company projected an adjusted EBITDA loss of up to $2.25 billion for the year. So yes, they are planning long-term, because the short-term is not pretty. Rivian analyzed Xiaomi SU7, but says U.S. cannot match China’s support There was another layer to the conversation this week. CEO RJ Scaringe confirmed that Rivian engineers recently tore down the Chinese Xiaomi SU7, the electric sedan that has been shaking up markets because of its price. It starts at 215,900 yuan, around $30,000. Last year, even Ford CEO Jim Farley said he imported an SU7 to drive it himself. That got attention. Scaringe said the SU7 is “a really well executed, heavily vertically-integrated technology platform” and “nicely done.” He even said that if he lived in China, it is one of the cars he would consider buying. But after the teardown, Rivian did not discover any magic trick that explains the low price. “We learned nothing from the teardown” that would explain how Xiaomi keeps costs down, Scaringe said. According to him, the answer is simple: China’s government support system. He said that in China, “the cost of capital is zero or negative, meaning they get paid to put up plants.” That is a financial environment the U.S. does not have and cannot copy.

The company said its revenue hit ₩24.45 trillion ($17.13 billion), compared to analyst forecasts of ₩24.73 trillion, while operating profit reached ₩11.38 trillion, narrowly missing estimates of ₩11.39 trillion. Still, those numbers mark an astonishing 39% increase in revenue year‑on‑year and a 62% jump in profit. On a quarterly basis, sales climbed 10%, and profit rose 24%. SK Hynix also confirmed that its quarterly profit exceeded ₩10 trillion for the first time. Shares in Seoul surged more than 5%, extending their 2024 rally to over 210%. SK Hynix said, “As demand across the memory segment has soared due to customers’ expanding investments in AI infrastructure, SK Hynix once again surpassed the record‑high performance of the previous quarter due to increased sales of high value‑added products.” The firm added that it has already sold out its planned supply of memory chips for 2026, underscoring the scale of AI‑driven demand from its data‑center clients. SK Hynix expands AI memory leadership with next‑gen HBM4 rollout SK Hynix said it would begin supplying its next‑generation HBM4 chips in the current quarter, following final negotiations with several major customers. The HBM4 chips mark the company’s sixth generation of high‑bandwidth memory and are expected to deliver faster data transfer speeds for next‑generation AI accelerators. HBM, or high‑bandwidth memory, sits under the DRAM category, which is used to store data and program code in everything from servers and workstations to consumer electronics. But AI has changed the balance of the memory market; HBM is now the beating heart of data‑center infrastructure, linking GPUs and CPUs to handle massive AI workloads. SK Hynix’s dominance comes from its early lead in HBM technology and its close supply ties with Nvidia, the world’s biggest AI chipmaker. It remains Nvidia’s main supplier of advanced memory, a position that competitors Samsung and Micron are still fighting to reach. Micron has started shipping HBM products to Nvidia, and Samsung recently passed Nvidia’s qualification tests for its own next‑gen memory chip, signaling intensifying competition ahead. Despite that, CFO Kim Woohyun said SK Hynix would “continue to strengthen our AI memory leadership by responding to customer demand through market‑leading products and differentiated technological capabilities.” The company is doubling down on AI memory, confident that the boom is far from over. Market share dominance and AI‑fueled demand forecast According to Counterpoint Research, SK Hynix held a 38% share of the global DRAM market by revenue in Q2, overtaking Samsung in the first quarter and widening its lead through mid‑year. In the HBM market, the company’s grip is even stronger, with a 64% global share as of the second quarter, while the entire market expanded 178% year‑on‑year. Research director MS Hwang from Counterpoint said the HBM market could hit $43 billion by 2027, giving firms like SK Hynix significant profit leverage. “For SK Hynix to continue generating profits, it’ll be important for the company to maintain and enhance its competitive edge,” Hwang said. Ray Wang, lead semiconductor analyst at Futurum Group, added that SK Hynix is likely to maintain around 60% of the global HBM market next year, supported by its technological edge and relationships with major AI players like Nvidia, Google, and other hyperscale customers.

Related Reading: Analyst Shares Why He Bought A Massive Stack Of XRP, ‘It’s Not A Gamble’ According to Standard Chartered’s head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick, the recent developments may mark a transformative phase for Bitcoin, one where its six-figure price zone becomes a lasting support level rather than a fleeting milestone. Macro Tailwinds Drive Market Mood Kendrick points to a rebound in global risk appetite after recent signs of détente between the United States and China . Discussions around delayed rare-earth export restrictions and increased U.S. agricultural purchases by China have eased trade tensions ahead of the high-level summit between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. Kendrick notes that this shift in geopolitics has helped restore confidence in risk assets, including Bitcoin, and may be influencing the recent uptick in the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio, a key sentiment indicator for crypto markets. In parallel, expectations of a potential interest-rate cut by the Fed and the possibility of the bank pausing its quantitative-tightening programme have also lifted hopes of increased liquidity, further favouring risk-on trades. Analysts suggest that if the Fed pivots, it could serve as a boost for Bitcoin’s structural up-trend. Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows Could Cement the New Floor Beyond macro trends, Standard Chartered emphasises the growing role of institutional flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. The believe that over $2 billion recently exited gold-backed ETFs, and argues that even half of those funds shifting into BTC products would represent a major structural change in capital allocation. This matters because it signals a shift away from the traditional narrative that Bitcoin’s price moves are primarily driven by its miner-reward “halving” events. Instead, large-scale adoption and institutional investment now appear to be the dominant drivers of the market. If this momentum persists, Kendrick asserts that Bitcoin may be entering a new phase where dropping below $100,000 becomes unlikely. Bottom Line At present, Bitcoin remains within a consolidation range near $112,000–114,000, with technicals pointing to a tightening in volatility and potential for a breakout once macro catalysts settle.

Volume over the last 24 hours rose by 60%, pushing total traded value above $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: $10K Is Coming: Arthur Hayes’ Zcash ‘Vibe Check’ Sparks 30% Moonshot Yet the token traded near $0.21 at the time of the report, down about 0.18% in the day and down 12% so far this month. Trading Volume Surges According to CoinMarketCap data, the sudden spike in volume shows many more hands moving DOGE than usual. Reports have disclosed that this wave of trades coincides with renewed interest among retail buyers and larger holders. Data shows that October has historically been a strong month for Dogecoin, with modest gains of 30% to a more impressive 101% from 2021 up to 2024. Those past returns help explain why some traders expect a positive close this month. Whales Move, Exchanges See Flow Reports have disclosed several large transfers tied to the surge. One report described a dormant whale with a 36 DOGE seed reactivating and making a transfer valued at $26.8 million to Binance. Another dormant wallet reportedly moved 15.115 million DOGE, valued at about $2.95 million, out of the same exchange. These movements drew attention because big transfers can change where liquidity sits and how quickly prices move when buying or selling picks up. Another dormant wallet reportedly moved 15 million DOGE, valued at about nearly $3 million, out of Binance. These movements drew attention because big transfers can change where liquidity sits and how quickly prices move when buying or selling picks up. Macro Drivers And Market Sentiment The volume surge came as major cryptocurrencies showed strength. Reports have disclosed Bitcoin moving higher toward $115,000 while Ethereum traded near $4,200. That broader rally can lift smaller tokens as traders rotate capital across markets. Still, metrics are mixed: one recent forecast predicted DOGE could rise by 13% to $0.22 by November 27, 2025, while technical indicators flagged the current sentiment as Bearish and the Fear & Greed Index sat at 50. Outlook And Risks Ahead The picture is straightforward and messy at the same time. Higher volume suggests interest; price action says caution. Whale transfers can both fuel rallies and add selling pressure, depending on intent.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-you-need-2500-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders, recently released a video with an urgent message to viewers about XRP. His comments came shortly after Ripple confirmed the completion of its acquisition of Hidden Road, a major institutional finance platform now operating under the name Ripple Prime . Rietveld began his message with a clear statement. “If you are watching this, you need to get at least 2,500 XRP before the end of this month,” he said. His reasoning centered on what he called the transformative effect of the Hidden Road acquisition, which he believes will push significant capital flows through the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the coming months. The transaction expands Ripple’s reach into prime brokerage and institutional clearing while integrating XRP and Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , into new financial services.

He predicted that “trillions of dollars are going to be going through the XRP ledger as part of this partnership,” emphasizing that the network could soon process institutional-level settlements at a scale not previously seen. He also warned that investors who delay could miss a significant opportunity, saying this was their last chance to make a life-changing decision . Rietveld’s call to secure 2,500 XRP shows his belief in the long-term success of the digital asset and Ripple’s initiatives. It reflects his view that retail investors should gain meaningful exposure before institutional investors become active.

The move enables Ripple to offer prime brokerage, financing, and settlement services to professional traders and financial institutions, bringing traditional and digital assets under a single operational framework. This integration positions Ripple to leverage the XRPL for real-world settlement of major financial transactions, a goal it has pursued for years. The acquisition is a bold step toward establishing XRP as an institutional-grade liquidity asset. By connecting Ripple Prime’s infrastructure with the XRPL, Ripple can facilitate faster and cheaper movement of capital between asset classes.

The company is now valued at $4.89 trillion, just a few months after becoming the first to break the $4 trillion barrier in July. Nvidia also announced on Tuesday that it’s teaming up with the U.S. Department of Energy to construct seven supercomputers, including one designed with 10,000 of its Blackwell GPUs. Nvidia’s Huang estimates they could earn over $500 billion in revenue by 2026 Among its other deals, Nvidia will also partner with Uber on autonomous vehicle development, sell 1,000 GPUs to Eli Lilly, and collaborate with Nokia to advance 6G communications. The semiconductor company, aiming to work on national security applications, also announced new alliances with Palantir and Oracle, as well as with telecom firms such as Cisco and T-Mobile, to support the next wave of 6G infrastructure. Additionally, the company noted that its AI systems are being utilized to power robotics efforts at firms such as Amazon, Foxconn, Caterpillar, and Belden. The company also rolled out NVQLink, a new open architecture designed to enhance the pace of quantum supercomputer innovation with partners including Rigetti and IonQ. Moreover, in his keynote address on Tuesday, CEO Jensen Huang projected that Nvidia will generate roughly half a trillion dollars in revenue from its Blackwell chips and the early rollout of Rubin, its next-generation computing platform, by 2026. The firm has already initiated mass production of Blackwell’s most advanced chip alongside Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Nvidia has made several strategic equity investments in key partners in recent months, as the company has emerged as a central player in the AI world. Last month, it committed a $5 billion investment in one-time rival Intel and announced plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. It also committed $500 million in self-driving car startup Wayve and a $667 million investment in U.K. cloud provider Nscale. Huang says the White House is working on an arrangement that could allow for chip sales in China A potential trade agreement between Washington and Beijing could work in Nvidia’s favor. A trade deal might allow it to resume chip sales in China. Huang has argued that keeping Nvidia out of the Chinese market would ultimately hurt America more than it hurts China. He noted, “We want to compete against China, no doubt about that. We want America to win this AI race, no doubt about that … But we also need to be in China to win their developers. A policy that causes America to lose half of the world’s AI developers is not beneficial in the long term.” The Trump administration is laying the groundwork for regulations that can make the government take up 15% of Nvidia’s China sales, Huang also said during a Q&A session on Tuesday afternoon. But Beijing hasn’t yet decided whether the chips can be repatriated. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet in South Korea, renewing optimism for a possible trade agreement between the two economic giants. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who joined Huang during Tuesday’s Q&A session, even commented, “I feel quite optimistic that we will have an agreement and arrangement coming out of that will benefit the United States and benefit the world.” Nvidia’s GPUs are still the backbone of the sprawling data centers that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are building worldwide. However, its rivals are stepping up, including AMD, which recently signed agreements to deliver up to 6 gigawatts of AI processors to OpenAI and 50,000 GPUs to Oracle. Qualcomm also said it’s joining the AI data center race with new accelerator chips.

Optimism over a potential US–China trade deal also lifted sentiment ahead of Thursday’s meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Australian shares declined after the release of the latest quarterly inflation figures. Silver rose to around $47.5 per ounce on Wednesday, moving away from one-month lows in a likely technical rebound. Gold prices rose to around $3,970 per ounce on Wednesday, pausing its recent decline, as attention turned to the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cut later in the day.

U.S. President Donald Trump signaled plans to reduce fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports ahead of his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin lost steam into the Asia session, down 1.1% to $112,806 as traders trimmed risk before the Fed’s rate decision later today. The pullback cooled a recent crypto rebound even as regional equities climbed on AI optimism. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $112,806, down 1.1% Ether : $4,016, down 2.1% Solana : $194.64, down 3.3% Total crypto market cap : $3.8 trillion, down 1.4% Asia is taking its cue from Wall Street. Tech optimism carried over after Microsoft struck a deal to let OpenAI restructure as a public benefit corporation while taking a 27% stake, and that lifted sentiment across the region. You can see it in the price action, as MSCI Asia ex-Japan nudged higher, Japan’s Nikkei jumped more than 1% to fresh records, and Korea’s Kospi hit an all-time high thanks in part to upbeat results from SK Hynix, a key Nvidia supplier. Futures are mixed into Europe and the US, with Nasdaq a touch firmer and Euro Stoxx 50 a bit softer. Fed Rate Cut Looms as Markets Brace for Policy Signals on Liquidity The real hinge today is rates. Markets have almost fully priced a 25-basis-point Fed cut. The dollar has eased on the view that more cuts could follow, and traders will listen closely for any hint that the Fed might slow or stop balance-sheet runoff, which would matter for liquidity. “If the Fed signals a fresh easing cycle, risk assets like crypto could pop, but if the messaging stays cautious or hawkish, we could see a quick pullback. For now, the market is perched on a knife-edge between hope and hesitation,” said Bitget CEO Gracy Chen. BREAKING: 98% chance of a 25 bps Fed rate cut tomorrow 2% chance of a 50 bps cut. pic.twitter.com/XEkIXFDBEa — Kalshi (@Kalshi) October 28, 2025 What to watch from the Fed US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce a rate cut today as the two-day FOMC meeting wraps up. The meeting runs Oct. 28–29, with Powell set to release the decision today at 2 pm ET, followed by a press conference at 2:30 pm ET. Markets will parse the statement and Q&A for guidance on the path of rates and quantitative tightening. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, described the Fed’s expected 25-basis-point rate cut to a range of 3.75% to 4% as a move that could inject fresh liquidity into crypto markets. “Easing borrowing costs typically boost risk appetite, and this could channel fresh capital into assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, sparking 5%–10% short-term rallies,” he said. “As investors seek higher returns, we may also see capital rotation from safer assets into major altcoins like SOL and XRP, reinforcing crypto’s appeal as both a growth play and inflation hedge.” BOJ Decision, Fed Rate and Big-Tech Results Form This Week’s Macro Crosscurrents In FX, the yen firmed about 0.3% after US officials amped up warnings about Japan’s ultra-low rates. The Bank of Japan is up tomorrow, and most expect no change. Earnings add another layer. We’re heading into the busiest stretch with Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all reporting, exactly the balance sheets that have steadied risk this year. For crypto desks, those same macro levers decide the next move, the rate path, the tone of US-China talks, and mega-cap results. With Bitcoin hovering under $113K, the question is whether a dovish Fed and tech strength can restart the bid, or if traders stay cautious until the dust settles.

OceanPal Launches SovereignAI Nasdaq-listed OceanPal Inc. raised $120 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal to launch a new subsidiary called SovereignAI, which goal is to commercialize the NEAR Protocol and develop artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company revealed on Tuesday that SovereignAI will also adopt a crypto treasury strategy, with plans to acquire up to 10% of the total NEAR token supply. The initiative is being developed in partnership with the NEAR Foundation and is a major move toward integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies under the concept of “universal AI sovereignty.” Announcement from OceanPal NEAR is a layer-1 blockchain that supports decentralized AI applications by enabling AI agents to interact, manage assets, and operate autonomously across different networks. This collaboration positions OceanPal as a public market vehicle for exposure to NEAR’s native token while also aligning both organizations around the shared goal of advancing open, interoperable AI infrastructure. Alongside the announcement, OceanPal introduced key leadership changes to steer the new venture. Former State Street executive Sal Ternullo was appointed co-CEO, while David Schwed, who previously held senior roles at BNY Mellon, Galaxy, and Robinhood, was named chief operating officer. NEAR Foundation co-founder and CEO Illia Polosukhin will join the SovereignAI advisory board, alongside other people from the industry like Richard Muirhead of Fabric Ventures and OpenAI researcher Lukasz Kaiser. The launch of SovereignAI comes at a time when the crypto and AI sectors are increasingly intertwined . AI agents are now leveraging blockchain technology to securely manage assets, verify on-chain actions, and function as self-governing economic participants. Coinbase’s head of institutional strategy, John D’Agostino, recently said that cryptocurrency is essential for enabling AI agents to operate efficiently in financial markets. Supporting this trend, Cloudflare announced plans to launch its own stablecoin, NET Dollar, to facilitate instant AI-triggered transactions, while Coinbase’s AI-ready payments protocol saw its transaction volume soar over 10,000% in the past month. Overall, it is becoming clear that there is a growing convergence between AI and blockchain as companies race to define the future of autonomous digital economies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|NEAR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-29 05:30:00

The project's developers have begun integrating the x402 payment standard developed by Coinbase into the Cardano network. This step aims to enable artificial intelligence (AI) agents to make on-chain payments using the ADA and USDM stablecoins. The Masumi blockchain team, which operates within the ADA ecosystem, is leading the system's implementation. ADA founder Charles Hoskinson described the development as “a huge step for Cardano” in a post on the X platform. The x402 protocol allows bots or AI-based agents to manage transactions on-chain without centralized control or human intervention. By integrating this technology into Cardano, AI agents will be able to automatically execute complex DeFi transactions such as token swaps, staking, and lending. This is considered a significant step towards full automation of smart contracts on the network. Related News: One of the Largest Cryptocurrency Companies Revealed It Purchased a Surprise Altcoin That is Not Even Listed on Binance Despite having a market capitalization of $24 billion, ADA only has $322 million in locked assets (TVL) in the DeFi ecosystem, falling short of major networks like Ethereum and Solana, as well as Layer-2 networks like Base and Optimism. Hoskinson has long voiced his frustration with Cardano's DeFi growth. He criticized the Cardano Foundation for being “slow and ineffective,” saying that the foundation attempted to increase network activity by spending $15 million in 2024, but it failed to achieve the expected impact. In October, the Cardano community approved a $33 million ADA fund to increase liquidity for the DeFi stablecoin. Despite this, Cardano's stablecoin market capitalization is only around $36 million. For comparison, Ethereum's market capitalization is around $164 billion and Tron's is around $79 billion. *This is not investment advice.

This persistent pursuit highlights the growing institutional interest in Solana (SOL) and its potential integration into traditional finance. The proposed management fee for this groundbreaking fund is set at a competitive 0.5%. This repeated effort by Canary Capital signals a strong belief in Solana’s future and its suitability for a regulated investment product. Investors are keenly watching how the SEC will respond to this latest submission, as a spot ETF could dramatically change how mainstream finance interacts with the SOL ecosystem. What Exactly is a Spot Solana ETF and Why is it Significant? A spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that holds the underlying asset directly. In this case, a Spot Solana ETF would directly hold Solana (SOL) tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to SOL’s price movements without actually owning or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. This differs significantly from a futures ETF, which tracks the price of futures contracts for an asset. Direct ownership offers a more accurate reflection of the asset’s real-time market value. The significance of a Spot Solana ETF is multi-faceted: Accessibility: It opens the door for traditional investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges. Regulatory Clarity: Approval would grant Solana a new level of legitimacy within regulated financial markets. Institutional Adoption: It could attract substantial capital from institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers. Ultimately, a spot ETF offers a familiar, regulated wrapper for a volatile digital asset, making it more palatable for a broader range of investors. Navigating the Regulatory Maze: Why So Many Amendments for a Spot Solana ETF ? The journey for any cryptocurrency ETF, especially a spot product, is often a long and challenging one. The SEC has historically approached crypto ETFs with extreme caution, primarily citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of digital asset markets. Canary Capital’s filing of a seventh amendment demonstrates their commitment to addressing these regulatory hurdles. Each amendment typically involves refining the application based on feedback from the SEC, providing more detailed information on market surveillance, custody arrangements, and risk management strategies. Consider the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Both faced numerous delays and rejections before eventually gaining approval, first for futures products, and then, more recently, for spot versions. The SEC’s stringent review process aims to ensure that any new financial product offers adequate safeguards for investors and operates within a robust regulatory framework. Therefore, the multiple amendments for a Spot Solana ETF are not unusual. They reflect the iterative dialogue between applicants and regulators, as they work towards a mutually acceptable structure for these innovative investment products. What Could a Spot Solana ETF Mean for the Solana Market? The potential approval of a Spot Solana ETF could have profound implications for Solana (SOL) and the broader cryptocurrency market. Historically, the approval of similar products for other cryptocurrencies has led to increased liquidity and heightened investor interest. Should the SEC give the green light, we might see: Increased Demand: New avenues for capital inflow from institutional and retail investors. Enhanced Price Discovery: A more efficient and transparent pricing mechanism for SOL. Market Validation: A significant boost to Solana’s credibility as a major blockchain platform. Investors should closely monitor SEC announcements and market reactions. While an approval could be a bullish catalyst, the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various influences. Staying informed about regulatory developments is a key actionable insight for anyone interested in the future of Solana and digital asset investments. A Glimpse into Solana’s Future with a Potential Spot Solana ETF Canary Capital’s persistent efforts to launch a Spot Solana ETF underscore a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. The filing of the seventh amendment signifies a continuous dialogue with regulators, aiming to meet the rigorous standards required for mainstream financial products. While the path to approval is often arduous, the potential benefits—from enhanced accessibility for traditional investors to increased institutional adoption—are immense. This development could solidify Solana’s position as a mature and recognized asset class within the global financial landscape, marking a significant step towards broader cryptocurrency integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the primary difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF? A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset, like actual Solana tokens, meaning its price movements closely track the asset’s real-time market value. A futures ETF, however, invests in futures contracts that speculate on the future price of an asset, which can sometimes diverge from the immediate spot price. Why is the SEC so cautious about approving a Spot Solana ETF ? The SEC’s caution stems from concerns about market manipulation, the protection of investors, and the overall maturity and regulatory oversight of the underlying cryptocurrency markets. They require extensive safeguards and transparency measures before approving new, complex financial products. What is Solana (SOL)?

Imagine holding onto an asset for years, only to see its value skyrocket into the tens of millions. This is precisely the story unfolding as an anonymous address, tied to the initial Ethereum ICO , recently moved a substantial amount of ETH to the Kraken exchange. What’s the Significance of This Ethereum ICO Deposit? This isn’t just any transaction; it’s a move by a true crypto veteran. According to data from Onchain Lens, an address that took part in the original Ethereum ICO has deposited 1,500 ETH, worth a staggering $6.02 million, onto the Kraken platform. For context, the Ethereum ICO was a groundbreaking event in 2014, allowing early supporters to acquire ETH at a nascent stage. Consider the journey of this particular investor: Initial Investment: A modest $6,220. ETH Acquired: A remarkable 20,000 ETH during the ICO. Current Valuation: The remaining 18,500 ETH (after this deposit) is still valued at an astounding $80.3 million. This highlights the incredible long-term growth potential that early participation in projects like the Ethereum ICO offered. It serves as a powerful reminder of the exponential returns possible in the volatile crypto market. A Glimpse into Early Ethereum ICO Fortunes The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) model, though common now, was pioneered by events like the Ethereum ICO . It allowed projects to raise funds by selling new cryptocurrencies to early investors. For many, including this anonymous participant, it was a bold investment in an unproven technology. Their journey from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions is a testament to that early vision and the transformative power of blockchain. While the investor’s identity remains private, their significant move is publicly visible. When a large holder, or “whale,” transfers substantial assets to an exchange, it typically signals an intent to sell or increase liquidity. Market watchers are therefore keenly observing for any subsequent actions, understanding that such moves can influence sentiment. What Could This Ethereum ICO Participant’s Move Mean for the Market? When a substantial amount of ETH from an early Ethereum ICO wallet moves to an exchange, several scenarios can unfold. Firstly, it could be straightforward profit-taking. After nearly a decade, realizing a multi-million dollar gain is a logical step for any investor. Secondly, it might be a strategic reallocation, preparing for new investments or diversifying a vast portfolio. However, large deposits can sometimes create a ripple effect on market sentiment. A sudden influx of sell orders might temporarily add downward pressure on ETH’s price. Conversely, if the ETH is moved for reasons other than immediate selling, the market might absorb it without significant volatility. Investors should monitor these on-chain signals but understand that individual whale movements don’t always dictate broader market trends. Navigating Whale Movements: Lessons from the Ethereum ICO Era Understanding the behavior of large holders, particularly those from the Ethereum ICO era, offers valuable insights. While their actions can be influential, it’s important not to make impulsive decisions based solely on one transaction. The crypto market is complex, influenced by many factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory news. For everyday investors, tracking these movements provides key lessons: Long-term Vision: The massive gains from the Ethereum ICO underscore the power of holding for the long run. Risk Management: Even early investors face volatility; knowing when to take profits is crucial. On-Chain Analysis: Tools like Onchain Lens offer transparency, helping investors track significant movements. These lessons remain relevant, whether you participated in the initial Ethereum ICO or are new to the market today. In conclusion, the recent $6 million ETH deposit by an early Ethereum ICO participant to Kraken is more than just a transaction; it’s a narrative of incredible wealth creation and a potential signal for the broader market. It highlights the life-changing potential of early crypto investments and the ongoing relevance of on-chain data in understanding market dynamics. This event serves as a fascinating case study in cryptocurrency history, reminding us of the immense journeys taken by early adopters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Ethereum ICO? The Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was a crowdfunding event in 2014, where early investors purchased Ether (ETH) tokens before the official launch of the Ethereum network. Who is the anonymous Ethereum ICO participant? The exact identity of the address holder remains anonymous, typical for blockchain transactions. On-chain analysis confirms their participation in the original Ethereum ICO. Why did the participant deposit ETH to Kraken? Depositing ETH to a centralized exchange like Kraken usually indicates an intention to sell, trade, or convert assets into fiat or other cryptocurrencies, often for profit realization or portfolio rebalancing. How much profit did the Ethereum ICO participant make? The participant initially invested $6,220 for 20,000 ETH. Even after this deposit, their remaining 18,500 ETH is valued at approximately $80.3 million, representing an astronomical return.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) published an updated version of its Info Sheet 225 on Tuesday , clarifying how existing financial services laws apply to digital-asset businesses. The revised guidance marks a significant step in tightening regulatory supervision as Australia prepares to introduce the Treasury Laws Amendment (Regulating Digital Asset and Tokenised Custody Platforms) Bill 2025. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:51422b79-bc24-4c50-98b9-934cee5f9c3d-14"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-8"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> This comes as Australia’s cryptocurrency market shows signs of stagnation, with investors holding back amid anticipation of new digital-asset legislation despite a year of sweeping reforms. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , crypto exchange Swyftx has released its fifth annual Australian Crypto Survey, revealing that adult ownership of digital assets has flatlined, and public trust in cryptocurrencies continues to decline. Treasury and ASIC work together to prepare for new crypto licensing rules The ASIC replaced the old term “crypto assets” with “digital assets” to make it easier for businesses to determine which rules apply to them and how to comply with them. This update is in line with the Australian Treasury’s new Digital Asset Platforms Bill and Payment Service Providers Bill. The new bills will help introduce official licenses for crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and custody service providers by 2026. In addition to the updated terms, the ASIC expanded the examples of financial products to illustrate how the current Corporations Act categorizes different digital assets. The agency also introduced new sections to help businesses know how to handle client assets, risks, and transition smoothly into the new licensing system. The regulator stated that it aims to provide companies with sufficient time to prepare for the new laws while also protecting customers. However, they did make it clear that the examples and sections will not replace the law, but only guide companies. With this new guidance, companies will understand how the current financial rules categorize their services and whether any of them require an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence. ASIC tightens custodial standards and extends Australian law to offshore crypto services The ASIC stated that some companies would intentionally attempt to circumvent the laws because they believe the laws don’t fully apply to them, as they are based outside the country. The agency warned that these excuses will no longer be effective, as every company that reaches Australian customers in some way or another must comply with the laws. Companies must now hold at least A$10 million ($6.5 million) in net tangible assets, unless their custody role is very small or secondary to another service. The Regulatory Guide 166 also has the same requirements for traditional custodians. To help companies adopt the new regulatory system easily, the ASIC stated that skilled individuals who have worked in cryptocurrency or blockchain can qualify as responsible managers under the Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence, even if they do not have a traditional finance background. The company also plans to give “no-action” relief to companies working to get full authorization but have not yet completed the process (as long as they continue to follow strong consumer-protection practices). Fund managers and exchange-traded product (ETP) issuers must also comply with the strict laws outlined in Chapter 5C of the Corporations Act. They should disclose to investors the assets they hold, where those assets are stored, and the specific risks investors face when purchasing crypto-linked products. The agency stated that it aims to prevent firms from promoting digital asset investments without disclosing to investors how funds are managed or what risks may arise. The ASIC also discussed decentralized finance (DeFi), but didn’t provide a single definition because the products are diverse. Instead, the regulator will evaluate each project to determine whether the exchanges or brokers are providing services that require a license. The agency will collaborate with other local regulators to develop new laws governing these digital asset companies. Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino said these updates will create clear and secure laws that will support innovation instead of blocking new technologies.

While Bitcoin price target discussions often lead to volatility, analysts are observing a fascinating pre-FOMC lull, hinting at significant movements ahead. Could this be the calm before a potential storm of upward momentum for BTC? What’s Behind the Current Bitcoin Price Target Lull? Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a short-term correction. This period of consolidation often precedes major market events, such as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Market participants are holding their breath, waiting for clarity on economic policies that could impact investor sentiment and, consequently, crypto valuations. Pre-FOMC Correction: Bitcoin’s recent dip is seen by many as a normal market adjustment, not a collapse. Anticipation Builds: The market is keenly awaiting signals from the FOMC that could dictate the next major trend. This phase is crucial for understanding the immediate future of BTC. Analysts are closely monitoring key price levels to gauge potential breakout or breakdown scenarios. It’s a classic example of market psychology at play, where uncertainty can lead to temporary stagnation before a decisive move. Could Bitcoin Price Target $143K? Analyst Insights Despite the current downturn, several prominent analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Their insights suggest that the recent correction might just be setting the stage for an impressive rally. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez, as reported by CoinDesk, has highlighted a significant potential upside. Martinez suggests that if Bitcoin price target manages to break above the crucial $120,000 resistance level, the path towards $143,000 could open up considerably. This projection is based on a weakening of upward resistance once that key psychological and technical barrier is surpassed. Trader Michaël van de Poppe echoes this sentiment, viewing the current market behavior as a healthy correction rather than a sign of a broader trend reversal. He emphasizes the importance of the $112,000 support level. According to van de Poppe, if BTC successfully holds this support, a robust rebound is highly probable, reaffirming the underlying strength of the asset. Navigating Key Resistance and Support Levels for Bitcoin Price Target Understanding the critical price zones is essential for any investor. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode provides valuable data, identifying the current price range as a key consolidation area. This means both buyers and sellers are actively engaged, creating a tug-of-war that defines the market’s immediate direction. Buying Pressure: Glassnode data indicates strong buying interest concentrated around the $111,000 mark. This suggests that many investors are keen to accumulate BTC at or below this level. Selling Pressure: Conversely, significant selling pressure is observed near $117,000. This acts as a short-term ceiling, where some holders might be looking to take profits. These levels are not arbitrary; they represent points where significant amounts of capital are positioned, making them pivotal for future price movements. A decisive break above $117,000 or below $111,000 could signal the next major trend. For the ambitious Bitcoin price target of $143K to be realized, overcoming these hurdles is paramount. What Does This Mean for Your Bitcoin Price Target Strategy? For investors and enthusiasts alike, the current market dynamics present both challenges and opportunities. While the pre-FOMC lull might test patience, the underlying analyst sentiment suggests a strong potential for upside. Actionable Insights: Monitor FOMC Announcements: Pay close attention to the Federal Reserve’s statements, as they often trigger immediate market reactions. Watch Key Levels: Keep an eye on the $112,000 support and $120,000 resistance levels. A sustained break above the latter could confirm the bullish outlook towards a higher Bitcoin price target . Consider Long-Term Potential: Analysts view this correction as normal, reinforcing the idea of Bitcoin’s resilience and growth potential. This period of consolidation could be a strategic entry or accumulation point for those with a long-term vision. The journey to a new all-time high is rarely a straight line, and these corrections are often part of a healthy market cycle. The Road Ahead: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Potential In conclusion, while Bitcoin is currently experiencing a pre-FOMC lull, the overall sentiment among analysts remains remarkably positive. The potential for BTC to not only recover but to surge past previous highs, possibly reaching a groundbreaking Bitcoin price target of $143,000, is a compelling prospect. This isn’t merely speculation; it’s a forecast supported by on-chain data and expert analysis. As the market navigates these critical junctures, staying informed and understanding the technical and fundamental indicators will be key to making informed decisions. The future of Bitcoin continues to look bright, with significant upside potential on the horizon. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the current outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) before the FOMC meeting? A: Bitcoin is currently in a short-term correction phase, often described as a pre-FOMC lull. Analysts generally view this as a normal market adjustment rather than a trend collapse, with potential for an upside if key support levels hold. Q2: What are the key price levels analysts are watching for Bitcoin? A: Analysts are closely monitoring the $112,000 level as crucial support. A break above $120,000 is seen as a significant resistance breakthrough that could pave the way to a higher Bitcoin price target . Q3: Who are the analysts providing these Bitcoin price target predictions? A: On-chain analyst Ali Martinez and trader Michaël van de Poppe are among those providing insights, with their analyses often reported by outlets like CoinDesk. Glassnode also contributes valuable on-chain data. Q4: What does Glassnode’s data reveal about Bitcoin’s current market? A: Glassnode identifies the current price zone as a key consolidation range. Their data indicates concentrated buying pressure around $111,000 and selling pressure near $117,000, defining the immediate market tug-of-war. Q5: How should investors approach Bitcoin’s current market phase? A: Investors should monitor FOMC announcements, watch key support ($112,000) and resistance ($120,000) levels, and consider the long-term potential.

Truth Social Introduces ‘Truth Predict’ According to a Tuesday press release , Truth Social users will have the opportunity to engage in prediction markets concerning a wide range of topics, including political elections, fluctuations in interest and inflation rates, commodity prices such as gold and crude oil, and events across major sports leagues. The new feature, called “Truth Predict,” provides real-time price updates. This will allow users to respond quickly to current events, similar to Kalshi and Polymarket. The latter is poised to re-enter the US market after receiving regulatory approval . Devin Nunes, Chairman and chief executive officer of Trump Media, expressed enthusiasm about this new collaboration, stating: We are thrilled to become the world’s first publicly traded social media platform to offer our users access to prediction markets. Truth Predict will empower our dedicated users to participate in prediction markets within a trusted framework, leveraging our social media platform to create unique avenues for discussion and comparison of their predictions. Trump Media’s Plan For A New CRO Treasury The event contracts will be provided through CDNA, which ensures a federally compliant method for accessing event contracts and making predictions related to politics, economics, finances, and sports, all integrated with Truth Social’s technology. Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and chief executive officer of Crypto.com, highlighted the potential of prediction markets, stating: Prediction markets are poised to become a multi-deca-billion dollar industry. Crypto.com has rapidly established itself as a trusted provider of prediction market services, and we are excited to collaborate with Truth Social to deliver the world’s first prediction markets accessible through a social media platform. Beta testing for this integration is expected to commence soon on Truth Social, followed by a full launch in the United States. Trump Media plans to expand the service globally once all necessary requirements are fulfilled. In line with this initiative, users of Truth Social and the Truth+ platform who hold Truth gems—earned through engagement on the platforms—will have the option to convert their gems into Crypto.Com’s native token Cronos (CRO), which can then be used to purchase Truth Predict contracts. This collaboration between Trump Media and Crypto.com builds on a recently established strategic partnership to introduce a CRO rewards system across the Truth Social and Truth+ platforms. Additionally, Trump Media Group is set to establish a new CRO-focused digital asset treasury (DAT), following a definitive agreement for a proposed business combination with Yorkville Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

Top Expert Forecasts Liquidity Surge With Fed’s QT Shift,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-a-crypto-melt-up-coming-top-expert-forecasts-liquidity-surge-with-feds-qt-shift/,"Market expert VirtualBacon recently suggested that the most significant event for the crypto industry this year is not the Bitcoin (BTC) Halving or the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but rather a potential shift in Federal Reserve (Fed) liquidity policy. After 18 months of tightening measures, the Fed is reportedly preparing to pause its quantitative tightening (QT) and may even initiate stealth quantitative easing (QE) once again. What’s Next For The Crypto Market In a recent post on social media platform X, VirtualBacon laid out a compelling argument linking liquidity pivots to altcoin cycles. In 2019, the Fed halted QT, which resulted in a rally for altcoins. Conversely, in 2022, when the Fed began QT, altcoins peaked. Now, as the Fed is expected to end QT in 2025, VirtualBacon anticipates a similar surge for altcoins. The correlation is clear: when the Fed increases liquidity, altcoins tend to rise. The pressing question now is when exactly QT will come to a close. Related Reading: The Next Chapter For Crypto: Legislative Clarity, Institutional Support Set Stage For Major Growth While the Fed may not explicitly label a shift as QE, the expert notes that the pivotal moment will arrive when they remove the language regarding “reducing the size of the balance sheet.” The last notable instance of this was during the 2019 repo crisis, when banks faced immediate cash shortages, prompting the Fed to inject $75 billion into the financial system. Although Powell claimed it was “not QE,” it effectively was, and following that intervention, Bitcoin tripled in value within months. CME FedWatch Tool Shows High Probability Of Rate Cuts Major financial institutions are already making predictions, with Goldman Sachs stating that the October meeting is the base case for QT to end, Bank of America expecting QT to cease by month-end, and Evercore indicating that the Fed is likely to signal an end to QT this week. The same indicators that caused market disruptions back in 2019 are signaling distress now. Regardless of official statements, it appears QT is nearing its conclusion, with stealth QE on the horizon. This shift would facilitate a return of liquidity to the markets, which historically has driven crypto prices. Liquidity acts as the fuel for market movements, and the Fed is poised to refill this tank. Related Reading: China Intensifies Crypto Crackdown With Latest Warning Against Stablecoins The CME FedWatch tool currently indicates a 96.7% probability of a rate cut this month and an 87.9% chance of another cut in December. Powell recently hinted that QT would conclude “in the coming months,” signaling an imminent pivot. M2 Money Supply Signals Upcoming Bitcoin Surge Despite the current market uncertainty, VirtualBacon asserts that Bitcoin has not reached its peak. Out of 30 historical indicators that typically signal a bull market peak, none have activated yet, with data indicating there is still room for growth. The global M2 money supply continues to rise, which historically leads Bitcoin prices by 10 to 12 weeks. The expert added that since the beginning of the month, this money supply has been increasing. This development indicates that Bitcoin’s next upward movement is already in the pipeline, albeit lagging behind the liquidity curve. Additionally, VirtualBacon forecasts that once the Fed pivots, a new altcoin season may commence.

Addressing Bobby A, he wrote that his colleague was “too focused on the small moves and not seeing the macro rotation that’s coming.” EGRAG CRYPTO linked this anticipated shift to potential global economic developments, referencing a possible “USA–China mega deal” and its impact on asset rotation toward cryptocurrencies. Macro Conditions and Market Cycle Outlook EGRAG CRYPTO’s view extends beyond XRP, touching on monetary policy and historical market behavior . He noted that “QT is still active. Rate cuts are barely starting,” suggesting that the final phase of the current cycle has yet to unfold. He compared present conditions to earlier market environments in 1999 and 2007, which he described as periods when markets surged before eventual declines. While his outlook remains assertive, EGRAG closed his remarks with a call for unity within the XRP community.

According to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, an increase in retail investor dip buying discussions, especially after a minor rebound, could surprisingly signal more downward pressure ahead. This insight challenges the common belief that buying during a downturn is always a smart move. Why Does Retail Investor Dip Buying Often Signal Trouble? Santiment’s analysis points to a fascinating historical pattern. When retail investors become vocal about retail investor dip buying , it has often preceded a short-term market bounce, only to be followed by another, more significant decline. It’s a counter-intuitive observation, suggesting that widespread optimism among individual traders might not be the bullish indicator many assume it to be. The firm emphasizes that the truly opportune buying moments typically emerge when retail investors are least expecting a recovery. This means that if everyone is talking about catching the falling knife, the market might still have more room to fall. Retail traders, according to Santiment, often misjudge the extent of a market correction after an initial drop, only to be surprised by subsequent price action. The Psychology Behind Retail Investor Dip Buying What drives this phenomenon? It largely boils down to market psychology. After an initial price drop, there’s a natural human tendency to look for a bottom. This often manifests as ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) on a potential rebound, leading to premature retail investor dip buying . However, the most significant market rebounds historically occur when optimism has completely evaporated, giving way to widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Consider these points: Premature Optimism: Retail investors often interpret a minor bounce as the start of a full recovery. Emotional Trading: Decisions are influenced by excitement or fear, rather than cold, hard analysis. Lack of Capitulation: True market bottoms are often marked by ‘capitulation,’ where even the most resilient investors give up, leading to extreme FUD. When Are the Real Buying Opportunities for Retail Investors? Santiment suggests that the best times to buy are precisely when the market feels the worst. When the general sentiment shifts from FOMO to intense FUD, and social media is filled with despair rather than discussions of retail investor dip buying , that’s often when the true turning points emerge. These periods of extreme pessimism can present genuine opportunities for long-term investors. How can you navigate these tricky waters? Monitor Sentiment: Pay attention to broader market sentiment indicators, not just price action. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of assets rather than short-term price swings. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Stick to a pre-defined investment strategy. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even during a perceived dip. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any investor. While the allure of retail investor dip buying is strong, especially after a market correction, Santiment’s data provides a valuable counter-narrative. It encourages a more cautious and data-driven approach, rather than simply following the crowd’s enthusiasm. In conclusion, while the idea of ‘buying the dip’ is popular, Santiment’s analysis offers a compelling warning: widespread discussion of retail investor dip buying might actually be a bearish signal. True buying opportunities often arise from deep market pessimism, not from optimistic chatter. By understanding market sentiment and historical patterns, investors can make more informed decisions and potentially avoid falling victim to common pitfalls. Stay vigilant and always conduct your own research! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ‘dip buying’ in the context of cryptocurrency? Dip buying refers to the strategy of purchasing an asset after its price has dropped, with the expectation that its value will soon rebound. It’s an attempt to buy low and sell high. Why does Santiment believe retail investor dip buying can signal further decline? Santiment’s analysis suggests that when a large number of retail investors are openly discussing and engaging in dip buying, it often indicates premature optimism. Historically, such collective enthusiasm has been followed by a brief rebound and then another, more significant market decline, as the true market bottom has not yet been reached. When is the best time to buy crypto, according to Santiment’s analysis? According to Santiment, the most significant rebounds tend to occur when market optimism (FOMO) has completely shifted to extreme fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). These periods of widespread pessimism, when retail investors are least expecting a recovery, often present the best long-term buying opportunities. How can retail investors avoid common pitfalls associated with dip buying? Retail investors can avoid pitfalls by focusing on long-term fundamentals, diversifying their portfolios, avoiding emotional trading decisions, and paying attention to broader market sentiment rather than just short-term price movements or social media hype. What is the difference between FOMO and FUD in crypto trading? FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is the anxiety that an investor might miss out on a profitable opportunity, often leading to impulsive buying during price surges. FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) refers to negative sentiment and skepticism surrounding an asset, often leading to selling during price drops or extreme market pessimism.

This growing pressure is forcing private banks and asset managers to integrate crypto services into their portfolios. A survey of 3,851 investors and 456 wealth management professionals conducted by Switzerland-based software firm Avaloq during the February-March 2025 period revealed that 39% of high-net-worth individuals in the United Arab Emirates own crypto assets, but only 20% of them invest through a traditional asset manager. Known for its oil wealth, low-tax structure, and foreign investor-friendly environment, the UAE has become one of the world's most important crypto centers, particularly thanks to the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which Dubai established in 2022. Related News: Watch Out: Binance Removes 18 Altcoins from Pre-Listing Pool - They Decided Not to List Them The main reasons for the corporate finance world's shyness away from crypto are technical risks like high volatility, complex technology, and wallet management. According to Avaloq data, the main concerns of UAE investors who don't own crypto are market volatility (38%), lack of knowledge (36%), and distrust of exchanges (32%). With the crypto market rebounding and Bitcoin reaching new record highs, the number of crypto millionaires worldwide has reached 241,700, a 40% increase from last year.

This monumental achievement, as reported by CoinDesk, isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of a significant shift in investor sentiment and a burgeoning demand for regulated cryptocurrency products on a trusted platform like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. What’s Driving the Surge in CME Crypto Futures? What exactly does this record-breaking CME crypto futures open interest signify? Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. When this number rises, it typically indicates new money flowing into the market, suggesting increased participation and a strong conviction among traders. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds a unique position in the crypto landscape. It’s a highly regulated and respected financial institution, traditionally catering to institutional investors. The surge in XRP and SOL futures on this platform therefore points to a growing appetite from larger, more traditional financial players who prioritize compliance and security. This influx suggests a maturing market where sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable engaging with digital assets, albeit through regulated avenues. It’s a testament to the evolving perception of cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to legitimate investment vehicles. Why XRP and SOL? Understanding Investor Preference in CME Crypto Futures The focus on XRP and SOL in particular for these record-breaking CME crypto futures is noteworthy. Both cryptocurrencies offer distinct value propositions that appeal to different segments of the market. XRP , associated with Ripple Labs, aims to facilitate fast and low-cost international payments. Its ongoing legal clarity in the U.S. has likely bolstered investor confidence, making it a more attractive option for institutions seeking regulatory certainty. SOL , the native token of the Solana blockchain, is renowned for its high transaction throughput and low fees, making it a favorite for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. Its robust ecosystem continues to attract developers and users, driving demand. The fact that these assets are seeing such significant open interest on CME underscores a strategic move by institutions to gain exposure to these specific blockchain technologies and their underlying utility, rather than purely speculative plays. The Institutional Embrace: Benefits and Future Outlook for CME Crypto Futures The growing institutional interest reflected in the CME crypto futures data brings several significant benefits to the broader cryptocurrency market. Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital typically leads to deeper liquidity, making markets more stable and efficient. Reduced Volatility: Institutional participation can help temper extreme price swings, contributing to a more mature market environment. Legitimacy and Adoption: The endorsement from traditional financial giants through platforms like CME lends greater legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, paving the way for wider mainstream adoption. Looking ahead, this trend suggests a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into traditional finance. We can anticipate more regulated products, clearer guidelines, and a continued influx of sophisticated capital into the crypto space, driving innovation and growth. However, it’s crucial for investors to remember that while institutional interest in CME crypto futures is a positive sign, the crypto market remains dynamic. Due diligence and understanding the underlying assets are always paramount. In conclusion, the record-shattering open interest in XRP and SOL futures on CME is a powerful testament to the accelerating institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. It signals a new era where digital assets are increasingly recognized as viable and valuable components of diversified investment portfolios. This milestone reinforces the growing maturity and legitimacy of the crypto market, promising an exciting future for both seasoned and new investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is “open interest” in crypto futures? Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, like futures or options, that have not yet been settled or closed. A rise in open interest indicates new money entering the market, signaling increased participation and confidence. Why is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) significant for crypto futures? The CME is a highly regulated and respected traditional financial institution. Its involvement in crypto futures provides a regulated, secure platform that attracts institutional investors who prioritize compliance and stability, thereby lending legitimacy to the crypto market. What factors are driving institutional interest in XRP and SOL? XRP benefits from its focus on fast international payments and increasing regulatory clarity. SOL, as the native token of the Solana blockchain, is attractive due to its high transaction speed, low fees, and robust ecosystem for dApps and NFTs. How does increased institutional involvement benefit the crypto market? Institutional involvement typically brings increased liquidity, which can lead to more stable and efficient markets. It also helps reduce volatility and contributes to the broader legitimacy and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Is investing in CME crypto futures the same as buying actual XRP or SOL? No, investing in CME crypto futures is not the same as directly buying the underlying assets. Futures contracts allow investors to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning it. They are derivatives and carry different risks and mechanisms compared to spot market purchases. Did you find this article insightful?

The asset has rebounded by more than 50% since the all-time low registered during the market-wide crash on October 10. Still, it remains 91% down from its all-time high on February 26. In terms of why this substantial PI token surge is taking place today, the answer might lie outside the box. The official news channel of the Pi Network Core Team has only recycled information about the number of verified users, which was already reported days ago. However, Cointelegraph posted about rumors that went live a few days ago, indicating that Pi Network has joined the ISO 20022 race alongside other reputable names such as Ripple and Stellar. Although these speculations are not new, the publicity coming from a big news media could be the catalyst for today’s impressive surge that drove PI above $0.26 once again. Aside from a 16% pump today, the asset is also up by 30% weekly. Nevertheless, the ever-vocal Pi Network community was quick to pick up the price rally and outlined some big predictions. Another X account dedicated to covering PI news with over 45,000 followers said the asset’s chart looks “exceptional and bullish” and compared it to a previous massive surge from SOL. This chart looks exceptional and bullish.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said on Wednesday that the Federal Court granted interim travel restraint orders against Xu, also known as Zijing Xu, on Oct. 20. The orders prohibit him from leaving or attempting to leave Australia until Dec. 20. ASIC sought the restrictions on an ex parte basis, meaning Xu has not yet had the opportunity to respond in court. The matter will return for an inter partes hearing, where all parties can be heard, on October 30. ASIC Probe Targets Blockchain Global’s Failed Exchange and Missing Funds The investigation centers on Blockchain Global’s role in operating the ACX Exchange, a now-defunct crypto platform that allowed customers to buy, sell and store digital assets. The exchange collapsed in late 2019 after users began reporting difficulties accessing their funds. Blockchain Global entered liquidation in Feb. 2022. Liquidators later told ASIC that the firm owed around A$58m ($37.3m) to unsecured creditors as of Oct. 2023. The regulator launched a formal probe into the company and its directors in early 2024. ASIC said it applied for the travel ban over concerns Xu could leave the country while the investigation is ongoing. ASIC Targets Troubled Crypto Firms to Restore Market Credibility The case marks another move by Australian authorities to tighten oversight of failed crypto ventures and recover funds for affected investors. ASIC has previously pursued actions against multiple digital asset firms that collapsed during the sector’s 2019–2022 downturn. Blockchain Global, once a high-profile player in Australia’s blockchain scene, operated several crypto businesses and positioned itself as a bridge between traditional finance and emerging digital markets. Its collapse, however, left creditors and customers facing millions in potential losses. Court Order Keeps Xu in Australia as ASIC Reviews Potential Law Breaches Court documents show that ASIC’s investigation is examining whether company directors breached corporate or financial laws in managing customer funds and maintaining solvency. Xu, a co-founder of Blockchain Global, was one of several executives associated with the exchange. He has not been charged with any criminal offenses, and the court’s current order is a civil measure to ensure his availability for ongoing proceedings.

Recently, a significant development emerged from one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. Binance has announced a crucial Binance delisting event, impacting several spot trading pairs. This move requires immediate attention from traders holding positions in the affected assets. Understanding the Latest Binance Delisting Announcement Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, recently made an announcement that has caught the attention of its user base. The exchange will be delisting three specific spot trading pairs. This means that after a certain date, users will no longer be able to trade these pairs on Binance’s spot market. Affected Pairs: ATA/BTC, LAYER/BNB, and POWR/ETH Delisting Date & Time: October 31, at 3:00 a.m. UTC For traders involved with these particular altcoins, understanding the implications of this Binance delisting is paramount. It signals a shift in available trading options and necessitates prompt action to manage existing holdings. Why Do Crypto Trading Pairs Get Delisted? Exchange delistings, while impactful, are not uncommon in the dynamic crypto space. Binance’s delisting decisions are typically based on a rigorous review process. Several factors can contribute to an exchange deciding to remove a trading pair. Low Liquidity: If a pair consistently has low trading volume, it can lead to poor market depth and slippage for traders. Project Performance: The underlying project’s development, team commitment, and overall market interest play a significant role. A lack of progress or community engagement can be a red flag. Regulatory Changes: Evolving regulatory landscapes can sometimes force exchanges to delist certain assets to remain compliant. User Feedback: Although less common, user sentiment and feedback can also influence these decisions. Ultimately, these actions aim to maintain a healthy and efficient trading environment for the majority of users. While it might be inconvenient for some, it often reflects a strategic move by the exchange to optimize its offerings. Navigating Binance Delisting: What Are Your Options? If you hold any of the assets involved in this Binance delisting , it’s essential to act swiftly and strategically. Ignoring the announcement could lead to challenges in managing your funds later on. Here are your primary options: Sell Your Assets: You can sell your ATA, LAYER, or POWR tokens against their respective quoted assets (BTC, BNB, or ETH) before the delisting deadline. This allows you to convert them into more liquid cryptocurrencies. Withdraw Your Assets: If you prefer to hold onto your tokens, you can withdraw them from Binance to an external wallet that supports the specific cryptocurrency. This gives you full control over your assets. Convert to Other Pairs: While the specific pairs are being delisted, the tokens themselves might still be available for trading against other major cryptocurrencies on Binance, or on other exchanges. Always check the available pairs. Remember, the goal is to avoid being caught off guard. Make sure to complete any necessary actions well before the October 31st deadline to ensure a smooth transition for your portfolio. Beyond the Delisting: Proactive Trading Strategies This particular Binance delisting event serves as a valuable reminder for all cryptocurrency traders about the importance of proactive risk management. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and changes like delistings are part of the landscape. To mitigate future risks: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across various assets reduces exposure to the risks associated with any single project or trading pair. Stay Informed: Regularly check official exchange announcements, project updates, and market news. Subscribing to newsletters and following reputable crypto news sources can keep you ahead. Understand Liquidity: Before investing, always consider a token’s trading volume and market depth. Higher liquidity generally means easier entry and exit points. Have a Contingency Plan: Always know what you would do if one of your holdings faces a delisting or other significant market event. By adopting these strategies, you can better navigate the unpredictable nature of the crypto market and protect your investments. In conclusion, Binance’s upcoming delisting of ATA/BTC, LAYER/BNB, and POWR/ETH spot trading pairs on October 31st is a significant event for affected traders. While such changes are a natural part of the evolving crypto ecosystem, they underscore the need for vigilance and adaptability. By understanding the reasons behind delistings and taking timely action, traders can effectively manage their portfolios and continue to thrive in the dynamic world of digital assets. Stay informed, act decisively, and always prioritize risk management. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does “delisting a spot trading pair” mean? A1: Delisting a spot trading pair means that the exchange will no longer support trading that specific combination of cryptocurrencies (e.g., ATA against BTC) on its spot market. You won’t be able to buy or sell using that pair after the announced date. Q2: Will I lose my funds if my tokens are part of a Binance delisting? A2: No, you will not automatically lose your funds. Binance typically provides ample time for users to either sell their tokens against other available pairs, convert them, or withdraw them to an external wallet. It’s crucial to take action before the delisting deadline. Q3: Can I still trade ATA, LAYER, or POWR tokens on Binance after October 31st? A3: While the specific ATA/BTC, LAYER/BNB, and POWR/ETH pairs will be delisted, the individual tokens (ATA, LAYER, POWR) might still be available for trading against other cryptocurrencies on Binance or other exchanges. You would need to check the available trading pairs for each token after the delisting. Q4: How can I stay informed about future Binance delisting announcements? A4: The best way to stay informed is to regularly check Binance’s official announcements page, follow their official social media channels, and subscribe to reputable cryptocurrency news outlets. Setting up notifications for key exchange updates can also be helpful. Q5: What should I do if I forget to act before the delisting deadline? A5: If you miss the deadline for trading, your funds will typically remain in your Binance wallet. You might still be able to withdraw them, but you won’t be able to trade them on Binance. In such cases, contact Binance customer support for guidance on how to proceed. Found this article helpful? Share these crucial insights with your trading community on social media!

South Korean crypto exchange giant, Upbit, has just made a significant announcement: the official Upbit ENSO listing . This highly anticipated move means that Enso (ENSO) is now available for trading on Upbit’s KRW, BTC, and USDT pairs, starting at 8:00 a.m. UTC today.

Enso (ENSO) is more than just another token; it’s a decentralized protocol designed to optimize on-chain trading strategies.

By aggregating liquidity and routing orders efficiently, Enso seeks to provide a seamless and cost-effective trading experience. The significance of the Upbit ENSO listing cannot be overstated. Upbit is one of the largest and most influential crypto exchanges globally, particularly in the Asian market.

For traders, the Upbit ENSO listing presents fresh avenues for portfolio diversification and potential gains. The availability of ENSO on KRW pairs is particularly crucial, as it allows direct access for Korean investors, who form a substantial part of Upbit’s user base. Furthermore, the BTC and USDT pairs offer flexibility for international traders. It’s essential for traders to understand the immediate implications. New listings often experience significant price volatility due to initial speculative interest.

The Upbit ENSO listing provides an excellent opportunity to dive into a project focused on improving on-chain trading efficiency. What Are the Opportunities and Risks Following the Upbit ENSO Listing? Every new listing brings both opportunities and risks. The opportunity lies in being an early participant in a project that could see significant growth due to increased adoption and liquidity. Enso’s focus on optimizing trades addresses a real need in the DeFi ecosystem, potentially attracting a dedicated user base. However, the risks associated with the Upbit ENSO listing include high price volatility, especially in the initial hours or days. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and new tokens are often subject to speculative pumps and dumps. Traders should approach with caution, setting clear entry and exit strategies, and never investing more than they can afford to lose. Thorough due diligence is always advisable. In conclusion, the Upbit ENSO listing is a monumental event for the Enso protocol, propelling it onto a global stage with enhanced accessibility and liquidity. For traders, it signifies a new frontier for exploration within the dynamic crypto market. While the opportunities are exciting, a prudent and well-researched approach is crucial to navigate the inherent volatility of new listings.

Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal On Tuesday, the Union of the Right for the Republic (UDR) party, led by Eric Ciotti, was set to introduce a pro-crypto bill in the French Parliament to address three key areas of France’s crypto ecosystem. Gregory Raymond, co-founder of The Big Whale, shared the news on X, noting that this is the first time such comprehensive legislation has been introduced in the country. “This text contains several proposals that the sector has championed for many years, as well as other unprecedented ones,” he stated, noting that it follows the steps of US President Donald Trump, “whose commitment to this issue has helped attract a new electorate that few had previously courted.” According to the post, the main policy proposed a French Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) with the creation of a Public Administrative Establishment (EPA) to diversify foreign exchange reserves and protect the country’s financial sovereignty by building a “national digital gold” reserve. The EPA would be dedicated to holding and managing 2% of the total Bitcoin supply, or 420,000 BTC, within the next 7-8 years. Notably, the strategic reserve would be funded by public Bitcoin mining using surplus nuclear and hydroelectric power. Additionally, the text proposed using systematic retention of BTC seized during legal proceedings, payments of taxes made in Bitcoin, and the allocation of “a quarter of the amounts collected through the Livret A and LDDS savings schemes” for daily BTC purchases on the secondary market to fund the strategic reserve. Crypto Bill Tackles Stablecoins, Industry Support The bill also encourages euro-denominated stablecoins, recognizing these digital assets as a credible alternative to traditional payment systems and proposing key regulations for the sector. Among the proposals, the text suggested a €200 daily cap for euro-pegged stablecoins , which would be exempt from taxation and social contributions. It would also authorize the use of euro-denominated stablecoins for paying taxes. The policy reportedly aims to ease the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) to facilitate the issuance of stablecoins by European banks and companies, a topic recently discussed by the global watchdogs. At the same time, it seeks to oppose the euro-based Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) at the EU Council, which is considered to centralize and pose a threat to financial freedom. Moreover, the proposed legislation also addresses energy and financial barriers, adapting electricity taxation for crypto mining by creating a progressive, dynamic excise duty based on price tiers, experimenting with flexible TURPE tariffs for flexible and adjustable consumer sites, and integrating Bitcoin and other crypto assets into the stock savings plan (PEA) via exchange-traded notes. In his X post, Raymond explained that the proposed bill’s chances of passing are low, as it is an independent legislative proposal unrelated to the Finance Bill currently in the French parliament and was designed without the collaboration of other political parties. “It therefore has little chance of being adopted by the Parliamentary Bureau due to the UDR’s limited weight in the chamber (16 MPs out of 577),” he added. Nonetheless, he affirmed that despite the extremely low probability of advancing, it demonstrates UDR’s “ambition to position itself as the party best able to defend the interests of the French crypto ecosystem.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin reserve|btc|BTCUSDT|European Union|France|France Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|French lawmakers|French National Assembly|French Parliament|SBR|Stablecoins|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-29 07:00:47

Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution Shows Where Resistance & Support Are Strongest In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about where support and resistance levels lie for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). This indicator basically tells us about the total amount of supply that last changed hands at the various price levels that the cryptocurrency has visited in its history. Related Reading: Solana Eyes $210 Before Its Next Major Move—Uptrend Or Fakeout Ahead? Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in this metric over the last few months. As is visible in the graph, the CBD highlights two levels for holding a dense amount of the cryptocurrency’s supply (shaded in red). The lower of these levels is situated near $111,000. A large chunk of buying at this mark occurred during the recent bearish phase in the asset. The other level is located around $117,000, made up of investors who bought during the price rally to the all-time high (ATH). Naturally, these buyers would be underwater right now, while those who purchased at $111,000 would be in profit. Generally, holders are sensitive to retests of their cost basis and can show some kind of reaction during one. Since these two levels host the cost basis of a significant amount of investors, it’s possible that when BTC will revisit them, some panic selling or buying will crop up. Which behavior would be dominant usually comes down to the market mood and the direction of the retest. When the retest occurs from above, investors may choose to buy more, believing the same cost basis level would result in profits again in the future. Similarly, holders who were in loss prior to the retest can react by selling, fearing that the asset will drop again in the future. Considering these effects, the $111,000 may be considered a key support cushion for Bitcoin, while $117,000 a resistance barrier. “This range defines the current battleground between recent buyers and profit-takers,” noted Glassnode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Returns To Neutral As BTC Breaks $115,000 It now remains to be seen which level BTC will visit next and how its retest will go. “A break in either direction could set the tone for the next major move,” explained the analytics firm. In some other news, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator has been sitting at cycle lows recently, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. This oscillator is based on the SSR, which compares the Bitcoin circulating supply against the supply of the stablecoins. The SSR Oscillator is sitting at a low level at the moment, which indicates that the BTC supply is low compared to stablecoin liquidity. “Historically, such periods precede stronger bid-side support when market confidence returns,” said the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a retrace toward $113,500 earlier, but the coin has been quick to bounce back as its price has returned to $115,400.

Here’s What XRP Army Should Expect,https://timestabloid.com/the-wait-for-ripple-national-bank-two-days-heres-what-xrp-army-should-expect/,"Ripple’s push to expand its footprint into traditional banking is approaching a decisive point. The company’s 120-day review period for its application to establish the Ripple National Trust Bank (RNTB) ends on October 30, marking a significant moment in Ripple’s regulatory and strategic timeline. Filed on July 2 with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the application aims to create a federally regulated entity headquartered in New York, with Ripple Labs Inc. listed as the sponsoring organization. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a prominent crypto pundit, recently highlighted the approaching October 30 deadline and shared details of the leadership lineup for the proposed bank. The filing, signed by key Ripple executives, proposes the name Ripple National Trust Bank and lists its principal office at 111-119 West 19th Street, Floor 6, New York. Ripple’s 120-day review for its National Bank license ends in 2 days The full leadership lineup for (RNTB): John (Jack) McDonald – President John Zavaglia – Chief Operating & Trust Officer Stuart Alderoty – Chief Legal Officer Timothy Francis Keaney –… pic.twitter.com/CFLClcKRSa — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 28, 2025 Leadership and Strategic Direction The document identifies five key organizers, including John (Jack) McDonald (President), John Zavaglia (Chief Operating and Trust Officer), Stuart Alderoty (Chief Legal Officer), Timothy Francis Keaney (Institutional Strategy), and David Puth (Risk and Global Policy). This group represents a cross-section of Ripple’s leadership and signals the company’s intent to operate within the U.S. banking framework under direct federal oversight. This leadership structure positions Ripple National Trust Bank as an institution to integrate blockchain-based solutions with traditional finance. Potential Benefits for XRP and the Market If approved, Ripple National Trust Bank could play a central role in expanding the utility of XRP by creating regulated on-ramps for financial institutions. The community is excited, and some believe the OCC’s approval could send XRP to $10 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The trust bank would allow Ripple to custody digital assets, process settlements, and facilitate cross-border transactions within a federally supervised structure. Such developments could strengthen institutional confidence in using XRP as a bridge asset for payments and liquidity. Analysts suggest that a national trust bank designation would allow Ripple to streamline operations with fewer state-by-state regulatory barriers. This could accelerate partnerships with major banks and corporations seeking compliance-assured access to blockchain settlement tools. As adoption increases , XRP’s transactional demand could grow, potentially improving its market position. The OCC’s decision, expected shortly after the 120-day review period concludes, may set a precedent for how blockchain companies integrate within the U.S. financial system. The creation of a federally regulated trust bank would represent a major milestone for Ripple and XRP following years of navigating regulatory uncertainty.

After falling over 7% on October 10, Bitcoin has now found strong support at a major upward-sloping trendline. It’s worth noting that this is the same trendline that has held Bitcoin’s upward momentum ever since November 2022. In fact, the last two contact points with this trendline resulted in new all-time highs. So, going by this alone – and considering that another Fed rate cut could be just around the corner – there’s a high likelihood we could see a new ATH in the next few days. That said, given that Bitcoin today is not far from its mid May price (~$112K), speculation is rife about whether the token has lost steam. Bitcoin may need a deeper correction before setting the stage for another rally to new highs. To find out what’s what, we turned to DeepSeek, one of the most powerful AI chatbots out there. It swept through not only real-time price movements and industry updates but also what both big and small crypto analysts are saying across social platforms. DeepSeek was quick to filter out relevant Bitcoin chart analyses. Chief among them was one by @CryptooELITES, who has more than 258K followers on X. The analyst switched to Bitcoin’s weekly chart to show that in March, the token bounced 70% after a successful retest of a breakout from a major resistance line that had held the token down since April 2021. And now, $BTC is once again forming that exact same pattern. According to this analysis, we could see a similar leg-up this time around – remember, history tends to repeat itself – meaning Bitcoin could be headed for the $190K mark in the next few weeks. Exciting, right? After all, this gives you the opportunity to back low-cap altcoins that could ride $BTC’s momentum all the way to the moon. Here are our top three suggestions for the best crypto to buy now ahead of a $BTC rally. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin L2 for Solana-Like Speeds & Web3 Support Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is arguably the most promising way to ride Bitcoin’s upcoming rally – primarily because of its under-the-radar, low-priced nature. Currently in its presale phase, one $HYPER token is available for just $0.013185, and according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , it could soar 1,420% to reach $0.02 by the end of 2026. So, what is Bitcoin Hyper ? It’s a game-changing altcoin building the ‘best-ever’ Layer-2 (L2) solution for Bitcoin. It’ll integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to massively boost Bitcoin’s real-world utility. With this tech, the new L2 will increase Bitcoin’s throughput from the current 7 transactions per second to thousands, as it will use parallel execution – all while lowering costs and maintaining Bitcoin’s native security. Additionally, Hyper’s SVM will enable developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) – something not possible before within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Hyper’s non-custodial canonical bridge will let you convert your Layer-1 Bitcoin into wrapped, L2-compatible tokens, allowing you to seamlessly interact with the SVM-powered Web3 ecosystem. This means you’ll soon be able to access high-speed DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, governance platforms, lending, staking, and gaming dApps, all compatible with $BTC. Get $HYPER tokens and join the Hyper DAO. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Next Potential Dogecoin Eyeing Insane Virality Maxi Doge ($MAXI) gives you a rare opportunity to turn back the clock and ride Dogecoin’s initial pumps. How so? Because Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin – one who’s aggressively building a loyal fleet of HODLers to take revenge on his elder brother. You see, Dogecoin is the reason Maxi had to grow up in loneliness. The OG crypto hogged all the limelight thanks to its fun-loving, celebrity-backed status. However, $MAXI used this setback to hit the gym, bulk up with caffeine shots and protein shakes, and dedicate his life to overthrowing Dogecoin as the best meme coin in the world. To achieve this, Maxi’s developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total token supply for marketing, including paid PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes. Plus, based on our $MAXI price prediction , a $100 investment today could potentially turn into $2,100 by the end of 2026, as $MAXI could reach a high of $0.0058 in just a few months. It’s currently available for just $0.0002655. In addition to raw gains, buying $MAXI will also unlock holder-exclusive events such as weekly trading competitions and leaderboard rewards. On top of that, $MAXI plans to partner with futures platforms, aiming for dominance across both CEXs/ DEXs and the derivatives trading market, right alongside his arch-rival $DOGE. Buy $MAXI and ride the new Doge’s pump. 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Viral Meme Coin Ready to Rally Again OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) , Donald Trump’s very own crypto coin, had a breathtaking start. Soon after its launch in the third week of January, it skyrocketed over 2,000% in just a couple of days, riding the popularity of the ‘crypto president’ of the United States. Since then, Trump has consistently rallied for pro-crypto causes. Still, that support has arguably not been reflected in the price of the $TRUMP coin, primarily due to the tariff wars and his somewhat controversial personality. But the token has now found strong support around the $5.3 level, and looks primed for a strong rebound. It’s currently challenging a major downward-sloping resistance line that has been pushing prices lower since February this year. Sure, this is an important resistance level, but given that it has already been tested over six times, there’s a high likelihood of a breakout now. If that happens, we could see a sharp run-up to at least the $24.5 level – a nearly 215% gain from current levels. The most recent fundamental catalysts behind this potential rally include Trump’s pardoning of Binance’s founder CZ and his push to appoint Mike Selig – an openly pro-crypto figure – as the new CFTC lead.

Recap : With Bitcoin rebounding from strong trendline support, now’s the time to load up on low-priced gems like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) before the next big breakout. Disclaimer : Invest in crypto only after doing your own research. The market is highly unpredictable, and none of the above is financial advice.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/comprehensive-report-on-ripples-xrp-current-status-released-does-it-look-healthy-here-are-the-details/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm Messari announced in its Q3 State of the XRP Ledger report that the XRP ecosystem performed strongly in the third quarter and made significant infrastructure improvements for enterprise-level use. According to the report, XRP closed the quarter at $2.85, a 27.2% increase, reaching its all-time high. Its market capitalization reached $170.3 billion, outperforming BTC, ETH, and SOL, which grew by only 13.3% combined during the same period. Messari's report argues that XRP Ledger (XRPL) now has enterprise-grade infrastructure for identity verification, financial compliance, and privacy. This includes storing the parameters of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) via multi-purpose tokens (MPTs), providing privacy protection with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and offering regulatory compliance with KYC/AML-verified access credentials. Messari states that these features will position XRPL for the forefront of corporate finance, DeFi, and asset tokenization. Related News: Nasdaq-Listed Company Moves to Acquire 10 Percent of This Altcoin's Supply The report notes that the tokenized real-world assets (RWA) market has gained significant momentum on XRPL. In the third quarter, RWA market capitalization on XRPL increased by 215% to $364.2 million. This growth was driven by projects such as Ondo Finance's OUSG treasury fund, Guggenheim's digital commercial paper, and tokenized real estate issued by Ctrl Alt. Furthermore, Ripple's dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, rose 34.7% quarter-over-quarter to reach $88.8 million in market capitalization, becoming the largest stablecoin on XRPL. The report, highlighting XRPL's deflationary nature, states that transaction fees are not distributed to validators but are burned directly, reducing the supply. Since the network's inception, 14.2 million XRP (approximately $40.5 million) has been permanently burned. However, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP each month, with unused tokens being locked back into escrow accounts. Messari states that this system will gradually release the remaining 35 billion XRP into circulation. Activity on the XRPL network also accelerated in the third quarter. The average daily transaction count increased by 8.9% to 1.8 million, while the number of daily active addresses increased by 15.4% to 25,300. The number of new addresses increased by a remarkable 46.3% to 447,200. While the total number of addresses has risen to 6.9 million, Messari stated that this data is more reliable than other networks, as the 1 XRP deposit requirement to open an account on XRPL prevents the creation of spam accounts. Looking at transaction types, the most frequently used transactions on XRPL are Payment (value transfer) and OfferCreate (limit order creation). OfferCreate transactions support transaction flow through the order book on XRPL's built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure. This demonstrates that the XRP Ledger is evolving from a mere transfer network to a fully developed ecosystem of on-chain liquidity and financial instruments. *This is not investment advice.

ETH’s Fusaka mainnet activation is expected before the end of the year. After successive activations on Holesky and Sepolia earlier this month, Ethereum’s hard fork activation on Hoodi represents the third and final testnet deployment this year. The Ethereum Foundation previously predicted that Fusaka’s mainnet launch would begin at least 30 days after the Hoodi testing. Fusaka upgrade seeks to expand ETH’s scalability, efficiency, and security Ethereum’s next major upgrade, Fusaka, is now live on the Hoodi network! ✅ Fusaka mainnet activation is scheduled for December 3rd. Fusaka introduces multiple EIPs to improve scalability, strengthen security, and reduce costs. The upgrade will unlock the next phase of rollup… pic.twitter.com/VQkosIouZQ — Consensys.eth (@Consensys) October 28, 2025 Ethereum core developers had also scheduled the hard fork for December 3. The developers announced the launch date of the upgrade in the ACDC #165 developer call. The hard fork was activated on the Holesky testnet on October 1 and on the Sepolia testnet on October 14. Ethereum’s latest hard fork on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is aimed at establishing backend improvements to boost the efficiency, scalability, and security of the largest smart contract blockchain. Fusaka aims to increase ETH’s block gas limit from 30 million to 150 million units, aimed at supporting more transactions. The upgrade also seeks to expand blob capacity and introduce new node security features. Fusaka will also include about a dozen Ethereum Improvement Proposals. The upgrade will primarily include EIP-7594, which introduces Peer Data Availability Sampling, also known as PeerDAS. PeerDAS enables validators to verify large datasets, or blobs, by sampling small portions from peer nodes instead of downloading entire datasets. The upgrade enables validators to survey data blocks rather than full blobs, thereby improving data availability for Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem. The next hard fork follows the audit contest for Fusaka launched by the Ethereum Foundation four weeks ago. The contest offered up to $2 million in rewards for security researchers who detect bugs before the hard fork reaches mainnet. The audit contest, which ran from September 15 through October 13, was hosted on Web3 security platform Sherlock and co-sponsored by Gnosis and Lido. The Ethereum Foundation revealed that the contest also came with 2x rewards multipliers in week one and 1.5x in week two. Ethereum’s last major upgrade, Pectra, was launched approximately six months before the introduction of the Fusaka hard fork. According to bi-weekly core dev calls, Ethereum researchers are already planning the roadmap for the next major protocol upgrade, Glamsterdam. The next hard fork will focus on faster block times and scalability enhancements, including the full EVM Object Format. Tomasz K. Stanczak, the Ethereum Foundation’s co-executive director, previously urged core teams to prioritize the Fusaka hard fork and pause forward-looking debates about Glamsterdam. The Glansterdam upgrade is scheduled for early 2026. In August, Stanczak called for coordination among the Ethereum community to ensure there are no delays to Fusaka. He warned at the time that slippage in coordination was putting deadlines at risk. “I have suggested coordinators a few weeks ago to stop discussing Glamsterdam and focus on the delivery of Fusaka. Maybe sometimes less ACD calls may help with the process? Maybe the future fork calls should not be happening when the current fork testnet timelines are at risk?” – Tomasz Stanczak , Co-Executive Director at the Ethereum Foundation. The Glamsterdam upgrade is expected to include headline items such as enshrined proposer-builder separation (ePBS) at the protocol level—the upgrade blocks level access lists (EIP-7928) on the execution side.

Traders often prioritize speed, while liquidity providers focus on efficient asset allocation and security. Developers, meanwhile, need infrastructure that reduces complexity when building cross-chain tools. The challenge is that many crypto presale projects highlight innovation but struggle to solve the real frictions across DeFi. Mono Protocol enters the scene aiming to address these barriers through a modular, chain-abstracted approach that’s already drawing strong engagement in its ongoing presale. How Mono Protocol’s ecosystem solves DeFi pain points The 2025 crypto presale market features countless projects, yet few focus on solving structural DeFi challenges. Mono Protocol takes a different path, offering infrastructure-level solutions to unify the blockchain ecosystem. One of the biggest issues users face is multi-chain fragmentation. Assets are scattered across networks, making transfers inefficient. Mono Protocol simplifies this by offering seamless asset management across chains. Bridging is another pain point. Long wait times and high fees often make moving tokens between networks inconvenient. Through its integrated infrastructure, Mono Protocol reduces those inefficiencies, ensuring faster and more reliable execution. It also addresses MEV exploitation, a problem that frequently causes value loss for traders. Mono Protocol’s architecture is designed to minimize these vulnerabilities, protecting users from front-running and sandwich attacks. Finally, developers benefit from simplified tools that reduce the need for complex infrastructure, helping them deploy and scale cross-chain applications more efficiently. Together, these solutions position Mono Protocol as one of the few crypto presales solving practical problems rather than just introducing another token. Momentum builds as Stage 15 nears completion Momentum is often an indicator of strong market confidence in a presale’s long-term potential. Mono Protocol’s Stage 15 demonstrates this clearly. This stage prices tokens at $0.0450, ahead of a planned launch price of $0.500, offering early participants a significant advantage. The consistent participation from both retail and institutional investors suggests growing confidence in Mono Protocol’s model and its long-term utility. What’s notable is the inclusivity of the presale. Participants can use over 200 different assets to purchase tokens, lowering entry barriers for users from ecosystems such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. This flexibility highlights Mono Protocol’s focus on accessibility — a feature many competing presales overlook. Mono Protocol is gearing up for a major phase of development with three key events ahead. The Smart Contract Audit begins on October 30, ensuring transparency and system reliability. Next, the Launch Beta kicks off on November 7, allowing users to explore and test the platform’s new features. Finally, on November 13, the CEO Announcement and AMA will connect the team with the community to share exciting updates and upcoming plans.

The Reward Hub isn’t just about earning, it’s about being part of a collective vision for a unified Web3. Start today and experience how interaction becomes innovation within Mono Protocol’s ecosystem. Web3 integrations strengthening cross-chain infrastructure Mono Protocol’s vision extends beyond token sales. Its partnerships with key Web3 players form the foundation of its interoperability network. The first is LI.FI, a leading cross-chain bridge aggregator. Through this integration, Mono Protocol ensures smoother asset transfers and better liquidity aggregation across blockchains. The second is Celestia, which brings modular scalability. By separating consensus and data availability layers, it allows Mono Protocol to scale operations without compromising decentralization. Lastly, Chainlink integration adds secure and verifiable oracle data, ensuring accurate on-chain information for pricing and execution. Together, these integrations create a foundation that combines performance, security, and decentralization — elements critical for sustainable Web3 growth. Why Mono Protocol stands out in 2025’s presale market While many crypto presales rely on hype, Mono Protocol focuses on function. It directly addresses real issues that limit DeFi’s accessibility and scalability, creating infrastructure-level value that goes beyond speculation. With Stage 14 raised $2.6M, the project’s steady progress and technical depth suggest strong alignment between market demand and real-world application. Its integrations with LI.FI, Celestia, and Chainlink add credibility to its mission of making DeFi and Web3 development more efficient, secure, and connected. For anyone tracking the 2025 presale landscape, Mono Protocol stands out not for promises of quick returns, but for its potential to reshape how blockchain ecosystems communicate and transact.

Backed by industry giants Bitfinex and Tether, Stable is set to launch the second phase of its Stable pre-deposit campaign next week. This eagerly awaited phase aims to address key community concerns and foster a more inclusive environment for all participants. What’s Next for the Stable Pre-Deposit Campaign? Stable’s initial pre-deposit phase demonstrated immense demand, filling its $825 million cap in a mere 10 minutes. This unprecedented rush, while showcasing strong interest, also sparked discussions about equitable access. Now, Stable is taking proactive steps to ensure broader participation in its upcoming second phase. Launch Date: The second phase of the Stable pre-deposit campaign is scheduled to go live next week. Deposit Limits: New per-wallet deposit limits will be introduced. This crucial measure prevents a small number of large investors, often called “whales,” from dominating the entire deposit pool. Individual Wallet Requirements: Strict individual wallet requirements will be implemented. These measures aim to verify participants and further deter concentrated ownership. The project’s goal is clear: to distribute deposit opportunities more widely across its community, laying a foundation for a truly decentralized and robust ecosystem. Why is Fair Access So Crucial for Stable’s Future? The rapid conclusion of Phase 1 led to community speculation regarding potential insider advantages. Such concerns, if unaddressed, can undermine trust and hinder the long-term adoption of any blockchain project. Stable’s response to these challenges is vital for its credibility and sustained growth. Ensuring fair access and preventing concentration of power are fundamental principles in the blockchain space. When a few entities control a significant portion of a network’s assets, it can compromise decentralization and introduce vulnerabilities. Therefore, the strategic design of this Stable pre-deposit campaign phase is not just about fundraising; it is about building a trustworthy and resilient platform from the ground up. Learning from Phase 1: An Unprecedented Demand The first phase of Stable’s pre-deposit campaign was nothing short of extraordinary. The swiftness with which the $825 million deposit cap was met highlighted the market’s strong appetite for a stablecoin-focused Layer 1 blockchain. This overwhelming demand, however, also served as a critical learning experience for the Stable team. The community’s swift reaction and subsequent discussions provided valuable insights into participant expectations. By listening to feedback and adapting its strategy, Stable demonstrates a commitment to transparency and community engagement, which are essential for long-term success in the competitive crypto landscape. This iterative approach helps refine the Stable pre-deposit campaign for optimal outcomes. How Does Stable Ensure an Equitable Deposit Process? Stable’s leadership understands the importance of a balanced approach. The new mechanisms for Phase 2 are designed to foster broad participation while maintaining security and efficiency. These measures are a direct response to the lessons learned from the initial rush. Preventing Whale Domination: By setting per-wallet deposit limits, Stable actively discourages a few large players from cornering the market. This promotes a more diverse set of early adopters. Enhancing Community Trust: Individual wallet requirements help ensure that deposits come from genuine community members, reducing the likelihood of unfair practices and fostering greater confidence in the project’s integrity. Building a Stronger Foundation: A wider distribution of early deposits contributes to a more decentralized network from day one. This strengthens the network’s resilience and aligns with the core ethos of blockchain technology. For potential participants, this means a more level playing field. It encourages a broader range of individuals to get involved, ensuring that the Stable pre-deposit campaign genuinely reflects community interest rather than just institutional capital. The upcoming launch of Phase 2 for Stable’s pre-deposit campaign marks a pivotal moment for the Layer 1 blockchain. By implementing thoughtful limits and requirements, Stable is not only managing demand but also reinforcing its commitment to fairness and decentralization. This strategic move aims to build a more robust, community-driven ecosystem, setting a strong precedent for future blockchain initiatives. The success of this Stable pre-deposit campaign will be a testament to its dedication to its community and its vision for a stablecoin-centric future. Frequently Asked Questions about Stable’s Pre-Deposit Campaign Q1: What is Stable’s pre-deposit campaign?

A2: The second phase is being launched to address concerns about fair access after the first phase filled its cap very quickly. It introduces per-wallet limits and individual wallet requirements to ensure broader community participation and prevent whale domination. Q3: How will Phase 2 of the Stable pre-deposit campaign prevent whale wallets from dominating? A3: Phase 2 will implement per-wallet deposit limits, meaning each participating wallet can only deposit a certain amount.

A5: Stable is a Layer 1 blockchain focused on stablecoins, and it is led by prominent industry entities Bitfinex and Tether, known for their significant presence in the cryptocurrency market. Q6: Why is fair access important for a blockchain project like Stable? A6: Fair access is crucial for decentralization, community trust, and the long-term health of a blockchain. It prevents power concentration, reduces manipulation risks, and fosters a more robust and resilient ecosystem where many stakeholders have a voice.

A recent incident in South Korea serves as a stark reminder, where a group accused of orchestrating a massive crypto scam has been referred to prosecutors. This alleged fraud, totaling 5.8 billion won (approximately $4.3 million), highlights the crucial need for vigilance among investors. Unpacking the Deception: How This Crypto Scam Unfolded According to reports from YTN, the accused group allegedly defrauded 27 unsuspecting investors through a series of elaborate tactics. Their scheme was not just about empty promises; it involved sophisticated manipulation designed to exploit trust and greed. Understanding these methods is key to recognizing potential red flags in the future. Price Manipulation: The ring reportedly manipulated the prices of certain digital coins, creating an artificial sense of value and growth. This tactic makes an investment seem more attractive than it truly is. False Exchange Listings: A major part of their deception involved falsely claiming that specific tokens would soon be listed on prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. Such listings typically lead to price surges, making these claims highly enticing to investors. Guaranteed Returns: Luring victims with promises of large, guaranteed returns on coins that the group personally vouched for was another core element. In the volatile crypto market, “guaranteed returns” are often a tell-tale sign of a scam. These methods collectively created a compelling illusion of a lucrative, low-risk investment, ultimately leading to significant financial losses for the victims. Who Were the Victims of This Massive Crypto Scam ? The scale of this operation is considerable, impacting 27 individual investors who collectively lost millions. Each victim likely had hopes of financial growth, only to face the harsh reality of fraud. This incident underscores that even experienced individuals can fall prey to well-crafted schemes, especially when promises of quick wealth are involved. It’s a sobering reminder that the allure of rapid profits can sometimes overshadow critical due diligence. The referral of this group to prosecutors marks a significant step towards justice for those affected by this devastating crypto scam . Why Do These Crypto Scams Continue to Thrive? Despite increasing awareness, crypto scams unfortunately persist. Several factors contribute to their prevalence in the digital asset space: Market Volatility and Hype: The inherent volatility of the crypto market, combined with periods of intense hype, creates an environment ripe for exploitation. Investors eager for quick gains can become less cautious. Complexity and Information Asymmetry: Cryptocurrencies can be complex, and not all investors fully understand the underlying technology or market dynamics. Scammers leverage this knowledge gap. Regulatory Gaps: While regulations are evolving, the decentralized nature of crypto often means there are still gaps that fraudsters can exploit, especially across international borders. Anonymity: The pseudo-anonymous nature of some blockchain transactions can make it challenging to trace funds and identify perpetrators, emboldening criminals. Understanding these contributing factors is the first step in building a stronger defense against such fraudulent activities. Protecting Yourself: Actionable Insights Against Crypto Scams In a landscape where sophisticated fraud like this $4.3 million crypto scam can occur, proactive measures are essential. Here are vital steps you can take to safeguard your investments: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly investigate any project or token before investing. Look for whitepapers, team backgrounds, community sentiment, and genuine utility. Be Skeptical of “Guaranteed Returns”: No legitimate investment, especially in crypto, can promise guaranteed high returns. If it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Verify Exchange Listings: Always check official exchange announcements directly on their websites, not through third-party claims or unofficial channels. Understand the Risks: Acknowledge that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Seek Independent Advice: If unsure, consult with a trusted financial advisor who understands the crypto market. By adopting a cautious and informed approach, investors can significantly reduce their vulnerability to fraudulent schemes. The Road Ahead: Legal Action and Investor Vigilance The referral of this group to South Korean prosecutors signals a commitment to tackling financial crime in the crypto sector. Legal actions like this are crucial not only for seeking justice for victims but also for deterring future fraudsters. However, legal processes can be lengthy and complex. Ultimately, the best defense against a crypto scam remains an educated and vigilant investor community. Staying informed about common scam tactics and adhering to best practices for digital asset security are paramount for navigating the evolving cryptocurrency landscape safely. This incident in South Korea serves as a powerful cautionary tale, reminding us that while the crypto market offers innovation, it also demands unwavering caution. Protecting your digital assets starts with awareness, thorough research, and a healthy dose of skepticism towards promises that seem too good to be true. Let this serve as a crucial lesson for all participants in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Crypto Scams Q1: What exactly is a crypto scam? A crypto scam is a fraudulent scheme designed to trick individuals into investing in fake cryptocurrencies, projects, or platforms, often with promises of high, guaranteed returns, leading to financial loss for the victims. Q2: How can I identify a potential crypto scam? Look for red flags such as guaranteed high returns, pressure to invest quickly, anonymous teams, vague project details, unofficial communication channels, and claims of exclusive access or listings that cannot be verified. Q3: What should I do if I suspect a crypto scam? If you suspect a scam, do not invest. If you have already invested, stop all communication with the perpetrators, gather all evidence, and report the incident to relevant financial authorities or law enforcement in your region. Q4: Are all cryptocurrencies risky investments? All investments carry some level of risk, and cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. However, legitimate projects differ significantly from scams. Thorough research and understanding the inherent risks are crucial for any crypto investment. Q5: How can regulators help prevent crypto scams? Regulators play a vital role by establishing clear guidelines, enforcing anti-fraud laws, prosecuting offenders, and educating the public about the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. International cooperation is also key to tackling cross-border scams. Stay informed and help protect others in the crypto community!

According to Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence, BSOL generated around $56 million in first-day trading volume, making it the most active newly launched ETF of 2025, he said in an X post on October 28. The fund was seeded with roughly $220 million; had the entire amount been deployed, trading volume could have approached $280 million, surpassing the debut of the Ethereum-based ETF. Final tally of Day One trading.. $BSOL : $56m $HBR : $8m $LTCC : $1m I can't believe how close I came. ETF sixth sense for the win. Wish there was a @Polymarket for this I'd be rich. https://t.co/TODOk13WUt — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 28, 2025 Alongside the strong volume, BSOL attracted about $222.8 million in assets on its first day. Balchunas described the launch as “unusually large for a crypto ETF debut,” noting that such flows suggest institutional investors are growing more comfortable with staking exposure. Notably, the fund offers exposure to Solana ( SOL ) and provides an estimated 7% annual yield derived from staking rewards on the Solana blockchain. BSOL is also notable as the first U.S.-approved ETF tied to Solana. Two other ETFs launched on the same day, the HBR ( Hedera spot ETF) and LTCC ( Litecoin spot ETF), recorded significantly lower first-day trading volumes of about $8 million and $1 million, respectively. Solana price analysis Meanwhile, despite BSOL’s strong debut, Solana’s price slipped nearly 3% over the past 24 hours to around $195 at press time, though it remains up 6% on the week. Analysts suggest the decline may reflect a long squeeze between holders and leveraged traders, a bearish sign that the ETF’s success hasn’t yet lifted broader market sentiment. Still, if institutional inflows persist, Solana could reclaim the $200 level, opening the path toward a potential move to $250.

53771369,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/ai-gaming-and-defi-7-trending-cryptos-leading-november-2025,1761723847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/53771369.jpeg,"AI, Gaming, and DeFi: 7 Trending Cryptos Leading November 2025",https://bitzo.com/2025/10/ai-gaming-and-defi-7-trending-cryptos-leading-november-2025,"While the broader market faces renewed volatility, certain sectors — particularly AI, gaming, and infrastructure — continue to shape crypto’s narrative heading into the final stretch of 2025. Some projects are defining new use cases, while others are feeling the weight of market corrections. Here are seven trending tokens to watch this November. 1. TRUE World ($TRUE) — A Real-World Revenue Engine in Web3 Gaming TRUE World by TRUE LABS has become one of the most discussed listings of 2025 — and for good reason. It’s the first-ever gaming utility token backed by a functioning gaming business with verified revenue and millions of active players. Unlike hype-driven GameFi tokens, $TRUE connects in-game activity directly to token utility and value circulation. The TRUE ecosystem operates on a positive economic loop: player engagement fuels platform revenue, a share of which flows back into buybacks and burn mechanics that sustain deflationary pressure. $TRUE also serves as the core currency for gameplay boosts, NFTs, staking, governance, and exclusive tournament access. With listings on major exchanges expected before year-end, TRUE represents a new model for Web3 sustainability — one built not on speculation, but on measurable product usage and real cash flow. Watch for official announcements at x.com/TRUExWorld 2. Story (IP) — Cultural Web3 Faces Its Toughest Quarter The digital culture and IP market continues to feel the chill. Story (IP), the token linked to creative ownership and entertainment assets, has fallen 35,7% this week. The decline mirrors reduced engagement in cultural Web3 projects, which depend heavily on community participation and brand collaborations. However, Story’s concept — tokenizing narrative and entertainment IP — remains compelling. If speculative capital rotates back toward creative assets, the project could see a 50% rebound, potentially targeting US$ 8,15. 3. Aptos (APT) — Strong Tech, Weak Market Even with ongoing technical upgrades and ecosystem expansion, Aptos (APT) saw a 35,2% drop as traders cut exposure to emerging blockchains. The correction appears more macro-driven than project-specific. Analysts note that if capital flows return to Tier-1 chains, APT could rebound above US$ 4,80, supported by its high-performance Layer-1 infrastructure and increasing DeFi integrations. 4. Aster (ASTER) — Interoperability Needs a Catalyst Aster (ASTER), a cross-chain interoperability network, was hit hard by risk aversion and capital rotation away from Asian altcoins, sliding 32,3%. The project’s fundamentals remain sound, but market appetite for mid-cap interoperability plays has thinned. Should Bitcoin stabilize and overall sentiment improve, Aster could rebound toward US$ 1,70, driven by renewed cross-chain activity and DeFi collaborations. 5. Pump.fun (PUMP) — Meme Season Ends (For Now) The summer euphoria around Pump.fun (PUMP), a leading meme-token platform, has cooled rapidly. Its 31,1% weekly decline highlights the volatility of narrative-driven assets. Still, history shows that when sentiment flips risk-on again, meme tokens often lead the initial bounce. A technical rebound toward US$ 0,0053 remains possible — though sustainability will depend on developer support and on-chain user retention. 6. Internet Computer (ICP) — Innovation Outpaced by Market Cycles Despite its impressive decentralized computing framework, Internet Computer (ICP) slipped 30,9%, pressured by thin liquidity and a lack of fresh catalysts. The project’s fundamentals — scalable smart contracts and Web-speed execution — remain intact, but investor focus has shifted toward liquid, high-turnover assets. With renewed optimism, ICP could revisit the US$ 4,40–4,50 range, provided developer activity and ecosystem growth regain visibility. 7. Sei (SEI) — Trading Blockchain Mirrors Volume Decline Sei (SEI), built for high-speed trading and low-latency DeFi, has declined 29,9% amid shrinking global trading volumes. The pullback reflects risk-off sentiment rather than technical flaws. If on-chain activity and DEX liquidity improve, SEI could recover to US$ 0,29. Its strong developer community and focus on orderbook performance keep it relevant within the infrastructure niche. Trending Cryptos in November 2025 Token Sector Notable Catalyst TRUE World ($TRUE) Web3 Gaming / GameFi Real-revenue Gaming ecosystem; buy-and-burn model Story (IP) Cultural Web3 / Entertainment Brand partnerships, new releases Aptos (APT) Layer-1 Blockchain Return of Tier-1 liquidity flows Aster (ASTER) Interoperability / Cross-Chain Risk-on recovery; Asian market strength Pump.fun (PUMP) Meme / Social Tokens Meme rebound in speculative phases Internet Computer (ICP) Decentralized Computing Renewed developer activity Sei (SEI) High-Speed DeFi Infrastructure Rising on-chain trading volume Final Take November 2025 underlines a market rotation: tokens with real-world backing, utility, or infrastructure use cases are holding narrative strength, while speculative assets face sharper pullbacks. In this environment, TRUE World stands out as the most structurally innovative listing — combining sustainable tokenomics, deflationary mechanics, and a working business engine.

53771393,616076,1761723861,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53771393.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction Ahead of FOMC Rate Cut: Is a Breakout Ahead for Top Altcoins Like $BEST?,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-prediction-ahead-of-fomc-rate-cut-best-crypto-to-buy/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Taking advantage of the renewed risk-on sentiment in the crypto market, $XRP has recorded a 9.45% surge on the weekly chart – outperforming $BTC and $ETH. 2⃣ It’s too early to tell whether $XRP can sustain the momentum, however, as derivatives market data and technical indicators give mixed signals. 3⃣ Meanwhile, the Best Wallet Token presale is approaching $17M, as investors pivot to early-stage infrastructure projects to offset losses from the October 10 deleveraging event. $XRP is one of the best performers among heavy-cap cryptos this week. For context, $BTC has surged 5% over the past seven days, while $ETH is up 4.5% . Considering the previous weeks’ bloodbath, the trend paints an optimistic picture for the market, but their gains pale in comparison to $XRP’s 9.45% . The cross-border remittance token has managed a steady climb for most of the week, briefly touching $2.69 before retracing slightly. Keeping up with the spot market’s energy, the derivatives market has also perked up, as open interest (OI) crosses $4.5B . But How Strong is the Rally? Multiple factors indicate that $XRP’s recent surge might be short-lived. It could be a while before it reclaims its all-time high of $3.65, since the rise in open interest could swing either way. For instance, the OI-weighted funding rate has declined, revealing that confidence in $XRP will be fragile in the absence of a significant broader market shift. Short positions likely anticipate another test of the key support level at $2.18. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is now at 51, while the current price is just slightly below the 50-day exponential moving average of 2.6852 , further indicating that the recent rally is slowing down. However, investors are awaiting a potential Fed rate cut on Wednesday, which could channel more capital into top altcoins . That partly explains the renewed activity in the derivatives market, which dropped to $3.49B on October 19 – its lowest point since late April. With the US and China set to discuss trade frictions and the Fed rate cut looking increasingly likely , $XRP could soon capitalize on the return of risk appetite and head for $3. Despite the crypto market simmering in uncertainty since October 10, a new crypto infrastructure coin has been attracting steady investor traction. The Best Wallet Token presale is making its way toward $17M, defying broader market trends. It’s not only retail investors who are contributing to that presale tally – whales have also being buying in. In fact, just a few hours ago, a hefty whale buy of $33.16K was recorded. Backed by a non-custodial wallet that boasts hundreds of thousands of downloads on iOS and Android devices, it’s clearly not just the token’s low presale price that’s drawing interest. Is Best Wallet Token the Next Crypto to Explode? Companies like Strategy continue to buy the crypto dip , as the market is entering a promising phase supported by friendlier regulations. While institutional giants can afford to buy $BTC and $XRP for a fortune, retail investors are playing a completely different game. For them, the smarter bets are emerging coins with much lower market caps. Not just any new coin, but those backed by promising projects. Smart investors are exercising this strategy while curating their portfolios ahead of the next crypto super cycle, likely to begin in November. This reallocation is behind the growing interest in the Best Wallet Token presale , which powers the Best Wallet ecosystem. Best Wallet Targets 40% Market Share by 2026 The project is on a mission to capture 40% of the global crypto wallet market share by 2026. It’s an ambitious target but not one that is far-fetched, considering the Best Wallet app is: Non-custodial and thus offers holders complete control over their private keys, staying true to the crypto market’s founding principle of financial freedom without middlemen. Multi-chain and flexible, letting users transfer assets across top blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain (50+ more will be added in the coming phases). Secured with Fireblocks’ MPC techology. Part of an extended ecosystem that offers features like cross-chain swaps, presale access, and – down the line – an everyday crypto shopping card. $BEST tokens play a key role in fueling this ecosystem, which looks beyond crypto storage and towards driving retail crypto adoption. For holders, it unlocks privileges like early access to vetted presales, lower fees, higher staking rewards, and voting rights. Being anchored to a thriving ecosystem with a growing user base, the token is expected to take off following its upcoming launch, making the current presale deal too good to ignore. But more importantly, organic demand could underpin the token’s value during volatile periods. Our Best Wallet Token price prediction sees the price potentially climbing to $0.62 during the course of next year, and reaching $0.82 by 2030. For early investors who buy the token at $0.025865 in the current presale phase and grab the 79% staking APY, that leaves room for jaw-dropping returns. Thinking of investing in $BEST? Take a look at our step-by-step guide to buying the Best Wallet Token before heading to the official presale website. Being a presale, however, the price rises in stages, while the staking APY lowers as more holders join the staking pool. And the next price surge is just a day away. So be sure to join the Best Wallet Token presale today to lock in the best deal . As always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice.

Stocks across the globe are smashing records as three big events collide; Trump’s return to the trade spotlight, Nvidia’s monster run, and Jerome Powell’s next move. U.S. stock futures barely moved Tuesday night, but it didn’t matter. The damage was already done during the day. The S&P 500 climbed 0.2% and broke above 6,900 intraday for the first time, inching toward 7,000. The Dow Jones added 162 points, up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite led the charge with a 0.8% jump. After-hours, Dow futures fell by 33 points, or 0.07%. The S&P 500 stayed flat. Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up 0.02%. Asia rallies as Nvidia lifts chips, but Japan’s rally is razor thin Nvidia surged nearly 2% in overnight trading. The chipmaker hit a fresh record above $204, as reported by Cryptopolitan. This comes during an AI-fueled market surge, pushing Nvidia further into global spotlight. But Japan’s massive rally is starting to look top-heavy. The Nikkei 225 spiked 2.17%, closing at 51,307.65, a new record. But here’s the catch—only 43 stocks in the index moved higher, according to Bloomberg. That’s the fewest number of gainers seen during a +1.7% rally. Most of the move came from two names: Advantest Corp. and SoftBank. Advantest soared to its limit after raising its earnings outlook. The AI-chip test equipment maker, along with SoftBank, added 7,100 yen to the Nikkei this year, which is 60% of the index’s gain. The NT ratio, which compares Nikkei to the broader Topix, hit a record high, underlining just how concentrated this move is. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.76%, lifted by techs, while the Kosdaq slipped 0.28%. In China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.69% to 4,015.83 and CSI 300 was up roughly 1%. Hong Kong was offline for holidays. In India, the Nifty 50 rose 0.50% to 26,064.70. Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 0.96% after consumer prices for Q3 came in at 3.2%, well above the 3% forecast. It’s the biggest gain in more than a year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. Bitcoin stalls, Europe cautious, Powell and earnings dominate Bitcoin is sitting just above $113,000, trying to escape the range it’s been stuck in. It bounced from $107,000 after Spot ETF netflows finally turned positive. But inflows are still weak at less than 1,000 BTC/day, way below the 2,500+ BTC/day seen during previous rallies. The $111K level is holding as support, while $117K has turned into a wall of sellers. The all-time high is over $125,000, hit a few weeks ago. Over in the currency world, dollar-yen option volume is drying up. Data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation shows Monday’s volume was the lowest this month, and Tuesday didn’t do much better. Traders are sitting on their hands, waiting for the Bank of Japan’s decision Thursday, and of course, the Fed’s announcement later today. Europe is nervous. European stocks are set to open in the red. FTSE is just under flat, Germany’s DAX seen down 0.4%, France’s CAC 40 off 0.16%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipping 0.12%, according to data from IG. Investors are all watching for Powell’s tone. The CNBC Fed Survey says 84% of traders expect another cut in December, and 54% see a third one in January. They’re pricing in a total of 100 basis points of cuts by the end of 2026, which would drop the Fed funds rate to 3.2%. Earnings season is stacked. Big Tech is on deck—Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are reporting after today’s close. Apple and Amazon follow tomorrow. Europe’s corporate calendar is just as loaded: Airbus, UBS, Banco Santander, Equinor, Deutsche Bank, BASF, Adidas, GSK, and Endesa will all release earnings Thursday. On top of that, Spain will publish its GDP data.

Clapp was built to remove that friction. By combining crypto portfolio management, fiat access, and secure storage in a single platform, it turns digital asset investing into a more structured, intuitive experience. A Unified Platform for Modern Investors Clapp.finance is a complete crypto management app that lets users buy, sell, and swap digital assets, manage portfolios, and withdraw directly to fiat — all under one regulated umbrella. For European users, the app supports direct EUR conversions and SEPA withdrawals, bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance. It’s a clean, integrated solution for investors who want control and simplicity without switching platforms. Rich Asset Selection and Custom Portfolios Clapp supports a broad range of DeFi and CeFi tokens, giving users exposure to multiple market sectors. Its tailored portfolio options help investors diversify easily: Conservative Portfolio – Lower volatility, long-term assets. Moderate Portfolio – Balanced mix of blue chips and mid-cap tokens. Risky Portfolio – High-growth, high-risk exposure. AI & Big Data Portfolio – Tokens tied to the artificial intelligence economy. CEX Token Portfolio – Focused on centralized exchange coins. RWA Portfolio – Real-world-asset tokens bridging blockchain and traditional finance. Users can adopt these curated sets or build custom portfolios from scratch, adjusting allocations to match their personal strategy. Actionable Insights and Smart Tools What sets Clapp apart is how it turns data into decisions. Each portfolio includes real-time tracking of growth, profitability, and asset distribution, eliminating the need for spreadsheets or third-party trackers. The built-in Time Machine feature adds another layer of intelligence. It lets investors backtest portfolios against historical data and even simulate how regular rebalancing could have affected performance. This allows users to refine strategies safely before committing capital — a feature typically reserved for professional asset managers. Automation With Full Control Clapp’s smart rebalancing system keeps portfolios aligned automatically. As markets move, the app adjusts holdings to maintain the target mix. Unlike rigid robo-advisors, however, Clapp’s automation is flexible — users can rebalance manually, change weights, or pause automation anytime. It’s the ideal balance between guidance and autonomy: investors stay in control, but the system handles the heavy lifting. Secure and Regulated by Design Security and compliance are baked into Clapp’s infrastructure. All assets are protected through Fireblocks, a leading institutional custody solution used by major financial institutions. Clapp is also a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic and is expanding its regulatory footprint in Dubai, Slovakia, El Salvador, and Mauritius. This multi-jurisdiction approach shows a long-term focus on compliance — a quality still rare among consumer crypto platforms. Seamless Fiat Access Unlike most portfolio apps that end at analytics, Clapp integrates fiat on/off-ramps directly into its ecosystem. Users can convert crypto to euros (or vice versa) and withdraw through SEPA transfers without relying on third-party exchanges. This bridge between digital and traditional finance turns Clapp into more than a portfolio tracker — it’s a practical tool for managing real-world liquidity.

BTC and Ethereum top buy lists for their proven stability in the market, but one new name is starting to gain attention as a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been named one of the fastest growing altcoins in 2025. This DeFi crypto is still available cheap in presale at $0.035. The presale has seen strong attention, selling out 5 stages faster than predicted. Stage 6 is now live and nearly complete as FOMO reaches new highs. With its Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending mechanism, Mutuum Finance provides early investors an opportunity to be a part of a next-generation DeFi protocol with a lot of upside potential. As Bitcoin and Ethereum spearhead the general rally, astute traders are taking Mutuum Finance. MUTM is now being referred to as a high-potential point of entry for their portfolios, a top crypto to watch out for before the next bull wave really sets in. Bitcoin Defies Major Levels as Traders Wait for Fed Action and Bullish Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) is demonstrating incredible strength. BTC is still past support at the 61.8% Fibonacci level of $113,231. This is despite a bearish MACD crossover. With firm buying interest at pivot points and RSI at neutral 48.22, Bitcoin is set for a possible breakout above $114,000. The move can fuel the next wave of bullish momentum. While BTC remains at the center of news as the bellwether of the market, wise investors are also looking for promising early-stage projects with greater short-term potential. Among them is presale DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM), quickly gaining popularity and attracting those in search of the next high-flying cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) Remains in Support Trendline, $4,800 Resistance in Sight Ethereum (ETH) remains firm as it continues to maintain its upper-hand support trendline on the daily chart, now having been probed seven times and left intact, indicating continuing buyer support. ETH needs to hold price above this trendline to maintain its climb. A strong run from here could lead us to the $4800 level. This is the zone where ETH was rejected before its fall. More rallies past here would see the altcoin reaching new highs above $5000. While ETH bulls aim to push higher, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking over in presale as a hot buy. The altcoin is still undervalued at just $0.035, but analysts see strong potential ahead. Mutuum Finance Aims to Reshape DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to be the next big DeFi project. The growth of the project has taken off beyond all expectation; over 17,530 investors and over $18.15 million have been raised in its ongoing presale phase. The huge growth rate exceeded the estimates of analysts, and Mutuum Finance is now one of the most important crypto projects to track in the DeFi ecosystem. Investors who buy now position themselves to make almost 2x gains when MUTM goes live. Earlier presales have already seen millions of MUTM tokens find buyers (resulting in clear investor demand and paving the way for early liquidity before mainnet goes live). The continued onslaught of such sales indicates increasing faith from holders who view not only Mutuum Finance as a DeFi project, but also as a basis for generating long-term utility rather than simply a short-term buying speculation project. DeFi the MUTM Way Mutuum Finance allows borrowers to fix the repayment charges in advance by fixing the borrowing rates by some multiple of market conditions. Though fixed interest rates are generally greater than variable interest rates but both of them provide security and assurance to the lenders and borrowers in the event of increasing interest rates and hence leading to secure and transparent lending process. BTC is breaking above $113K and ETH has a goal of $4,800 and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring. Phase 6 presale 80% sold at $0.035 – $18.15M DeFi and passive income on dual-lending place MUTM among the best cryptos to buy now and the top crypto to invest in prior to the next bull run.

In a significant development, South Korean insurer Kyobo Life Insurance is stepping into the future by embracing stablecoins. This move marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing acceptance and integration of blockchain technology within established financial services. The experimentation with Kyobo Life stablecoins is set to open new avenues for efficiency and innovation in the insurance sector. What Does Kyobo Life’s Stablecoin Experimentation Entail? Kyobo Life Insurance has officially joined Circle’s stablecoin-dedicated blockchain, Arc, as a partner. This strategic alliance positions the South Korean giant at the forefront of digital asset exploration. Decenter, a prominent financial news outlet, initially reported this groundbreaking collaboration, highlighting its importance for the broader financial landscape. The Arc project is not just any blockchain initiative; it is a significant endeavor attracting some of the biggest names in global finance. Esteemed firms like Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, HSBC, and Standard Chartered are also active participants in the Arc ecosystem. This high-profile involvement underscores the project’s credibility and its potential to reshape financial operations. Interestingly, Kyobo Life stands out as the sole South Korean financial company among these influential partners. This unique position grants Kyobo Life a distinct advantage, allowing it to pioneer localized applications and insights into stablecoin utility within the South Korean market. Their participation indicates a proactive approach to understanding and leveraging digital currencies. The potential for Kyobo Life stablecoins to revolutionize internal processes and customer interactions is immense. Why Are Kyobo Life Stablecoins a Game Changer for Finance? The decision by a major insurer like Kyobo Life to experiment with stablecoins is more than just a technological upgrade; it represents a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. This stability makes them an attractive option for financial operations where price predictability is crucial. For the insurance industry, the benefits of integrating stablecoins could be transformative. Consider the following advantages: Enhanced Efficiency: Stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions, especially for cross-border payments like claims processing or reinsurance settlements. Reduced Costs: Eliminating intermediaries and streamlining payment rails can significantly lower operational expenses. Increased Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear audit trail for all transactions, enhancing trust and compliance. New Product Development: Stablecoins could enable innovative insurance products, such as parametric insurance triggered by smart contracts or micro-insurance solutions for underserved markets. This embrace of Kyobo Life stablecoins sets a precedent for other financial institutions globally. It demonstrates a practical application of blockchain beyond speculative trading, moving towards real-world utility in core business functions. As more traditional players enter this space, the digital asset ecosystem gains further legitimacy and accelerates its mainstream adoption. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Kyobo Life Stablecoins While the opportunities presented by stablecoins are significant, Kyobo Life’s journey will undoubtedly involve navigating various challenges. Integrating a novel technology into a highly regulated industry like insurance requires careful consideration and robust frameworks. Some key areas that Kyobo Life will need to address include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving globally. Kyobo Life will need to ensure compliance with existing and future regulations in South Korea and any other jurisdictions where they operate. System Integration: Seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with existing legacy IT systems can be complex and resource-intensive. This requires skilled personnel and strategic planning. Security Concerns: While blockchain offers robust security, managing digital wallets, preventing hacks, and ensuring data privacy will be paramount. Customer Adoption: Educating customers and ensuring ease of use will be crucial for the successful rollout of any stablecoin-based services. Despite these hurdles, the long-term opportunities for Kyobo Life are compelling. By pioneering the use of Kyobo Life stablecoins , the insurer can gain a competitive edge, attract tech-savvy customers, and potentially expand its global footprint. This experimentation could lead to the development of next-generation insurance services, offering greater flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs. Imagine a future where insurance claims are settled instantly using stablecoins, or where premiums are paid digitally with minimal fees. This is the vision that Kyobo Life is now actively pursuing. Their involvement with Circle’s Arc project is not just an experiment; it’s an investment in the future of finance, paving the way for a more connected, efficient, and transparent insurance ecosystem. Kyobo Life Insurance’s venture into stablecoin experimentation through its partnership with Circle’s Arc blockchain marks a significant milestone for both the insurance industry and the broader digital asset space. As the sole South Korean financial institution among a cohort of global giants, Kyobo Life is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in integrating stablecoins into traditional financial services. This strategic move promises enhanced efficiency, reduced costs, and the potential for innovative new products, despite the inherent challenges of regulatory uncertainty and technological integration. The bold step taken by Kyobo Life underscores the growing recognition of stablecoins as a powerful tool for financial transformation, moving beyond speculation to deliver tangible real-world value.

Key Takeaways: Bitwise’s Solana ETF drew $69.5M in first-day inflows, nearly six times higher than rival SSK’s $12M debut. Institutions are showing renewed interest in Solana, marking what industry leaders call a “watershed moment” for the asset. Bitwise’s spot-based structure and staking yield give it an early advantage as competitors like SSK and Grayscale’s GSOL enter the race. The figure is nearly six times the $12 million debut haul of its closest competitor, the Rex-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), according to data from Farside. Bitwise Solana ETF Marks “Watershed Moment” as Institutions Enter SOL Market The Bitwise Solana Fund (BSOL) now stands as the clear favorite among institutional and retail investors eyeing Solana-based exposure. “Truly a watershed moment,” said Kyle Samani , managing partner at Multicoin Capital, noting that “the substantial majority of capital in the world was legally not allowed to trade or own Solana until today.” https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1983181496925204811 The two ETFs represent divergent strategies in Solana exposure. Bitwise’s BSOL offers a fully spot-based structure, directly staking all held SOL tokens in-house to pass along Solana’s full network yield, around 7% annually, to investors. The fund trades on the New York Stock Exchange and carries a modest 0.20% management fee, which Bitwise has waived for the first three months. In contrast, SSK takes a diversified approach. Roughly 54% of its portfolio is held in direct Solana, 43.5% in the CoinShares Physical Staked Solana ETP listed in Switzerland, and the remainder in JitoSOL, short-term government securities, and cash. Its staking rewards are paid monthly and classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. SSK trades on the Chicago Board Options Exchange with a 0.75% expense ratio. Analysts say BSOL’s early traction reflects institutional enthusiasm for Solana as a high-throughput blockchain with growing on-chain revenue. “Institutional investors love ETFs, and they love revenue,” said Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise. “Solana has the most revenue of any blockchain. Therefore, institutional investors love Solana ETFs.” Institutional investors love ETFs, and they love revenue. Solana has the most revenue of any blockchain. Therefore, institutional investors love Solana ETFs. I have a feeling the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF, $BSOL , is gonna be huge. This material must be accompanied by a… — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) October 28, 2025 Grayscale’s own Solana ETF, GSOL, is also set to begin trading on Wednesday, joining the race to capture institutional demand for Solana exposure. Despite the positive sentiment around the launches, traders remain cautious. Prediction market Myriad currently gives Solana just a 32.7% chance of reaching a new all-time high this year. As of Wednesday, Solana (SOL) is down 3.1% over 24 hours, trading at $194, while Bitcoin has dropped 3.2% from Tuesday’s peak of $116,000, per CoinGecko. Western Union to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin on Solana As reported, Western Union plans to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) on the Solana blockchain in the first half of 2026. The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, will allow users to move money globally with lower fees and faster settlement times, reducing reliance on traditional banking intermediaries and volatile currency conversions. CEO Devin McGranahan described the move as a continuation of Western Union’s 175-year mission to simplify money transfers, this time through blockchain technology. He said Solana was chosen for its speed, scalability, and low-cost transactions, which are crucial for the company’s high-volume remittance business. By leveraging blockchain rails, Western Union aims to make remittances nearly instantaneous and more transparent. If widely adopted, USDPT could drive stablecoin use beyond crypto trading and into everyday payments, bill settlements, and cross-border commerce, marking a pivotal step toward mainstream digital dollar adoption.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

A significant governance proposal has emerged, aiming to revolutionize the approach to dYdX token buybacks and potentially reshape the value proposition of the DYDX token. This move could mark a pivotal moment for the decentralized exchange. What’s the Buzz Around dYdX Token Buybacks? Currently, the dYdX decentralized exchange allocates only 25% of its on-chain trading fees towards buying back DYDX tokens from the open market. This mechanism helps to create demand and reduce the circulating supply of the token. However, a new governance proposal, submitted by the community, seeks to dramatically increase this allocation. If approved, the proposal would direct a full 100% of all on-chain trading fees to fund dYdX token buybacks . This isn’t just a theoretical discussion. The proposal outlines a concrete three-month pilot program. During this period, the exchange anticipates buying back a substantial amount of DYDX, estimated to be between $5 million and $10 million worth of tokens. The community believes this change could significantly impact the DYDX token’s economics. It reflects a strong desire to strengthen the token’s value and align it more closely with the success of the dYdX platform. How Could Increased dYdX Token Buybacks Benefit DYDX Holders? The potential benefits for DYDX token holders are considerable. When a protocol buys back its own tokens, it typically removes them from circulation, either by burning them or holding them in a treasury. This action can lead to several positive outcomes: Supply Reduction: By consistently reducing the available supply of DYDX tokens, the mechanism can, in theory, create scarcity. This scarcity often contributes to upward price pressure, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Enhanced Value Proposition: A robust buyback program signals confidence in the token’s future and its underlying platform. It can make DYDX a more attractive asset for investors and long-term holders. Community Empowerment: This proposal originates from the community, demonstrating the power of decentralized governance. Holders have a direct say in shaping the token’s economic model. Direct Protocol Alignment: Allocating all fees to dYdX token buybacks directly aligns the protocol’s success with the token’s value. As trading volume on dYdX grows, so does the potential for buybacks, creating a virtuous cycle. Navigating the Potential Challenges of Enhanced dYdX Token Buybacks While the prospect of increased dYdX token buybacks is exciting, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. No financial mechanism is without its complexities, and this proposal is no exception. One key factor is market volatility. The effectiveness of buybacks can fluctuate depending on market conditions. If the price of DYDX is highly volatile, the buyback program might not achieve its intended impact as efficiently. Another aspect involves the technical implementation. Ensuring the smart contracts and automated processes for these buybacks are secure and efficient is paramount. Any glitches could undermine confidence in the program. Furthermore, while the pilot program offers a clear path forward, future decisions will still rely on community consensus. Sustaining support for this model or adapting it based on the pilot’s results will require ongoing active governance and participation from DYDX holders. A Look at the Future: What’s Next for dYdX Token Buybacks? The proposed three-month pilot program is crucial. It will serve as a real-world test, providing valuable data on the effectiveness and impact of dedicating 100% of trading fees to dYdX token buybacks . This data will be instrumental in informing future governance decisions. The dYdX community will closely monitor metrics such as the amount of DYDX bought back, the impact on token liquidity, and overall market sentiment. This iterative approach is a hallmark of decentralized finance, allowing for agile adjustments based on observed outcomes. Comparing dYdX’s tokenomics with other decentralized exchanges could also provide insights. Many protocols experiment with different fee structures and value accrual mechanisms. The success of this pilot could set a new standard or inspire variations across the DeFi landscape. Ultimately, this proposal represents a significant step towards a more robust and community-aligned economic model for the dYdX ecosystem. It highlights the dynamic nature of decentralized governance and the continuous pursuit of value optimization for token holders. The dYdX community is actively shaping its future. This governance proposal for enhanced dYdX token buybacks demonstrates a clear commitment to strengthening the DYDX token’s position and fostering a thriving, sustainable decentralized exchange. It’s a powerful example of how community-led initiatives can drive meaningful change in the crypto space, potentially unlocking significant value for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the current allocation of trading fees for DYDX token buybacks? Currently, only 25% of the on-chain trading fees generated by the dYdX decentralized exchange are allocated for DYDX token buybacks. 2. What does the new governance proposal suggest for dYdX token buybacks? The new governance proposal suggests increasing the allocation of on-chain trading fees for DYDX token buybacks from 25% to 100%. 3. How long is the proposed pilot program for these increased buybacks? If approved, the proposal would initiate a three-month pilot program to implement the 100% fee allocation for buybacks. 4. What is the estimated value of DYDX tokens expected to be bought back during the pilot? During the three-month pilot program, the exchange is expected to buy back between $5 million and $10 million worth of DYDX tokens. 5. How do dYdX token buybacks generally benefit token holders? Token buybacks typically benefit holders by reducing the circulating supply of tokens, which can create scarcity and potentially lead to increased demand and price appreciation, assuming other factors remain constant.

A number of super political action committees (PACs) focused on crypto are pooling together a major $263 million war chest, according to Bloomberg. Fairshake Leads With $141 Million The legislative victories with the passage of the GENIUS Act, coupled with the Trump family’s endorsement of crypto, are reportedly prompting many newer super PACs to pivot from previous strategies and align more closely with Republican candidates. A primary focus is a proposed crypto market-structure bill that seeks to implement comprehensive changes to the oversight of digital assets, potentially empowering the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has been more receptive to the industry’s interests. Collaborations have further emerged between crypto firms and Trump-affiliated ventures, along with donations to Trump’s inauguration and military events. Several companies are also contributing to the development of a new White House ballroom, with notable supporters including Coinbase, Ripple , and the US arm of Tether (USDT). Fairshake remains the largest PAC, reporting $141 million in its coffers as of the end of June, after spending more than $133 million to back pro-crypto candidates during 2024. In its efforts to promote crypto-friendly policies across party lines, Fairshake allocated around $10 million each to support Democratic senators Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, both of whom successfully won their races in Michigan and Arizona. They were among the 18 Democratic senators who voted in favor of the GENIUS Act, which facilitated broader usage of stablecoins, a favored instrument of the crypto sector. New Super PACs Arise To Boost Pro-Crypto Candidates Another new organization, the First Principles Digital PAC, identifies itself as a Republican-focused entity dedicated to electing pro-crypto leaders. Led by Republican strategist Jason Thielman, this PAC was established after the 2024 elections and reported approximately $954,000 in cash as of the end of June. Fellowship PAC, which emerged in September with $100 million in commitments, is another new player, though its donors have not been publicly disclosed. Initial filings indicate its treasurer is an executive from Cantor Fitzgerald , the financial firm previously headed by Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick. Democrats are increasingly apprehensive about the financial firepower of the crypto sector. Erik Balsbaugh, who has campaigned for Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton, now directs a new group called Open Frontier, which aims to amplify progressive voices within the crypto conversation. “Many on my side are striving to understand this industry,” Balsbaugh stated. “There’s a lack of trustworthy messengers, and significant skepticism about crypto remains.” Democrats Reevaluate Stance Ahead of this new election cycle, Bloomberg reports that there are indications that the industry’s growing financial reserves and political clout are prompting some Democrats to reassess their positions. Even Sherrod Brown has moderated his criticisms, with his campaign manager stating, “Cryptocurrency is increasingly becoming integrated into America’s economy, especially in Ohio. Industry executives are also looking beyond the immediate target of the market-structure bill, which Republicans hope to advance before the midterms.

On Tuesday, the company announced its intention to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT), a new stablecoin, alongside its Digital Asset Network designed to integrate digital and fiat currencies. Western Union New USDPT Stablecoin Built on the Solana (SOL) blockchain and issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, USDPT aims to broaden the options for transferring money for customers, agents, and partners, while also bolstering Western Union’s treasury capabilities. Through this initiative, the company plans to provide users with access to digital assets, allowing them to send, receive, spend, and hold USDPT with ease, supported by Western Union’s global compliance and risk management framework. Related Reading: China Intensifies Crypto Crackdown With Latest Warning Against Stablecoins Devin McGranahan, President and CEO of Western Union, expressed the company’s commitment to harnessing emerging technologies to empower customers and communities. “As we transition into the digital asset space, USDPT will enable us to take ownership of the economics associated with stablecoins,” McGranahan stated. He also highlighted the significance of the Digital Asset Network, which aims to simplify cash off-ramps for digital assets by partnering with wallets and wallet providers, thereby allowing seamless access for customers via Western Union’s extensive global network. Western Union anticipates that USDPT will launch in the first half of 2026, with plans for users to access the stablecoin through partner exchanges, ensuring broad availability and user-friendliness. Stablecoins To Reduce Reliance On Traditional Banking During Western Union’s third quarter of the year earnings call last Thursday, McGranahan revealed that the company has initiated a pilot program utilizing stablecoins for value transfer. He noted that this pilot aims to leverage blockchain technology and stablecoins to decrease reliance on traditional correspondent banking systems, which will help shorten settlement times and enhance capital efficiency.

However, with the enactment of the GENIUS Act, McGranahan indicated that new opportunities are emerging for integrating digital assets into the company’s operations, enhancing efficiency, reducing friction, and ultimately improving the customer experience. Western Union facilitates the transfer of billions of dollars annually, boasting a market capitalization of over $2.9 billion as of October 28, and generating more than $1 billion in adjusted revenue in the third quarter of the year alone. Despite the announcement, SOL’s price has failed to react positively, currently attempting to hold the $200 line as the cryptocurrency’s next short-term support.

The $1.25 billion purchase of the global prime broker has positioned Ripple to service some of the world’s largest financial institutions through a structure they already trust. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto commentator on X, highlighted the significance of the deal by sharing a video in which Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse explained the purpose of the acquisition. Garlinghouse stated, “Our acquisition this week, Hidden Road, we paid $1.25 billion for what’s called a prime broker. And this allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that.” The acquisition of Hidden Road allows institutions like BlackRock and Wall Street to access a safer prime broker, Enabling them to conduct more secure transactions directly on their balance sheets. @bgarlinghouse #XRP https://t.co/blwvZVihSh pic.twitter.com/ijcnq5jKM0 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 27, 2025 Institutional Trust and Infrastructure Growth Hidden Road, now known as Ripple Prime , serves as a multi-asset prime broker offering clearing, financing, and liquidity services across traditional and digital markets. With over 300 institutional clients and an annual clearing volume in the trillions, its integration into Ripple’s operations brings a level of institutional-grade security and compliance infrastructure previously uncommon in the crypto sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The acquisition gives Ripple an immediate foothold in a regulated environment that is essential for attracting major financial entities seeking a stable and compliant entry into digital assets. For those institutions, access to a familiar prime brokerage model may eliminate one of the most persistent barriers to entry in the crypto market. Ripple Prime ensures that Ripple can conduct these institutional transactions directly on balance sheets with improved risk management and regulatory oversight. This step moves XRP and the XRP Ledger closer to being utilized as settlement and liquidity tools within large-scale financial operations. Expanding XRP’s Functional Role The integration of Hidden Road opens opportunities for using Ripple’s own stablecoin, RLUSD, as collateral within institutional trading environments . As these mechanisms expand, the XRP Ledger may see increased transaction activity related to post-trade settlements and asset tokenization, all of which contribute to a more practical use case for XRP itself. This acquisition strengthens Ripple’s ability to connect traditional finance with digital asset markets . If financial institutions begin leveraging the XRP Ledger for settlement efficiency and liquidity management, demand for XRP could increase as part of broader utility-driven adoption.

Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF ($BSOL) – aka the first-ever Solana Staking ETF approved for trading in the United States – made a blockbuster debut on Tuesday, October 28. It became the biggest crypto ETF launch since Ethereum, with $222.9M in seed capital and a staggering $ 69.5M in inflows on its very first day . To put that number in perspective, REX Osprey’s Solana Staking ETF saw ‘just’ $12M in first-day inflows – meaning Bitwise’s figure was roughly 480% higher. $BSOL is beginning life with $220M in assets. Impressive, already half the size of $SSK. Surprised they didn’t hold off tho and have it come in on Day One to get volume and flows higher. Good news is now we’ll have only organic, easier to measure true demand. – Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas Such massive growth on day 1 is a telltale sign that the industry is hungry for user-friendly investment options into the biggest cryptocurrencies. Plus, given that $BSOL offers more than 7% annual rewards by staking 100% of your $SOL, it’s naturally destined to become a go-to choice for Solana HODL investors. Crypto ETFs are crucial for the growth of the industry because they make investing in digital assets easier and more accessible to everyone. Thanks to them, investors no longer need to navigate complex jargon around crypto wallets, private keys, or blockchain networks. The approval of these ETFs by regulators – and now their enthusiastic reception by the public – signals growing confidence and acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class. It’s a clear sign that the industry is moving in the right direction, i.e., toward broader mainstream adoption. Now, if you want to make the most of this building momentum – particularly in the case of Solana – it’s worth looking at under-the-radar gems that could ride alongside the biggest cryptos but deliver far better returns in the process. To help you out, we’ve handpicked the best meme coins going around right now. 1. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Unique Mine-to-Earn Cryptocurrency Offering Real Rewards Despite crypto’s open-to-everyone ethos, the fact remains that crypto mining is one of the most gated ventures in the space – given its high setup and maintenance costs as well as the technical expertise required. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , however, is a new cryptocurrency project that’s bringing crypto mining to everyday users through its never-before-seen, gamified, and engaging ecosystem that turns mining into an interactive experience. As soon as you buy $PEPENODE tokens , you’re given an empty virtual server room, which you then populate by buying meme mining nodes and experimenting with different combinations to achieve your desired results. The trick is to get this combination right, because each mining node is unique, with different capabilities, characteristics, and efficiencies. But don’t mistake this for a video game with no real-world rewards. Your goal as a $PEPENODE miner is to rank as high as possible on the leaderboard, which will earn you real rewards like free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FATCOIN tokens. It’s worth noting that these rewards will be distributed after PEPENODE’s TGE (Token Generation Event) and once its virtual mining simulator goes live. According to our $PEPENODE price prediction , it could skyrocket after listing, reaching a high of around 0.0072 by 2026 – a massive 540% ROI from current price levels. Right now, 1 $PEPENODE is priced at just $0.0011227, with the project having already raised nearly $2M in its ongoing presale. Ride the crypto mining revolution – grab your $PEPENODE tokens today! 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Doge’s Distant Cousin Aiming to Become the Biggest Meme Coin Don’t mistake Maxi Doge ($MAXI) for just another meme coin looking to ride the market’s love for dog-themed tokens. It, in fact, carries the potential to become the next Dogecoin. A big reason for that is it combines an absurd yet thrilling anti-Dogecoin narrative with massive investor hype, putting it in a prime position to become the next 1000x crypto . According to Maxi’s story, it is Dogecoin’s distant cousin – one whose childhood was destroyed by his elder cousin’s overwhelming popularity, which hogged all the limelight while they were growing up. But credit to Maxi’s resilience, he made a ‘dawg’ out of himself, hitting the gym, lifting heavy weights, bulking up, and creating the perfect strategy to overtake Dogecoin’s dominance. Maxi’s master plan is to go insanely viral, which is why it has reserved a whopping 40% of its total token supply for marketing. This includes high-ticket influencer collaborations, social media campaigns, and major PR pushes. That’s not all; $MAXI also plans to go beyond the usual CEX and DEX listings and launch on futures platforms, offering itself as the ultimate tool for degen meme coin traders who love taking leveraged bets and chasing whale-like returns. Based on our $MAXI price prediction , the token could climb to $0.0058 by the end of 2026, meaning a $100 investment today could turn into $2,100 in just a few months. Even better, the project is currently in its presale phase, so you can buy Maxi Doge at some of its lowest-ever prices – currently just $0.0002655. Join the junior Doge in its brutal title fight – get your $MAXI tokens today. 3. Unstable Coin ($USDUC) – Viral Satirical Meme Coin Primed for Another Rally Unstable Coin ($USDUC) is a clever satirical take on the entire stablecoin industry, particularly Circle’s USDC. Although there’s no point in finding logic in any viral meme coin – the lack of logic is precisely why they become so popular – Unstable Coin’s concept is truly unique. It mocks how stablecoins are bringing ‘stability’ to crypto, which, by its very essence, is supposed to be memetic and highly volatile. This simple yet amusing idea has clearly resonated with investors. Launched in May this year, $USDUC is up over 32,000% so far and is currently bouncing off a major support zone around $0.0165. This same level previously triggered a massive 350% rally in August. So, we could see a similar sharp move upward from here, potentially pushing the token close to new all-time highs – a gain of roughly 230% from current levels. Fancy some raw meme coin energy? Grab your $USDUC tokens on MEXC today. Recap : With Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF ($BSOL) now alive and kicking, it’s the perfect time to load up on low-cap coins – top picks include PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Unstable Coin ($USDUC). Disclaimer : Kindly do your own research before investing in crypto, since it’s highly volatile and unpredictable. This article is not financial advice.

Five years after MicroStrategy’s first bitcoin purchase - during which time no companies dared follow its lead - hundreds of DATs have emerged. Many investors compare crypto assets - especially L1 tokens - to equities, commodities, or currencies, even though they are more different than similar. By Lorenzo Valente Introduction During August and September 2025, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) dominated the vehicles through which digital assets have gone mainstream on Wall Street. It must have been a surprising turn of events to those in the community who assumed that ETFs would continue to play the role that DATs have started to usurp. What happened? Several years ago, MicroStrategy pioneered the bitcoin DAT model, but investors did not understand how to apply it to other digital assets. This paper describes why the DAT phenomenon has been controversial in four sections: DATs description The DAT landscape The rationale for a DAT mNAV premium Risks associated with DATs DATs Description A Digital Asset Treasury ((DAT)) is a company that holds cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ether, or solana (SOL-USD) directly on its balance sheet, to which investors can gain exposure by buying its stock. Unlike SEC-regulated 1 spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETFs that hold crypto passively and issue shares backed one-for-one with holdings, DATs are companies - operating businesses that can use leverage, corporate strategy, or financing to manage their holdings. While ETFs provide the regulated exposure germane to public investment instruments, DATs introduce corporate risk and potential upside or downside beyond the underlying asset. Long before the phrase “digital asset treasury” evolved, MicroStrategy developed the first “DAT” for bitcoin. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, the company deemphasized its enterprise software business to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible. As of September 15, 2025, MicroStrategy (Renamed “Strategy” (MSTR)) had acquired more than 632,000 BTC for $46.5 billion - an average of $73,527 per coin. 2 Today, the company controls more than 3% of the scheduled 21 million bitcoin supply. 3 MicroStrategy accumulated its bitcoin position with various financing strategies. While it began by issuing convertible senior notes, followed by senior secured notes at a 6.125% yield, 4 the real breakthrough was an at-the-market ((ATM)) equity program. Because its stock, MSTR, was trading at a substantial premium to book value, Saylor issued new shares, diluting existing holders but using the proceeds to buy more bitcoin and increase its bitcoin per share. In effect, its shareholders supplied the capital to leverage MicroStrategy’s exposure to bitcoin. The approach has caused quite a bit of debate. Critics denigrate DATs by suggesting, “They’re selling 50 cents for a dollar.” 5 What does that mean? If a DAT were to trade at twice its market net asset value (mNAV), investors would be paying two dollars in equity for every dollar’s worth of bitcoin on the balance sheet. In other words, the premium seems irrational and unsustainable. Thus far, MicroStrategy’s stock has defied that analysis and rewarded shareholders handsomely. Except for a brief dip into discount territory during the bear market between March 2022 and January 2024, MSTR has been priced at a significant premium to mNAV. More importantly, Saylor has weaponized that premium strategically by issuing shares well above book value and increasing MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings accretively. As a result, not only has MSTR compounded shareholder exposure to bitcoin, but it also has outperformed a simple buy-and-hold bitcoin strategy since its first bitcoin purchase in August 2020 significantly. 6 The DAT Landscape Five years after MicroStrategy’s first bitcoin purchase - during which time no companies dared follow its lead - hundreds of DATs have emerged. The new vehicles are accumulating ETH, SOL, HYPE, ADA, ENA, BNB, XRP, TRON, DOGE, SUI, AVAX, and many other digital assets. Now the market is beginning to rally around the largest-cap assets, as a handful of well-capitalized DATs are competing to accumulate ETH and SOL. Combined, ETH-focused DATs have acquired 3.74% of the ether supply, 7 and Solana DATs 2.31% of the SOL supply, 8 as shown below. Source: Blockworks as of August 25, 2025.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. In our view, while some DATs may have been created for short-term opportunistic reasons, the winners could become more efficient wrappers than spot ETFs for some digital assets. By exploiting their corporate structures, 9 DATs can deploy leverage, corporate financing, and strategic optionality that ETFs cannot. These advantages will pertain as long as their mNAV premiums prove sustainable, a topic we explore in the following sections. Why Might The mNAV Premium Be Warranted? As an asset manager with significant exposure to crypto, ARK Invest has taken an active interest in the emerging DAT space. Recently, we invested in one of the leading ETH-focused DATs, Bitmine Immersion (BMNR). While approaching DATs cautiously and monitoring their rapid evolution closely, we can understand the reasons that some DATs trade at a an mNAV premium, among them the following: DATs’ Revenue / Staking Yield DATs’ Speed of accumulation / Velocity DATs’ Liquidity and Inexpensive Capital DATs’ Optionality Revenue / Staking Yield Smart contract Layer 1 blockchain protocols (L1s) 10 - Ethereum, in particular - offer native yields through staking, which rewards participants for securing the network. In the digital asset ecosystem, that yield is effectively the risk-free rate, as it is generated within the protocol and does not involve counterparty risk. In contrast, spot ETFs in the US do not allow staking for yield on the underlying asset. Because of Ethereum’s design, even if regulators were to change their position, ETFs probably would be able to stake a limited percentage of their holdings - perhaps less than 50% - as the network enforces “churn limits” that restrict how many validators can enter or exit during each epoch. 11 Essential for security, the limits prevent malicious actors from spinning up or shutting down large numbers of validators at once, ensuring that any changes do not overwhelm consensus or state management. As a result, staking or unstaking ETH can take up to two weeks. While ETFs could use liquid staking protocols 12 and tokens to circumvent the limits, compliance, liquidity, and centralization risks are likely to prevent ETFs from staking significant portions of their holdings. In contrast, DATs can benefit from significant optionality. Typical DATs are extremely lean organizations, often run by very small teams that generate outsized revenue. At a $10 billion market cap, if all ETH is staked, Bitmine Immersion, for example, generates ~$300 million of free cash flow annually, 13 capital that can be redeployed into mergers and acquisitions (M&A), token purchases, on-chain opportunities, or shareholder distributions. Speed Of Accumulation / Velocity Justifying DATs premium-to-book value are the speed of asset accumulation and the growth in cryptoassets per share. DATs can grow cryptoassets per share more quickly than the price appreciation of the underlying asset and, by extension, accelerate revenue growth by staking yield. Consider Bitmine. On July 13, the company held 163,142 ETH across roughly 56 million fully diluted shares. 14 At $2,914 per ETH, ETH per share was 0.0029, or $8.45. Just 31 days later, our estimates suggest that Bitmine’s holdings and shares had expanded to 1.15 million ETH and 173 million of fully diluted shares, respectively. 15 At $4,700 per ETH, ETH per share was 0.0066 ETH, or $32.43. In one month, the price of ETH rose about 60%, and Bitmine’s ETH/share increased by 130%. In other words, Bitmine’s ability to arbitrage its mNAV premium through at-the-market equity ((ATM)) issuance and accretive purchases added significantly more value than holding ETH directly. Of course, this dynamic will persist only with an mNAV premium and ATMs deployed accretively. Should the premium narrow or drop to a discount, DATs would have to rely on other capital-market tools, like liquidating a portion of their underlying token holdings to repurchase shares. The Shapley Value decomposition method breaks down the drivers of Bitmine’s (BMNR’s) stock performance, attributing the changes to three variables: the ETH price, growth in ETH per share, and shifts in the mNAV premium or discount, as shown below. As of August 25, ETH/share had been the biggest contributor to BMNR’s price and shareholder return. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025. Note: This chart is based on the Shapley Average Value, which uses only public data (e.g., stock price, mNAV, eth AUM, price of ETH, FDV shares). Data as of August 25, 2025. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Liquidity And Inexpensive Capital Liquidity is the main reason a DAT deserves a premium. At-the-market equity programs (ATMs) and convertible bonds work only if an equity is liquid. An ATM relies on meaningful daily turnover and a DAT’s ability to absorb steady share issuance without depressing the price. The same is true for convertibles: investors are buying a bond plus the option to convert into equity. The option has value only if the equity is liquid enough to be sold or hedged efficiently. Without liquidity, the instrument will not attract serious investors and/or will become prohibitively expensive for the issuer. Scale also matters because debt markets typically serve large companies. Investment banks and institutional lenders depend on demand in the secondary market, which is a function of market cap and float/liquidity. In practice, most broadly syndicated debt deals and institutional convertible offerings are accessible only to companies with market caps greater than ~$1–2 billion. Below that threshold, the cost of capital rises sharply, and financing options often are limited to bespoke or venture-style credit facilities. MicroStrategy, for example, was able to issue multiple rounds of convertibles totaling billions of dollars because its equity was liquid and its market cap was in the tens of billions at the time. Preferred share issuance illustrates the same point. Structured equity deals like those MicroStrategy has pursued require both balance-sheet heft and secondary liquidity to attract institutional investors. Preferred share buyers must believe that they will be able to exit or hedge positions. Illiquid DATs have no access to this financing channel. In other words, liquidity lowers the cost of capital. To compensate for illiquidity, investors demand higher returns, so illiquid DATs have to pay up in one or more ways: deeper discounts on equity issuance, higher coupon rates on debt, or more onerous covenants. In contrast, a liquid DAT can raise capital less expensively 16 to accumulate BTC or ETH, creating a flywheel effect that reinforces the premium. Optionality Many investors compare crypto assets - especially L1 tokens - to equities, commodities, or currencies, even though they are more different than similar. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) highlight this distinction and demonstrate how ETF wrappers can be an inefficient way to gain exposure to L1s. The DAT corporate structure offers optionality that investors often value at a premium to book value. Large DATs can acquire tokens at a discount in distressed circumstances, such as the ongoing FTX bankruptcy sales, or through the purchase of other DATs trading below mNAV. To illustrate, with a $10 billion market cap, Bitmine Immersion could issue just 2–3% of its stock and acquire an ETH-focused DAT worth $200 million at a discount, an accretive acquisition. Beyond such mergers and acquisitions (M&A), ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum offer other opportunities. Because those networks support tens of billions of dollars in liquidity and applications, a sufficiently scaled DAT can monetize by securing or providing liquidity on-chain. Indeed, protocols might offer incentives to attract large, balance-sheet-heavy participants into their ecosystems. Another arbitrage opportunity involves the spread between traditional and on-chain interest rates which, at times, has exceeded 500 basis points (bp), or 5%. 17 In a low-rate environment, DATs could borrow USD in traditional financial markets at a low cost and deploy the funds in on-chain lending pools at materially higher yields. Today, stablecoin pools like sUSDS, sUSDe, or SyrupUSDC offer annualized yields of ~7%, roughly 300bp (~3%) higher than Treasury yields, giving DATs the opportunity to capture incremental revenue streams beyond simple token appreciation. Risks While DATs offer new ways to gain exposure to cryptoassets, they also introduce significant risks that investors must weigh carefully. The first is dependence on market premiums. The DAT model - particularly the growth in crypto per share - relies on stocks trading at a premium to mNAV. When the premium compresses, a DAT’s ability to issue accretive equity diminishes and can disappear, forcing them to slow purchases or to liquidate tokens and repurchase shares. Second, liquidity can cut both ways. While liquid stocks enable access to inexpensive capital, they also can become the source of illiquidity during market downdrafts. In an extended downturn, DATs could enter a negative feedback loop: collapsing share prices, higher cost of capital, and potential redemptions that force token sales. Third, regulatory uncertainty looms large. Unlike ETFs, DATs operate in a gray area that could invite scrutiny around accounting treatment, disclosures, and other regulatory questions which apply more to investment funds than to operating companies. Regulatory intervention could impair access to capital markets or limit optionality. Fourth, governance and operational risks could be underappreciated. Many DATs are managed by small teams overseeing multi-billion-dollar treasuries. Weak controls, poor risk management, or misaligned incentives can erode value very quickly. In the worst case, some DATs could evolve into reckless on-chain hedge funds in disguise - chasing yield, levering up balance sheets, and allocating capital with limited transparency, creating the risk of hidden exposures and even bankruptcy. Conclusion The rise of Digital Asset Treasuries offers a new way for investors to gain exposure to crypto assets. What began with MicroStrategy’s seemingly idiosyncratic bet has evolved into a broader phenomenon, with DATs proliferating across Ethereum, Solana, and other leading Layer 1 blockchain protocols. While critics dismiss the model as “selling fifty cents for a dollar,” the reality is more nuanced. The DAT corporate structure offers unique potential advantages - ones that ETFs cannot match - that justify their premiums to book value: the ability to increase ETH or SOL per share more quickly than the price appreciation of the underlying asset; the liquidity and scale to access inexpensive capital across the capital stack; and the optionality to pursue M&A, token purchases, and on-chain opportunities. Unlike ETFs, DATs are not passive wrappers for digital assets. They are dynamic capital-market vehicles with the potential to magnify exposure, capture protocol yields, and allocate capital. For some assets, they may prove not only to be more sustainable but also to be more efficient than ETFs. Far from a passing arbitrage, DATs could become enduring institutions at the intersection of the traditional financial markets and the new world of digital assets. DISCLOSURE: Digital Asset Risk Digital assets, often referred to as cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether are relatively new investments, which have unique and substantial risks and which may be more volatile than other types of investments. Digital assets operate without central authority or banks and are not backed by any government. Even indirectly, digital assets may experience very high volatility. Digital assets are not legal tender. Federal, state or foreign governments could restrict the use and exchange of digital assets. Digital asset exchanges could stop operating or permanently shut down due to fraud, technical glitches, hackers or malware. Digital assets, like bitcoin and ether, are subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for the digital asset, and other factors. There is no assurance that a digital asset will maintain its value over the long term. 1 Cryptocurrencies are classified as commodities rather than securities. As such, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are structured as commodity-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (“33 Act”) rather than traditional investment companies that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“40 Act”) like most other ETFs. Therefore, although the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to some degree, they do not offer the same investor protections as traditional investment companies that are subject to the regulations set forth by the 40 Act. 2 Based on data from Saylor, M. 2025. “Strategy has acquired 525 BTC for ~$60.2 million at ~$114,562 per bitcoin…” X. 3 Ibid. 4 See MicroStrategy. 2021. “MicroStrategy Completes $500 Million Offering of 6.125% Senior Secured Notes Due 2028 with Bitcoin Use of Proceeds.” 5 Carter, N. 2025. “in the end its going to be very funny…” X. 6 MSTR stock has outperformed the buy and hold strategy from the first bitcoin purchase of the company on August 11, 2020. Data as of October 22, 2025. MSTR stock went up from 14 usd to 300 usd (20.8x), versus bitcoin, which rose from 11,410 USD to 110,000 USD (9.6x). MSTR stock’s outperformance of BTC price is attributable to the accretive usage of the share issuance to buy BTC. 7 Based on data from Blockworks as of August 25, 2025. 8 Based on data from Blockworks as of August 25, 2025. 9 A Digital Asset Treasury can use its corporate structure to exploit leverage and financing in ways an ETF cannot. By holding crypto directly on its balance sheet, a DAT can borrow against those reserves through secured loans or convertible bonds, effectively levering its exposure. It can also issue new shares if its stock trades at a premium to the value of its underlying assets, turning that premium into additional capital to buy more crypto. ETFs, by contrast, are constrained to issuing and redeeming shares at net asset value and cannot borrow against their holdings, which limits them to passively tracking the asset. 10 Colloquially, “Layer 1 blockchain”—or “L1”—refers to the base protocol of a blockchain network, which is responsible for essential functions like transaction processing, consensus mechanisms, and data storage on its own chain. 11 As used within the crypto community, an “epoch” is a unit of time used primarily in the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system to organize validator activity and block finalization. 12 Liquid staking protocols are platforms that enable users to stake their cryptocurrency holdings on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain while retaining liquidity via a yield-bearing token that rebases. 13 Based on data from UltraSound Money, data as of August 25, 2025. Our calculation assumes that Ethereum yield is approximately 3%, resulting in a total of $300 million. 14 Based on data from Deepnewz. 2025. “Bitmine ( BMNR ) Raises $250 Million, Sells 55.56M Shares, Stock Surges 400% as Tom Lee Launches ""MicroStrategy of Ethereum"" Treasury.” 15 Based on public data regarding prices of stock, ETH, and mNAV, for example, as of August 25, 2025. 16 In finance, preferreds are hybrid securities—a class of stock that blends features of both stocks and bonds, offering fixed-dividend payouts and preferential claims on assets in bankruptcy or liquidation over common stockholders, but with lower priority than bondholders. Also known as preferred stock, they usually pay higher yields than common stock to compensate for their intermediate risk level and lack of voting rights. 17 Note: A basis point ((BP)) is equal to 0.01%, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point.
