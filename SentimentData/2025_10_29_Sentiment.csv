He is threatening to file an explosive defamation lawsuit against U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren . This potential Changpeng Zhao lawsuit stems from what Zhao describes as false claims about him seeking a pardon from U.S. authorities. What Sparked This Potential Changpeng Zhao Lawsuit? The controversy began when Senator Warren, a well-known critic of the cryptocurrency industry, made specific allegations. She referred to Zhao on X (formerly Twitter) as a ‘convicted felon seeking a pardon.’ Warren also suggested potential ties between Zhao and the Trump family’s cryptocurrency ventures. These remarks, reported by Watcher.Guru, quickly escalated the ongoing tension between crypto figures and their political detractors. Zhao’s legal team is taking these accusations very seriously. They view the senator’s statements as baseless and damaging to his reputation. The core of their argument is that these claims are factually incorrect and constitute defamation, which could lead to significant legal action. Senator Warren’s Claims: Referred to Zhao as a ‘convicted felon seeking a pardon.’ Additional Allegation: Suggested potential links to the Trump family’s crypto ventures. Zhao’s Stance: Vehemently denies these claims, calling them false and defamatory. Why Is Changpeng Zhao Taking Such a Firm Stance? For Changpeng Zhao , this isn’t just about political rhetoric; it’s about protecting his personal and professional integrity. He recently pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws and stepped down as CEO of Binance, agreeing to pay a substantial fine as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice . However, he has consistently maintained his innocence regarding many of the broader accusations leveled against him and Binance. The idea of seeking a pardon implies an admission of guilt for certain actions, which Zhao seems unwilling to concede. A defamation lawsuit would serve as a powerful public rebuttal, aiming to clear his name and challenge the narrative presented by Senator Warren. This move highlights the high stakes involved for individuals at the forefront of the crypto industry, who often face intense scrutiny and criticism from political figures. What Are the Broader Implications of This Legal Battle? A potential Changpeng Zhao lawsuit against a sitting U.S. Senator carries significant weight. It could set a precedent for how public figures in the crypto space respond to criticism from lawmakers. This situation underscores the ongoing struggle between innovation in the digital asset sector and the regulatory concerns of traditional political systems. Moreover, this legal confrontation brings the spotlight back to the broader debate around cryptocurrency regulation. Senator Warren is a prominent voice advocating for stricter controls on digital assets, often citing concerns about illicit finance and consumer protection. Zhao’s response, however, signals a growing willingness among crypto leaders to challenge what they perceive as misinformed or overly aggressive attacks. The outcome of this threatened legal action could influence: Future Political Discourse: Lawmakers might become more cautious about their public statements regarding crypto figures. Crypto Industry Response: Other industry leaders might be emboldened to challenge perceived defamation. Regulatory Landscape: It could intensify the debate over how cryptocurrencies should be regulated and perceived by the mainstream. As the situation unfolds, the crypto community will be watching closely. This potential Changpeng Zhao lawsuit is more than just a personal dispute; it’s a reflection of the intense pressures and evolving dynamics between the digital asset world and established political powers. This development serves as a powerful reminder of the complex legal and reputational challenges faced by prominent figures in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency industry. The confrontation between Changpeng Zhao and Senator Elizabeth Warren is far from over, and its resolution could have lasting impacts on both crypto and political discourse. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Changpeng Zhao ? A1: Changpeng Zhao , often known as CZ, is the founder and former CEO of Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

He denies seeking a pardon and believes her claims constitute defamation, which is a false statement that harms a person’s reputation. Q4: What are the potential outcomes of this situation?

It highlights the ongoing tensions between crypto leaders and political figures regarding regulation and public perception. Q5: How does this relate to Zhao’s previous legal issues?

53756829,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87861,1761694248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO David Schwartz Drops Bombshell On Escrow XRP,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-david-schwartz-drops-bombshell-on-escrow-xrp/,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has clarified that the company has the legal ability to sell or transfer the rights to receive XRP currently locked in its escrow accounts. His comments came in response to a community debate about how circulating supply is calculated for different cryptocurrencies. The discussion began after software engineer Vincent Van Code questioned why major crypto-tracking platforms, such as CoinMarketCap, exclude Ripple’s escrowed XRP from circulation figures while counting all Bitcoin, including those believed to be in Satoshi Nakamoto’s dormant wallets. Van Code argued that this approach creates a double standard. He noted that if CoinMarketCap excluded the one million BTC presumed to belong to Satoshi, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization would decrease by roughly 15%. In contrast, XRP’s market cap is based on about 60 billion tokens in circulation rather than the total 65 billion, which currently values the asset at $157 billion with a price of $2.62 per token instead of $170 billion. Ripple could sell the right to receive the tokens released from escrow or even sell the accounts the escrows complete into. But the XRP still can't circulate until their release dates. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 27, 2025 Another participant responded that Bitcoin’s figures include all mined coins because, theoretically, they can be sold at any time. This raised the question of whether Ripple’s escrowed XRP could be treated the same way and if Ripple could liquidate those holdings before their scheduled release dates. Schwartz Confirms Ripple’s Legal Flexibility Addressing the issue, Schwartz confirmed that Ripple can sell or assign the rights to receive XRP that is currently locked in escrow. He clarified, however, that the XRP tokens themselves cannot be accessed or enter circulation until the monthly release schedule allows it. According to Schwartz, Ripple could sell the accounts linked to future escrow releases or the contractual rights to those tokens, but such transactions would not immediately affect XRP’s circulating supply. His explanation provided rare insight into how Ripple can legally structure agreements involving its escrowed holdings. Implications for Market Transparency Public records from XRPScan show that Ripple controls approximately 35 billion XRP in escrow, valued at around $92 billion. The existence of these holdings has long sparked debate within the XRP community about Ripple’s influence over market supply and future liquidity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Schwartz’s statement has reignited discussions about potential institutional involvement. Some community analysts have speculated that Ripple may already have agreements in place to sell or allocate rights to parts of its escrow, particularly to major financial institutions. Others have suggested that these rights could even be used to back future partnerships or reserves involving government or private entities. Ongoing Speculation Around Ripple’s Strategy These comments follow reports about Evernorth’s plan to acquire $1 billion worth of XRP to establish an XRP reserve. Ripple expressed support for the initiative but did not specify whether the escrow holdings would be used for it. Market watcher Nietzbux suggested this might be because Ripple has already sold portions of its escrow rights to institutional buyers, although the company has made no public confirmation of such deals. Schwartz’s clarification ultimately reinforces that while Ripple cannot bypass its escrow mechanism, it retains considerable flexibility in managing the financial rights tied to those future token releases. This nuance could have important implications for how market participants interpret XRP’s supply metrics and Ripple’s long-term financial strategy.

Each brings unique momentum and fresh community power, but MoonBull’s blazing Stage 5 presale is catching the most significant buzz. With over $500K raised, more than 1,600 holders, and a planned ROI surpassing 9,256%, investors are calling this the next bull in the meme ring. Crypto traders and blockchain dreamers who missed the early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu hype are turning their heads toward the MoonBull presale. Stage 5 offers a first-come, first-served chance to secure $MOBU at $0.00006584, and when prices rise through 23 stages, those holding early could see life-changing returns. For anyone watching the next bull charge, MoonBull looks like the best meme coin to buy under $1 this cycle. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Best Meme Coin To Buy Under $1 Investors Can’t Ignore MoonBull has quickly become the talk of Telegram and X feeds as its $MOBU presale gallops through Stage 5. This isn’t another hype-driven token; it’s a structured ecosystem blending meme culture with real tokenomics. Backed by liquidity injections, reflections, and burns, every trade strengthens the token’s foundation. For example, selling $MOBU triggers 2% to liquidity, 2% to holders, and 1% burned forever – that’s real scarcity baked in. No wonder MoonBull’s energy has traders calling it the best meme coin to buy under $1 this year. Now, imagine dropping $50,000 into the Stage 5 presale. By the final listing price of $0.00616, that investment could potentially balloon to over $4.6 million, showing just how powerful early entry can be. This is what crypto FOMO feels like – a shot at financial freedom built on tokenomics that actually make sense. Deployed on Ethereum: Security, Liquidity, and Scale Built on Ethereum’s rock-solid framework, MoonBull uses audited smart contracts, automated rewards, and seamless DEX integration. Ethereum’s network ensures strong liquidity, transparent governance, and deep DeFi compatibility. $MOBU holders can stake with up to 95% APY once Stage 10 launches, and the governance phase at Stage 12 will let every token holder vote on key decisions. The security, scalability, and liquidity of Ethereum give MoonBull the upper hand, reinforcing its status as the best meme coin to buy under $1 for anyone hunting long-term utility mixed with viral energy. SPX6900 ($SPX) Surge: Retail Bulls Drive 13% Rally Toward $1.30 SPX6900 just pulled off a classic bull charge. After rebounding from $0.80, it roared past $1.16, locking in a 13% gain in a single day. Retail traders stormed back in, boosting Buy Volume to 3 million, while derivatives volume exploded 124% to over $146 million. That kind of inflow is no joke – it shows traders believe SPX still has gas left in the tank. But not all’s smooth sailing. Whales started cashing out near $1.18, sending Netflow to $257K, a signal of short-term pressure. Even so, sentiment stays bullish as open interest rises and the Long/Short Ratio hits 1.0008, meaning traders expect upside continuation. If momentum holds, $1.30 is the next major resistance level. Those looking for the best meme coin to buy under $1 are comparing SPX6900’s current performance to MoonBull’s entry-level presale firestorm, but SPX’s room for explosive growth is tightening as whales test profit zones. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) Takes Flight: Whale Accumulation and Breakout Setup Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) just reclaimed the spotlight with a technical setup that screams “breakout.” On-chain data shows 2.16 million PENGU flowing into whale wallets, sparking speculation of a fresh bull phase. Prices recently cleared resistance around $0.038, confirming a cup-and-handle pattern – a classic bullish sign. Momentum keeps building as the chart points toward potential targets near $0.06 to $0.07, and with smart money flowing in, the penguins are waddling straight toward market confidence. The current price of $0.02139 with over $111 million in daily volume underscores real trading strength, not just hype. Compared with the best meme coin to buy under $1, MoonBull, Pudgy Penguins shows strong potential but may face tougher scaling without Ethereum’s advanced mechanics and presale momentum. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, both SPX6900 and Pudgy Penguins have captured investor attention through whale activity, retail momentum, and bullish technical setups. SPX6900’s surge from $0.80 to $1.16 and PENGU’s on-chain accumulation paint a strong short-term picture. However, neither project matches MoonBull’s combination of structured presale mechanics, Ethereum deployment, and sky-high ROI potential, securing its place as the best meme coin to buy under $1 for early 2025. MoonBull’s presale isn’t just a chance – it’s a movement. With Stage 5 live, over $500K already raised, and staking rewards nearing launch, this is the project setting the next crypto narrative. The MoonBull presale offers the lowest price window before listing, and missing it could mean watching another meme legend moon without you. Jump into the $MOBU presale while the gate’s open and ride the bull before it takes off for good. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official MOBU Website Telegram: Join the MOBU Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow MOBU ON X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for Best Meme Coin To Buy Under $1 Which meme coin will reach $1? Analysts expect coins with strong communities and real tokenomics to have the best chance. MoonBull ($MOBU) shows solid fundamentals, while SPX6900 and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) could also test that level if the current bullish cycle continues. Which coin is best to invest in under $1? Right now, MoonBull tops the list. Its presale model, Ethereum deployment, and growing investor base make it one of the most promising crypto projects under a dollar. Which meme coin is best to invest in? MoonBull ($MOBU) is currently leading the charge thanks to its deflationary mechanics, staking rewards, and early-stage pricing. SPX6900 and PENGU offer volatility and short-term plays, but MoonBull shows better long-term potential. Will Pepe ever hit $1? Reaching $1 would require an enormous market cap expansion for Pepe, which makes it unlikely in the near term. Newer tokens like MoonBull have smaller supplies and structured growth paths, giving them a more realistic shot at massive ROI. Do meme coins have a future? Definitely, the meme market has evolved from pure hype to real innovation. Projects like MoonBull prove that meme coins can combine humor, community, and solid tokenomics for sustainable growth. Glossary of Key Terms Presale: Early sale of tokens before public listing. Staking: Locking tokens to earn rewards. APY: Annual Percentage Yield, the return earned over a year. Referral Program: An Incentive system where participants earn bonuses by inviting others. Token Burn: Permanent removal of tokens from supply to create scarcity. Reflections: Rewards distributed to token holders from transaction fees. Governance: A System allowing token holders to vote on project decisions. Article Summary MoonBull, SPX6900, and Pudgy Penguins are leading the 2025 meme coin surge. While SPX6900 and PENGU gain traction through rallies and whale action, MoonBull’s presale delivers unmatched potential through Ethereum deployment, token burns, staking, and governance. With its Stage 5 presale open and ROI projections skyrocketing, MoonBull stands tall as the best meme coin to buy under $1, giving investors a second chance at a generational moonshot.

U.S. cryptocurrency firm Help has announced a significant step forward for crypto enthusiasts and investors alike. They are gearing up to launch a groundbreaking crypto-backed loan service this December, offering a flexible way to leverage digital assets without selling them. What is This Revolutionary Crypto-Backed Loan Service? Imagine needing funds but not wanting to part with your valuable Bitcoin or Ethereum. Help’s upcoming service addresses this common dilemma. It allows users to obtain loans by using their existing digital assets as collateral. Initially, this innovative crypto-backed loan service will kick off as a pilot program in Florida. However, Help has ambitious plans for a rapid nationwide expansion across the United States, making these financial tools accessible to a broader audience. The service will support major cryptocurrencies, including XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , and USD Coin (USDC) . This broad selection provides users with diverse options for collateralizing their portfolios. How Does a Crypto-Backed Loan Service Work? At its core, a crypto-backed loan service functions much like a traditional secured loan. Instead of a house or car, your collateral is your digital currency. Users deposit their chosen crypto assets with Help, and in return, they receive a loan in traditional fiat currency or stablecoins. This mechanism offers a unique advantage: you retain ownership of your crypto assets. This means you can still benefit from potential price appreciation of your collateral while accessing immediate liquidity. Moreover, Help’s service is designed to allow users to generate yield on the collateral they’ve deposited, adding another layer of financial benefit. Collateralize Your Assets: Use XRP , ETH , BTC , or USDC to secure a loan. Access Instant Liquidity: Get the funds you need without selling your crypto. Retain Ownership: Keep your digital assets and benefit from market movements. Generate Yield: Potentially earn returns on your deposited collateral. Why Choose Help’s Empowering Crypto-Backed Loan Service? Help’s entry into the market with its crypto-backed loan service is particularly compelling for several reasons. For many crypto holders, the decision to sell assets for cash can be a difficult one, often triggering capital gains taxes or missing out on future growth. This service provides a powerful alternative. It empowers individuals to unlock the value of their digital holdings without liquidating them. This approach is especially appealing during volatile market conditions or when investors believe their assets have long-term growth potential. The dual benefit of raising funds and generating yield on collateral makes Help’s offering stand out. It transforms dormant digital assets into active financial instruments, working harder for the user. This innovative model, reported by Pinpoint News, underscores a growing trend towards more sophisticated financial products in the crypto space. Navigating the Future of Crypto Lending: What to Consider? While a crypto-backed loan service offers exciting opportunities, it’s crucial for users to understand the associated considerations. Market volatility is a primary factor. If the value of your collateral drops significantly, you might face a margin call, requiring additional collateral or partial repayment to maintain your loan-to-value ratio. Therefore, understanding the terms and conditions, including liquidation thresholds and interest rates, is paramount. Help , as a U.S. firm, will operate under specific regulatory frameworks, offering a degree of security and compliance that users should appreciate. Key Considerations for Borrowers: Market Volatility: Be aware of potential price fluctuations in your collateral. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios: Understand how much you can borrow against your assets. Interest Rates and Fees: Compare terms to ensure they align with your financial goals. Regulatory Compliance: Benefit from the oversight of a U.S.-regulated entity. This service represents a maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, bridging the gap between digital wealth and traditional financial needs. It’s an exciting development for anyone looking to optimize their crypto portfolio. In conclusion, Help’s upcoming launch of its crypto-backed loan service marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital finance. By enabling users to leverage their XRP , ETH , BTC , and USDC holdings for loans while simultaneously generating yield, the firm is providing a powerful and flexible financial tool. This service promises to unlock new opportunities for crypto investors, offering liquidity and growth potential without the need to sell valuable assets. As it expands beyond Florida, Help is set to redefine how individuals interact with their digital wealth across the United States. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What cryptocurrencies can I use as collateral for Help’s crypto-backed loan service? A: Initially, Help ‘s service will accept XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , and USD Coin (USDC) as collateral for their crypto-backed loan service . This selection offers flexibility for a wide range of crypto holders. Q2: Where will Help’s crypto-backed loan service be available? A: The service will first launch as a pilot program in Florida in December. Following this initial phase, Help plans for a future nationwide expansion across the United States. Q3: Can I earn yield on my collateral with Help’s service? A: Yes, a unique feature of Help ‘s crypto-backed loan service is the ability for users to generate yield on the digital assets they have deposited as collateral. This adds an extra layer of financial benefit. Q4: What happens if the value of my collateral drops significantly? A: Like all secured loans, if the market value of your crypto collateral drops below a certain threshold (the loan-to-value ratio), you may receive a margin call. This would require you to deposit more collateral or repay a portion of your loan to maintain the agreed-upon ratio. It’s crucial to understand these terms before taking out a loan. Q5: Is Help a regulated firm? A: Help is described as a U.S. cryptocurrency firm. Operating in the United States implies adherence to relevant financial regulations, offering a level of compliance and security for users of their crypto-backed loan service .

53757718,615283,1761696014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53757718.jpeg,"Forget Gold’s Run To ATH, Analyst Reveals Why It’s Bitcoin’s Turn To Run Now",https://bitcoinist.com/why-its-bitcoins-turn-to-run-now/,"Gold’s price climbed to new all-time highs in mid-October, breaking above $4,000/oz for the first time in history, before eventually reaching a peak of $4,342/oz. The yellow metal’s rally came at a time when BTC was enduring a flash crash that pulled its price down to $101,000 very briefly. This contrast between gold’s strong rise and BTC’s pause has caught the attention of crypto commentator Sykodelic, who believes the pattern is about to flip . In his latest analysis, he suggests that gold may have already peaked while Bitcoin is preparing for its next major rally. Gold’s Blow-Off Top And The Cycle Inversion Sykodelic pointed to the nearly 18-month inverse correlation between gold and Bitcoin as the foundation of his argument. The analyst’s chart, which overlays both assets, shows a pattern of alternating expansions and corrections. Each time gold surged, BTC entered a cooling phase, and whenever gold stabilized or corrected, Bitcoin followed with a major upward leg. The most recent sequence places gold in what looks like a blow-off top structure. This blow-off top structure is a parabolic rally followed by exhaustion, confirmed by the precious metal’s current correction below its all-time high. This phase has always correlated with the point of transfer between the two assets. During periods when retail enthusiasm peaked in gold, Bitcoin’s price quietly consolidated at support zones. This timing, according to Sykodelic, is “almost down to the day.” The comparison chart below shows the synchronization. Gold’s breakout phases, shown in green channels, are followed by cooling phases highlighted in red, and Bitcoin’s chart below follows the same rhythm with a slight time delay. The structure implies that Bitcoin’s recent consolidation around the $110,000 to $115,000 range may be mirroring the early stages of gold’s last expansion phase in early September. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? From a technical perspective, this setup means that Bitcoin is now entering the same pattern gold just completed, with momentum building at the lower boundary of its new green channel highlighted in the chart image above. This implies that a breakout could lift Bitcoin well above its current all-time high, setting up what is another crypto rally similar to gold’s move earlier this month. “It’s Bitcoin’s turn to pump very hard,” Sykodelic said. The channel projection on his chart shows an advance that will see the BTC price breaking above $140,000 by the end of 2026 before the next capital rotation into gold. Of course, this all depends on how market news and events play out in favor of the crypto market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $114,196, up by 6% in the past seven days. Gold, on the other hand, is trading at $3,930, down by 9.5% in the same timeframe. This divergence might be the first sign that the capital rotation is already underway.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|gold|Sykodelic,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-29 00:00:14

Avalanche (AVAX) continues to lose ground amid declining ETF optimism, while Bittensor (TAO) consolidates in a tightening triangle pattern that could trigger a major move. Yet, the spotlight remains on BlockDAG , where the verified $430 million presale has sparked urgency among early buyers. With dual audits from CertiK and Halborn confirming the network’s transparency and robust architecture, trader confidence is surging. The $0.0015 price point stands as the golden opportunity before the listing jumps to $0.05, creating a decisive moment for participants. As the market favors audited, utility-driven networks, BlockDAG’s hybrid Layer-1 framework, verified ecosystem, and exchange readiness secure its position among the top crypto picks for 2025. AVAX Price Drop Tests Market Nerves Avalanche (AVAX) trades near $19.33, down 1.2% in the past 24 hours and 12.8% weekly as sentiment remains fragile. On-chain data shows $3.7 million in daily exchange outflows for four consecutive days, confirming weak conviction among short-term holders. The price remains below all major moving averages, 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs, signalling a bearish structure. RSI at 42 reflects subdued momentum, while traders watch the $19.00 support zone closely. A breakdown could open targets near $17.80, whereas a rebound above $20.50 might indicate early recovery. Despite short-term weakness, Avalanche’s fundamentals remain sound. The Octane upgrade has cut transaction fees by 98%, driving efficiency across its DeFi ecosystem. Analysts note that while ETF optimism fades, Avalanche’s scalability and ecosystem depth continue to underpin long-term value once broader risk appetite returns. TAO Triangle Tightens Near Resistance Bittensor (TAO) trades around $376.53, posting a 7.6% weekly decline amid thinning volume and neutral funding. The 4-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle, indicating consolidation before a potential breakout. Resistance stands at $420–$430, while support lies near $370. A breakout above resistance could target $470, whereas a slip below support risks a fall toward $350. Open interest has dropped 5.9% to $216 million, showing reduced leverage exposure, while the funding rate near 0.0024% signals a balance between long and short positions. Momentum indicators, including early green Heikin Ashi candles, hint at tentative buying pressure. Institutional investors such as TAO Synergies continue accumulating, reflecting belief in Bittensor’s decentralized AI model. For traders, TAO’s structure suggests a classic pre-breakout phase, making it one of the top crypto opportunities to monitor in late 2025. BlockDAG’s Dual Audits Fuel $430M Presale Surge! BlockDAG has solidified its credibility through dual audits by CertiK and Halborn, making it one of the most thoroughly verified presales in the market. Both firms confirmed the project’s robust architecture, secure coding standards, and transparent governance, resolving the trust concerns that often shadow early-stage crypto projects. This verification has been instrumental in driving BlockDAG’s presale beyond $430 million, setting a new benchmark for transparency and execution. Currently priced at $0.0015 in Batch 31, BlockDAG’s verified presale represents the final chance to secure early entry before the $0.05 listing. With over 3.5 million X1 app miners and 20,000 hardware miners already active, the network’s operational ecosystem is expanding rapidly ahead of Genesis Day. BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG architecture achieves 2,000–15,000 TPS, ensuring scalability without compromising decentralization. Additionally, Dashboard V4 introduces a gamified trading experience with live analytics, order tracking, and leaderboard rankings, enhancing user engagement. Backed by confirmed listings on 20 exchanges and a global marketing push through the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team partnership, BlockDAG has redefined what a verified presale can achieve. For traders seeking a blend of trust, technology, and long-term potential, BlockDAG stands as one of the best crypto projects to buy in 2025. The Bottom Line Avalanche’s decline and Bittensor’s consolidation highlight the broader market’s cautious tone, yet BlockDAG continues to advance with verifiable progress. The $0.0015 presale price marks the last confirmed entry before the expected $0.05 listing, offering substantial upside potential for early participants. Backed by CertiK and Halborn audits, over 3.5 million miners, and expanding hardware deployment, BlockDAG combines transparency with delivery. As traders seek reliability amid market uncertainty, BlockDAG’s hybrid network and audited infrastructure provide a clear advantage. With Genesis Day approaching, it exemplifies how verified presales can restore confidence in crypto fundraising. For those eyeing the top crypto assets of 2025, BlockDAG’s mix of proof, performance, and participation makes it a standout in a market hungry for authenticity.

Drawing from multiple independent analyses, the host presented a detailed argument suggesting that XRP could reach as high as $15 in the long term. This analysis follows a rebound across the cryptocurrency market after the sharp correction on October 10. To support this outlook, the host referenced well-known analysts in the XRP community, including CryptoInsightUK, Vincent Van Code, and EGRAG Crypto. Each expert presented different data points and perspectives that collectively reinforced the argument for a sustained bullish trend. CryptoInsightUK Predicts Sustained Uptrend Analyst CryptoInsightUK addressed recent concerns about XRP’s performance and argued that the current price movement indicates a stable upward trajectory. He noted that XRP shows limited downside liquidity, suggesting that there are few opportunities for the asset to drop significantly in price. According to him, this dynamic could drive XRP upward as traders and market makers seek to capitalize on liquidity at higher levels. He further pointed out that despite the widespread sell-offs during the October 10 liquidation event , XRP’s structure on higher timeframes remains largely intact. I know a few people in the space are saying $XRP isn't looking amazing right now. However, I can discuss a few things for you this morning. First off, $XRP has literally no downside liquidity. Whilst this doesn't mean price can't fluctuate / be pushed around, it does mean that… pic.twitter.com/BXJLb9y2Gq — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 27, 2025 On the weekly chart, the token continues to maintain a higher low formation, and on the quarterly chart, it remains well above its previous major resistance level from 2018. This, he argued, reflects an ongoing uptrend rather than a reversal. Additionally, CryptoInsightUK referred to a technical pattern based on the relative strength index (RSI). The last time XRP’s daily RSI hit oversold territory, the token experienced a sharp rally. Applying the same setup today, he projected that XRP could potentially climb toward the $15 region if the pattern repeats under similar market conditions. At the time of the Working Money broadcast, XRP was trading in the $2.62 to $2.63 range, having briefly reached $2.675 earlier in the day. The host observed that the general sentiment in the crypto market is improving. The Fear and Greed Index has risen to the neutral zone, while the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands around $3.89 trillion, nearing the $4 trillion mark. This recovery, combined with growing momentum among altcoins, suggests renewed investor confidence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Van Code Highlights XRP Liquidity Shortage Software engineer Vincent Van Code was also cited in the discussion for his recent remarks about XRP’s limited availability on exchanges. According to his findings, Binance currently holds only around 4 million XRP in its order books. He explained that such thin liquidity could cause significant price movement if large buyers attempt to acquire millions of tokens at once. Van Code warned that a purchase of 10 million XRP at current prices could quickly push the token’s price upward due to limited supply. He also noted that institutional interest, such as Evernorth’s plan to acquire $1 billion worth of XRP, could further intensify this effect. Moreover, he mentioned that over-the-counter (OTC) and wholesale markets, typically used by institutions to avoid price fluctuations, are seeing reduced availability as many long-term holders refuse to sell. EGRAG Crypto Confirms Strong Market Structure The discussion concluded with insights from EGRAG Crypto , which has consistently argued against bearish projections. He maintained that XRP’s market structure remains solid as long as it closes above $2.20 and $1.97 on monthly timeframes. According to him, the asset’s current trajectory mirrors earlier financial cycles, specifically those seen in 1999 and 2007, when risk assets experienced a final surge before a broader market correction. EGRAG emphasized that the current market has not yet reached the kind of euphoria that typically signals a cycle peak, implying that XRP may still have room to appreciate further before the next major downturn. The analyses from CryptoInsightUK, Vincent Van Code, and EGRAG Crypto all align in suggesting that XRP remains in a structurally strong position. The combination of tight exchange liquidity, renewed market optimism, and supportive technical indicators collectively strengthens the argument for a potential long-term move toward $15.

This innovative new platform is poised to introduce a much-needed layer of risk-controlled yield generation, directly addressing one of the primary concerns for users venturing into the safety of their deposited capital. SolsticeFi is reimagining how investors earn on Solana by introducing a defensively engineered approach to yield, one that directly protects the value of user deposits. According to crypto commentator Madissa’s post on X, one of SolsticeFi’s most compelling features is its ability to allow users to continue earning staking rewards while keeping their assets liquid and usable across the broader DeFi ecosystem. How SolsticeFi Balances Risk While Generating Yield This innovation created continuous opportunities for user to deploy their capital in other protocols without interrupting their base yield, instead of locking up funds. SolsticeFi platform is designed to prioritize full transparency and validator diversification, minimizing exposure to single-validator risks and opaque yield platforms. Furthermore, depositing capital into SolsticeFi provides support for SOL’s network security while generating sustainable returns for users. Related Reading: Solana Stays Strong: Network Outperforms Rivals Amid AWS Outage Turmoil Crypto analyst Hokage has also mentioned how Solana is improving and completely revolutionizing financial transaction speeds in traditional finance (TraFi), where transfers take days, settlements drag, and middlemen slow everything down. SOL has changed the game by creating a new block every 400 milliseconds, and currently, the central to this acceleration is Bam, the new block assembly marketplace. This Bam will speed up how quickly user transaction gets picked up and integrated into a block, and slash inclusion times to an astonishing 50-100 milliseconds. Building on this is Alpenglow, which takes finality down to an incredible 100-150 milliseconds faster than a blink, and the point where the network confirms the user transaction is 100% done and irreversible. One project that stands out in these ultra-fast ecosystem steps is SolsticeFi’s USX, a stablecoin specifically built to move at that speed, which enables users to send dollars, deploy capital, and settle instantly. Hokage concluded that “while these advancements might sound like pure sci-fi, if you’ve been around the SOL ecosystem, you would know it’s not.” Market Confidence Returns To Solana While SolsticeFi provides speed and reduces risk to Solana yield platforms, KOLS Manager at Binance, investor, and trader BitGuru, has noted that SOL’s price is currently showing a strong bullish setup, after following a steady downtrend and now stabilizing near key support. Related Reading: Solana Pauses To Recharge – Will $195 Support Hold The Line For A Comeback? As a result of that action, the SOL market is now pulling back with considerable strength, aiming to break above the critical $210 resistance level, a zone that has capped multiple attempts at recovery. A decisive breakout above $210 would likely trigger SOL’s next leg higher toward $230 and beyond.

Reports indicate a massive transfer of Ethereum (ETH) that has caught the attention of market watchers. Specifically, Onchain-Lense , a reputable blockchain analytics firm, has highlighted a substantial movement: 27,316 ETH, valued at approximately $108.92 million, was transferred from BitGo to a new wallet. This wallet is strongly suspected of belonging to none other than Bitmain , a major player in the crypto mining industry. This strategic move means Bitmain now holds an impressive 2.7% of the total ETH supply. The implications of such a significant Bitmain ETH accumulation are worth exploring. What Does Bitmain’s Massive ETH Accumulation Mean for the Market? Bitmain ‘s recent acquisition of Ethereum isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a powerful statement. When a company of Bitmain ‘s stature makes such a substantial investment, it often signals a strong belief in the asset’s future potential. This particular transfer of Bitmain ETH positions them as a significant holder, sometimes referred to as a “whale” in the crypto space. For context, Bitmain is primarily known for manufacturing cryptocurrency mining hardware. While their historical focus has been heavily on Bitcoin mining, this significant ETH acquisition suggests a diversification of their crypto holdings and perhaps a broader strategic outlook on the blockchain ecosystem. This could indicate a growing confidence in Ethereum ‘s long-term value and its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Why is Bitmain Accumulating Ethereum Now? Several factors might be at play behind this strategic move. One possibility is a bullish long-term outlook on Ethereum ‘s price. With Ethereum ‘s ongoing developments, including scalability improvements and its dominance in smart contract platforms, institutional players like Bitmain might see it as a valuable asset for future growth. Moreover, this purchase could reflect Bitmain ‘s strategy to diversify its treasury assets, moving beyond its primary focus on Bitcoin -related ventures. This helps mitigate risks and capitalize on different market segments. The timing of this Bitmain ETH purchase is also crucial, potentially reflecting an opportune entry point based on their market analysis. Long-Term Confidence: Bitmain likely sees Ethereum as a robust and essential part of the future digital economy. Portfolio Diversification: Spreading investments across different major cryptocurrencies reduces reliance on a single asset. Strategic Positioning: Holding a significant portion of the total ETH supply gives Bitmain considerable influence and exposure. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of Bitmain ETH Holdings? The accumulation of such a large amount of Ethereum by a single entity like Bitmain can have several ripple effects across the market. Firstly, it could be perceived as a strong vote of confidence, potentially encouraging other institutional and retail investors to consider ETH . This positive sentiment could contribute to price stability or even upward momentum for Ethereum . Furthermore, a large holder like Bitmain gains significant influence. While not necessarily used for manipulation, their future buying or selling activities could impact market dynamics. However, the sheer size of the Ethereum market means that even a substantial holding like this is unlikely to cause extreme volatility on its own. Instead, it adds another significant institutional player to the Bitmain ETH ecosystem, further maturing the market. Challenges could arise if such large holdings become concentrated among a few entities, raising concerns about centralization. However, the decentralized nature of Ethereum ‘s network means that individual holdings, even substantial ones, do not directly control the protocol itself. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitmain ETH and Ethereum Bitmain ‘s significant Ethereum accumulation underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency space. As more established companies recognize the value and potential of digital assets, the market gains further legitimacy and stability. This move by Bitmain could inspire other traditional tech or financial giants to explore similar investments, driving further capital into the Ethereum network. For investors, this development serves as a reminder of the evolving landscape of crypto investments. Keeping an eye on major institutional movements, like this Bitmain ETH transfer, can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future trends. It reinforces the idea that Ethereum is not just a speculative asset but a foundational technology attracting serious long-term capital. In conclusion, Bitmain ‘s acquisition of $109 million in Ethereum is a monumental event in the crypto world. It signals a robust belief in Ethereum ‘s future, diversifies Bitmain ‘s portfolio, and adds another powerful institutional player to the ETH ecosystem.

The company is shifting into artificial intelligence infrastructure while still running its bitcoin business. The CEO explained the plan on CNBC’s “Crypto World” and said this model will likely become common among miners. CleanSpark recently won a 100‑megawatt site in Cheyenne, Wyoming, beating Microsoft for the contract. The CEO said the deciding factor was speed. CleanSpark built a 100‑megawatt mining site in about six months, while building a full AI data center can take between three and six years. “We were able to scale up and deploy 100 megawatt bitcoin mining facility in about six months,” CEO Matt Schultz said. “Certainly, Cheyenne didn’t select CleanSpark because we had a stronger balance sheet than Microsoft.” The company once operated as an energy firm before shifting to bitcoin mining five years ago. Schultz said this pivot brings the company back to its roots because the competition now revolves around access to power. CleanSpark currently operates 1.03 gigawatts of active facilities and has 1.7 gigawatts planned. Schultz described the model as “monetizing megawatts,” using bitcoin mining to scale power infrastructure fast, and then converting selected locations into high‑performance computing for AI where it makes sense. He said bitcoin miners can build and energize data centers quickly, but power access is the main barrier for everyone in the space. CleanSpark expands into AI campuses CleanSpark announced a partnership with Submer, a data center engineering company, to develop AI‑focused campuses across North America. The plan combines CleanSpark’s energy and land assets with Submer’s liquid‑cooled, high‑density systems. Schultz said , “We are positioned to deliver AI capacity at gigawatt scale, faster, cleaner, and more efficiently than traditional approaches.” He said the goal is to turn CleanSpark’s infrastructure platform into the backbone of the next phase of computing. One region Schultz pointed to as a growing AI cluster is Atlanta, which he described as second only to Northern Virginia on the East Coast for data center development. Running AI models consumes large amounts of power. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are spending heavily on new data centers and signing deals with utilities to build new nuclear reactors or restart old ones. Even with that spending, many of the new projects face long delays connecting to the grid. Schultz said, “Hyperscalers are spending 60% of their free cash flow on capex to try and keep up with AI.” He added that miners already control what is hardest to secure: land, substations, and direct access to electricity. Crypto margins tighten as dual‑track model grows Shares of CleanSpark are up more than 100% this year. The shift to AI helps offset tighter bitcoin mining profits after the April halving cut block rewards by half. CleanSpark reported $198.6 million in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, up nearly 91% year over year, and holds 12,703 bitcoin in its treasury. Schultz said the AI move does not replace crypto earnings. “It’s [bitcoin mining] a terrific part of our business,” he said. CleanSpark’s power model allows it to shut down mining operations during grid stress and push power back to utilities, something AI centers cannot easily do. Schultz said blending mining with AI gives utilities flexibility. During hurricane Helene in Georgia, CleanSpark powered down and redirected energy. “The lights came back on at the hospital within an hour,” he said.

Today, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely recognized barometer for investor psychology, stands at a pivotal 51. This score, a slight uptick from yesterday, firmly places the market in a neutral zone. But what does this equilibrium truly signify for those navigating the volatile waters of digital assets? Let’s delve deeper into what this crucial metric reveals about the current state of crypto sentiment. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal Today? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me , offers a fascinating snapshot of the market’s emotional pulse. Operating on a scale from 0 to 100, it helps investors gauge whether the market is leaning towards extreme fear (0) or extreme greed (100). A score of 51, hovering precisely in the middle, indicates that neither fear nor euphoria is dominating investor decisions right now. This neutral stance suggests a period of consolidation or indecision, where market participants are perhaps waiting for clearer signals before making significant moves. It’s a moment for cautious observation rather than impulsive action. Unpacking the Components: How is This Crucial Index Calculated? Understanding how the Crypto Fear & Greed Index arrives at its score is vital for accurate interpretation. It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of several key market indicators, each weighted differently to reflect its impact on overall sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the factors that contribute to this powerful metric: Volatility (25%): Measures the current price fluctuations of Bitcoin and compares them to average values. Higher volatility often signals a fearful market. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volumes and market momentum. High buying volumes in a rising market can indicate greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related keywords and sentiment. An abundance of positive chatter can signal greed. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these surveys historically asked investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates a flight to safety, suggesting fear in altcoin markets. Google Search Trends (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sudden spikes in “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” searches can signal fear. By combining these diverse data points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a holistic view of market psychology, moving beyond simple price action. Navigating Neutrality: What Does a Score of 51 Mean for Your Strategy? A neutral score of 51 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it suggests a lack of extreme emotional biases, which can lead to more rational market behavior. On the other hand, it often precedes significant moves, as the market is essentially ‘coiling’ before a breakout in either direction. For investors, this period calls for a balanced and informed approach: Opportunity for Research: Use this calmer period to thoroughly research potential investments, understand underlying technologies, and assess long-term viability. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Resist the urge to chase small price movements. Neutrality often means chop, where prices fluctuate without clear direction. Prepare for Shifts: While neutral, the market rarely stays static. Be ready for potential shifts towards fear or greed, and have a strategy in place for both scenarios. Diversify Wisely: Re-evaluate your portfolio. A neutral sentiment can be a good time to adjust allocations without the pressure of extreme market conditions. The key is to use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as one tool among many, rather than a standalone indicator for making investment decisions. Beyond the Numbers: Limitations and Strategic Use of This Crucial Metric While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool for understanding market sentiment, it’s essential to recognize its limitations. It measures current emotions, but it doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Market dynamics are complex, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological advancements, and unforeseen events. Relying solely on this index without considering fundamental analysis or technical indicators would be an incomplete strategy. Instead, consider using this crucial metric as a complementary indicator. For example, a shift from extreme fear to neutral might signal a potential bottom, while a move from neutral to extreme greed could warn of an impending correction. Experienced traders often use the index to identify contrarian opportunities, buying when others are fearful and taking profits when others are overly greedy. It’s about understanding the prevailing mood and how it might influence collective behavior. The current neutral stance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 51 serves as a timely reminder for all crypto enthusiasts. It highlights a market that is currently holding its breath, poised for its next significant move. While not a definitive predictor, this crucial indicator offers invaluable insights into the collective psychology of crypto investors. By understanding its components and implications, you can better navigate the market’s ebbs and flows, making more informed and strategic decisions in your crypto journey. Stay informed, stay strategic, and remember that patience often yields the greatest rewards in volatile markets.

Robyn said that if Elon Musk leaves or becomes less involved, Tesla is ready to name a new chief executive from inside the company to ensure what she described as an “orderly transition.” She said internal succession is the most likely path, though the board is not fully ruling out candidates from outside. Elon Musk’s compensation plan would give him about 25% voting control if he achieves major growth milestones linked to Tesla’s market value, including expansion in electric cars, robotics, and the robotaxi program. Elon Musk has made it clear that if he does not receive the compensation structure he wants, he may shift more of his time toward his other companies, including SpaceX and xAI. Robyn said: “I’ve had the conversations with him directly. There’s no question in my mind that if we don’t get this across, there is a high probability he would back away from the company or become less engaged.” Board campaigns for shareholder support Robyn emphasized that the pay plan is tied to performance expectations, not simply a payout.The shareholder vote will take place at Tesla’s annual meeting on November 6. said the outcome is not guaranteed because many investors wait until the last minute to cast their votes.About 30% of Tesla’s shareholders are retail holders, which is unusually high, so the board has been making direct efforts to encourage them to vote. Robyn and other board members, including James Murdoch and former Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung, have been meeting with some of the largest institutional shareholders, including Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc., and State Street Corp. Many investors often follow recommendations from proxy advisory firms. Two of the largest, ISS and Glass Lewis, have recommended voting against the compensation plan. Robyn said : “There is no guarantee. There is a large contingent of passive investors who actually follow their guidance, so we have to counter that with them directly.” As part of the effort to encourage voting, Tesla placed its Optimus humanoid robot outside the Nasdaq building in New York. The robot handed out Tesla-branded gummy candies, waved at people, and posed for pictures as crowds gathered. Videos were taken and shared widely online. Succession planning and future business decisions Tesla shares rose 2.9% at midday in New York, and the stock is up 12% this year, compared to a 17% increase in the S&P 500 Index. Earlier this year, the company’s stock was affected by concerns over an aging vehicle lineup and public reactions to Elon Musk’s political activity. The board believes that Elon Musk’s continued engagement is tied to Tesla’s artificial intelligence development and its future products. If the proposal does not get enough support, Tesla has what Robyn described as Plan B. She said Tesla has a strong internal leadership group. One key figure is Tom Zhu, who oversees global production and operations in China. Tom has worked across multiple divisions in Tesla, a deliberate move to ensure internal candidates understand the company deeply. Robyn said Tesla has “a whole range of different alternatives out there,” including the possibility of splitting leadership roles among more than one person. Another item in the upcoming meeting is a nonbinding vote on whether Tesla should invest in xAI, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company. Robyn said, “We haven’t invested in it” because the technology being built at xAI is different from what Tesla focuses on. However, Robyn added that if shareholders approve the idea, it would start a review process to evaluate the related-party transaction before any investment happens.

Under the deal, the firms will also deploy the self-driving vehicles. According to The Verge, the agreement stipulates that Stellantis will manufacture the vehicles, while Foxconn and chip making giant will provide the self-driving technology as well as systems integration. Under this deal, Uber will then roll out the finished robotaxis on its global ride-hailing platform. For Uber , the initiative comes as the company is also actively championing the crucial role of AI in the transportation tech, hoping to leverage the technology for growth. Uber will start with a 5,000 vehicle rollout in the US Production is scheduled to start in 2028 and Uber will initially launch 5,000 vehicles in the US markets before expanding the program internationally. Recently, Uber teamed up with AI specialist Wayve to trial fully autonomous rides across the UK, with no human behind the wheel, beginning in spring 2026 as previously reported by Cryptopolitan . With this partnership with Wayve, a London-based startup backed by SoftBank, Uber aims to bring driverless journeys to passengers in London. According to Stellantis, its “AV-Ready” platforms such as the K0 Medium Size Van and the STLA Small –are designed with flexibility in mind, capable of supporting multiple passengers and configurations suited for autonomous operation. As for Nvidia, its Drive AGX Hyperion 10 platform will power the vehicles’ brains, combining the company’s DriveOS software with advanced AI hardware for autonomous decision-making. According to the agreement, Foxconn, which is better known for assembling Apple’s iPhones, will aid with hardware and systems integration – though the company’s exact role remains somewhat vague. Beyond semiconductors and smartphones, Foxconn has earlier revealed that it is actively pursuing growth in the electric-vehicle (EV) sector. Its subsidiary, Foxtron Vehicle Technologies, established in partnership with Yulon Motor , signed a memorandum of understanding with Mitsubishi Motors to design and manufacture a new EV model in Taiwan. Now, the partnership with Stellantis and the other firms signals a renewed enthusiasm for autonomous mobility after years of scepticism and shutdowns across the industry because of safety concerns and high development costs. By pooling expertise from multiple sectors, automotive, technology, and ridehailing – the partners aim to overcome previous hurdles that have stalled the commercialisation of self-driving vehicles. Analysts are however still cautious that such partnerships often resemble supplier agreements more than equal partnerships. Already, Nvidia supplies autonomous tech to several other automakers, including General Motors and Lucid, while Uber has made it clear that its platform will host robotaxis from a range of manufacturers, such as Waymo and Volkswagen. For Stellantis, the deal highlights its growing focus on automation. The vehicle making giant has been developing Level 3 semi-autonomous systems for its major brands. It previously signed another separate robotax partnership Pony.ai to develop and test driverless vehicles in Europe. On successful implementation, the new venture could mark a turning point in the long-delayed promise of driverless mobility—potentially ushering in a new era where hailing a ride might not require a human driver at all.

This was the electrifying reality at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025, where Thomas Middleditch, the beloved star of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” made an unexpected yet impactful appearance. His presence wasn’t just for a casual chat; Middleditch took center stage to champion an innovative Australian startup, demonstrating the powerful convergence of entertainment, technology, and the evolving landscape of digital innovation. Who is Thomas Middleditch and Why Was He at Bitcoin World Disrupt? For fans of HBO’s critically acclaimed series “Silicon Valley,” Thomas Middleditch is synonymous with Richard Hendricks, the socially awkward but brilliant CEO of Pied Piper. The show itself famously parodied and celebrated the very essence of tech conferences like Disrupt, making Middleditch’s appearance at Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 a meta-moment of epic proportions. His presence was a deliberate and engaging surprise, designed to capture attention and highlight a compelling new venture. This wasn’t just a celebrity endorsement; it was a testament to the growing mainstream interest in the intersection of AI, blockchain, and creative industries. Middleditch’s role went beyond a mere cameo. He executed a planned takeover of Othelia’s presentation, an Australian startup competing in the prestigious Battlefield 200. This strategic move instantly elevated Othelia’s profile, drawing significant attention to their mission and technology. The actor, amid being pitched, photographed, and mildly swarmed by enthusiastic attendees in the Expo hall, also found time to share his valuable perspective on the conference, the transformative power of AI, and how he integrates AI platforms into his own creative projects, such as his popular “Improv With Robots” YouTube channel. Unveiling Othelia: The Next Frontier in AI Storytelling Platform At the heart of Middleditch’s captivating pitch was Othelia, an ambitious Australian startup with a clear vision: to build a Cursor-like platform specifically tailored for storytellers. In an era where content creation is king, Othelia’s AI storytelling platform aims to empower creators by providing advanced tools that streamline and enhance the narrative development process. Imagine an AI assistant that understands your creative intent, helps you flesh out characters, plotlines, and even generate dialogue, all while maintaining your unique artistic voice. This is the promise of Othelia. The concept of an AI storytelling platform is revolutionary, offering several key benefits: Enhanced Creativity: By automating mundane tasks, AI frees up storytellers to focus on high-level creative decisions. Increased Efficiency: Rapid prototyping of story ideas, character arcs, and world-building elements. Accessibility: Lowering the barrier to entry for aspiring writers and content creators.

Today, that humor feels closer to reality as markets shift at lightning speed. Gold is hitting record highs, Bitcoin is rallying ahead of a major breakout, and TRON is making headlines with its public debut via a reverse merger. Amid this volatility, early-stage projects are quietly gaining momentum, creating opportunities for savvy investors. Now is the perfect moment to explore which projects could become the best 100x crypto this year. For those aiming to position for exponential upside, timing, strategy, and careful research are more important than ever. Choosing the right opportunity can mean the difference between modest gains and extraordinary returns in today’s fast-moving crypto markets. This makes it essential for investors who want to capitalize on the best 100x crypto this year to explore the potential of these projects while managing risk. In this article, we take a close look at Bitcoin, BullZilla, and TRON, analyzing their investment potential, technological innovation, market positioning, and community support, offering valuable insights for investors, developers, and analysts seeking to navigate this dynamic world effectively. Don’t Wait – Only 500 Allocations Remain for the Next BullZilla Presale Stage! Bitcoin Tests $116K Resistance Amid Neutral-Bullish Consolidation Bitcoin is currently navigating a neutral-to-bullish consolidation, trading between its 100- and 200-day moving averages. The $116K level now serves as the primary resistance for any upward continuation, while the $109K zone marks the threshold that would invalidate the bullish outlook. With gold up more than 33% this year, this zone marks a critical inflection point: a sustained close above $116K would signal a structural shift, potentially propelling Bitcoin toward the $120K–$122K supply area. However, the rejection candle forming near the 100-day moving average underscores ongoing selling pressure from short-term holders. That said, its upside may be tempered by its scale and maturity relative to smaller projects, making 100× returns less likely, though structural value remains strong. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin News Today What makes Bitcoin a safe-haven asset? Bitcoin’s capped supply, robust institutional inflows, and increasing inclusion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reinforce its role as a digital reserve asset. These factors position it as a potential hedge in volatile markets, offering investors a combination of scarcity-driven value. Why might Bitcoin break out now? The BTC/gold ratio has formed a bullish triangle, suggesting potential upside for Bitcoin. As gold’s price momentum slows, conservative investors may rotate capital into Bitcoin, viewing it as an alternative store of value. BullZilla ($BZIL) – Best 100x Crypto this Year BullZilla ($BZIL) opens an exciting chapter in early-stage crypto, making it a potential best 100x crypto this year . The project emphasizes scarcity, utility, and community through its presale mechanics. So far, it has raised over $980K, with more than 31 billion tokens sold and 3,300+ holders onboard. At the current stage price of $0.00019906, BullZilla promises an estimated ROI of 2,548% for late-stage participants and over 3,361% for early adopters, making structured gains a possibility rather than mere hype. A $1,000 investment in BullZilla could generate 5.023 million $BZIL tokens, highlighting the carefully engineered potential upside through mechanisms such as staking in the HODL Furnace, token burns via the Roar Burn Mechanism, and layered referral programs that reward community engagement. For instance, allocating $5,000 today with a listing target of $0.00527 could yield a gross value of approximately $26,350. While these numbers are promising, they remain projections, underscoring the importance of strategic planning, risk awareness, and fully understanding BullZilla’s structured growth approach. How to Join the BullZilla Presale To join the BullZilla presale, participants should visit the official purchase portal , connect a supported wallet, and follow the guided purchase steps. Authentication and identity checks protect the ecosystem, while instructions highlight verifying contract addresses and avoiding phishing sources. After purchase, tokens may appear after network confirmations and vesting schedules apply. It is essential to use the official site and verify via project channels. With the next phase priced at $0.00020573 (a 3.35% bump), early entry matters. Frequently Asked Questions About Bullzilla Presale Why might my presale tokens not show in my wallet immediately? Tokens might not appear immediately in a wallet due to factors such as blockchain confirmation delays, vesting schedules, or the requirement to manually add the token contract to the wallet. How can one spot fake Telegram channels about BullZilla? Authentic channels can be identified by official verification badges, consistent branding, and direct links from the project’s official website. In contrast, scam or fake channels often exhibit spelling mistakes, inconsistent or distorted logos, and unresponsive or unreachable administrators, signaling a high risk of fraud or misinformation. How are presales potentially life-changing? Early-stage access provides investors with significant discounts and a structured path to potential upside. When a project’s utility, token scarcity, and community support align effectively, participating early can result in outsized returns. Claim Your Share!

On-chain metrics show TRON’s circulating supply near 94.66 billion and a market cap of around $28 billion. Its ecosystem boasts high stablecoin activity and expanding DeFi infrastructure, recently cutting transaction fees to boost adoption. Although ranked as a comparatively larger project, and thus less likely to deliver 100× growth, TRON offers established infrastructure, real-world applications, and institutional anchoring features that the smallest presales lack. Frequently Asked Questions About TRON News Today What is TRON’s current market cap and supply? TRON’s market capitalization is around $28 billion, with a circulating supply of 94.66 billion TRX tokens. This large scale supports strong liquidity, stability, and sustained investor confidence across global markets. How does TRON differ from smaller presale coins? TRON offers a mature blockchain, real-world integrations, and massive stablecoin transaction volumes, ensuring stability. Smaller presale tokens rely on scarcity and speculation, presenting higher potential returns but significantly greater volatility and investment risk. Conclusion – Which is the Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now? The recent breakout signals around Bitcoin, combined with TRON’s strategic institutional initiatives, have created an exciting environment for high-potential crypto engagement. Bitcoin’s growing role as a digital safe-haven asset and TRON’s structural resilience both emphasize the rapid evolution of the blockchain ecosystem. Investors are increasingly seeking opportunities that balance stability with strong upside potential, while developers and analysts evaluate innovative blockchain protocols. These market dynamics underline why timing, strategic positioning, and informed decision-making are vital in today’s competitive crypto world. Within this dynamic environment, BullZilla stands out as the best 100x crypto this year . Its blend of early-stage tokenomics, structured presale phases, and defined real-world utility mechanisms makesfla it uniquely positioned for exponential growth. Nevertheless, investors must stay alert to common risks such as volatility, smart contract vulnerabilities, and market timing challenges. A well-informed approach enables participants to navigate these risks effectively while leveraging BullZilla’s potential as a project engineered for innovation, scalability, and long-term ecosystem expansion. Secure your allocation now, join BullZilla before the next price jump and ride the potential upside with fewer spots left!

This move, alongside a transfer of another 2,361.73 BTC ($266.20 million) to a new address, was meticulously tracked by Onchain Lens and has ignited considerable market discussion. When such a considerable amount of Bitcoin moves to an exchange, it is often interpreted as a potential signal of an intention to sell, prompting many to ponder the intentions of this seasoned market participant. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Investor Deposit Signify? Deposits of this scale to centralized exchanges are invariably under intense scrutiny by market analysts. Historically, these movements suggest that the holder might be preparing to liquidate some of their assets. For an individual like Gunden, whose associated address still retains a staggering 7,150 BTC (worth around $806.44 million), such a deposit can undoubtedly send ripples across the entire market. Potential Selling Pressure: A large influx of BTC onto an exchange could increase the available supply, potentially leading to downward price pressure if a significant sell-off materializes. Market Sentiment Impact: The actions of prominent early holders can significantly influence broader market sentiment, prompting other investors to reassess their own positions. However, it is crucial to understand that a deposit does not always culminate in an immediate sale. Various factors could be at play, including portfolio rebalancing, utilizing exchange services for other financial instruments, or even preparing for large over-the-counter (OTC) deals that bypass direct impact on spot market prices. The Enduring Influence of Early Bitcoin Holders Early Bitcoin holders, often termed “whales,” control a substantial portion of the total Bitcoin supply. Their strategic movements are frequently perceived as indicators of market confidence or impending caution. Owen Gunden exemplifies these pioneers who acquired Bitcoin when its value was dramatically lower than today. Their decisions, due to the sheer volume of their holdings, carry significant weight. The fact that Gunden’s address still holds a massive 7,150 BTC after these recent transfers underscores the profound long-term conviction many early adopters possess. While a portion was directed to Kraken, an even larger sum was moved to a fresh address, potentially signaling a strategic reallocation of assets rather than a complete divestment. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Every Investor For everyday participants in the dynamic crypto market, observing these large-scale movements offers invaluable lessons. While it is tempting to engage in immediate speculation, adopting a measured and informed approach is consistently the most prudent strategy. Stay Informed: Diligently monitor on-chain analytics and consult reputable news sources to comprehend significant market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid concentrating all your capital in one asset. Diversification is a powerful tool to help mitigate risks associated with large market shifts. Implement Robust Risk Management: Develop a clear, predefined investment strategy and adhere to it, rather than reacting impulsively to the actions of large holders or market FUD. Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey has been characterized by notable volatility. Focusing on the long-term growth trajectory can help investors navigate and withstand short-term fluctuations. What’s Next for This Noteworthy Investor and the Broader Market? The cryptocurrency community will undoubtedly continue to closely observe Owen Gunden’s address and the Kraken exchange for any subsequent activity. Will the deposited BTC be sold, or is this merely a strategic repositioning within a larger financial plan? The resolution of these questions could have short-term implications for Bitcoin’s price action and market sentiment. Ultimately, the actions of a single influential holder, even a significant Bitcoin investor , represent just one facet of the intricate puzzle that defines the crypto market. Broader macroeconomic trends, evolving regulatory frameworks, and increasing institutional adoption continue to exert pivotal influence over Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Compelling Summary: A Whale’s Strategic Move Sparks Market Watch The recent substantial deposit by early Bitcoin investor Owen Gunden to Kraken has undeniably captured significant market attention. While such large-scale movements often hint at potential selling, the subsequent transfer of an even greater sum to a new address suggests a more intricate, strategic repositioning. This event powerfully highlights the immense influence of major holders and serves as a vital reminder for all investors to remain informed, practice diligent risk management, and maintain a resilient long-term perspective within the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Owen Gunden? A1: Owen Gunden is identified as an early Bitcoin investor , known for holding a substantial amount of BTC acquired in the early days of cryptocurrency. His recent movements of significant Bitcoin holdings have drawn considerable market attention. Q2: What does a large BTC deposit to an exchange like Kraken signify? A2: A large deposit of Bitcoin to a centralized exchange such as Kraken is frequently interpreted as a potential intention to sell. Investors often move their assets to exchanges when they plan to liquidate holdings, though it can also be for other purposes like portfolio rebalancing or engaging in over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Q3: How do the actions of early Bitcoin investors (whales) impact the market? A3: Early Bitcoin investors, often called “whales” due to their massive holdings, can significantly influence market sentiment and price action. Their large transactions, whether deposits, withdrawals, or transfers, can create speculation, increase volatility, or signal broader trends due to the sheer volume of their assets. Q4: Should individual investors react immediately to whale movements? A4: While it’s important to stay informed about significant market movements, individual investors are generally advised against making impulsive decisions based solely on whale activity. It’s more prudent to stick to a well-defined investment strategy, manage risk, diversify, and maintain a long-term perspective rather than reacting emotionally to short-term market fluctuations. Q5: What is Onchain Lens? A5: Onchain Lens is a platform or entity that provides on-chain analytics and reporting, tracking significant cryptocurrency transactions and movements on various blockchain networks, offering insights into market activity and large holder behavior.

According to the Norwegian Tax Administration (Skatteetaten), more than 73,000 taxpayers reported owning digital assets in their 2024 tax filings — a 30% increase compared to the previous year. The declared holdings were valued at over $4 billion, including about $550 million in gains and $290 million in losses, highlighting both growing participation and heightened compliance. Officials attribute the surge to ongoing awareness campaigns, technological improvements that simplify reporting, and the upcoming introduction of third-party reporting requirements for crypto exchanges and custodians, which are set to take effect by 2026. These measures will make it mandatory for service providers to share transaction data with the government, closing long-standing gaps in crypto-related tax compliance. Additionally, the number of taxpayers that reported owning digital assets in their 2024 tax filings is considerably higher than in 2019, when only about 6,470 individuals out of the European country’s total population of around 5.5 million reported having cryptocurrency. Regarding digital assets reporting, the Norwegian Tax Administration noted that 2024 saw an improvement in reporting, as more individuals reported their cryptocurrency holdings than in the previous year. Norwegian tax authority recognizes an improvement in digital assets reporting In a statement, Nina Schanke Funnemark, Director of the Norwegian Tax Administration, acknowledged that it is encouraging when more individuals declare their own cryptocurrency holdings. Funnemark explained that this move is important as it ensures accurate tax reporting. “We have implemented several measures in recent years to boost these numbers, and we are noticing positive results,” she added. To strengthen the enforcement of the reporting policy, the tax authority stated that, as of January 1, 2026, crypto custodians and exchange operators must report certain information through third-party channels. Sources from Norway, in the meantime, have reported that the country has a central bank with a sovereign wealth fund that invests partially in digital assets. This came to light after reports surfaced in August indicating that the foundation had an indirect exposure of 7,161 BTC. This was achieved by investing in companies such as Metaplanet, Coinbase, and Strategy. The latest data reflects a growing global trend toward stricter crypto tax compliance, as governments move to integrate digital assets more firmly into traditional financial frameworks. UK’s HMRC emphasizes the need for crypto tax compliance Like Norway, several governments have announced significant updates to their tax regulations as cryptocurrencies gain more popularity among individuals. Earlier this month, the UK’s tax agency reportedly sent approximately 65,000 letters to cryptocurrency holders who were believed to have failed to report or evade taxes on their gains from the digital assets. This move was initiated after the country’s tax authority intensified its investigation into cryptocurrency investors, issuing double the number of warning letters to suspected non-compliers or evaders of taxes related to gains on digital assets. The 65,000 letters from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the UK’s tax, payments, and customs authority, were sent between the 2024 and 2025 tax years. Regarding this figure, a reliable source noted that the letters exceeded the 27,700 sent the previous year, citing data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Notably, the letters are referred to as “nudge letters” and were introduced to encourage investors to correct their tax filings before official investigations commenced voluntarily. Still, the HMRC increases emphasis on crypto tax compliance. The agency has sent over 100,000 letters in the last four years, as digital assets adoption and asset prices increased.

While XRP’s price performance in the current times is indicating the possibility of a good comeback, Mutuum Finance is gaining traction with its groundbreaking dual-lending protocol and presale history that is smashing all-time highs. Now selling at Stage 6 for $0.035 and more than 80% sold out already, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming one of the market’s top cryptocurrencies. More and more investors are opining that MUTM’s revolutionary architecture and initial traction is evoking the type of potential that was available for XRP in its early growth phase, positioning it as a new crypto coin to watch in 2025. XRP Price Forecast: Institutional Support Pushes for 35% Rally XRP is drawing stiff bullish cues as price action bounces off the significant $2.33 support zone, a historically strong launching pad for mass rallies. Technicals project a possible 35% rally to the $3.45 mark, supported by a clear pick-up in trading activity and renewed market sentiment. In addition to the charts, Ripple’s introduction of Ripple Prime, a global prime brokerage solution for institutions, is supporting XRP’s credibility in cross-border payments and making it more attractive to professional investors. While Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrates its power above $111,000, institutional adoption would be the key that would drive XRP to its next breakout phase. As faith returns to veteran alts, investors are also adding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to their watchlists, which is rapidly gaining popularity as a new crypto coin and one of the top cryptocurrencies for 2025. Mutuum Finance Attracts Early Birds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly turning out to be one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to keep an eye on in 2025, capturing the interest of investors globally. The presale has received over 17,500 individuals participating and has raised over $18.15 million to date with increasing market demand. During Phase 6, the existing price of the MUTM token is $0.035, its most devalued state prior to the price increasing to $0.04 in the subsequent phase. This phase has experienced a rush of demand, and sales have already hit 80% sell-out in record time, an indicator of growing investor confidence in the long-term future of the project. This drive places MUTM at the top of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in today and highlights it as a new crypto coin with serious growth potential. Consistent Passive Income With Mutuum Finance Aside from token appreciation, Mutuum Finance also offers steady passive income in the form of its liquidity pools, with investors earning annual percentage yields (APY) based on market demand. For instance, an investor investing $20,000 of USDT can earn $2,000 annually at a 10% APY, while its assets earn yield automatically over time. Unlike the majority of the other legacy altcoins, Mutuum Finance is a real DeFi protocol based on functional, open financial technology. Utilizing both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) paradigms, the platform accommodates adaptive lending, passive income generation, and efficient risk management, all carried out in a secure, automated, and publicly verifiable setting. This makes it a new crypto coin with strong fundamentals, as well as one of the top cryptocurrencies in 2025. Security Features Enhance Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) devs have established an official bug bounty program with CertiK. They dedicated $50,000 USDT to rewards, divided among four severity levels: critical, major, minor, and low. Every vulnerability level has a reward attached to make thorough testing affordable. This comes on the heels of a completed CertiK audit, reflecting on dedication to reliability. Concurrently, the V1 protocol is gearing up for Sepolia testnet launch in Q4 2025 with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will support borrowing and lending initially. Borrowers lend into peer-to-contract pools for yield or peer-to-peer markets for customized terms. As investors prepare for 2025’s bull season, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Ripple (XRP) are two of the altcoins attracting serious attention. XRP is signaling a 35% shift to $3.45 as institutional support ramps up, but Mutuum Finance is the star of the show with its dual-borrowing DeFi architecture and blazing presale. Positioned in Phase 6 at $0.035, more than 80% sold out and $18.15M funded, Mutuum Finance has growth prospects and passive returns via yield pools.

53759504,615317,1761699611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53759504.jpeg,"Old Bitcoin Supply Awakens – Long-Term Holders Move 4,657 BTC After Years of Inactivity",https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-supply-long-term-holders-move-4657/,"Bitcoin is attempting to push higher after weeks of consolidation and sustained selling pressure that followed the sharp October 10 crash. The market remains in a delicate recovery phase, with volatility compressing as traders await the next major catalyst. This week could prove decisive, as all eyes turn to Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting, where policymakers are expected to announce their next move on interest rates — a decision that could shape global risk sentiment for the remainder of the year. On-chain data adds another layer of intrigue to the current setup. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s dormant supply is waking up, with long-inactive coins — held between three and five years — showing significant movement in recent blocks. Such activity often signals renewed engagement from long-term holders, sometimes preceding key market inflection points. While the short-term outlook remains mixed, analysts note that the reactivation of old coins amid tightening macro conditions suggests growing investor anticipation. If the Fed signals a softer stance on monetary policy, Bitcoin could see renewed capital inflows. However, another hawkish surprise might extend the consolidation phase, keeping BTC locked below resistance until clearer macro conditions emerge. Long-Term Holders Make A Move Top analyst Maartunn shared data revealing that Bitcoin’s 3–5 year dormant supply has seen a sudden spike in activity, with 4,657.48 BTC spent in a single recent block. This metric tracks coins that have been untouched for several years — a cohort often associated with early bull-cycle investors or strategic long-term holders. When such coins move, it typically signals renewed activity from investors who have weathered multiple market phases. In the historical context, similar awakenings in long-term supply have preceded major shifts in market structure. For instance, during past consolidation periods, old coins were reactivated as investors prepared for volatility — either to take profits near local highs or to reposition ahead of a trend reversal. The magnitude of this recent movement suggests that seasoned holders are once again reassessing their allocations amid tightening macro conditions and elevated expectations for the Federal Reserve’s rate decision this week. What makes this particularly interesting is the contrast with current sentiment. Despite the spike in long-term holder activity, on-chain indicators such as the Bull-Bear Structure Index and Unified Sentiment Index remain in mildly bullish territory. This implies that while some early investors are realizing profits or reallocating, broader market conviction is improving — especially as Bitcoin holds above the $113,000–$114,000 range. This movement shouldn’t be interpreted as panic selling but as healthy on-chain rotation. Long-term holders moving coins after years of dormancy often signal the beginning of liquidity redistributions that accompany the next phase of market growth. If Bitcoin maintains its current support levels and macro conditions remain stable, these shifts could fuel the liquidity needed for a new impulse phase toward higher prices. BTC Bulls Regain Momentum Bitcoin is showing renewed strength on the 3-day timeframe, currently trading near $114,485, as it attempts to recover from the sharp sell-off seen earlier in October. The chart shows BTC holding firmly above both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages — a key structural signal suggesting that the medium-term trend remains intact despite recent volatility. The next major resistance level sits at $117,500, a zone that has repeatedly capped Bitcoin’s advances over the past two months. A successful breakout and daily close above this level could open the door for a retest of $125,000, marking the potential start of a new bullish impulse. However, rejection here could signal another short-term consolidation, as traders take profits and reassess risk amid macroeconomic uncertainty. On the downside, immediate support lies near $111,000–$112,000, while the 200-day moving average (red) around $96,000 continues to provide long-term structural backing. Momentum indicators and on-chain data, including a rebound in sentiment and stable liquidity conditions, suggest that buying interest is gradually returning. If the broader market remains calm following the upcoming Federal Reserve rate decision, Bitcoin could confirm its recovery and aim higher toward the $120,000–$125,000 range.

Right now, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , is holding steady at 27. But what does this number truly mean for your investments and how should you navigate the current market climate? Understanding the Crucial Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool provided by CoinMarketCap that helps investors gauge the prevailing market sentiment. It’s not just a random number; it represents a specific market condition. This index measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, carefully excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, have successfully outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Essentially, it tells us who is currently leading the race: Bitcoin or the broader altcoin market. A reading closer to 100 suggests a vibrant altcoin season, where many alternative cryptocurrencies are seeing significant gains against Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower value, like our current 27, indicates a “Bitcoin season.” This means Bitcoin is generally outperforming most altcoins. What Does an Altcoin Season Index of 27 Tell Us? A score of 27 for the Altcoin Season Index is a clear signal: we are currently in a Bitcoin-dominated market. This isn’t necessarily a negative situation, but it demands a different investment approach. When Bitcoin is leading, it often acts as the primary driver for the entire crypto ecosystem. Altcoins, while still active, might experience slower growth or even declines relative to Bitcoin’s performance. This period often sees investors consolidating their positions into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer haven or the primary vehicle for market appreciation. It’s a time when the “digital gold” narrative of Bitcoin often comes to the forefront, attracting capital from across the market. Navigating a Bitcoin-Dominated Market with the Altcoin Season Index For savvy investors, understanding the implications of a low Altcoin Season Index is paramount. It helps in formulating strategies that align with current market dynamics. Instead of chasing every altcoin pump, which might be less frequent or less sustained during a Bitcoin season, attention can shift to Bitcoin’s price action and its impact on the wider market. During such phases, some investors might choose to: Increase Bitcoin Holdings: Capitalizing on Bitcoin’s potential outperformance. Re-evaluate Altcoin Portfolios: Trimming underperforming altcoins or rebalancing towards stronger projects. Focus on Blue-Chip Altcoins: Projects like Ethereum ( ETH ) or Solana ( SOL ) might still show resilience, but often move in tandem with Bitcoin. Research and Accumulate: Use this period to research promising altcoins at potentially lower entry points, preparing for a future shift in the Altcoin Season Index . When Will the Altcoin Season Index Shift? The shift from a Bitcoin season to an altcoin season isn’t always predictable, but certain factors often play a role. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes an altcoin season. Once Bitcoin achieves significant gains and consolidates, investors often take profits and rotate that capital into altcoins, seeking higher returns. This rotation can drive the Altcoin Season Index upwards. Macroeconomic factors, technological advancements within specific altcoin projects, and increasing institutional interest in diverse crypto assets can also contribute to a shift. Monitoring the overall market sentiment and major news events is crucial for anticipating these changes. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio The steady reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 27 reinforces the importance of a well-thought-out investment strategy. Don’t let the number deter you; instead, let it inform your decisions. This period could be an excellent opportunity to refine your portfolio and prepare for future market shifts. Remember to always conduct your own research, understand the risks involved, and consider your personal financial goals. The crypto market is volatile, and while the Altcoin Season Index offers valuable insight, it’s one tool among many in a comprehensive investment approach. The current Altcoin Season Index at 27 clearly signals a Bitcoin-dominated period. This isn’t a static condition, but a phase that savvy investors can leverage. By understanding this crucial metric and adjusting your strategy accordingly, you can better navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market, positioning yourself for potential future growth, whether it’s led by Bitcoin or a resurgence of altcoins. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric, primarily tracked by CoinMarketCap , that indicates whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. A high number suggests an altcoin season, while a low number points to a Bitcoin season. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: It’s calculated by comparing the performance of individual altcoins in the top 100 (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over a 90-day rolling window. If 75% or more of these altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, the index moves towards 100. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 27 signify for my investments? A3: An index of 27 means we are currently in a “Bitcoin season.” This suggests that Bitcoin is generally outperforming most altcoins. Investors might consider increasing their Bitcoin exposure, re-evaluating altcoin holdings, or researching projects for future accumulation. Q4: When can we expect the Altcoin Season Index to shift towards an altcoin season? A4: Shifts are not precisely predictable. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often precedes an altcoin season as profits rotate into altcoins. Macroeconomic trends, significant altcoin project developments, and overall market sentiment also influence this shift. Q5: Should I sell all my altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is low? A5: Not necessarily. A low index indicates a general trend, but individual altcoins can still perform well. It’s an indicator to help you adjust your strategy, perhaps by reducing exposure to weaker altcoins, increasing Bitcoin holdings, or accumulating strong altcoins at lower prices. Always do your own research. Q6: Where can I track the Altcoin Season Index? A6: You can track the Altcoin Season Index directly on CoinMarketCap’s website , which provides real-time updates and historical data.

Solana Has Been Trading Inside A Parallel Channel Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the trajectory of Solana is looking from the perspective of a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset’s price trades between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the channel is considered a source of resistance, meaning that tops can be probable to appear on retests of it. Similarly, the lower level is assumed to provide support to the price, helping it to arrive at bottoms. A breakout of either of these bounds can signal a continuation of the trend in that direction. That is, a surge above the Parallel Channel can be a bullish signal, while a drop under it may lead to bearish action. There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, depending on how the channel is oriented with respect to the graph axes. Channels that have a positive slope are known as Ascending Channels, while those that slope downward are called Descending Channels. In the context of the current topic, the third and simplest type is the one of interest: a Parallel Channel that’s also parallel to the time-axis. This case corresponds to a phase of true sideways consolidation in the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Parallel Channel that the 4-hour price of Solana has been stuck inside for the last couple of weeks: As displayed in the above graph, Solana retested the lower level of the Parallel Channel last week and successfully found support. The cryptocurrency has since been rising and nearing the resistance level, located at $210. Considering the coin’s current trajectory, the analyst has noted that its price may be heading for a retest at $210 before making its next big move. However, the direction of such a move, if one happens, remains uncertain. Given that the $210 level corresponds to the resistance line of the Parallel Channel, it’s possible that a retest could reject Solana all the way back down to the support level around $176. It’s also possible, though, that this retest could instead lead to a breakout. In this case, SOL could naturally see a sustained bullish push. It now remains to be seen which of the two scenarios will play out for the asset if the Parallel Channel holds and a retest takes place. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $200, up over 7.5% in the last seven days.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has recently unveiled a crucial update to its financial guidelines for cryptocurrencies, known as Info Sheet 225. This move is a game-changer, signalling a broader regulatory approach that will impact numerous platforms and participants in the country’s burgeoning digital asset sector. Understanding these revised Australian crypto regulations is paramount for anyone operating or investing in this space. What Do These Expanded Australian Crypto Regulations Entail? ASIC’s updated guidelines mark a pivotal shift in how digital assets are viewed and regulated. Previously, the focus was primarily on “crypto assets.” Now, the document explicitly uses the term “digital assets,” encompassing a much wider range of digital representations of value or rights. This subtle yet significant change carries substantial implications. Most digital assets will likely fall under the purview of Australia’s financial services laws, meaning they will need to comply with the Australian Financial Services (AFS) license requirements. This broadens ASIC’s oversight considerably, ensuring a more regulated environment for various digital asset activities. Strengthened Oversight: Key Areas of Focus The revised Info Sheet 225 isn’t just theoretical; it provides practical guidance through 18 detailed examples of regulatory applications. These examples offer much-needed clarity for platforms navigating the evolving regulatory environment. Key areas highlighted include: Enhanced Custody Obligations: Platforms holding digital assets on behalf of clients will face stricter requirements to safeguard those assets, ensuring greater investor protection. Application to Overseas Platforms: Local laws will now extend to overseas platforms that offer digital asset services to Australian consumers, levelling the playing field and protecting local investors. Specific Guidance for ETP Issuers: Exchange-Traded Product (ETP) issuers dealing with digital assets receive tailored advice, clarifying their compliance responsibilities. These detailed examples provide a roadmap for compliance, helping businesses understand their obligations and foster a more secure and transparent digital asset ecosystem under the new Australian crypto regulations . DeFi and the Regulatory Horizon: What’s Next? While the updated guidelines bring significant clarity, some areas still remain under active discussion. Notably, the document does not explicitly state whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms must adhere to the same licensing requirements. This signals an ongoing evolution in regulatory thinking as ASIC grapples with the unique characteristics of decentralized protocols. ASIC has clarified that these guidelines do not introduce new laws. Instead, they serve as crucial interpretative guidance. Their purpose is to provide clarity for crypto platforms and stablecoin issuers, preparing them for a formal licensing regime that is expected to be introduced in the future. This proactive approach aims to bridge the gap between innovation and investor protection. Actionable Insights for Digital Asset Platforms For businesses operating in the Australian digital asset space, these updated Australian crypto regulations present both challenges and opportunities. Compliance is no longer an option but a necessity. Platforms should: Review Operations: Assess current services against the expanded definition of “digital assets” and AFS licensing requirements. Strengthen Custody Practices: Ensure robust security and operational frameworks are in place for client assets. Seek Expert Advice: Engage with legal and compliance professionals to navigate the complexities of the new guidelines. Embracing these changes proactively will not only ensure regulatory adherence but also build greater trust with consumers, fostering sustainable growth within the Australian digital asset market. Crucial Steps for a Secure Digital Future ASIC’s updated Info Sheet 225 represents a vital step towards a more mature and secure digital asset market in Australia. By broadening the scope to “digital assets” and providing clear examples, the regulator aims to enhance consumer protection and market integrity. While the path for DeFi remains somewhat open, the overall direction is clear: increased oversight and a push towards greater compliance. These Australian crypto regulations are designed to build a robust framework, ensuring that innovation can thrive responsibly within a well-defined regulatory landscape. This proactive guidance is a welcome development for investors and businesses alike, promising a more transparent and trustworthy environment for digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions About Australian Crypto Regulations Q1: What is Info Sheet 225 and why is it important? A1: Info Sheet 225 is a guidance document from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) that outlines its regulatory approach to digital assets. Its importance lies in providing clarity and expanding the scope of financial services laws to a broader range of “digital assets,” preparing the industry for a formal licensing regime. Q2: How do the new guidelines differ from previous ones? A2: The key difference is the shift from “crypto assets” to the broader term “digital assets.” This expansion means more digital representations of value will likely fall under Australian Financial Services (AFS) license requirements, significantly increasing ASIC’s regulatory oversight. Q3: Do these new Australian crypto regulations apply to overseas platforms? A3: Yes, the revised guidelines indicate that local laws will apply to overseas platforms that offer digital asset services to Australian consumers. This ensures consistent consumer protection regardless of where the platform is based. Q4: Are DeFi platforms explicitly covered by these guidelines? A4: The guidelines do not explicitly state whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms must adhere to licensing requirements. ASIC acknowledges the complexity of DeFi and continues to evaluate its regulatory approach in this evolving sector. Q5: What should digital asset platforms do in response to these updates? A5: Platforms should review their services against the expanded definition of “digital assets,” strengthen their custody practices, and seek expert legal and compliance advice to ensure adherence to the updated Australian crypto regulations .

Balchunas added that BSOL garnered over $223 million in assets before its launch, indicating increased institutional engagement and trust in exposure to staking, which pays individuals who lock up cryptocurrency on the blockchain to authenticate transactions. Wall Street’s appetite for cryptocurrency has expanded beyond market heavyweights Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), with asset managers considering the establishment of exchange-traded products related to riskier cryptocurrencies or featuring unique mechanisms, such as staking. BSOL’s $55.4 million trading volume exceeded Balchunas’ pre-launch projection of $52 million. Meanwhile, the Canary Capital HBAR ETF (HBR) concluded its first trading day with $8 million in volume, meeting the analyst’s prediction. The Canary Capital Litecoin ETF (LTCC) raised $1 million, which is less than Balchunas’ estimated $7 million. Bitwise’s Solana staking ETF (BSOL) opened to significant demand on Tuesday, with $10 million traded in the first 30 minutes, according to Balchunas. Compared to Canary’s HBAR ETF (HBR) and Litecoin ETF (LTCC), which posted $4 million and $400,000, respectively, within the same period. The early trading activity indicates various levels of investor interest in the new crypto-focused exchange-traded funds, with Bitwise’s Solana product experiencing the most initial demand of the three new offerings. Regulatory clarity on staking fuels U.S. launch after months of uncertainty The debut follows the recent approval of several crypto ETFs, despite limited operational capability owing to the government shutdown. BSOL’s debut trading volume, however, was a fraction of the $1.08 billion in trading volume noted by the nine spot Ether ETFs that launched last July, the first of the altcoin funds to launch in the U.S.. Grayscale’s converted Ethereum ETF Trust accounted for $458 million of that tally, while the BlackRock-issued iShares Ethereum Trust ETF raked in $248.7 million. Bitwise’s spot Ether ETF product also saw $94.3 million, considerably higher than its Solana product’s performance today. The debut follows months of regulatory hesitation over how staking income should be treated under U.S. securities law. On May 29, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance issued a staff statement clarifying that some proof-of-stake (PoS) activities do not constitute securities offerings. In August, the agency extended that guidance to certain liquid staking programs, effectively clearing the path for ETFs like BSOL to move forward. Bitwise had previously launched a similar Solana staking product in Europe last year but delayed its U.S. counterpart amid ongoing regulatory uncertainty. The company’s U.S. fund now debuts just weeks after the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK) began trading on June 30, recording approximately $12 million in first-day volume. As one of the leading U.S. issuers of crypto-linked ETFs, Bitwise already offers funds tied to Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The Solana fund marks its latest effort to expand investor access to staking yield within a fully regulated structure. Investors shift beyond Bitcoin and Ether as institutional demand for altcoin ETFs rises The product’s launch comes amid a surge in crypto ETF activity this year. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs shattered records in early 2024, attracting tens of billions of dollars in inflows. Spot Ether ETFs, while initially slower to gain momentum, have since drawn significant investor interest as market sentiment improved through the mid-year period. Analysts note that investors are increasingly diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ether, turning their attention to alternative networks such as Solana, Avalanche, and XRP. In January, JPMorgan projected that Solana and XRP ETFs could collectively attract between $3 billion and $8 billion in inflows within six months of their listings, mirroring the adoption patterns seen in earlier crypto fund launches.

Zhao’s lawyer claims the allegations are false, and the founder plans to sue the senator. Zhao’s lawyer, Teresa Goody Guillen, is writing a letter asking Warren to take down her post on X or face a lawsuit. CZ’s lawyer asks Warren to remove her false post and issue a retraction Senator Elizabeth Warren posted on X and stated that the court convicted Zhao of money laundering , but his lawyer, Teresa Goody Guillen, claims that’s not true. She says Warren’s post will spread false information that will hurt the founder’s name and reputation. According to Guillen, Zhao only pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act, not to money laundering. He already served his four months in jail and paid a $50 million fine as per his plea deal. Warren made her comments after President Donald Trump pardoned Zhao, but Goody Guillen said the founder will not remain silent while a senator tarnishes his name. She said she has written a formal letter demanding that the senator take down her post and correct her words on social media and in Congress. If she doesn’t, Zhao will sue her. Additionally, the lawyer stated that lawmakers like Warren cannot use their positions of power to make false statements and escape accountability. She explained that the Speech or Debate Clause in the U.S. Constitution only covers actions and comments made inside Congress, not public statements or social media posts. Finally, Zhao’s legal team claims that Warren sought to portray his pardon as an act of corruption and to attack both Zhao and Trump simultaneously. Goody Guillen said this case should remind politicians that truth matters and they should not use their power to spread misinformation. Warren stands by her comments and attacks Trump’s pardon decision In response to Goody Guillen’s warning, Senator Elizabeth Warren stood by her comments. She said she wasn’t trying to insult or attack CZ, but rather question why President Donald Trump pardoned him. She wanted to know whether personal or political interests backed that decision. According to the Senator, Congress should take action to stop what she described as “this kind of corruption” before lawmakers become part of the problem. Her post garnered millions of reactions, and some people praised her for speaking out against what they saw as another example of Trump misusing his presidential powers to benefit his allies. Others, however, accused her of spreading false information and unfairly damaging Zhao’s reputation. Warren’s post received a community note correction on X. The note made clear that Zhao’s offense was related to weak company compliance, rather than personal involvement in moving or hiding dirty money. This correction led many people to change their views about Warren’s statement on CZ, and they immediately began accusing her of spreading false information. The senator did not comment on the possible lawsuit but said that Zhao “pleaded guilty to violating the law” and that she was “calling him out for what he did.” She was not backing down and saw it as her duty to hold powerful figures accountable in such situations. A larger national debate ensued on social media following Trump’s pardon of Zhao. The president openly criticised digital currencies during his first term. But he has suddenly changed his stance completely and now promotes it publicly. What’s even worse is that his family is largely involved and has even launched a digital asset company called World Liberty Financial. People close to Zhao say that he has no personal or business relationship with Trump or his family, and that Binance has never partnered with World Liberty Financial in any official capacity. According to them, the two are only linked by individual investors who happen to use Trump’s stablecoin to buy or trade assets connected to Binance’s platform. Get seen where it counts.

Sources with knowledge of the situation mentioned that the tech company is testing new versions of each product, featuring OLED screens. They also pointed out that Apple adopted this technology because it provides richer colors and improved contrasts compared to the current LCDs. Notably, OLED stands for organic light-emitting diode. This comes after Apple asked a federal judge to dismiss a racketeering lawsuit filed by a company that accused the iPhone maker of stealing its technology to create the lucrative mobile wallet, Apple Pay. In a Monday night filing in Atlanta federal court, the tech firm noted that if the case is not thrown out, it should be transferred to a Texas judge who recently dismissed Fintiv’s related patent case. Apple examines new upgrades for its products Apple’s recent upgrade plans are expected to be implemented on three devices : the MacBook Air, iPad mini, and iPad Air. Sources close to the situation hinted that the iPad mini will be the first to receive this upgrade, with the launch of an OLED model scheduled for next year. This move is part of a broader shift toward OLED technology, providing customers with a new incentive to upgrade their devices. Following the tech giant’s plan, analysts have predicted that the sales of Mac and iPad products will increase this year. However, data released recently indicates that sales are still lower than those experienced in 2021 and 2022, when the pandemic led to an upswing in computer purchases. Some analysts have also raised concerns that this shift may lead to price increases. According to them, the update for Apple’s devices, such as the iPad mini, may increase its cost by up to $100 due to the more expensive display technology. Despite these concerns raised, Apple is still actively examining new updates for its products. To support this claim, sources indicate that the tech company has been exploring a new water-resistant design for the iPad mini. This feature bears some resemblance to those available on the latest iPhones. Apple has also experimented with a new speaker system that utilizes vibration technology. This change enables the firm to eliminate speaker holes that could allow water to enter. This characteristic distinguishes it from the water-resistant design of the latest iPhones, which have openings but use seals and glue to prevent damage. Meanwhile, the latest update on Apple’s iPad mini was implemented towards the end of 2024. It featured a faster processor and support for its Intelligence platform. Like other tech firms, analysts anticipated that the tech giant might change or postpone these upgrade plans, as they are not yet final. They also highlighted that this trend is commonly practiced during product development, citing Apple’s reported delay in developing the foldable iPad until 2029, as announced last week. Apple intends to switch its devices to feature OLED technology Sources familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous as the information on the upgrade had not yet been made public, mentioned that the next iPad Air, expected in the spring, will still utilize LCD screens. However, they highlighted that Apple is preparing to shift these devices to OLED in a future version. On the other hand, the iPad Pro, which was updated with the M5 chip last week, transitioned to OLED in May 2024. For now, the iPad Air is the last tablet in the lineup to undergo this shift. Currently, Apple has no plans to use OLED on its entry-level iPad. In the meantime, sources have revealed that the upcoming redesign of the MacBook Pro will be the first Mac to feature an OLED screen. Apple has also started early preparations for an OLED version of the MacBook Air, its best-selling laptop. However, this upgrade is unlikely to occur until 2028.

The Dogecoin price briefly traded above $0.21 earlier this week, but has since slipped by more than 2%, highlighting the mounting selling pressure in the market. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Analyst Predicts When DOGE Rallies Again According to on-chain data, whales have sold over 500 million DOGE tokens in the past week, fueling fears of further downside. The selloff coincides with a sharp 61% drop in futures open interest, plunging from $5.03 billion to $1.95 billion, signaling widespread position liquidations and trader fatigue. DOGE's price moving sideways on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Futures Liquidations and Weak Technicals Weigh on Momentum Derivatives data show declining participation across major exchanges, with traders closing out long positions rather than adding new exposure. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume surged 17.5% to nearly $2 billion, a sign that sellers remain in control even as overall market recovery stalls. Technical indicators paint a similarly cautious picture. On the daily chart, the Dogecoin price is forming a potential “death cross” between the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages, a bearish pattern that often precedes a further drop. If sustained selling continues, analysts warn the Dogecoin price could fall toward the $0.166 support, which aligns with the lower boundary of its long-term ascending trendline. However, this same trendline has historically triggered strong rebounds. Previous retests have led to price recoveries of nearly 100%, leaving some traders optimistic that a similar setup could emerge if support holds firm. Consolidation or Collapse? Key Dogecoin Price Levels to Watch Currently, Dogecoin price hovers near $0.20 with a market cap of $30.3 billion, holding above the critical psychological zone but struggling to regain upward momentum. The immediate resistance lies between $0.204 and $0.210, while a decisive close below $0.19 could accelerate losses toward $0.18–$0.166.

53761326,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87825,1761703234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Aster Rockets Upward and Cardano Shows Stability, but BlockDAG Steals the Spotlight with CertiK and Halborn Verified Audits",https://timestabloid.com/blockdag-steals-the-spotlight-with-certik-and-halborn-verified-audits/,"Recent updates on Aster (ASTR) price trends and Cardano (ADA) support levels reveal a market shaped by both resilience and opportunity. Cardano remains stable near its $0.60 mark, protecting key technical zones, while Aster’s sharp rise and billion-dollar valuation have attracted strong attention despite growing concerns over sustainability. These shifts highlight how stability and momentum each define success in crypto, but they also bring one crucial question to light: how secure are the platforms driving these gains? That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out. Is BlockDAG secure? Has it been verified by credible auditors? The answer is clear. BlockDAG has successfully completed independent audits by both CertiK and Halborn, marking a new benchmark for top rated crypto projects focused on transparency and trust. BlockDAG’s Verified Security and Transparency Raise the Bar Blockchain security questions often surface, but BlockDAG delivers tangible proof of trust and dependability. Its complete system architecture has been rigorously examined by not one but two industry-leading security firms, CertiK and Halborn. Receiving high marks from either of these independent audits would be an achievement in itself, but earning approval from both confirms BlockDAG’s exceptional technical standards. This dual certification positions it among the top rated cryptos globally for safety, transparency, and performance. These audits go beyond routine checks; they represent verified readiness for real-world scalability and resilience under market stress. Each review evaluated BlockDAG’s code integrity, smart contract security, and network reliability, ensuring long-term sustainability. The outcome has strengthened user confidence, reinforced community engagement, and attracted institutional attention. Alongside its audit triumph, BlockDAG’s $432M+ presale demonstrates powerful market validation, with 27.1 billion+ coins sold to 312K+ holders across 31 batches. As it approaches its $0.05 mainnet price, the project’s rare combination of certified security and structural transparency cements its status among the top rated cryptos ready for mainstream adoption and sustained growth in the next phase of blockchain evolution. Cardano (ADA) Price Range: Testing Strength Around $0.60 The Cardano (ADA) price levels remain among the most closely followed areas in the crypto market right now. Analysts point to the $0.60–$0.62 zone as an important support line that buyers are actively defending. Staying above this point is vital; a drop below could bring the next support near $0.55, with a deeper risk zone around $0.51. On the flip side, if ADA breaks through resistance between $0.74 and $0.80, experts believe it could set off a new upward move. These technical levels are providing traders with a clear setup, showing where buying and selling pressure are building. Some market watchers note that ADA’s longer trend remains positive as long as it stays firm above its current base. Early consolidation signals are visible on the charts, suggesting this area could turn into a potential launchpad if trading activity rises. The Cardano (ADA) price action reflects a mix of cautious optimism and technical testing, where the coin’s strength will determine if it continues consolidating or moves toward a breakout past $0.80. Aster (ASTR) Performance Review: Balancing Progress with Volatility The Aster (ASTR) performance review shows one of the most remarkable surges in recent weeks. After receiving strong backing from key supporters and completing the APX-to-ASTER token swap, Aster soared over 1,500% within a week, driving its market cap above $2.3 billion. This fast climb was powered by intense trading and fresh listings, but analysts are now monitoring whether Aster can maintain its pace. Resistance areas are expected near $2.40 and $2.75, with crucial support between $1.15 and $1.00. Staying within these ranges will play a big role in deciding if the coin stabilizes or corrects further. Even with its strong rise, the Aster (ASTR) market update points out some risks. Analysts are debating the strength of liquidity, whale movements, and whether trading volumes represent steady demand or speculative behavior. Certain indicators show buying interest, while others suggest that valuations may be stretched if momentum slows. The coming weeks will reveal whether Aster’s growth turns into sustained progress or fades as a brief rally. Regardless, it remains at the core of market discussions about how quickly hype and innovation can influence the crypto landscape. Bottom Line The Cardano (ADA) price holds steady near $0.60, signaling cautious optimism as traders guard key levels and await a possible move above $0.74. Meanwhile, the Aster (ASTR) review shows a dramatic rally that has stirred both enthusiasm and caution, testing the project’s ability to maintain long-term consistency. Together, these cases highlight two distinct growth paths in the market: one grounded in steady development, the other in rapid momentum and speculation. In contrast, BlockDAG takes a security-first approach. Backed by audits from CertiK and Halborn, it has become one of the top rated crypto projects for reliability and technical strength. Having raised over $432 million in presale and sold over 27 billion coins with its batch now at 31, BlockDAG stands out as both scalable and verified, assuring users that its foundation is built on proven security and enterprise-level standards.

53761346,615443,1761703241,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53761346.jpeg,Polygon CTO Vs. Zcash: Clash Erupts Over 21 Million Coin Integrity,https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-cto-vs-zcash-clash-21-million-coins/,"An exchange on X between Polygon’s CTO Mudit Gupta and Zcash founder Zooko Wilcox reignited a long-simmering debate over whether privacy-preserving shielded pools can be perfectly audited — and, by extension, whether ZEC’s 21 million cap can be trusted under all conceivable failure modes. The dispute hinged on a familiar fault line in privacy-coin design: zero-knowledge protocols can obfuscate individual balances and flows, but they still must preserve a hard monetary base. Polygon CTO Attacks Zcash Gupta opened with a stark framing: “Nobody knows how many Zcash tokens actually exist. Shielded assets like Zcash are hard to audit. In March 2019, an infinite mint bug was detected in Zcash shielded assets. It was fixed in October 2019 but there is no guaranteed way to tell if the bug was ever exploited.” Nobody knows how many zcash tokens actually exist. Shielded assets like zcash are hard to audit. In March 2019, an infinite mint bug was detected in zcash shielded assets. It was fixed in October 2019 but there is no guaranteed way to tell if the bug was ever exploited. — Mudit Gupta (@Mudit__Gupta) October 26, 2025 He later softened the immediate risk assessment — “Based on heuristic, it’s unlikely the bug was exploited so no reason to panic” — while stressing what he called an enduring category risk: “I’m just highlighting an attack vector with Zcash and similar privacy pools… I’m not claiming any bug was exploited, just mentioning the possibility and risk.” Wilcox pushed back, calling the initial post “not accurate,” and pointed Gupta to “publicly-verifiable on-chain audits” that track the monetary base. “They show the integrity of the Zcash monetary base. A straightforward game-theoretic analysis further shows zero counterfeiting,” he wrote, linking to community dashboards and documentation. In a follow-on, Wilcox encapsulated the ZEC position with a thought experiment about the legacy Sprout pool: “Suppose someone counterfeited ZEC in the Sprout pool before October 28, 2018. Then there is a ‘race to the exits’ between the counterfeiter and his victims. Whoever moves their ZEC out of the Sprout pool first gets to keep all the money. Conclusion: there was no counterfeiting.” He added that “even if there was counterfeiting… there would still be only 16,355,911 ZEC in existence, and still only 21 M ever. Thanks, turnstiles!” Stripped to its essentials, the technical disagreement is less about Zcash’s intended monetary policy and more about the edge-case guarantees when privacy meets auditability. Zcash’s published economics mirror Bitcoin ’s: a fixed 21 million upper bound and a halving-style issuance schedule. That cap is unambiguous in official materials. The Backstory The controversy traces back to the counterfeiting vulnerability affecting ZEC’s earliest shielded pool, Sprout. According to the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and the Zcash Foundation, the flaw was discovered privately in 2018 and publicly disclosed on February 5, 2019; critically, the Sapling upgrade that activated on October 28, 2018 removed the vulnerable construction, and Zcash introduced “turnstile” accounting to constrain exits from shielded pools to, at most, the amount verifiably entered. ECC reported at disclosure that it had seen “no evidence that counterfeiting has occurred,” a stance it has reiterated, and it described turnstile enforcement as a defense to preserve the monetary base even under hypothetical counterfeiting. This is the heart of Wilcox’s argument. Because ZEC can only enter or leave a shielded pool via transfers that reveal values at the boundary, the chain can compute an expected pool balance. If more value tries to exit than has ever entered, the discrepancy becomes observable at the turnstile. The “race to the exits” intuition — while informal — captures the idea that any attacker who minted bogus ZEC inside Sprout would be competing against legitimate holders to withdraw before the turnstile constraint bites; absent an unexplained drain to zero or a negative reconciliation, long-lived counterfeiting is inconsistent with observed pool totals. Zcash’s documentation describes these value-pool turnstiles and their role in monitoring pool integrity, and community discussions dating back years have treated them as the canonical mitigation. Gupta’s rejoinder is about epistemic certainty, not policy intent. “Perhaps I should have been clearer,” he wrote. “Due to [the] possibility of bugs, there’s no guarantee that the shielded pools have the same amount of Zcash circulating inside them as transparent Zcash that went in. Therefore, you can’t be 100% sure of the actual total supply… [though] the likelihood of a bug like this being exploited is essentially 0.” At press time, ZEC traded at $325.",Crypto News|polygon|ZCash|Zcash News|ZCash Price|ZEC|ZEC News|ZEC price,EN,0,0,BTC|MATIC|MINING|ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-29 02:00:41

A recent survey has unveiled a significant trend: a remarkable 39% of wealthy UAE crypto owners are already holding digital assets. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it signals a profound embrace of the future of finance by the region’s affluent. This insight comes from a survey conducted by Swiss software firm Avaloq , as reported by CoinDesk . The findings highlight not only the growing adoption but also a notable independence from traditional financial services. Among these existing crypto holders, only 20% currently rely on traditional asset managers, suggesting a preference for self-management or specialized crypto advisory services. Why Are Wealthy UAE Crypto Owners Embracing Digital Assets So Rapidly? The UAE is quickly solidifying its position as a global leader in the cryptocurrency space, and there are clear reasons why. The nation, particularly Dubai, has been proactive in developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework. This forward-thinking approach, spearheaded by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( VARA ), provides a secure and legitimate environment for digital asset investments. This regulatory clarity offers a crucial layer of trust and stability, which is highly appealing to affluent investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. The proactive stance of the United Arab Emirates has positioned it as an attractive hub for innovation and investment in the digital asset sector. For wealthy UAE crypto owners , this means a more predictable and secure investment landscape. The Generational Influence: Educating the Elite on Crypto Interestingly, the survey points to a unique dynamic driving this adoption: intergenerational education. It observes a growing trend where the younger members of wealthy families are actively educating their parents’ generation about the opportunities and mechanisms of cryptocurrency investments. This familial transfer of knowledge is accelerating the acceptance and understanding of digital assets among the older, more established investor base. This trend suggests a natural evolution in wealth management, where traditional financial strategies are being complemented by new digital frontiers. For many wealthy UAE crypto owners , the exposure to cryptocurrencies often comes from trusted family members who are already familiar with the technology. This organic adoption pathway builds confidence and encourages exploration into a sector that might otherwise seem complex or intimidating. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Considerations for Wealthy UAE Crypto Owners The journey into digital assets, while promising, also comes with its own set of considerations. While the opportunities for diversification, high growth potential, and access to global markets are compelling, investors must also be mindful of market volatility, security risks, and the continuously evolving regulatory landscape. However, the UAE’s commitment to creating a robust framework helps mitigate some of these concerns. For wealthy UAE crypto owners , the benefits often outweigh the perceived risks, especially with careful planning and informed decisions. Key advantages include: Portfolio Diversification: Adding digital assets can reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Access to Innovation: Investing in groundbreaking technologies and emerging sectors. Potential for High Returns: Cryptocurrencies have historically shown significant growth potential. Global Accessibility: Seamless transactions and investments across borders. The survey, conducted between February and March, gathered insights from 3,851 investors and 456 wealth management professionals, providing a comprehensive snapshot of the sentiment towards digital assets in the region. A Compelling Digital Future for the UAE’s Affluent The findings from the Avaloq survey paint a clear picture: the UAE is not just participating in the global crypto revolution; it’s leading it, particularly among its wealthy populace. The significant percentage of wealthy UAE crypto owners , coupled with a progressive regulatory environment and a unique intergenerational knowledge transfer, positions the Emirates as a true pioneer in the digital asset space. As Dubai continues to innovate and attract global talent, the integration of digital assets into mainstream wealth management is set to become even more pronounced. This trend highlights a forward-thinking approach that prioritizes innovation, security, and financial freedom, promising an exciting and prosperous future for digital asset adoption in the region.

These early adopters, who have held their digital assets for years, sometimes make significant movements that capture the market’s attention. Recently, one such individual executed a transaction that has many investors asking questions about potential market shifts. What’s Behind the Latest Bitcoin OG Deposit to Kraken? A specific address, known for its deep history in the Bitcoin ecosystem, recently deposited an additional 200 BTC, valued at approximately $22.52 million, onto the Kraken exchange. This isn’t an isolated incident; according to Onchain Lens, this particular Bitcoin OG address (beginning with 1E2JG2) has moved a staggering total of 5,803 BTC, worth around $649.6 million, to exchanges over just the past two weeks. Such large transfers from long-dormant wallets to trading platforms are rarely overlooked. They typically suggest an intention to sell. Consequently, this activity from a significant Bitcoin OG often triggers discussions about potential market impacts and investor sentiment. Why Does a Bitcoin OG ‘s Move Spark Market Speculation? When a substantial amount of Bitcoin moves from cold storage to an exchange, it increases the supply available for trading. This dynamic can potentially influence market prices, especially if the selling pressure is significant. Long-term holders, or “whales,” possess enough capital to affect liquidity and price stability with their actions. Consider these key points: Intent to Sell: Deposits to exchanges are almost universally interpreted as preparation for selling. Market Impact: Large sell orders can absorb significant buying demand, potentially leading to price drops. Sentiment Shift: Such moves can also signal a shift in confidence among experienced holders, influencing other investors. The actions of a prominent Bitcoin OG can therefore create ripple effects across the entire crypto landscape, affecting both Bitcoin’s price and broader altcoin markets. Is This a Warning Sign, or Just a Natural Market Cycle for a Bitcoin OG ? Interpreting these large deposits requires a nuanced perspective. While an immediate reaction might be concern, it’s essential to consider various possibilities. This could simply be a strategic profit-taking move after substantial gains over many years. After all, early investors are entitled to realize their profits. However, it could also indicate a lack of conviction in short-to-medium term price appreciation, or even a desire to reallocate capital into other assets. Market observers often scrutinize the timing of such large transactions, looking for patterns or correlations with broader economic indicators or upcoming crypto events. What Should Investors Monitor Following This Bitcoin OG Activity? For those closely watching the market, several factors warrant attention after such a significant move: Exchange Inflows/Outflows: Continue monitoring overall exchange balances to see if selling pressure persists or if the market absorbs these large sales. Price Action: Observe how Bitcoin ‘s price reacts in the immediate aftermath and over the coming days. Look for support and resistance levels. Market Sentiment: Gauge the broader investor mood through social media, news, and sentiment indicators. Understanding the implications of a Bitcoin OG ‘s decisions is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. It serves as a reminder that even the most seasoned holders eventually take profits, influencing market dynamics along the way. Conclusion: The Enduring Influence of the Bitcoin OG The recent substantial deposit of 200 BTC to Kraken by a long-term holder highlights the enduring influence of early adopters on the cryptocurrency market. While such moves often generate apprehension, they are also a natural part of the market cycle as early investors realize their gains. Monitoring these whale activities provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements, underscoring the importance of on-chain analysis in understanding Bitcoin’s trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions About Bitcoin OG Activity Understanding the actions of large Bitcoin holders is key to grasping market movements. Here are some common questions: What is a Bitcoin OG? A Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) refers to an early adopter or investor who acquired a significant amount of Bitcoin in its nascent stages and has held onto it for a very long time, often years. These individuals or entities typically possess large quantities of BTC. Why are deposits to exchanges often seen as bearish? Depositing a large amount of Bitcoin to an exchange like Kraken is usually interpreted as an intent to sell. When a substantial supply becomes available on exchanges, it can increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop if buying demand does not absorb it. How does a single whale’s actions affect the Bitcoin price? While the market is vast, a single “whale” (an entity holding significant crypto) moving hundreds or thousands of Bitcoin can indeed impact price. Their large sell orders can absorb considerable liquidity, causing temporary price volatility or even initiating a downward trend if other investors follow suit due to perceived negative sentiment. What is On-chain analysis? On-chain analysis refers to the process of examining publicly available data on a blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and exchange flows, to gain insights into market sentiment and potential future price movements. Reports from entities like Onchain Lens provide crucial data points for this type of analysis. Learn more about on-chain analysis . Is this the first time this specific Bitcoin OG has moved funds? No, the report indicates that this address (1E2JG2) has deposited a total of 5,803 BTC ($649.6 million) to exchanges over the past two weeks, suggesting a pattern of liquidation rather than a single, isolated event.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-open-interest-just-reset-again-heres-the-significance/,"XRP’s open interest on Binance has fallen sharply, reaching the same level it last saw in May 2025. At that time, the market reset in leverage preceded one of XRP’s strongest rallies of the year, when the asset climbed to over $3.5. While the recent chart shared by crypto commentator CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) highlights this renewed decline in open interest, XRP’s price remains relatively elevated at around $2.6 following a notable recovery where it outperformed the top 10 cryptocurrencies . In the post, CryptosRus noted that the current market environment shows “leverage is gone, yet strong hands are still holding,” suggesting that the absence of leveraged positions could make way for more stable accumulation by investors . XRP OPEN INTEREST JUST RESET, AGAIN #XRP ’s open interest on Binance has dropped back to the same lows we saw in May 2025. Back then, that flush kicked off a massive move from $0.70 to $3.50. This time, OI is at the floor again but price is still holding around $2.6+. That means… pic.twitter.com/iaWooa5JRV — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) October 26, 2025 Low Leverage Signals Market Reset The CryptoQuant chart indicates that open interest has returned to its floor near $550 million, matching the trough from earlier in the year. However, unlike the May decline, XRP’s price has remained much higher this time, holding above $2.50. This divergence between price and leverage suggests that speculative positions have been flushed out, but spot demand has sustained market strength . Historically, a drop in open interest reflects reduced leverage and a clearing of overextended positions. When accompanied by stable or rising prices, it often points to accumulation by long-term holders rather than short-term traders. That combination can create a foundation for renewed upward momentum once liquidity returns to the market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Constructive Setup for XRP According to the analysis shared, the current structure may favor XRP if new capital flows into the market. CryptosRus explained that “if new liquidity comes in, this setup could easily flip into the next leg up,” pointing to the conditions that typically precede bullish moves, including low leverage, strong spot demand, and short sellers caught in unfavorable positions. The pattern aligns with the behavior observed earlier in the year, when a similar reset in open interest set the stage for an extended advance. At that time, once traders re-entered the market and open interest began to climb again, XRP’s price responded with significant strength. While no outcome is guaranteed, the data suggest that XRP’s current position may be constructive. Open interest levels near historical lows combined with a resilient spot price create conditions that could support a continuation of the longer-term uptrend if buying pressure intensifies.

With momentum building, traders now wonder, will one final dip come before the next major breakout? XRP Faces A Crucial Decision Zone Amid Ongoing Range CasiTrades, in a recent market update, highlighted that XRP continues to range within a critical zone, keeping its setup for a potential final wave down valid. The analyst noted that the price remains at a key decision point, with ongoing tests of the Wave 4 highs acting as a firm ceiling against further upside movement. Related Reading: Boom Incoming? XRP’s Market Setup Looks ‘Explosive,’ Analyst Says According to CasiTrades, the pivotal level to watch is $2.82 on Binance. A confirmed breakout and sustained hold above this resistance would invalidate the bearish setup and signal renewed bullish momentum. However, XRP has so far failed to push through, maintaining a range-bound structure between support and resistance, a sign that the market has yet to commit to a clear directional trend. The analyst emphasized that a V-shaped recovery typically breaks through resistance with strong conviction, but such a move has not been seen here. Instead, XRP’s hesitancy indicates that selling pressure may still be present, preventing a clean continuation to the upside. Exchange Variations Add Complexity To Market Analysis CasiTrades went on to explain that most major exchanges are now aligning around their key Fibonacci retracement levels, particularly the 0.618 zone. On Binance, this range sits between $1.35 and $1.46, which the analyst identified as the area where the next corrective wave could complete. According to the expert, this move would finalize the macro Wave 2 correction, paving the way for a powerful Wave 3 impulse that might propel XRP toward $6.50 or even $10. Related Reading: XRP Sparks Bullish Frenzy As Top Software Dev Says It Beats ETF Hype The analyst emphasized that these lower price levels shouldn’t be viewed as a cause for concern but rather as valuable accumulation opportunities for long-term investors. Historically, zones like these have marked points of strong institutional buying and major trend reversals, presenting some of the best risk-to-reward setups before a large bullish expansion. CasiTrades also noted that exchange discrepancies add a layer of complexity to the analysis. For instance, during a recent liquidation event, Binance briefly fell to $0.77, while Coinbase never reached its .618 retracement. This variation means traders should always chart on the specific exchange they plan to execute trades on, as price reactions can differ slightly between platforms. In conclusion, the analyst noted that until XRP breaks and holds above $2.82, the market structure still supports the idea of one final downward wave before a major upward cycle begins.

Industry insiders confirm that fund issuers have filed the requisite documents and received listing notices, paving the way for a landmark expansion of crypto products into the traditional finance sphere. Altcoin ETF wave surges ahead The stalwart asset managers behind this push, Bitwise Asset Management, Canary Capital, and Grayscale Investments, have signalled that their funds will launch this week. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, exchange listing notices have been posted for Bitwise’s Solana ETF and Canary’s Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, with launches slated for Tuesday. Grayscale’s Solana fund conversion is expected on Wednesday. What’s key is how this is happening despite the U.S. government shutdown. Issuers are relying on regulatory mechanisms, notably Form 8-A filings and amended S-1 registration statements allowing automatic effectiveness after 20 days, to go live without requiring the SEC’s manual sign-off. This regulatory workaround, combined with the generic listing standards approved in September, has created a rare window for altcoin ETFs to break into the market. What the new ETFs mean for crypto markets For Solana , this ETF launch could prove transformative. As the sixth-largest blockchain by market cap, Solana already draws institutional interest for its high-speed ecosystem. The proposed product from Bitwise (ticker: BSOL) reportedly includes staking features, offering long-term holders a compelling “own crypto via a regulated fund” route. Meanwhile, Litecoin and Hedera , though smaller in market cap, gain legitimacy through this ETF channel. Canary Capital’s CEO confirmed the spot LTC and HBAR funds will trade on the Nasdaq starting Tuesday under the tickers “LTCC” and “HBR”. Institutional access is widening. Investors who previously needed to hold crypto wallets and navigate exchange custody can now access regulated funds via brokerage accounts. The market views this as a major step in bridging DeFi/crypto assets with mainstream finance. Bottom Line That said, timing matters. The surrounding conditions, regulatory innovation, shutdown-driven inertia at the SEC, and investor appetite for fresh crypto exposure, have aligned uniquely. Market watchers caution that while the launches are historic, they are not without risk, token prices, liquidity flows, and investor behaviour around product debut remain uncertain. In sum, the crypto industry stands at a tipping point. With Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera gaining regulated ETF wrappers, the era of altcoin funds may be officially underway, despite Washington being partially shut down. The countdown is on.

This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s the bold prediction for MicroStrategy , thanks to its pioneering MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy. Joe Burnett, a Bitcoin strategist at Semler Scientific , recently sparked a conversation on X, suggesting that if Bitcoin’s true value as collateral is recognized, MicroStrategy’s financial standing could transform dramatically. This perspective challenges conventional wisdom, highlighting a pivotal shift in how corporate assets are perceived. Unlocking the Power of MicroStrategy Bitcoin as Premier Collateral Burnett’s compelling argument centers on Bitcoin’s unique attributes as collateral, asserting its superiority in the modern financial system. He explains that the full integration of BTC into traditional credit mechanisms is still in its nascent stages. However, MicroStrategy has already amassed a colossal asset base: approximately $72 billion worth of BTC. This isn’t merely a speculative holding; it’s a globally traded, highly liquid resource that boasts several critical advantages: Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be accessed and transferred across borders without intermediaries. Rapid Settlement: Transactions can be settled in minutes, a significant improvement over traditional banking systems. No Counterparty Risk: As a decentralized asset, Bitcoin eliminates the risks associated with third-party intermediaries. These characteristics collectively position MicroStrategy Bitcoin as an unparalleled form of collateral, offering a level of security and efficiency rarely seen with conventional assets. Furthermore, MicroStrategy’s financial structure includes $8 billion in long-term convertible bonds and $7 billion in preferred stock, all underpinned by this substantial Bitcoin treasury. Why Are Traditional Credit Agencies Overlooking MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Advantage? Despite its immense digital asset holdings, MicroStrategy currently holds a B- speculative-grade rating from S&P Global Ratings . Intriguingly, this is the same rating assigned to an airline like JetBlue , a company that typically generates minimal free cash flow. Burnett critically observes that traditional credit rating agencies have not yet adapted their methodologies to fully account for this fundamental shift in corporate treasury management. They are, in essence, evaluating MicroStrategy through an outdated lens, failing to acknowledge the immense value, liquidity, and stability provided by its MicroStrategy Bitcoin treasury. This discrepancy highlights a significant lag in how established financial institutions perceive and integrate innovative asset classes. A re-evaluation is not just likely, but inevitable, once Bitcoin’s role as superior collateral is fully understood and accepted across the financial industry. The Broader Impact: Bitcoin’s Role in Modern Corporate Finance The scenario unfolding with MicroStrategy offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolving landscape of corporate finance. As more institutions and treasuries recognize Bitcoin’s robust qualities – its decentralization, immutability, scarcity, and transparent ledger – its role as a strategic treasury asset is poised for significant expansion. Companies that proactively incorporate substantial Bitcoin reserves into their balance sheets could see a fundamental re-assessment of their risk profiles, potentially leading to more favorable borrowing terms, enhanced liquidity, and overall greater financial stability. This evolving understanding of digital assets is not merely a niche trend; it’s a crucial development for the entire financial sector, paving the way for a more integrated, resilient, and efficient global credit system. The innovative MicroStrategy Bitcoin approach serves as a powerful testament to this ongoing paradigm shift, prompting crucial discussions about the future of corporate treasury. What Does MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy Mean for Investors and Businesses? For investors, businesses, and financial analysts alike, MicroStrategy’s bold move provides a compelling and insightful case study. It demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to treasury management, strategically leveraging a non-sovereign, censorship-resistant asset to bolster corporate strength. Here are some key takeaways: For Businesses: It encourages exploring the long-term benefits of diversifying treasury reserves with digital assets, considering their potential for inflation hedging and global liquidity. For Investors: It prompts a critical examination of how traditional financial metrics and credit ratings are adapting (or, in some cases, failing to adapt) to the rapid advancements in the digital asset space. For the Market: This narrative powerfully underscores the ongoing maturation of Bitcoin as a legitimate and significant financial instrument, moving beyond its early days as a speculative asset to a foundational element of corporate and institutional finance. MicroStrategy’s journey, led by its visionary CEO Michael Saylor , clearly illustrates the need for continuous education, flexibility, and adaptation within financial analysis and corporate strategy. Embracing these new paradigms is essential for navigating the complexities of the 21st-century economy. A Vision of Future Financial Safety with MicroStrategy Bitcoin Joe Burnett’s insightful analysis paints a vivid picture of a future where MicroStrategy, through its strategic MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings, could genuinely redefine corporate safety and financial resilience. While traditional credit systems are undeniably catching up, the inherent strengths of Bitcoin—global liquidity, rapid settlement, and zero counterparty risk—position MicroStrategy uniquely as a pioneer. This isn’t merely about one company’s balance sheet; it’s about the broader financial world acknowledging and integrating the transformative power of digital assets. This integration promises a more secure, efficient, and forward-looking financial landscape for all participants, with MicroStrategy leading the charge in demonstrating Bitcoin’s profound value. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is MicroStrategy’s core business? MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is primarily a business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services company. However, it has gained significant prominence for its corporate strategy of acquiring and holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Q2: Why does MicroStrategy hold so much Bitcoin? MicroStrategy began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020 as a hedge against inflation and as a strategic asset it believes will appreciate over time. Led by CEO Michael Saylor , the company views Bitcoin as a superior form of money and a robust long-term store of value, making it a central component of their corporate treasury strategy. Q3: Who is Joe Burnett and Semler Scientific? Joe Burnett is a Bitcoin strategist at Semler Scientific , a medical device company that has also adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, following MicroStrategy’s lead. Burnett is known for his insights into Bitcoin’s financial properties and its potential impact on corporate finance. Q4: How does Bitcoin act as “collateral” in this context? Bitcoin acts as collateral due to its inherent properties: it’s globally liquid, can be settled quickly, and carries no counterparty risk because it’s a decentralized asset. This makes it a highly desirable asset that can be pledged against loans or used to secure other financial instruments, potentially improving a company’s creditworthiness as its value becomes more widely recognized by traditional finance. Q5: Will MicroStrategy’s credit rating change soon? According to Joe Burnett , a re-evaluation of MicroStrategy’s credit rating is anticipated once traditional credit agencies, such as S&P Global Ratings , fully acknowledge and integrate Bitcoin’s value as superior collateral into their assessment models. While the exact timing is uncertain, the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin suggests that such a shift is likely in the future.

SoFi to Launch Bitcoin and Crypto Trading After Record $950M Q3 Revenue SoFi Technologies announced plans to begin Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading by the end of 2025, following record-breaking Q3 results. The fintech giant reported a 38% year-over-year revenue surge to $950 million and earnings of $0.11 per share, surpassing analyst expectations.

The company, once focused on student loans, now operates as a full financial ecosystem and plans to expand blockchain-based international transfers for faster, cheaper payments. SoFi’s move into crypto marks another step toward mainstream financial adoption, reinforcing market optimism and helping lift Bitcoin prices slightly today. Central Banks Turn to Tokenization as Gold Slips Below $4K BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said central banks are increasingly exploring tokenization and digital assets as gold prices dip below $4,000. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia, Fink noted that central banks face growing pressure to digitize their currencies and adapt to a tokenized global economy. BlackRock CEO: “Crypto and gold aren’t for profit, they’re protection.” He says investors hold these assets not out of greed but out of fear to guard against currency dilution and global instability. #BlackRock #Crypto #Gold #Finance #Markets pic.twitter.com/FBo3Yi1CJu — Cyrus (@Cyrus_In_The_X) October 28, 2025 He described gold and cryptocurrencies as “assets of fear,” used by investors to hedge against traditional market risks. Despite continued record gold purchases by central banks, the metal’s recent decline has raised concerns about overreliance on the dollar. Following Fink’s remarks, Bitcoin briefly surged past $115,500 as traders interpreted his endorsement of tokenization and recognition of crypto’s expanding role as bullish for Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Pulls Back to $112K but Bulls Still Target $124K Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading near $112,400 after retreating from the $117,600 double-top resistance, where buyers failed to sustain momentum. The daily chart shows BTC forming lower highs within a short-term descending channel, signaling a cooling phase after last week’s rally. The 20-day EMA has flattened near $114,900, acting as dynamic resistance, while the 50-day EMA at $112,300 is being tested as near-term support. Candlestick formations reveal indecision, spinning tops and small-bodied candles, suggesting a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The RSI hovers around 49, reflecting neutral momentum but warning of potential downside if it slips below 45. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview A break beneath $112,200 could expose the $108,600 zone, where prior demand supported a rebound earlier this month. Conversely, reclaiming $114,900 would shift bias back toward the $117,600 neckline, opening the path toward $120,500 and the $124,100 Fibonacci extension target. For traders, a clean breakout above $117,600 signals renewed bullish momentum, while holding above $108,600 keeps the broader uptrend intact. With sentiment stabilizing and macro optimism building, Bitcoin’s path toward $130,000 remains a plausible medium-term scenario as global liquidity and institutional demand expand. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong.

The exchange will proceed with the Binance delisting of three prominent altcoins: Flamie (FLM), Kadena (KDA), and Perpetual Protocol (PERP). This decision is set to take effect at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 12. For many traders and investors, such news can be unsettling, raising immediate questions about portfolio adjustments and market stability. Understanding the implications of this Binance delisting is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. What Does a Binance Delisting Mean for Your Investments? A delisting event, especially from a major platform like Binance, carries substantial weight. Essentially, it means that the affected cryptocurrencies will no longer be available for trading on the exchange. This move can trigger a range of reactions across the market, impacting liquidity, price, and overall investor sentiment for the delisted assets. When an exchange announces a delisting, it typically provides a timeline for users to take action. For FLM, KDA, and PERP holders on Binance, this period is critical. Here’s what usually happens: Cessation of Trading: All trading pairs involving FLM, KDA, and PERP will be removed. This includes spot, margin, and futures trading, depending on what was offered. Withdrawal Period: Users are generally given a window to withdraw their delisted tokens to other wallets or exchanges that still support them. It’s vital to act within this timeframe. Price Volatility: Often, delisting announcements lead to increased selling pressure, causing the price of the affected assets to drop sharply due to reduced demand and market access. This Binance delisting highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the importance of staying informed about exchange policies. Why Does Binance Delist Cryptocurrencies? Exchanges like Binance do not take delisting decisions lightly. These actions are usually the result of a comprehensive review process. Binance, like many other reputable exchanges, regularly assesses listed assets to ensure they meet specific standards. These standards often include: Project Quality and Commitment: Is the development team active? Is the project roadmap being followed? Network Stability and Security: Are there any vulnerabilities or consistent network issues? Trading Volume and Liquidity: Does the asset maintain sufficient trading volume to ensure fair price discovery and prevent market manipulation? Regulatory Compliance: Does the asset comply with evolving regulatory frameworks in various jurisdictions? User Feedback: Input from the community can also play a role in these decisions. While Binance has not provided specific reasons for the FLM, KDA, and PERP delisting in this particular announcement, such factors are typically at play. The goal is to protect users and maintain a healthy, vibrant trading environment on the platform. Therefore, this decision reflects Binance’s commitment to upholding its listing criteria. Navigating the Binance Delisting: Your Action Plan For individuals holding FLM, KDA, or PERP on Binance, proactive steps are essential. Ignoring the announcement could lead to difficulties in accessing or liquidating your assets after the deadline. Here’s an actionable guide: Assess Your Holdings: Identify the exact amount of FLM, KDA, and PERP you hold on Binance. Research Alternatives: Look for other reputable exchanges or decentralized platforms that still list these tokens. Verify their security and withdrawal fees. Plan Your Transfer: Decide whether to sell your tokens before the deadline or withdraw them to another platform. Consider the current market price and potential transaction costs. Execute Withdrawals: If you choose to withdraw, do so well before the November 12 deadline. Ensure you have the correct wallet addresses for the receiving platform or personal wallet. Double-check all details to avoid irreversible losses. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring official Binance announcements and the news surrounding FLM, KDA, and PERP for any further updates. Remember, timely action can mitigate potential losses and help you manage your portfolio effectively in light of this significant Binance delisting . Conclusion: Adapting to Market Changes The upcoming Binance delisting of FLM, KDA, and PERP serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be challenging for investors, they also underscore the importance of due diligence, diversification, and staying updated with exchange policies. By understanding the reasons behind delistings and taking swift, informed action, traders can better navigate these changes and protect their investments. Always prioritize security and verify information from official sources. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Binance Delisting Q1: What exactly is a crypto delisting?

Over the past 24 hours, a staggering event unfolded, highlighting the inherent volatility and risk. We witnessed massive crypto liquidations topping an incredible $330 million across various digital assets, predominantly impacting long positions. This significant market movement has left many investors pondering the underlying mechanisms and potential future implications. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? At its core, a crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when the market moves against a trader’s bet, and their margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. Essentially, the trader’s collateral is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Most liquidations happen in perpetual futures markets, where traders use leverage to amplify their potential gains. While leverage can boost profits, it also magnifies losses, making traders vulnerable to sudden price swings. When the price hits a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses to the exchange itself. The Astonishing $330 Million Crypto Liquidations Breakdown The recent market turbulence led to a dramatic wave of forced closures. In just 24 hours, the total value of crypto liquidations surged past $330 million. Let’s break down where these significant losses occurred: Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $114 million in liquidations. A substantial 64.89% of these were long positions, indicating a bullish bias among traders that was swiftly punished. Ethereum (ETH): Experienced even higher figures, with $158 million in liquidations. An overwhelming 71.73% of these were long positions, showcasing intense optimism that quickly unwound. Solana (SOL): Faced $58.76 million in liquidations. Here too, long positions dominated, accounting for 69.18% of the total, reflecting a similar trend of over-leveraged bullish bets. These figures underscore the rapid and often unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in volatile markets. The dominance of long positions being liquidated paints a clear picture of market sentiment preceding the downturn. Why Did Long Positions Bear the Brunt of These Crypto Liquidations? The fact that long positions accounted for such a large percentage of the recent crypto liquidations isn’t a coincidence. Long positions are essentially bets that the price of an asset will increase. Traders open long positions when they are bullish on the market’s direction, often using leverage to maximize their potential returns from even small price movements. However, if the market suddenly reverses and prices drop, these leveraged long positions quickly become unprofitable. As the price falls, the value of their collateral decreases, eventually triggering a margin call or an automatic liquidation. This cascading effect can exacerbate market downturns, as forced selling adds further downward pressure on prices. What’s the Wider Impact of Such Significant Crypto Liquidations? Beyond the individual traders who faced losses, a wave of crypto liquidations of this magnitude has broader implications for the entire market. Firstly, it can signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to increased fear and uncertainty among investors. Large liquidation events often precede or accompany significant price corrections. Moreover, these events can highlight periods of excessive speculation and over-leveraging within the market. While a healthy amount of trading activity is vital, widespread leveraged positions can create systemic risks. The forced closure of positions can create a domino effect, leading to further price declines and more liquidations across the board. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Your Guide to Avoiding Crypto Liquidations For both new and experienced traders, understanding and mitigating the risks associated with crypto liquidations is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Practice Prudent Risk Management: Avoid over-leveraging. Using high leverage ratios can quickly deplete your capital in volatile markets. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you to a predetermined level. This limits potential losses and prevents liquidation. Understand Market Conditions: Pay close attention to market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. High volatility periods require extra caution. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into a single leveraged trade. Diversification can help spread risk. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news and technical analysis to make informed trading decisions. By adopting these strategies, traders can better protect their capital and navigate the often-unpredictable world of cryptocurrency trading. A Call for Caution in a Dynamic Market The recent episode of crypto liquidations , totaling over $330 million, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in the highly dynamic cryptocurrency market. The dominance of long positions among those liquidated underscores the dangers of excessive leverage and bullish speculation in the face of unexpected market shifts. While the crypto market offers exciting opportunities, it demands respect for its volatility and a disciplined approach to risk. Understanding the mechanics of liquidations and implementing robust risk management strategies are not just good practices; they are essential for long-term survival and success in this thrilling digital frontier. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations What causes crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations are primarily caused by leveraged positions moving against the trader’s bet. When the market price of an asset falls below a certain threshold (the liquidation price) for a long position, or rises above it for a short position, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. What are long positions in cryptocurrency trading? A long position in cryptocurrency trading is a bet that the price of a particular digital asset, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum , will increase over time. Traders ‘go long’ when they are bullish on an asset, hoping to buy low and sell high. When these positions are leveraged, small price drops can lead to significant losses and potential liquidation. How can traders protect themselves from crypto liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by employing several risk management strategies. These include avoiding excessive leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, diversifying their portfolio, and staying informed about market conditions and potential volatility. Understanding your liquidation price is also key. Which cryptocurrencies were most affected by the recent liquidation event? The recent event saw Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Solana (SOL) as the most affected cryptocurrencies, experiencing the largest volumes of crypto liquidations . Long positions dominated the forced closures across all three, indicating a significant bearish turn that caught many bullish traders off guard.

Announced during the company’s third-quarter earnings call, the initiative will include the creation of a US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) and a new infrastructure called the Digital Asset Network. Both will be developed in collaboration with Anchorage Digital Bank. Stablecoin Launch Expected in 2026 According to the company, USDPT will go live in the first half of 2026. Customers will be able to access the stablecoin through partner exchanges, similar to how PayPal’s PYUSD is listed on Binance and other platforms. Western Union said the Digital Asset Network will also operate as a global off-ramp for its 150 million customers across 200 countries and territories. Speaking at the Money 20/20 USA conference in Las Vegas, CEO Devin McGranahan explained why Solana was chosen for the project. He said his team had evaluated numerous alternatives before concluding that Solana was the “right choice” to build an institutional-grade platform. Traditional Finance Moves Deeper into Crypto Western Union joins a growing number of traditional payment firms exploring blockchain for remittances. Supporters argue that blockchain technology allows faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border transactions compared to conventional payment systems. In recent months, other financial giants have made similar announcements. Zelle’s parent company revealed plans to introduce stablecoins for international payments, while MoneyGram rolled out a USDC wallet for customers in Colombia through its crypto app. Regulatory Clarity Accelerates Adoption The stablecoin industry’s momentum in the US has been fueled by clearer regulations following the passage of the GENIUS Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. McGranahan said the company had previously avoided entering the crypto market due to concerns over volatility and regulatory uncertainty but that the new legislation has opened the door for participation. According to the US Treasury Department, the stablecoin market was valued at $311.5 billion in April and could reach $2 trillion by 2028. Western Union’s move comes roughly three months after it first hinted at stablecoin integration earlier this year, marking a major shift in the remittance leader’s digital strategy.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-29 03:43:54

Grayscale’s ETHE experienced a net outflow of $2.66 million. This might indicate that some investors are shifting capital from older, perhaps less efficient, Grayscale products to newer spot ETH ETFs, which often offer better fee structures or direct exposure without the previous trust structure limitations.

Recently, the Bank of Korea (BOK) Governor, Lee Chang-yong , voiced a serious concern regarding the potential for foreign exchange market volatility and capital flight if a won stablecoin is launched without proper safeguards. Why the Alarm? Understanding the Won Stablecoin Concern Governor Lee’s apprehension stems from the belief that a freely accessible won stablecoin could easily be taken overseas by individuals. This outflow of capital could destabilize South Korea’s foreign exchange markets, impacting the national economy. Speaking at a parliamentary audit of the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee , Lee emphasized the critical need for a controlled approach. His comments, reported by Yonhap News , highlight a cautious stance on integrating digital currencies into the existing financial system. Capital Flight Risk: A major concern is that a won stablecoin , designed to maintain a stable value against the Korean Won, could become an easy vehicle for money to leave the country. Market Volatility: Uncontrolled capital outflows can lead to sudden fluctuations in the exchange rate, making it harder for businesses to plan and impacting the cost of imports and exports. Financial Stability: The central bank’s primary role is to maintain financial stability. Any development that threatens this, like a poorly managed stablecoin rollout, demands careful consideration. A Cautious Path: The Phased Rollout Strategy for Won Stablecoin Instead of an immediate, wide-scale launch, Governor Lee advocates for a strategic, phased rollout. This approach prioritizes stability and control over rapid adoption. He suggested starting with a bank-centered system. Under this model, commercial banks would play a central role in issuing and managing the won stablecoin , acting as intermediaries between the central bank and users. This initial phase would allow authorities to closely monitor and manage foreign exchange outflows. If this controlled environment proves effective, the program could then be expanded, gradually integrating the digital currency into broader economic activities. What are the benefits of a bank-centered approach? Enhanced Control: Banks already have robust systems for managing currency flows and complying with regulations, making them ideal for overseeing a new digital asset. Risk Mitigation: By limiting initial exposure, the central bank can identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they become systemic problems. Gradual Adaptation: It allows both financial institutions and the public to adapt to the new technology at a manageable pace, fostering trust and understanding. Safeguarding South Korea’s Financial Future The BOK’s stance reflects a global trend among central banks: embracing innovation while prioritizing financial stability. The potential benefits of digital currencies, such as faster and cheaper transactions, are acknowledged, but not at the expense of economic security. The conversation around a won stablecoin is part of a larger global dialogue on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and privately issued stablecoins. Many nations are exploring similar concepts, but concerns about regulatory frameworks, privacy, and economic impact remain paramount. South Korea, with its advanced technological infrastructure and robust financial markets, is uniquely positioned to lead in this space. However, careful planning, as advocated by Governor Lee, is essential to ensure that any new digital currency serves to strengthen, rather than jeopardize, the nation’s economic foundation. Navigating the Future of Digital Currency with a Won Stablecoin The path forward for a won stablecoin is complex, balancing innovation with prudence. The Bank of Korea’s cautious approach aims to harness the advantages of digital currency while effectively mitigating risks like capital flight and market volatility. A phased rollout, beginning with a bank-centered system, appears to be the most sensible strategy. This measured introduction could pave the way for a secure and stable digital won, benefiting South Korea’s economy in the long run. Ultimately, the success of a won stablecoin will depend on meticulous planning, robust regulatory frameworks, and a clear understanding of its potential impact on the broader financial ecosystem. Governor Lee’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that while innovation is exciting, stability must always remain the cornerstone of financial policy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won stablecoin? A won stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to the Korean Won. Its purpose is to offer the benefits of digital currency (like fast transactions) without the price volatility often seen in other cryptocurrencies. Q2: Why is the Bank of Korea concerned about capital flight? Bank of Korea Governor Lee Chang-yong is concerned that if a won stablecoin is introduced without proper controls, it could easily be moved overseas, leading to significant outflows of capital. This could destabilize South Korea’s foreign exchange market and impact its financial stability. Q3: What does a “phased rollout” mean for the won stablecoin? A phased rollout, as suggested by Governor Lee, means introducing the won stablecoin gradually. It would likely start with a limited, controlled system, possibly centered around commercial banks, to test its functionality and manage potential risks like capital flight before expanding its availability to a wider public. Q4: How does a bank-centered system help control foreign exchange outflows? In a bank-centered system, commercial banks would act as key intermediaries, managing the issuance and redemption of the won stablecoin . This structure allows existing banking regulations and oversight mechanisms to be applied, making it easier to monitor and control the movement of funds, including potential foreign exchange outflows. Q5: What is the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee’s role in this discussion? The National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee is a parliamentary body responsible for overseeing South Korea’s economic and financial policies. Governor Lee’s comments were made during an audit, indicating that the committee plays a crucial role in scrutinizing and guiding the nation’s financial strategies, including those related to digital currencies. We hope this article has provided valuable insights into the ongoing discussions surrounding the won stablecoin and its implications for South Korea’s financial landscape.

The asset’s slow, but steady recovery signals that the market is stabilizing. This leaves analysts guessing which catalyst could drive the next rally. In the latest edition of the Bitfinex Alpha report , market experts predicted that changes in the macroeconomic landscape could drive liquidity to bitcoin. Volatility in traditional asset classes, such as oil and fiat currencies, could help stabilize the crypto market and drive positive price movement in the coming weeks. Crypto Market Stabilizes According to Bitfinex, BTC spent last week trading below the short-term holders’ (STH) cost basis of $113,600, which hovers around the 0.85 quantile level. That dynamic indicated signs of market fatigue and fading momentum. However, the market turned for the better over the weekend as U.S.-China tariff discussions progressed and BTC reclaimed those resistance levels. Nonetheless, the STH cost basis remains crucial for BTC to sustain a bullish trajectory. BTC needs to stay above $113,600 to establish a shift in market structure from defensive to constructive. While market participants hope BTC makes a positive turn from this crucial level, historical patterns suggest there may be more bloodshed on the way. Persistent weakness below the STH cost basis has indicated structural weakness in the past and often preceded deeper corrections toward the 0.75 quantile, now located around $97,500. Currently, BTC hovers above $114,400; however, a drop below $113,600 could trigger a decline to $97,500. This level could serve as the low of this consolidation phase. Analysts say a move toward this lower boundary will be consistent with prior cycle patterns. The silver lining is that such a move will mark the exhaustion of selling pressure, providing the foundation for the next uptrend. Volatile Macro Landscape As the market prepares for its next move, changes in energy prices and foreign exchange markets are affecting global liquidity flows. Fortunately, cryptocurrencies appear to be absorbing some of the capital rotation. There is a surge in oil prices, and currencies like the Japanese yen have weakened. These developments, coupled with geopolitical tensions, have prompted investors to reassess their exposures to risk assets. Institutional traders are now evaluating their investments in bonds and equities and are likely leaning toward cryptocurrencies.

ETHZilla Dumps ETH For BuyBacks The company framed the buybacks as balance-sheet arbitrage rather than a strategic retreat from its core Ethereum exposure. “We are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet, including reducing our ETH holdings, to execute share repurchases,” chairman and CEO McAndrew Rudisill said, adding that ETH sales are being used as “cash” while common shares trade below net asset value. He argued the transactions would be immediately accretive to remaining shareholders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Shows The Possibility Of The Ethereum Price Reaching $16,000 ETHZilla amplified the message on X, saying it would “use its strong balance sheet to support shareholders through buybacks, reduce shares available for short borrow, [and] drive up NAV per share” and reiterating that it still holds “~$400 million of ETH” on the balance sheet and carries “no net debt.” The company also cited “recent, concentrated short selling” as a factor keeping the stock under pressure. The market-structure logic is straightforward: when a digital-asset treasury trades below the value of its coin holdings and cash, buying back stock with “coin-cash” can, in theory, collapse the discount and lift NAV per share. But the optics are contentious inside crypto because the mechanism requires selling the underlying asset—here, ETH—to purchase equity, potentially weakening the very treasury backing that investors originally sought. Death Spiral Incoming? Popular crypto trader SalsaTekila (@SalsaTekila) commented on X: “This is extremely bearish, especially if it invites similar behavior. ETH treasuries are not Saylor; they haven’t shown diamond-hand will. If treasury companies start dumping the coin to buy shares, it’s a death spiral setup.” Skeptics also zeroed in on funding choices. “I am mostly curious why the company chose to sell ETH and not use the $569m in cash they had on the balance sheet last month,” another analyst Dan Smith wrote, noting ETHZilla had just said it still holds about $400 million of ETH and thus didn’t deploy it on fresh ETH accumulation. “Why not just use cash?” The question cuts to the core of treasury signaling: using ETH as a liquidity reservoir to defend a discounted equity can be read as rational capital allocation, or as capitulation that undermines the ETH-as-reserve narrative. Beyond the buyback, a retail-driven storyline has rapidly formed around the stock. Business Insider reported that Dimitri Semenikhin—who recently became the face of the Beyond Meat surge—has targeted ETHZilla, saying he purchased roughly 2% of the company at what he views as a 50% discount to modified NAV. He has argued that the market is misreading ETHZilla’s balance sheet because it still reflects legacy biotech results rather than the current digital-asset treasury model. Related Reading: Ethereum Emerges As The Sole Trillion-Dollar Institutional Store Of Value — Here’s Why The same report cites liquid holdings on the order of 102,300 ETH and roughly $560 million in cash, translating to about $62 per share in liquid assets, and calls out a 1-for-10 reverse split on October 15 that, in his view, muddied the optics for retail. Semenikhin flagged November 13 as a potential catalyst if results show the pivot to ETH generating profits. The company’s own messaging emphasizes the discount-to-NAV lens rather than a change in strategy. ETHZilla told investors it would keep buying while the stock trades below asset value and highlighted a goal of shrinking lendable supply to blunt short-selling pressure. For Ethereum markets, the immediate flow effect is limited—$40 million is marginal in ETH’s daily liquidity—but the second-order risk flagged by traders is behavioral contagion. If other ETH-heavy treasuries follow the playbook, selling the underlying to buy their own stock, the flow could become pro-cyclical: coins are sold to close equity discounts, the selling pressures spot, and wider discounts reappear as equity screens rerate to the weaker mark—repeat. That is the “death spiral” scenario skeptics warn about when the treasury asset doubles as the company’s signal of conviction. At press time, ETH traded at $4,156.

This coming week, a confluence of major central bank decisions, particularly from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ), is poised to send ripples across global currency valuations. These shifts can directly influence investor sentiment, liquidity, and ultimately, the trajectory of your crypto portfolio. So, buckle up, as we delve into the crucial dynamics shaping Asia FX and the mighty US Dollar . How Global Forex Decisions Echo in Your Crypto Wallet The financial world is bracing for a week packed with high-stakes announcements that could redefine global currency trends. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding these macro shifts isn’t just academic; it’s essential for strategic positioning. When major currencies experience significant volatility, it often triggers a flight to safety or risk-on appetite, both of which have profound implications for digital assets. A stronger US Dollar , for instance, can sometimes exert downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as it makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive and reduces the purchasing power for international investors. Conversely, a weakening dollar could signal a broader risk-on environment, potentially benefiting crypto. This week’s focus will be on two titans of monetary policy: the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Their impending decisions on interest rates and monetary policy are expected to dictate the immediate direction of the dollar and key Asian currencies, setting the stage for global market sentiment. Asia FX : Is Regional Stability Under Threat or Poised for Growth? The currencies of Asia have shown a mixed bag of resilience and vulnerability in recent times. While some, like the Chinese Yuan, are closely managed, others, such as the Korean Won or the Indonesian Rupiah, are more susceptible to global capital flows and commodity price fluctuations. The overall health of Asia FX is a critical barometer for global trade and economic growth, directly impacting supply chains and investor confidence worldwide. Several factors contribute to the current state of Asian currencies: Global Trade Dynamics: Asia remains the manufacturing hub of the world. Any slowdown in global demand or disruptions in trade relations can quickly reflect in export-oriented economies and their currencies. Interest Rate Differentials: The gap between local interest rates and those in major economies like the US can drive ‘carry trades,’ where investors borrow in low-interest currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones. This directly impacts capital flows into and out of Asian markets. Commodity Prices: Many Asian economies are significant importers or exporters of commodities. Fluctuations in oil, gas, or raw material prices can significantly affect their balance of payments and currency strength. China’s Economic Health: As the region’s largest economy, China’s performance and policy decisions have an outsized influence on its neighbors. A robust Chinese economy generally provides a tailwind for other Asia FX , while slowdowns can trigger regional weakness. This week, the interplay of these factors, especially against the backdrop of Fed and BOJ actions, will be crucial for the stability and direction of regional currencies. The Unyielding Strength of the US Dollar : A Safe Haven in Uncertain Times? The US Dollar has largely maintained its firm footing, acting as a perennial safe haven amidst global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Its strength is not merely a reflection of US economic performance but also a consequence of its role as the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant currency for international trade and finance. What drives the dollar’s firmness? Economic Resilience: Despite global headwinds, the US economy has often demonstrated surprising resilience, with robust job growth and consumer spending. This strength supports the argument for higher-for-longer interest rates, making dollar-denominated assets attractive. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes over the past couple of years have created a significant yield advantage for the dollar compared to many other major currencies, attracting global capital. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global stress or market volatility, investors typically flock to the perceived safety of the dollar, increasing its demand and value. Liquidity: The sheer depth and liquidity of US financial markets make the dollar an easy currency to trade in large volumes, further cementing its role. However, the narrative could shift significantly if the Fed signals a more dovish stance, particularly regarding a potential Fed rate cut . Any indication of easing monetary policy could temper the dollar’s strength and re-evaluate its safe-haven status, impacting everything from commodity prices to global equity markets and, of course, cryptocurrencies. Will the Anticipated Fed Rate Cut Materialize, and What Does It Mean? The prospect of a Fed rate cut has been a dominant theme in financial markets for months. After an aggressive hiking cycle to combat inflation, the market is now keenly anticipating when the Federal Reserve will begin to reverse course. The timing and magnitude of such a cut are critical for global financial conditions. Here’s what to consider regarding a potential Fed rate cut: Inflation Data: The Fed’s primary mandate is price stability. Sustained evidence of cooling inflation, moving towards its 2% target, is a prerequisite for any rate cuts. Labor Market Health: While a strong labor market is generally positive, an overheating one can fuel inflation. The Fed monitors employment figures closely for signs of softening that would justify easing policy. Economic Growth: The Fed aims for a ‘soft landing’ – bringing down inflation without triggering a severe recession. Signs of significant economic slowdown would increase the urgency for rate cuts. Market Expectations: Financial markets have often priced in rate cuts aggressively, sometimes ahead of the Fed’s own signals. Discrepancies between market expectations and Fed communication can lead to significant volatility. If a Fed rate cut materializes, it would likely: Weaken the US Dollar: Lower interest rates reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets, potentially leading to capital outflows. Boost Risk Assets: A dovish Fed typically signals easier financial conditions, which can be a boon for equities, commodities, and riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Impact Global Borrowing Costs: As the dollar is central to global finance, a Fed rate cut can lower borrowing costs for countries and corporations worldwide. The market will be dissecting every word from the Fed’s upcoming statements for clues on the path forward, making this a truly pivotal moment for the forex market . The BOJ Meeting : What Surprises Could Shake the Markets? Across the Pacific, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) holds its own crucial meeting, watched closely for any signs of a departure from its ultra-loose monetary policy. Japan has long been an outlier among major economies, maintaining negative interest rates and a yield curve control (YCC) policy to combat deflation and stimulate growth. However, recent inflation figures in Japan have shown persistent upward pressure, fueling speculation that the BOJ might finally be ready to normalize policy. Key aspects of the upcoming BOJ meeting include: Interest Rate Adjustments: Will the BOJ finally hike its policy rate out of negative territory? This would be a historic shift with global implications. Yield Curve Control (YCC): The BOJ currently caps the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds. Any adjustments to this policy, or its complete abolition, would have significant effects on global bond markets. Inflation Outlook: The BOJ’s assessment of the sustainability of inflation above its 2% target will be key to its policy decisions. Yen Volatility: The Japanese Yen (JPY) has been particularly sensitive to interest rate differentials. Any hawkish surprise from the BOJ could lead to a sharp appreciation of the Yen, unwinding years of carry trades. A significant policy shift from the BOJ would not only impact the Yen and Japanese markets but could also reverberate across the global forex market . For instance, an unwinding of Yen carry trades could lead to repatriation of capital, affecting asset prices in other markets, including potentially impacting liquidity for certain crypto assets. Navigating the Complex Forex Market : Strategies for a Volatile Landscape The convergence of these major central bank meetings creates a highly dynamic and potentially volatile environment for the entire forex market . Traders and investors, including those with exposure to cryptocurrencies, need to be acutely aware of the interconnectedness of these global financial levers. Interplay of Major Currencies: The decisions from the Fed and the BOJ will not occur in isolation. Their actions will trigger a chain reaction across currency pairs: USD/JPY: This pair will be directly impacted by both central banks. A dovish Fed and a hawkish BOJ could see a significant drop in USD/JPY. USD/Asian Currencies: The strength or weakness of the US Dollar will heavily influence the trajectory of currencies within Asia FX . A weaker dollar could provide breathing room for Asian central banks, potentially reducing pressure for them to hike rates. Global Capital Flows: Changes in interest rate differentials will re-route global capital. Money tends to flow towards higher-yielding assets, so shifts in policy can lead to significant rebalancing of portfolios. Challenges and Opportunities in a Dynamic Market: This period of intense central bank activity presents both challenges and opportunities: Aspect Challenges Opportunities Volatility Increased risk of sudden price swings; stop-losses can be triggered easily. Potential for significant short-term gains for agile traders; arbitrage opportunities. Policy Divergence Conflicting signals from central banks make forecasting difficult. Clear trends can emerge in currency pairs where central bank policies diverge sharply. Risk Management Need for tighter risk controls and smaller position sizes. Opportunity to review and adjust hedging strategies across different asset classes. Crypto Impact Macro shifts can cause unexpected crypto market volatility. Potential for capital rotation from traditional assets into crypto if liquidity increases or confidence in traditional systems wavers. Actionable Insights: Preparing Your Portfolio for Macro Swings For investors navigating both traditional and digital asset markets, a proactive approach is key. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Closely monitor official statements from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Pay attention to the nuances in their language, not just the headline decisions. Diversify: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and geographies. This can help mitigate risks associated with sudden currency movements. Consider Hedging: If you have significant exposure to specific currencies or international assets, consider hedging strategies to protect against adverse currency swings. Assess Risk Appetite: In periods of high uncertainty, it’s wise to re-evaluate your risk tolerance and adjust your positions accordingly. Volatility can be a friend or foe, depending on your strategy. Look for Intermarket Connections: Understand how movements in the forex market impact other assets. For instance, a stronger dollar often correlates with weaker commodity prices and can sometimes weigh on crypto. The confluence of a potential Fed rate cut and a pivotal BOJ meeting creates a landscape ripe for significant shifts. Being prepared means understanding the potential outcomes and their far-reaching implications. Conclusion: High Stakes, High Rewards – The Week Ahead for Global Currencies The coming week is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated for the global forex market in recent memory. With the Federal Reserve poised to potentially signal its first Fed rate cut and the Bank of Japan teetering on the edge of a historic policy shift, the ripple effects will be felt across every corner of finance, from major currencies like the US Dollar to the nuanced movements of Asia FX . These decisions will not only reshape traditional investment landscapes but also significantly influence the broader sentiment and liquidity within the cryptocurrency space. For astute investors, understanding these macro currents is paramount to navigating the complexities and capitalizing on the opportunities that lie ahead. Prepare for a week of crucial announcements and potential market-moving developments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Federal Reserve’s primary goal?

A3: A strong US Dollar makes dollar-denominated goods and services more expensive for international buyers, can increase the debt burden for countries with dollar-denominated loans, and can draw capital away from other markets, including emerging markets and sometimes even cryptocurrencies. Q4: Who is the current Chair of the Federal Reserve? A4: The current Chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell . Q5: What does ‘Asia FX’ refer to?

MoonBull Smashes Past the $500K Barrier as BullZilla and La Culex Gain Fierce Momentum,https://timestabloid.com/top-meme-coin-to-buy-now-moonbull-smashes-past-the-500k/,"The top meme coin to buy now is stirring up the crypto streets, and names like BullZilla, La Culex, and MoonBull are grabbing attention fast. BullZilla’s 8th stage, “Echoes of the Bull,” shows a strong $980K presale tally and over 3,300 holders. Meanwhile, La Culex is buzzing at Stage 3. Together, these rising stars are shaking up the meme market, drawing in traders eager for the next moonshot. But for investors chasing early-stage wins, the MoonBull presale’s Stage 5 looks like the golden ticket. It’s where community energy meets serious tokenomics. Crypto enthusiasts, students, and analysts who missed earlier bull runs are watching closely, seeing MoonBull as a fresh chance to ride the hype wave with purpose and profit baked into every stage. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Top meme Coin to Buy Now MoonBull stands out as the top meme coin to buy now thanks to its wild mix of meme culture and financial muscle. Running on Ethereum, it’s a fresh breed of meme token with automated liquidity, reflections, and burns that turn every trade into a boost for holders. The MoonBull presale is now in Stage 5, priced at just $0.00006584 with over $500K raised and 1,600+ holders. Early joiners could see over 9,256% ROI by the time listing hits $0.00616. The next surge? A whopping 27.4% jump, making now the sweet spot to hop in. Here’s the fun part – imagine dropping $30,000 into MoonBull right now. By the time the 23-stage presale hits its final round, that small stack could snowball into serious peanuts turned into gold. With 95% APY staking set to launch at Stage 10, the project rewards holders not just for buying but for staying loyal. It’s not just a meme play; it’s a financial engine dressed in bull horns and moon boots. Voting Power: Community Control and Crypto Freedom Starting from Stage 12, every $MOBU token equals one vote, giving holders real say in the project’s future. This governance model ensures transparency and long-term trust, letting users decide on burns, campaigns, and ecosystem upgrades. That’s a rare power move in the meme coin jungle, where most communities have little voice. MoonBull’s structure transforms buyers into decision-makers, making it the top meme coin to buy now for investors who crave both fun and function. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Veteran Beast Charging Ahead BullZilla has proven its horns are sharp in this bull run. Now in its 8th stage, Echoes of the Bull, it boasts a presale tally of over $980K and more than 3,300 token holders. The current price sits at $0.00019906, with a surge expected to $0.00020573 soon. Early joiners already racked up over 3,300% ROI, showing how powerful timing can be. A $1,000 investment once fetched over 5 million $BZIL tokens, turning ordinary buyers into bullish believers. But as the bull keeps charging, the entry price rises, making future gains tighter. While BullZilla remains a reliable name in the herd, those who missed its early roar might find it harder to catch lightning again. For those seeking fresh entry potential, MoonBull offers a similar rise but at its ground floor. That’s why analysts keep linking BullZilla’s early hype to the growing buzz around MoonBull, marking it as the top meme coin to buy now. La Culex ($CULEX): The Newcomer Buzzing in the Shadows La Culex , now in Stage 3: Bug Spray Dip, trades at $0.00002274 and is gearing up for a next-stage price of $0.00002458. The presale has already surpassed $7,000, and its slow but steady flight continues to catch the attention of early meme investors. Though smaller in scale than BullZilla and MoonBull, La Culex carries an intriguing sense of mystery – like a mosquito that just won’t quit buzzing the closer you listen. There’s undeniable potential here, but it’s still early in its evolution within the crypto meme ecosystem. Investors who appreciate quiet, early-stage plays may find its gradual progress appealing, yet the real spotlight seems to shine elsewhere. As crypto discussions increasingly center on long-term sustainability and token utility, many traders are turning toward the MoonBull presale, where staking rewards, governance voting, and structured growth offer a more comprehensive value proposition. That’s why MoonBull continues to stand out as the front-running contender among today’s top meme coins to watch. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, BullZilla continues its powerful climb, and La Culex is finding its footing among smaller-cap plays. Both coins have shown grit and promise in their respective stages. Yet, when it comes to combining innovation, community engagement, and smart tokenomics, MoonBull emerges as the clear frontrunner. Its strong ROI projections, presale momentum, and built-in scarcity mechanisms make it a prime example of the top meme coin to buy now. MoonBull isn’t just another hype train. It’s an ecosystem built for longevity and community power. With staking, referrals, and voting rights shaping its structure, this project is turning meme energy into financial reality. The MoonBull presale at Stage 5 is still open, but not for long. Jump in before it’s too late – the next 1000x bull could already be warming up its engines.

Its community-driven governance, staking pool, and transparent roadmap create a solid foundation for sustained growth. Glossary of Key Terms Presale: Early sale of tokens before public listing.

In today’s environment—where stablecoin-based investments and regulated digital assets are gaining momentum—PMN offers a concrete, operationally backed solution for disciplined Bitcoin accumulation. We’re proud to show that Japan’s next financial exports may no longer be limited to stocks and bonds—but also include blockchain-powered, professionally managed investment opportunities.” This engagement marks a pivotal step in bringing Japan-origin infrastructure-based digital assets to the global stage .

That’s a 14% surge, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.59 billion by 0.97%. On the earnings side, Visa reported $2.98 per share, slightly above the $2.97 estimate, and well above the $2.71 it reported this time last year. This is the fourth quarter in a row that Visa has outstandingly outperformed analyst expectations on both earnings and revenue. The company delivered a +0.34% surprise this quarter, but last quarter’s surprise was even bigger at +4.2%, when analysts expected $2.86 per share and Visa again came through with a $2.98. But hey, don’t confuse consistency with outperformance, because despite all this, the stock has only surged by 10.1% this year, trailing the S&P 500’s 16.9% monster rally. Visa pushes stablecoin adoption across global network Visa’s quarterly earnings call wasn’t just about numbers though, as CEO Ryan McInerney made it clear they’re going deeper into stablecoins. “We are adding support for four stablecoins, running on four unique blockchains, representing two currencies, that we can accept and convert to over 25 traditional fiat currencies,” Ryan said Tuesday. Ryan also said that Visa card spending linked to stablecoins in Q4 was four times higher than it was a year ago. This is after Visa launched a pilot program in September to test cross-border payments using stablecoins, giving businesses a faster way to move funds internationally without the usual banking delays. Visa has been dabbling in the crypto space for a while, but this quarter’s update gave numbers. According to Ryan, since 2020, Visa has handled over $140 billion in crypto and stablecoin flows. That includes $100 billion worth of crypto purchases using Visa credentials. Ryan says Visa is now letting banks mint and burn stablecoins directly through Visa’s infrastructure. The payments giant allegedly has over 130 stablecoin-linked card issuing programs across more than 40 countries. And while they’ve worked with crypto-native firms before, McInerney emphasized that the regulatory clarity in the U.S. around USD-pegged tokens is pushing Visa to move faster. So what’s coming next? Depends who you ask. Right now, analysts expect $3.07 EPS on $10.59 billion revenue for the next quarter. For the full fiscal year, the estimate is $12.84 EPS and $44.18 billion in total revenue. But the revisions trend ahead of this report was mixed, so there’s no clear signal yet on where forecasts are heading next. Visa’s stock may react to all this… or it may not. As usual, what matters most for short-term movement is what management said on the earnings call, and how investors interpret that tone. And that is a question for the next quarter.

The statement came from CFO Claire McDonough, who spoke to reporters in Detroit. She said construction on the Georgia plant is expected to begin next year. Claire explained that Rivian plans to seek reimbursement through the Department of Energy loan after the plant is completed but before the company begins production there. “It’d be prior to starting production in 2028 that we’d be drawing down the loan,” she said. The loan was finalized in January, during the final days of President Joe Biden’s administration. That timing matters because former President Donald Trump has criticized federal financing of clean energy projects like this. Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in May that his agency does not plan to move forward with several loans approved under Biden. Rivian’s expected drawdown in 2028 will land directly in another U.S. presidential election year, putting political risk right at the center of this financing plan. No drama there, right? Sure. Rivian timelines tied to Georgia plant and R2-R3 production The company, based in Irvine, California, plans to start building the Georgia plant next year. The factory is intended to handle production of the company’s upcoming models, including the R2 and eventually another model called R3. The R2 will first be built at Rivian’s existing plant in Normal, Illinois starting in 2026. Rivian applied for this federal loan last year, shortly after pausing the initial Georgia construction plan because of cost pressures. Yes, cost-cutting led to the pause. Now the plan is back on track, just slower. Claire also reaffirmed Rivian’s target to reach operating profit by 2028, but only if the Normal plant reaches full annual capacity of 200,000 vehicles. That is the internal performance threshold. Claire said, “Ramping up the Normal facility to 200,000 would get us to Ebitda,” referring to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Right now, Rivian is nowhere near that. In August, the company projected an adjusted EBITDA loss of up to $2.25 billion for the year. So yes, they are planning long-term, because the short-term is not pretty. Rivian analyzed Xiaomi SU7, but says U.S. cannot match China’s support There was another layer to the conversation this week. CEO RJ Scaringe confirmed that Rivian engineers recently tore down the Chinese Xiaomi SU7, the electric sedan that has been shaking up markets because of its price. It starts at 215,900 yuan, around $30,000. Last year, even Ford CEO Jim Farley said he imported an SU7 to drive it himself. That got attention. Scaringe said the SU7 is “a really well executed, heavily vertically-integrated technology platform” and “nicely done.” He even said that if he lived in China, it is one of the cars he would consider buying. But after the teardown, Rivian did not discover any magic trick that explains the low price. “We learned nothing from the teardown” that would explain how Xiaomi keeps costs down, Scaringe said. According to him, the answer is simple: China’s government support system. He said that in China, “the cost of capital is zero or negative, meaning they get paid to put up plants.” That is a financial environment the U.S. does not have and cannot copy.

The company said its revenue hit ₩24.45 trillion ($17.13 billion), compared to analyst forecasts of ₩24.73 trillion, while operating profit reached ₩11.38 trillion, narrowly missing estimates of ₩11.39 trillion. Still, those numbers mark an astonishing 39% increase in revenue year‑on‑year and a 62% jump in profit. On a quarterly basis, sales climbed 10%, and profit rose 24%. SK Hynix also confirmed that its quarterly profit exceeded ₩10 trillion for the first time. Shares in Seoul surged more than 5%, extending their 2024 rally to over 210%. SK Hynix said, “As demand across the memory segment has soared due to customers’ expanding investments in AI infrastructure, SK Hynix once again surpassed the record‑high performance of the previous quarter due to increased sales of high value‑added products.” The firm added that it has already sold out its planned supply of memory chips for 2026, underscoring the scale of AI‑driven demand from its data‑center clients. SK Hynix expands AI memory leadership with next‑gen HBM4 rollout SK Hynix said it would begin supplying its next‑generation HBM4 chips in the current quarter, following final negotiations with several major customers. The HBM4 chips mark the company’s sixth generation of high‑bandwidth memory and are expected to deliver faster data transfer speeds for next‑generation AI accelerators. HBM, or high‑bandwidth memory, sits under the DRAM category, which is used to store data and program code in everything from servers and workstations to consumer electronics. But AI has changed the balance of the memory market; HBM is now the beating heart of data‑center infrastructure, linking GPUs and CPUs to handle massive AI workloads. SK Hynix’s dominance comes from its early lead in HBM technology and its close supply ties with Nvidia, the world’s biggest AI chipmaker. It remains Nvidia’s main supplier of advanced memory, a position that competitors Samsung and Micron are still fighting to reach. Micron has started shipping HBM products to Nvidia, and Samsung recently passed Nvidia’s qualification tests for its own next‑gen memory chip, signaling intensifying competition ahead. Despite that, CFO Kim Woohyun said SK Hynix would “continue to strengthen our AI memory leadership by responding to customer demand through market‑leading products and differentiated technological capabilities.” The company is doubling down on AI memory, confident that the boom is far from over. Market share dominance and AI‑fueled demand forecast According to Counterpoint Research, SK Hynix held a 38% share of the global DRAM market by revenue in Q2, overtaking Samsung in the first quarter and widening its lead through mid‑year. In the HBM market, the company’s grip is even stronger, with a 64% global share as of the second quarter, while the entire market expanded 178% year‑on‑year. Research director MS Hwang from Counterpoint said the HBM market could hit $43 billion by 2027, giving firms like SK Hynix significant profit leverage. “For SK Hynix to continue generating profits, it’ll be important for the company to maintain and enhance its competitive edge,” Hwang said. Ray Wang, lead semiconductor analyst at Futurum Group, added that SK Hynix is likely to maintain around 60% of the global HBM market next year, supported by its technological edge and relationships with major AI players like Nvidia, Google, and other hyperscale customers.

Related Reading: Analyst Shares Why He Bought A Massive Stack Of XRP, ‘It’s Not A Gamble’ According to Standard Chartered’s head of digital asset research Geoffrey Kendrick, the recent developments may mark a transformative phase for Bitcoin, one where its six-figure price zone becomes a lasting support level rather than a fleeting milestone. Macro Tailwinds Drive Market Mood Kendrick points to a rebound in global risk appetite after recent signs of détente between the United States and China . Discussions around delayed rare-earth export restrictions and increased U.S. agricultural purchases by China have eased trade tensions ahead of the high-level summit between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping. Kendrick notes that this shift in geopolitics has helped restore confidence in risk assets, including Bitcoin, and may be influencing the recent uptick in the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio, a key sentiment indicator for crypto markets. In parallel, expectations of a potential interest-rate cut by the Fed and the possibility of the bank pausing its quantitative-tightening programme have also lifted hopes of increased liquidity, further favouring risk-on trades. Analysts suggest that if the Fed pivots, it could serve as a boost for Bitcoin’s structural up-trend. Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows Could Cement the New Floor Beyond macro trends, Standard Chartered emphasises the growing role of institutional flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. The believe that over $2 billion recently exited gold-backed ETFs, and argues that even half of those funds shifting into BTC products would represent a major structural change in capital allocation. This matters because it signals a shift away from the traditional narrative that Bitcoin’s price moves are primarily driven by its miner-reward “halving” events. Instead, large-scale adoption and institutional investment now appear to be the dominant drivers of the market. If this momentum persists, Kendrick asserts that Bitcoin may be entering a new phase where dropping below $100,000 becomes unlikely. Bottom Line At present, Bitcoin remains within a consolidation range near $112,000–114,000, with technicals pointing to a tightening in volatility and potential for a breakout once macro catalysts settle.

Volume over the last 24 hours rose by 60%, pushing total traded value above $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: $10K Is Coming: Arthur Hayes’ Zcash ‘Vibe Check’ Sparks 30% Moonshot Yet the token traded near $0.21 at the time of the report, down about 0.18% in the day and down 12% so far this month. Trading Volume Surges According to CoinMarketCap data, the sudden spike in volume shows many more hands moving DOGE than usual. Reports have disclosed that this wave of trades coincides with renewed interest among retail buyers and larger holders. Data shows that October has historically been a strong month for Dogecoin, with modest gains of 30% to a more impressive 101% from 2021 up to 2024. Those past returns help explain why some traders expect a positive close this month. Whales Move, Exchanges See Flow Reports have disclosed several large transfers tied to the surge. One report described a dormant whale with a 36 DOGE seed reactivating and making a transfer valued at $26.8 million to Binance. Another dormant wallet reportedly moved 15.115 million DOGE, valued at about $2.95 million, out of the same exchange. These movements drew attention because big transfers can change where liquidity sits and how quickly prices move when buying or selling picks up. Another dormant wallet reportedly moved 15 million DOGE, valued at about nearly $3 million, out of Binance. These movements drew attention because big transfers can change where liquidity sits and how quickly prices move when buying or selling picks up. Macro Drivers And Market Sentiment The volume surge came as major cryptocurrencies showed strength. Reports have disclosed Bitcoin moving higher toward $115,000 while Ethereum traded near $4,200. That broader rally can lift smaller tokens as traders rotate capital across markets. Still, metrics are mixed: one recent forecast predicted DOGE could rise by 13% to $0.22 by November 27, 2025, while technical indicators flagged the current sentiment as Bearish and the Fear & Greed Index sat at 50. Outlook And Risks Ahead The picture is straightforward and messy at the same time. Higher volume suggests interest; price action says caution. Whale transfers can both fuel rallies and add selling pressure, depending on intent.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-you-need-2500-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders, recently released a video with an urgent message to viewers about XRP. His comments came shortly after Ripple confirmed the completion of its acquisition of Hidden Road, a major institutional finance platform now operating under the name Ripple Prime . Rietveld began his message with a clear statement. “If you are watching this, you need to get at least 2,500 XRP before the end of this month,” he said. His reasoning centered on what he called the transformative effect of the Hidden Road acquisition, which he believes will push significant capital flows through the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the coming months. The transaction expands Ripple’s reach into prime brokerage and institutional clearing while integrating XRP and Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , into new financial services.

He predicted that “trillions of dollars are going to be going through the XRP ledger as part of this partnership,” emphasizing that the network could soon process institutional-level settlements at a scale not previously seen. He also warned that investors who delay could miss a significant opportunity, saying this was their last chance to make a life-changing decision . Rietveld’s call to secure 2,500 XRP shows his belief in the long-term success of the digital asset and Ripple’s initiatives. It reflects his view that retail investors should gain meaningful exposure before institutional investors become active.

The move enables Ripple to offer prime brokerage, financing, and settlement services to professional traders and financial institutions, bringing traditional and digital assets under a single operational framework. This integration positions Ripple to leverage the XRPL for real-world settlement of major financial transactions, a goal it has pursued for years. The acquisition is a bold step toward establishing XRP as an institutional-grade liquidity asset. By connecting Ripple Prime’s infrastructure with the XRPL, Ripple can facilitate faster and cheaper movement of capital between asset classes.

The company is now valued at $4.89 trillion, just a few months after becoming the first to break the $4 trillion barrier in July. Nvidia also announced on Tuesday that it’s teaming up with the U.S. Department of Energy to construct seven supercomputers, including one designed with 10,000 of its Blackwell GPUs. Nvidia’s Huang estimates they could earn over $500 billion in revenue by 2026 Among its other deals, Nvidia will also partner with Uber on autonomous vehicle development, sell 1,000 GPUs to Eli Lilly, and collaborate with Nokia to advance 6G communications. The semiconductor company, aiming to work on national security applications, also announced new alliances with Palantir and Oracle, as well as with telecom firms such as Cisco and T-Mobile, to support the next wave of 6G infrastructure. Additionally, the company noted that its AI systems are being utilized to power robotics efforts at firms such as Amazon, Foxconn, Caterpillar, and Belden. The company also rolled out NVQLink, a new open architecture designed to enhance the pace of quantum supercomputer innovation with partners including Rigetti and IonQ. Moreover, in his keynote address on Tuesday, CEO Jensen Huang projected that Nvidia will generate roughly half a trillion dollars in revenue from its Blackwell chips and the early rollout of Rubin, its next-generation computing platform, by 2026. The firm has already initiated mass production of Blackwell’s most advanced chip alongside Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Nvidia has made several strategic equity investments in key partners in recent months, as the company has emerged as a central player in the AI world. Last month, it committed a $5 billion investment in one-time rival Intel and announced plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. It also committed $500 million in self-driving car startup Wayve and a $667 million investment in U.K. cloud provider Nscale. Huang says the White House is working on an arrangement that could allow for chip sales in China A potential trade agreement between Washington and Beijing could work in Nvidia’s favor. A trade deal might allow it to resume chip sales in China. Huang has argued that keeping Nvidia out of the Chinese market would ultimately hurt America more than it hurts China. He noted, “We want to compete against China, no doubt about that. We want America to win this AI race, no doubt about that … But we also need to be in China to win their developers. A policy that causes America to lose half of the world’s AI developers is not beneficial in the long term.” The Trump administration is laying the groundwork for regulations that can make the government take up 15% of Nvidia’s China sales, Huang also said during a Q&A session on Tuesday afternoon. But Beijing hasn’t yet decided whether the chips can be repatriated. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet in South Korea, renewing optimism for a possible trade agreement between the two economic giants. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who joined Huang during Tuesday’s Q&A session, even commented, “I feel quite optimistic that we will have an agreement and arrangement coming out of that will benefit the United States and benefit the world.” Nvidia’s GPUs are still the backbone of the sprawling data centers that Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are building worldwide. However, its rivals are stepping up, including AMD, which recently signed agreements to deliver up to 6 gigawatts of AI processors to OpenAI and 50,000 GPUs to Oracle. Qualcomm also said it’s joining the AI data center race with new accelerator chips.

Optimism over a potential US–China trade deal also lifted sentiment ahead of Thursday’s meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Australian shares declined after the release of the latest quarterly inflation figures. Silver rose to around $47.5 per ounce on Wednesday, moving away from one-month lows in a likely technical rebound. Gold prices rose to around $3,970 per ounce on Wednesday, pausing its recent decline, as attention turned to the Federal Reserve’s expected rate cut later in the day.

U.S. President Donald Trump signaled plans to reduce fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports ahead of his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Bitcoin lost steam into the Asia session, down 1.1% to $112,806 as traders trimmed risk before the Fed’s rate decision later today. The pullback cooled a recent crypto rebound even as regional equities climbed on AI optimism. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $112,806, down 1.1% Ether : $4,016, down 2.1% Solana : $194.64, down 3.3% Total crypto market cap : $3.8 trillion, down 1.4% Asia is taking its cue from Wall Street. Tech optimism carried over after Microsoft struck a deal to let OpenAI restructure as a public benefit corporation while taking a 27% stake, and that lifted sentiment across the region. You can see it in the price action, as MSCI Asia ex-Japan nudged higher, Japan’s Nikkei jumped more than 1% to fresh records, and Korea’s Kospi hit an all-time high thanks in part to upbeat results from SK Hynix, a key Nvidia supplier. Futures are mixed into Europe and the US, with Nasdaq a touch firmer and Euro Stoxx 50 a bit softer. Fed Rate Cut Looms as Markets Brace for Policy Signals on Liquidity The real hinge today is rates. Markets have almost fully priced a 25-basis-point Fed cut. The dollar has eased on the view that more cuts could follow, and traders will listen closely for any hint that the Fed might slow or stop balance-sheet runoff, which would matter for liquidity. “If the Fed signals a fresh easing cycle, risk assets like crypto could pop, but if the messaging stays cautious or hawkish, we could see a quick pullback. For now, the market is perched on a knife-edge between hope and hesitation,” said Bitget CEO Gracy Chen. BREAKING: 98% chance of a 25 bps Fed rate cut tomorrow 2% chance of a 50 bps cut. pic.twitter.com/XEkIXFDBEa — Kalshi (@Kalshi) October 28, 2025 What to watch from the Fed US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce a rate cut today as the two-day FOMC meeting wraps up. The meeting runs Oct. 28–29, with Powell set to release the decision today at 2 pm ET, followed by a press conference at 2:30 pm ET. Markets will parse the statement and Q&A for guidance on the path of rates and quantitative tightening. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, described the Fed’s expected 25-basis-point rate cut to a range of 3.75% to 4% as a move that could inject fresh liquidity into crypto markets. “Easing borrowing costs typically boost risk appetite, and this could channel fresh capital into assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, sparking 5%–10% short-term rallies,” he said. “As investors seek higher returns, we may also see capital rotation from safer assets into major altcoins like SOL and XRP, reinforcing crypto’s appeal as both a growth play and inflation hedge.” BOJ Decision, Fed Rate and Big-Tech Results Form This Week’s Macro Crosscurrents In FX, the yen firmed about 0.3% after US officials amped up warnings about Japan’s ultra-low rates. The Bank of Japan is up tomorrow, and most expect no change. Earnings add another layer. We’re heading into the busiest stretch with Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all reporting, exactly the balance sheets that have steadied risk this year. For crypto desks, those same macro levers decide the next move, the rate path, the tone of US-China talks, and mega-cap results. With Bitcoin hovering under $113K, the question is whether a dovish Fed and tech strength can restart the bid, or if traders stay cautious until the dust settles.

OceanPal Launches SovereignAI Nasdaq-listed OceanPal Inc. raised $120 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal to launch a new subsidiary called SovereignAI, which goal is to commercialize the NEAR Protocol and develop artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company revealed on Tuesday that SovereignAI will also adopt a crypto treasury strategy, with plans to acquire up to 10% of the total NEAR token supply. The initiative is being developed in partnership with the NEAR Foundation and is a major move toward integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies under the concept of “universal AI sovereignty.” Announcement from OceanPal NEAR is a layer-1 blockchain that supports decentralized AI applications by enabling AI agents to interact, manage assets, and operate autonomously across different networks. This collaboration positions OceanPal as a public market vehicle for exposure to NEAR’s native token while also aligning both organizations around the shared goal of advancing open, interoperable AI infrastructure. Alongside the announcement, OceanPal introduced key leadership changes to steer the new venture. Former State Street executive Sal Ternullo was appointed co-CEO, while David Schwed, who previously held senior roles at BNY Mellon, Galaxy, and Robinhood, was named chief operating officer. NEAR Foundation co-founder and CEO Illia Polosukhin will join the SovereignAI advisory board, alongside other people from the industry like Richard Muirhead of Fabric Ventures and OpenAI researcher Lukasz Kaiser. The launch of SovereignAI comes at a time when the crypto and AI sectors are increasingly intertwined . AI agents are now leveraging blockchain technology to securely manage assets, verify on-chain actions, and function as self-governing economic participants. Coinbase’s head of institutional strategy, John D’Agostino, recently said that cryptocurrency is essential for enabling AI agents to operate efficiently in financial markets. Supporting this trend, Cloudflare announced plans to launch its own stablecoin, NET Dollar, to facilitate instant AI-triggered transactions, while Coinbase’s AI-ready payments protocol saw its transaction volume soar over 10,000% in the past month. Overall, it is becoming clear that there is a growing convergence between AI and blockchain as companies race to define the future of autonomous digital economies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|NEAR|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-29 05:30:00

The project's developers have begun integrating the x402 payment standard developed by Coinbase into the Cardano network. This step aims to enable artificial intelligence (AI) agents to make on-chain payments using the ADA and USDM stablecoins. The Masumi blockchain team, which operates within the ADA ecosystem, is leading the system's implementation. ADA founder Charles Hoskinson described the development as “a huge step for Cardano” in a post on the X platform. The x402 protocol allows bots or AI-based agents to manage transactions on-chain without centralized control or human intervention. By integrating this technology into Cardano, AI agents will be able to automatically execute complex DeFi transactions such as token swaps, staking, and lending. This is considered a significant step towards full automation of smart contracts on the network. Related News: One of the Largest Cryptocurrency Companies Revealed It Purchased a Surprise Altcoin That is Not Even Listed on Binance Despite having a market capitalization of $24 billion, ADA only has $322 million in locked assets (TVL) in the DeFi ecosystem, falling short of major networks like Ethereum and Solana, as well as Layer-2 networks like Base and Optimism. Hoskinson has long voiced his frustration with Cardano's DeFi growth. He criticized the Cardano Foundation for being “slow and ineffective,” saying that the foundation attempted to increase network activity by spending $15 million in 2024, but it failed to achieve the expected impact. In October, the Cardano community approved a $33 million ADA fund to increase liquidity for the DeFi stablecoin. Despite this, Cardano's stablecoin market capitalization is only around $36 million. For comparison, Ethereum's market capitalization is around $164 billion and Tron's is around $79 billion. *This is not investment advice.

This persistent pursuit highlights the growing institutional interest in Solana (SOL) and its potential integration into traditional finance. The proposed management fee for this groundbreaking fund is set at a competitive 0.5%. This repeated effort by Canary Capital signals a strong belief in Solana’s future and its suitability for a regulated investment product. Investors are keenly watching how the SEC will respond to this latest submission, as a spot ETF could dramatically change how mainstream finance interacts with the SOL ecosystem. What Exactly is a Spot Solana ETF and Why is it Significant? A spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle that holds the underlying asset directly. In this case, a Spot Solana ETF would directly hold Solana (SOL) tokens, allowing investors to gain exposure to SOL’s price movements without actually owning or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. This differs significantly from a futures ETF, which tracks the price of futures contracts for an asset. Direct ownership offers a more accurate reflection of the asset’s real-time market value. The significance of a Spot Solana ETF is multi-faceted: Accessibility: It opens the door for traditional investors who might be hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges. Regulatory Clarity: Approval would grant Solana a new level of legitimacy within regulated financial markets. Institutional Adoption: It could attract substantial capital from institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers. Ultimately, a spot ETF offers a familiar, regulated wrapper for a volatile digital asset, making it more palatable for a broader range of investors. Navigating the Regulatory Maze: Why So Many Amendments for a Spot Solana ETF ? The journey for any cryptocurrency ETF, especially a spot product, is often a long and challenging one. The SEC has historically approached crypto ETFs with extreme caution, primarily citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of digital asset markets. Canary Capital’s filing of a seventh amendment demonstrates their commitment to addressing these regulatory hurdles. Each amendment typically involves refining the application based on feedback from the SEC, providing more detailed information on market surveillance, custody arrangements, and risk management strategies. Consider the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Both faced numerous delays and rejections before eventually gaining approval, first for futures products, and then, more recently, for spot versions. The SEC’s stringent review process aims to ensure that any new financial product offers adequate safeguards for investors and operates within a robust regulatory framework. Therefore, the multiple amendments for a Spot Solana ETF are not unusual. They reflect the iterative dialogue between applicants and regulators, as they work towards a mutually acceptable structure for these innovative investment products. What Could a Spot Solana ETF Mean for the Solana Market? The potential approval of a Spot Solana ETF could have profound implications for Solana (SOL) and the broader cryptocurrency market. Historically, the approval of similar products for other cryptocurrencies has led to increased liquidity and heightened investor interest. Should the SEC give the green light, we might see: Increased Demand: New avenues for capital inflow from institutional and retail investors. Enhanced Price Discovery: A more efficient and transparent pricing mechanism for SOL. Market Validation: A significant boost to Solana’s credibility as a major blockchain platform. Investors should closely monitor SEC announcements and market reactions. While an approval could be a bullish catalyst, the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various influences. Staying informed about regulatory developments is a key actionable insight for anyone interested in the future of Solana and digital asset investments. A Glimpse into Solana’s Future with a Potential Spot Solana ETF Canary Capital’s persistent efforts to launch a Spot Solana ETF underscore a pivotal moment in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. The filing of the seventh amendment signifies a continuous dialogue with regulators, aiming to meet the rigorous standards required for mainstream financial products. While the path to approval is often arduous, the potential benefits—from enhanced accessibility for traditional investors to increased institutional adoption—are immense. This development could solidify Solana’s position as a mature and recognized asset class within the global financial landscape, marking a significant step towards broader cryptocurrency integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the primary difference between a spot ETF and a futures ETF? A spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset, like actual Solana tokens, meaning its price movements closely track the asset’s real-time market value. A futures ETF, however, invests in futures contracts that speculate on the future price of an asset, which can sometimes diverge from the immediate spot price. Why is the SEC so cautious about approving a Spot Solana ETF ? The SEC’s caution stems from concerns about market manipulation, the protection of investors, and the overall maturity and regulatory oversight of the underlying cryptocurrency markets. They require extensive safeguards and transparency measures before approving new, complex financial products. What is Solana (SOL)?

Imagine holding onto an asset for years, only to see its value skyrocket into the tens of millions. This is precisely the story unfolding as an anonymous address, tied to the initial Ethereum ICO , recently moved a substantial amount of ETH to the Kraken exchange. What’s the Significance of This Ethereum ICO Deposit? This isn’t just any transaction; it’s a move by a true crypto veteran. According to data from Onchain Lens, an address that took part in the original Ethereum ICO has deposited 1,500 ETH, worth a staggering $6.02 million, onto the Kraken platform. For context, the Ethereum ICO was a groundbreaking event in 2014, allowing early supporters to acquire ETH at a nascent stage. Consider the journey of this particular investor: Initial Investment: A modest $6,220. ETH Acquired: A remarkable 20,000 ETH during the ICO. Current Valuation: The remaining 18,500 ETH (after this deposit) is still valued at an astounding $80.3 million. This highlights the incredible long-term growth potential that early participation in projects like the Ethereum ICO offered. It serves as a powerful reminder of the exponential returns possible in the volatile crypto market. A Glimpse into Early Ethereum ICO Fortunes The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) model, though common now, was pioneered by events like the Ethereum ICO . It allowed projects to raise funds by selling new cryptocurrencies to early investors. For many, including this anonymous participant, it was a bold investment in an unproven technology. Their journey from a few thousand dollars to tens of millions is a testament to that early vision and the transformative power of blockchain. While the investor’s identity remains private, their significant move is publicly visible. When a large holder, or “whale,” transfers substantial assets to an exchange, it typically signals an intent to sell or increase liquidity. Market watchers are therefore keenly observing for any subsequent actions, understanding that such moves can influence sentiment. What Could This Ethereum ICO Participant’s Move Mean for the Market? When a substantial amount of ETH from an early Ethereum ICO wallet moves to an exchange, several scenarios can unfold. Firstly, it could be straightforward profit-taking. After nearly a decade, realizing a multi-million dollar gain is a logical step for any investor. Secondly, it might be a strategic reallocation, preparing for new investments or diversifying a vast portfolio. However, large deposits can sometimes create a ripple effect on market sentiment. A sudden influx of sell orders might temporarily add downward pressure on ETH’s price. Conversely, if the ETH is moved for reasons other than immediate selling, the market might absorb it without significant volatility. Investors should monitor these on-chain signals but understand that individual whale movements don’t always dictate broader market trends. Navigating Whale Movements: Lessons from the Ethereum ICO Era Understanding the behavior of large holders, particularly those from the Ethereum ICO era, offers valuable insights. While their actions can be influential, it’s important not to make impulsive decisions based solely on one transaction. The crypto market is complex, influenced by many factors including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory news. For everyday investors, tracking these movements provides key lessons: Long-term Vision: The massive gains from the Ethereum ICO underscore the power of holding for the long run. Risk Management: Even early investors face volatility; knowing when to take profits is crucial. On-Chain Analysis: Tools like Onchain Lens offer transparency, helping investors track significant movements. These lessons remain relevant, whether you participated in the initial Ethereum ICO or are new to the market today. In conclusion, the recent $6 million ETH deposit by an early Ethereum ICO participant to Kraken is more than just a transaction; it’s a narrative of incredible wealth creation and a potential signal for the broader market. It highlights the life-changing potential of early crypto investments and the ongoing relevance of on-chain data in understanding market dynamics. This event serves as a fascinating case study in cryptocurrency history, reminding us of the immense journeys taken by early adopters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Ethereum ICO? The Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO) was a crowdfunding event in 2014, where early investors purchased Ether (ETH) tokens before the official launch of the Ethereum network. Who is the anonymous Ethereum ICO participant? The exact identity of the address holder remains anonymous, typical for blockchain transactions. On-chain analysis confirms their participation in the original Ethereum ICO. Why did the participant deposit ETH to Kraken? Depositing ETH to a centralized exchange like Kraken usually indicates an intention to sell, trade, or convert assets into fiat or other cryptocurrencies, often for profit realization or portfolio rebalancing. How much profit did the Ethereum ICO participant make? The participant initially invested $6,220 for 20,000 ETH. Even after this deposit, their remaining 18,500 ETH is valued at approximately $80.3 million, representing an astronomical return.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) published an updated version of its Info Sheet 225 on Tuesday , clarifying how existing financial services laws apply to digital-asset businesses. The revised guidance marks a significant step in tightening regulatory supervision as Australia prepares to introduce the Treasury Laws Amendment (Regulating Digital Asset and Tokenised Custody Platforms) Bill 2025. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:51422b79-bc24-4c50-98b9-934cee5f9c3d-14"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-8"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> This comes as Australia’s cryptocurrency market shows signs of stagnation, with investors holding back amid anticipation of new digital-asset legislation despite a year of sweeping reforms. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , crypto exchange Swyftx has released its fifth annual Australian Crypto Survey, revealing that adult ownership of digital assets has flatlined, and public trust in cryptocurrencies continues to decline. Treasury and ASIC work together to prepare for new crypto licensing rules The ASIC replaced the old term “crypto assets” with “digital assets” to make it easier for businesses to determine which rules apply to them and how to comply with them. This update is in line with the Australian Treasury’s new Digital Asset Platforms Bill and Payment Service Providers Bill. The new bills will help introduce official licenses for crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and custody service providers by 2026. In addition to the updated terms, the ASIC expanded the examples of financial products to illustrate how the current Corporations Act categorizes different digital assets. The agency also introduced new sections to help businesses know how to handle client assets, risks, and transition smoothly into the new licensing system. The regulator stated that it aims to provide companies with sufficient time to prepare for the new laws while also protecting customers. However, they did make it clear that the examples and sections will not replace the law, but only guide companies. With this new guidance, companies will understand how the current financial rules categorize their services and whether any of them require an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence. ASIC tightens custodial standards and extends Australian law to offshore crypto services The ASIC stated that some companies would intentionally attempt to circumvent the laws because they believe the laws don’t fully apply to them, as they are based outside the country. The agency warned that these excuses will no longer be effective, as every company that reaches Australian customers in some way or another must comply with the laws. Companies must now hold at least A$10 million ($6.5 million) in net tangible assets, unless their custody role is very small or secondary to another service. The Regulatory Guide 166 also has the same requirements for traditional custodians. To help companies adopt the new regulatory system easily, the ASIC stated that skilled individuals who have worked in cryptocurrency or blockchain can qualify as responsible managers under the Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence, even if they do not have a traditional finance background. The company also plans to give “no-action” relief to companies working to get full authorization but have not yet completed the process (as long as they continue to follow strong consumer-protection practices). Fund managers and exchange-traded product (ETP) issuers must also comply with the strict laws outlined in Chapter 5C of the Corporations Act. They should disclose to investors the assets they hold, where those assets are stored, and the specific risks investors face when purchasing crypto-linked products. The agency stated that it aims to prevent firms from promoting digital asset investments without disclosing to investors how funds are managed or what risks may arise. The ASIC also discussed decentralized finance (DeFi), but didn’t provide a single definition because the products are diverse. Instead, the regulator will evaluate each project to determine whether the exchanges or brokers are providing services that require a license. The agency will collaborate with other local regulators to develop new laws governing these digital asset companies. Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino said these updates will create clear and secure laws that will support innovation instead of blocking new technologies.

While Bitcoin price target discussions often lead to volatility, analysts are observing a fascinating pre-FOMC lull, hinting at significant movements ahead. Could this be the calm before a potential storm of upward momentum for BTC? What’s Behind the Current Bitcoin Price Target Lull? Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a short-term correction. This period of consolidation often precedes major market events, such as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Market participants are holding their breath, waiting for clarity on economic policies that could impact investor sentiment and, consequently, crypto valuations. Pre-FOMC Correction: Bitcoin’s recent dip is seen by many as a normal market adjustment, not a collapse. Anticipation Builds: The market is keenly awaiting signals from the FOMC that could dictate the next major trend. This phase is crucial for understanding the immediate future of BTC. Analysts are closely monitoring key price levels to gauge potential breakout or breakdown scenarios. It’s a classic example of market psychology at play, where uncertainty can lead to temporary stagnation before a decisive move. Could Bitcoin Price Target $143K? Analyst Insights Despite the current downturn, several prominent analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Their insights suggest that the recent correction might just be setting the stage for an impressive rally. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez, as reported by CoinDesk, has highlighted a significant potential upside. Martinez suggests that if Bitcoin price target manages to break above the crucial $120,000 resistance level, the path towards $143,000 could open up considerably. This projection is based on a weakening of upward resistance once that key psychological and technical barrier is surpassed. Trader Michaël van de Poppe echoes this sentiment, viewing the current market behavior as a healthy correction rather than a sign of a broader trend reversal. He emphasizes the importance of the $112,000 support level. According to van de Poppe, if BTC successfully holds this support, a robust rebound is highly probable, reaffirming the underlying strength of the asset. Navigating Key Resistance and Support Levels for Bitcoin Price Target Understanding the critical price zones is essential for any investor. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode provides valuable data, identifying the current price range as a key consolidation area. This means both buyers and sellers are actively engaged, creating a tug-of-war that defines the market’s immediate direction. Buying Pressure: Glassnode data indicates strong buying interest concentrated around the $111,000 mark. This suggests that many investors are keen to accumulate BTC at or below this level. Selling Pressure: Conversely, significant selling pressure is observed near $117,000. This acts as a short-term ceiling, where some holders might be looking to take profits. These levels are not arbitrary; they represent points where significant amounts of capital are positioned, making them pivotal for future price movements. A decisive break above $117,000 or below $111,000 could signal the next major trend. For the ambitious Bitcoin price target of $143K to be realized, overcoming these hurdles is paramount. What Does This Mean for Your Bitcoin Price Target Strategy? For investors and enthusiasts alike, the current market dynamics present both challenges and opportunities. While the pre-FOMC lull might test patience, the underlying analyst sentiment suggests a strong potential for upside. Actionable Insights: Monitor FOMC Announcements: Pay close attention to the Federal Reserve’s statements, as they often trigger immediate market reactions. Watch Key Levels: Keep an eye on the $112,000 support and $120,000 resistance levels. A sustained break above the latter could confirm the bullish outlook towards a higher Bitcoin price target . Consider Long-Term Potential: Analysts view this correction as normal, reinforcing the idea of Bitcoin’s resilience and growth potential. This period of consolidation could be a strategic entry or accumulation point for those with a long-term vision. The journey to a new all-time high is rarely a straight line, and these corrections are often part of a healthy market cycle. The Road Ahead: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Potential In conclusion, while Bitcoin is currently experiencing a pre-FOMC lull, the overall sentiment among analysts remains remarkably positive. The potential for BTC to not only recover but to surge past previous highs, possibly reaching a groundbreaking Bitcoin price target of $143,000, is a compelling prospect. This isn’t merely speculation; it’s a forecast supported by on-chain data and expert analysis. As the market navigates these critical junctures, staying informed and understanding the technical and fundamental indicators will be key to making informed decisions. The future of Bitcoin continues to look bright, with significant upside potential on the horizon. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the current outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) before the FOMC meeting? A: Bitcoin is currently in a short-term correction phase, often described as a pre-FOMC lull. Analysts generally view this as a normal market adjustment rather than a trend collapse, with potential for an upside if key support levels hold. Q2: What are the key price levels analysts are watching for Bitcoin? A: Analysts are closely monitoring the $112,000 level as crucial support. A break above $120,000 is seen as a significant resistance breakthrough that could pave the way to a higher Bitcoin price target . Q3: Who are the analysts providing these Bitcoin price target predictions? A: On-chain analyst Ali Martinez and trader Michaël van de Poppe are among those providing insights, with their analyses often reported by outlets like CoinDesk. Glassnode also contributes valuable on-chain data. Q4: What does Glassnode’s data reveal about Bitcoin’s current market? A: Glassnode identifies the current price zone as a key consolidation range. Their data indicates concentrated buying pressure around $111,000 and selling pressure near $117,000, defining the immediate market tug-of-war. Q5: How should investors approach Bitcoin’s current market phase? A: Investors should monitor FOMC announcements, watch key support ($112,000) and resistance ($120,000) levels, and consider the long-term potential.

Truth Social Introduces ‘Truth Predict’ According to a Tuesday press release , Truth Social users will have the opportunity to engage in prediction markets concerning a wide range of topics, including political elections, fluctuations in interest and inflation rates, commodity prices such as gold and crude oil, and events across major sports leagues. The new feature, called “Truth Predict,” provides real-time price updates. This will allow users to respond quickly to current events, similar to Kalshi and Polymarket. The latter is poised to re-enter the US market after receiving regulatory approval . Devin Nunes, Chairman and chief executive officer of Trump Media, expressed enthusiasm about this new collaboration, stating: We are thrilled to become the world’s first publicly traded social media platform to offer our users access to prediction markets. Truth Predict will empower our dedicated users to participate in prediction markets within a trusted framework, leveraging our social media platform to create unique avenues for discussion and comparison of their predictions. Trump Media’s Plan For A New CRO Treasury The event contracts will be provided through CDNA, which ensures a federally compliant method for accessing event contracts and making predictions related to politics, economics, finances, and sports, all integrated with Truth Social’s technology. Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and chief executive officer of Crypto.com, highlighted the potential of prediction markets, stating: Prediction markets are poised to become a multi-deca-billion dollar industry. Crypto.com has rapidly established itself as a trusted provider of prediction market services, and we are excited to collaborate with Truth Social to deliver the world’s first prediction markets accessible through a social media platform. Beta testing for this integration is expected to commence soon on Truth Social, followed by a full launch in the United States. Trump Media plans to expand the service globally once all necessary requirements are fulfilled. In line with this initiative, users of Truth Social and the Truth+ platform who hold Truth gems—earned through engagement on the platforms—will have the option to convert their gems into Crypto.Com’s native token Cronos (CRO), which can then be used to purchase Truth Predict contracts. This collaboration between Trump Media and Crypto.com builds on a recently established strategic partnership to introduce a CRO rewards system across the Truth Social and Truth+ platforms. Additionally, Trump Media Group is set to establish a new CRO-focused digital asset treasury (DAT), following a definitive agreement for a proposed business combination with Yorkville Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC).

Top Expert Forecasts Liquidity Surge With Fed’s QT Shift,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-a-crypto-melt-up-coming-top-expert-forecasts-liquidity-surge-with-feds-qt-shift/,"Market expert VirtualBacon recently suggested that the most significant event for the crypto industry this year is not the Bitcoin (BTC) Halving or the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but rather a potential shift in Federal Reserve (Fed) liquidity policy. After 18 months of tightening measures, the Fed is reportedly preparing to pause its quantitative tightening (QT) and may even initiate stealth quantitative easing (QE) once again. What’s Next For The Crypto Market In a recent post on social media platform X, VirtualBacon laid out a compelling argument linking liquidity pivots to altcoin cycles. In 2019, the Fed halted QT, which resulted in a rally for altcoins. Conversely, in 2022, when the Fed began QT, altcoins peaked. Now, as the Fed is expected to end QT in 2025, VirtualBacon anticipates a similar surge for altcoins. The correlation is clear: when the Fed increases liquidity, altcoins tend to rise. The pressing question now is when exactly QT will come to a close. Related Reading: The Next Chapter For Crypto: Legislative Clarity, Institutional Support Set Stage For Major Growth While the Fed may not explicitly label a shift as QE, the expert notes that the pivotal moment will arrive when they remove the language regarding “reducing the size of the balance sheet.” The last notable instance of this was during the 2019 repo crisis, when banks faced immediate cash shortages, prompting the Fed to inject $75 billion into the financial system. Although Powell claimed it was “not QE,” it effectively was, and following that intervention, Bitcoin tripled in value within months. CME FedWatch Tool Shows High Probability Of Rate Cuts Major financial institutions are already making predictions, with Goldman Sachs stating that the October meeting is the base case for QT to end, Bank of America expecting QT to cease by month-end, and Evercore indicating that the Fed is likely to signal an end to QT this week. The same indicators that caused market disruptions back in 2019 are signaling distress now. Regardless of official statements, it appears QT is nearing its conclusion, with stealth QE on the horizon. This shift would facilitate a return of liquidity to the markets, which historically has driven crypto prices. Liquidity acts as the fuel for market movements, and the Fed is poised to refill this tank. Related Reading: China Intensifies Crypto Crackdown With Latest Warning Against Stablecoins The CME FedWatch tool currently indicates a 96.7% probability of a rate cut this month and an 87.9% chance of another cut in December. Powell recently hinted that QT would conclude “in the coming months,” signaling an imminent pivot. M2 Money Supply Signals Upcoming Bitcoin Surge Despite the current market uncertainty, VirtualBacon asserts that Bitcoin has not reached its peak. Out of 30 historical indicators that typically signal a bull market peak, none have activated yet, with data indicating there is still room for growth. The global M2 money supply continues to rise, which historically leads Bitcoin prices by 10 to 12 weeks. The expert added that since the beginning of the month, this money supply has been increasing. This development indicates that Bitcoin’s next upward movement is already in the pipeline, albeit lagging behind the liquidity curve. Additionally, VirtualBacon forecasts that once the Fed pivots, a new altcoin season may commence.

Addressing Bobby A, he wrote that his colleague was “too focused on the small moves and not seeing the macro rotation that’s coming.” EGRAG CRYPTO linked this anticipated shift to potential global economic developments, referencing a possible “USA–China mega deal” and its impact on asset rotation toward cryptocurrencies. Macro Conditions and Market Cycle Outlook EGRAG CRYPTO’s view extends beyond XRP, touching on monetary policy and historical market behavior . He noted that “QT is still active. Rate cuts are barely starting,” suggesting that the final phase of the current cycle has yet to unfold. He compared present conditions to earlier market environments in 1999 and 2007, which he described as periods when markets surged before eventual declines. While his outlook remains assertive, EGRAG closed his remarks with a call for unity within the XRP community.

According to on-chain analytics platform Santiment, an increase in retail investor dip buying discussions, especially after a minor rebound, could surprisingly signal more downward pressure ahead. This insight challenges the common belief that buying during a downturn is always a smart move. Why Does Retail Investor Dip Buying Often Signal Trouble? Santiment’s analysis points to a fascinating historical pattern. When retail investors become vocal about retail investor dip buying , it has often preceded a short-term market bounce, only to be followed by another, more significant decline. It’s a counter-intuitive observation, suggesting that widespread optimism among individual traders might not be the bullish indicator many assume it to be. The firm emphasizes that the truly opportune buying moments typically emerge when retail investors are least expecting a recovery. This means that if everyone is talking about catching the falling knife, the market might still have more room to fall. Retail traders, according to Santiment, often misjudge the extent of a market correction after an initial drop, only to be surprised by subsequent price action. The Psychology Behind Retail Investor Dip Buying What drives this phenomenon? It largely boils down to market psychology. After an initial price drop, there’s a natural human tendency to look for a bottom. This often manifests as ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) on a potential rebound, leading to premature retail investor dip buying . However, the most significant market rebounds historically occur when optimism has completely evaporated, giving way to widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Consider these points: Premature Optimism: Retail investors often interpret a minor bounce as the start of a full recovery. Emotional Trading: Decisions are influenced by excitement or fear, rather than cold, hard analysis. Lack of Capitulation: True market bottoms are often marked by ‘capitulation,’ where even the most resilient investors give up, leading to extreme FUD. When Are the Real Buying Opportunities for Retail Investors? Santiment suggests that the best times to buy are precisely when the market feels the worst. When the general sentiment shifts from FOMO to intense FUD, and social media is filled with despair rather than discussions of retail investor dip buying , that’s often when the true turning points emerge. These periods of extreme pessimism can present genuine opportunities for long-term investors. How can you navigate these tricky waters? Monitor Sentiment: Pay attention to broader market sentiment indicators, not just price action. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of assets rather than short-term price swings. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Stick to a pre-defined investment strategy. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even during a perceived dip. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any investor. While the allure of retail investor dip buying is strong, especially after a market correction, Santiment’s data provides a valuable counter-narrative. It encourages a more cautious and data-driven approach, rather than simply following the crowd’s enthusiasm. In conclusion, while the idea of ‘buying the dip’ is popular, Santiment’s analysis offers a compelling warning: widespread discussion of retail investor dip buying might actually be a bearish signal. True buying opportunities often arise from deep market pessimism, not from optimistic chatter. By understanding market sentiment and historical patterns, investors can make more informed decisions and potentially avoid falling victim to common pitfalls. Stay vigilant and always conduct your own research! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is ‘dip buying’ in the context of cryptocurrency? Dip buying refers to the strategy of purchasing an asset after its price has dropped, with the expectation that its value will soon rebound. It’s an attempt to buy low and sell high. Why does Santiment believe retail investor dip buying can signal further decline? Santiment’s analysis suggests that when a large number of retail investors are openly discussing and engaging in dip buying, it often indicates premature optimism. Historically, such collective enthusiasm has been followed by a brief rebound and then another, more significant market decline, as the true market bottom has not yet been reached. When is the best time to buy crypto, according to Santiment’s analysis? According to Santiment, the most significant rebounds tend to occur when market optimism (FOMO) has completely shifted to extreme fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). These periods of widespread pessimism, when retail investors are least expecting a recovery, often present the best long-term buying opportunities. How can retail investors avoid common pitfalls associated with dip buying? Retail investors can avoid pitfalls by focusing on long-term fundamentals, diversifying their portfolios, avoiding emotional trading decisions, and paying attention to broader market sentiment rather than just short-term price movements or social media hype. What is the difference between FOMO and FUD in crypto trading? FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is the anxiety that an investor might miss out on a profitable opportunity, often leading to impulsive buying during price surges. FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) refers to negative sentiment and skepticism surrounding an asset, often leading to selling during price drops or extreme market pessimism.

This growing pressure is forcing private banks and asset managers to integrate crypto services into their portfolios. A survey of 3,851 investors and 456 wealth management professionals conducted by Switzerland-based software firm Avaloq during the February-March 2025 period revealed that 39% of high-net-worth individuals in the United Arab Emirates own crypto assets, but only 20% of them invest through a traditional asset manager. Known for its oil wealth, low-tax structure, and foreign investor-friendly environment, the UAE has become one of the world's most important crypto centers, particularly thanks to the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which Dubai established in 2022. Related News: Watch Out: Binance Removes 18 Altcoins from Pre-Listing Pool - They Decided Not to List Them The main reasons for the corporate finance world's shyness away from crypto are technical risks like high volatility, complex technology, and wallet management. According to Avaloq data, the main concerns of UAE investors who don't own crypto are market volatility (38%), lack of knowledge (36%), and distrust of exchanges (32%). With the crypto market rebounding and Bitcoin reaching new record highs, the number of crypto millionaires worldwide has reached 241,700, a 40% increase from last year.

This monumental achievement, as reported by CoinDesk, isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of a significant shift in investor sentiment and a burgeoning demand for regulated cryptocurrency products on a trusted platform like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. What’s Driving the Surge in CME Crypto Futures? What exactly does this record-breaking CME crypto futures open interest signify? Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. When this number rises, it typically indicates new money flowing into the market, suggesting increased participation and a strong conviction among traders. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) holds a unique position in the crypto landscape. It’s a highly regulated and respected financial institution, traditionally catering to institutional investors. The surge in XRP and SOL futures on this platform therefore points to a growing appetite from larger, more traditional financial players who prioritize compliance and security. This influx suggests a maturing market where sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable engaging with digital assets, albeit through regulated avenues. It’s a testament to the evolving perception of cryptocurrencies from speculative assets to legitimate investment vehicles. Why XRP and SOL? Understanding Investor Preference in CME Crypto Futures The focus on XRP and SOL in particular for these record-breaking CME crypto futures is noteworthy. Both cryptocurrencies offer distinct value propositions that appeal to different segments of the market. XRP , associated with Ripple Labs, aims to facilitate fast and low-cost international payments. Its ongoing legal clarity in the U.S. has likely bolstered investor confidence, making it a more attractive option for institutions seeking regulatory certainty. SOL , the native token of the Solana blockchain, is renowned for its high transaction throughput and low fees, making it a favorite for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. Its robust ecosystem continues to attract developers and users, driving demand. The fact that these assets are seeing such significant open interest on CME underscores a strategic move by institutions to gain exposure to these specific blockchain technologies and their underlying utility, rather than purely speculative plays. The Institutional Embrace: Benefits and Future Outlook for CME Crypto Futures The growing institutional interest reflected in the CME crypto futures data brings several significant benefits to the broader cryptocurrency market. Increased Liquidity: More institutional capital typically leads to deeper liquidity, making markets more stable and efficient. Reduced Volatility: Institutional participation can help temper extreme price swings, contributing to a more mature market environment. Legitimacy and Adoption: The endorsement from traditional financial giants through platforms like CME lends greater legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, paving the way for wider mainstream adoption. Looking ahead, this trend suggests a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into traditional finance. We can anticipate more regulated products, clearer guidelines, and a continued influx of sophisticated capital into the crypto space, driving innovation and growth. However, it’s crucial for investors to remember that while institutional interest in CME crypto futures is a positive sign, the crypto market remains dynamic. Due diligence and understanding the underlying assets are always paramount. In conclusion, the record-shattering open interest in XRP and SOL futures on CME is a powerful testament to the accelerating institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. It signals a new era where digital assets are increasingly recognized as viable and valuable components of diversified investment portfolios. This milestone reinforces the growing maturity and legitimacy of the crypto market, promising an exciting future for both seasoned and new investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is “open interest” in crypto futures? Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, like futures or options, that have not yet been settled or closed. A rise in open interest indicates new money entering the market, signaling increased participation and confidence. Why is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) significant for crypto futures? The CME is a highly regulated and respected traditional financial institution. Its involvement in crypto futures provides a regulated, secure platform that attracts institutional investors who prioritize compliance and stability, thereby lending legitimacy to the crypto market. What factors are driving institutional interest in XRP and SOL? XRP benefits from its focus on fast international payments and increasing regulatory clarity. SOL, as the native token of the Solana blockchain, is attractive due to its high transaction speed, low fees, and robust ecosystem for dApps and NFTs. How does increased institutional involvement benefit the crypto market? Institutional involvement typically brings increased liquidity, which can lead to more stable and efficient markets. It also helps reduce volatility and contributes to the broader legitimacy and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Is investing in CME crypto futures the same as buying actual XRP or SOL? No, investing in CME crypto futures is not the same as directly buying the underlying assets. Futures contracts allow investors to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning it. They are derivatives and carry different risks and mechanisms compared to spot market purchases. Did you find this article insightful?

The asset has rebounded by more than 50% since the all-time low registered during the market-wide crash on October 10. Still, it remains 91% down from its all-time high on February 26. In terms of why this substantial PI token surge is taking place today, the answer might lie outside the box. The official news channel of the Pi Network Core Team has only recycled information about the number of verified users, which was already reported days ago. However, Cointelegraph posted about rumors that went live a few days ago, indicating that Pi Network has joined the ISO 20022 race alongside other reputable names such as Ripple and Stellar. Although these speculations are not new, the publicity coming from a big news media could be the catalyst for today’s impressive surge that drove PI above $0.26 once again. Aside from a 16% pump today, the asset is also up by 30% weekly. Nevertheless, the ever-vocal Pi Network community was quick to pick up the price rally and outlined some big predictions. Another X account dedicated to covering PI news with over 45,000 followers said the asset’s chart looks “exceptional and bullish” and compared it to a previous massive surge from SOL. This chart looks exceptional and bullish.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said on Wednesday that the Federal Court granted interim travel restraint orders against Xu, also known as Zijing Xu, on Oct. 20. The orders prohibit him from leaving or attempting to leave Australia until Dec. 20. ASIC sought the restrictions on an ex parte basis, meaning Xu has not yet had the opportunity to respond in court. The matter will return for an inter partes hearing, where all parties can be heard, on October 30. ASIC Probe Targets Blockchain Global’s Failed Exchange and Missing Funds The investigation centers on Blockchain Global’s role in operating the ACX Exchange, a now-defunct crypto platform that allowed customers to buy, sell and store digital assets. The exchange collapsed in late 2019 after users began reporting difficulties accessing their funds. Blockchain Global entered liquidation in Feb. 2022. Liquidators later told ASIC that the firm owed around A$58m ($37.3m) to unsecured creditors as of Oct. 2023. The regulator launched a formal probe into the company and its directors in early 2024. ASIC said it applied for the travel ban over concerns Xu could leave the country while the investigation is ongoing. ASIC Targets Troubled Crypto Firms to Restore Market Credibility The case marks another move by Australian authorities to tighten oversight of failed crypto ventures and recover funds for affected investors. ASIC has previously pursued actions against multiple digital asset firms that collapsed during the sector’s 2019–2022 downturn. Blockchain Global, once a high-profile player in Australia’s blockchain scene, operated several crypto businesses and positioned itself as a bridge between traditional finance and emerging digital markets. Its collapse, however, left creditors and customers facing millions in potential losses. Court Order Keeps Xu in Australia as ASIC Reviews Potential Law Breaches Court documents show that ASIC’s investigation is examining whether company directors breached corporate or financial laws in managing customer funds and maintaining solvency. Xu, a co-founder of Blockchain Global, was one of several executives associated with the exchange. He has not been charged with any criminal offenses, and the court’s current order is a civil measure to ensure his availability for ongoing proceedings.

Recently, a significant development emerged from one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. Binance has announced a crucial Binance delisting event, impacting several spot trading pairs. This move requires immediate attention from traders holding positions in the affected assets. Understanding the Latest Binance Delisting Announcement Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, recently made an announcement that has caught the attention of its user base. The exchange will be delisting three specific spot trading pairs. This means that after a certain date, users will no longer be able to trade these pairs on Binance’s spot market. Affected Pairs: ATA/BTC, LAYER/BNB, and POWR/ETH Delisting Date & Time: October 31, at 3:00 a.m. UTC For traders involved with these particular altcoins, understanding the implications of this Binance delisting is paramount. It signals a shift in available trading options and necessitates prompt action to manage existing holdings. Why Do Crypto Trading Pairs Get Delisted? Exchange delistings, while impactful, are not uncommon in the dynamic crypto space. Binance’s delisting decisions are typically based on a rigorous review process. Several factors can contribute to an exchange deciding to remove a trading pair. Low Liquidity: If a pair consistently has low trading volume, it can lead to poor market depth and slippage for traders. Project Performance: The underlying project’s development, team commitment, and overall market interest play a significant role. A lack of progress or community engagement can be a red flag. Regulatory Changes: Evolving regulatory landscapes can sometimes force exchanges to delist certain assets to remain compliant. User Feedback: Although less common, user sentiment and feedback can also influence these decisions. Ultimately, these actions aim to maintain a healthy and efficient trading environment for the majority of users. While it might be inconvenient for some, it often reflects a strategic move by the exchange to optimize its offerings. Navigating Binance Delisting: What Are Your Options? If you hold any of the assets involved in this Binance delisting , it’s essential to act swiftly and strategically. Ignoring the announcement could lead to challenges in managing your funds later on. Here are your primary options: Sell Your Assets: You can sell your ATA, LAYER, or POWR tokens against their respective quoted assets (BTC, BNB, or ETH) before the delisting deadline. This allows you to convert them into more liquid cryptocurrencies. Withdraw Your Assets: If you prefer to hold onto your tokens, you can withdraw them from Binance to an external wallet that supports the specific cryptocurrency. This gives you full control over your assets. Convert to Other Pairs: While the specific pairs are being delisted, the tokens themselves might still be available for trading against other major cryptocurrencies on Binance, or on other exchanges. Always check the available pairs. Remember, the goal is to avoid being caught off guard. Make sure to complete any necessary actions well before the October 31st deadline to ensure a smooth transition for your portfolio. Beyond the Delisting: Proactive Trading Strategies This particular Binance delisting event serves as a valuable reminder for all cryptocurrency traders about the importance of proactive risk management. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and changes like delistings are part of the landscape. To mitigate future risks: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading investments across various assets reduces exposure to the risks associated with any single project or trading pair. Stay Informed: Regularly check official exchange announcements, project updates, and market news. Subscribing to newsletters and following reputable crypto news sources can keep you ahead. Understand Liquidity: Before investing, always consider a token’s trading volume and market depth. Higher liquidity generally means easier entry and exit points. Have a Contingency Plan: Always know what you would do if one of your holdings faces a delisting or other significant market event. By adopting these strategies, you can better navigate the unpredictable nature of the crypto market and protect your investments. In conclusion, Binance’s upcoming delisting of ATA/BTC, LAYER/BNB, and POWR/ETH spot trading pairs on October 31st is a significant event for affected traders. While such changes are a natural part of the evolving crypto ecosystem, they underscore the need for vigilance and adaptability. By understanding the reasons behind delistings and taking timely action, traders can effectively manage their portfolios and continue to thrive in the dynamic world of digital assets. Stay informed, act decisively, and always prioritize risk management. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does “delisting a spot trading pair” mean? A1: Delisting a spot trading pair means that the exchange will no longer support trading that specific combination of cryptocurrencies (e.g., ATA against BTC) on its spot market. You won’t be able to buy or sell using that pair after the announced date. Q2: Will I lose my funds if my tokens are part of a Binance delisting? A2: No, you will not automatically lose your funds. Binance typically provides ample time for users to either sell their tokens against other available pairs, convert them, or withdraw them to an external wallet. It’s crucial to take action before the delisting deadline. Q3: Can I still trade ATA, LAYER, or POWR tokens on Binance after October 31st? A3: While the specific ATA/BTC, LAYER/BNB, and POWR/ETH pairs will be delisted, the individual tokens (ATA, LAYER, POWR) might still be available for trading against other cryptocurrencies on Binance or other exchanges. You would need to check the available trading pairs for each token after the delisting. Q4: How can I stay informed about future Binance delisting announcements? A4: The best way to stay informed is to regularly check Binance’s official announcements page, follow their official social media channels, and subscribe to reputable cryptocurrency news outlets. Setting up notifications for key exchange updates can also be helpful. Q5: What should I do if I forget to act before the delisting deadline? A5: If you miss the deadline for trading, your funds will typically remain in your Binance wallet. You might still be able to withdraw them, but you won’t be able to trade them on Binance. In such cases, contact Binance customer support for guidance on how to proceed. Found this article helpful? Share these crucial insights with your trading community on social media!

South Korean crypto exchange giant, Upbit, has just made a significant announcement: the official Upbit ENSO listing . This highly anticipated move means that Enso (ENSO) is now available for trading on Upbit’s KRW, BTC, and USDT pairs, starting at 8:00 a.m. UTC today.

Enso (ENSO) is more than just another token; it’s a decentralized protocol designed to optimize on-chain trading strategies.

By aggregating liquidity and routing orders efficiently, Enso seeks to provide a seamless and cost-effective trading experience. The significance of the Upbit ENSO listing cannot be overstated. Upbit is one of the largest and most influential crypto exchanges globally, particularly in the Asian market.

For traders, the Upbit ENSO listing presents fresh avenues for portfolio diversification and potential gains. The availability of ENSO on KRW pairs is particularly crucial, as it allows direct access for Korean investors, who form a substantial part of Upbit’s user base. Furthermore, the BTC and USDT pairs offer flexibility for international traders. It’s essential for traders to understand the immediate implications. New listings often experience significant price volatility due to initial speculative interest.

The Upbit ENSO listing provides an excellent opportunity to dive into a project focused on improving on-chain trading efficiency. What Are the Opportunities and Risks Following the Upbit ENSO Listing? Every new listing brings both opportunities and risks. The opportunity lies in being an early participant in a project that could see significant growth due to increased adoption and liquidity. Enso’s focus on optimizing trades addresses a real need in the DeFi ecosystem, potentially attracting a dedicated user base. However, the risks associated with the Upbit ENSO listing include high price volatility, especially in the initial hours or days. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, and new tokens are often subject to speculative pumps and dumps. Traders should approach with caution, setting clear entry and exit strategies, and never investing more than they can afford to lose. Thorough due diligence is always advisable. In conclusion, the Upbit ENSO listing is a monumental event for the Enso protocol, propelling it onto a global stage with enhanced accessibility and liquidity. For traders, it signifies a new frontier for exploration within the dynamic crypto market. While the opportunities are exciting, a prudent and well-researched approach is crucial to navigate the inherent volatility of new listings.

Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal On Tuesday, the Union of the Right for the Republic (UDR) party, led by Eric Ciotti, was set to introduce a pro-crypto bill in the French Parliament to address three key areas of France’s crypto ecosystem. Gregory Raymond, co-founder of The Big Whale, shared the news on X, noting that this is the first time such comprehensive legislation has been introduced in the country. “This text contains several proposals that the sector has championed for many years, as well as other unprecedented ones,” he stated, noting that it follows the steps of US President Donald Trump, “whose commitment to this issue has helped attract a new electorate that few had previously courted.” According to the post, the main policy proposed a French Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) with the creation of a Public Administrative Establishment (EPA) to diversify foreign exchange reserves and protect the country’s financial sovereignty by building a “national digital gold” reserve. The EPA would be dedicated to holding and managing 2% of the total Bitcoin supply, or 420,000 BTC, within the next 7-8 years. Notably, the strategic reserve would be funded by public Bitcoin mining using surplus nuclear and hydroelectric power. Additionally, the text proposed using systematic retention of BTC seized during legal proceedings, payments of taxes made in Bitcoin, and the allocation of “a quarter of the amounts collected through the Livret A and LDDS savings schemes” for daily BTC purchases on the secondary market to fund the strategic reserve. Crypto Bill Tackles Stablecoins, Industry Support The bill also encourages euro-denominated stablecoins, recognizing these digital assets as a credible alternative to traditional payment systems and proposing key regulations for the sector. Among the proposals, the text suggested a €200 daily cap for euro-pegged stablecoins , which would be exempt from taxation and social contributions. It would also authorize the use of euro-denominated stablecoins for paying taxes. The policy reportedly aims to ease the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) to facilitate the issuance of stablecoins by European banks and companies, a topic recently discussed by the global watchdogs. At the same time, it seeks to oppose the euro-based Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) at the EU Council, which is considered to centralize and pose a threat to financial freedom. Moreover, the proposed legislation also addresses energy and financial barriers, adapting electricity taxation for crypto mining by creating a progressive, dynamic excise duty based on price tiers, experimenting with flexible TURPE tariffs for flexible and adjustable consumer sites, and integrating Bitcoin and other crypto assets into the stock savings plan (PEA) via exchange-traded notes. In his X post, Raymond explained that the proposed bill’s chances of passing are low, as it is an independent legislative proposal unrelated to the Finance Bill currently in the French parliament and was designed without the collaboration of other political parties. “It therefore has little chance of being adopted by the Parliamentary Bureau due to the UDR’s limited weight in the chamber (16 MPs out of 577),” he added. Nonetheless, he affirmed that despite the extremely low probability of advancing, it demonstrates UDR’s “ambition to position itself as the party best able to defend the interests of the French crypto ecosystem.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin reserve|btc|BTCUSDT|European Union|France|France Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|French lawmakers|French National Assembly|French Parliament|SBR|Stablecoins|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-29 07:00:47

Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution Shows Where Resistance & Support Are Strongest In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about where support and resistance levels lie for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). This indicator basically tells us about the total amount of supply that last changed hands at the various price levels that the cryptocurrency has visited in its history. Related Reading: Solana Eyes $210 Before Its Next Major Move—Uptrend Or Fakeout Ahead? Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in this metric over the last few months. As is visible in the graph, the CBD highlights two levels for holding a dense amount of the cryptocurrency’s supply (shaded in red). The lower of these levels is situated near $111,000. A large chunk of buying at this mark occurred during the recent bearish phase in the asset. The other level is located around $117,000, made up of investors who bought during the price rally to the all-time high (ATH). Naturally, these buyers would be underwater right now, while those who purchased at $111,000 would be in profit. Generally, holders are sensitive to retests of their cost basis and can show some kind of reaction during one. Since these two levels host the cost basis of a significant amount of investors, it’s possible that when BTC will revisit them, some panic selling or buying will crop up. Which behavior would be dominant usually comes down to the market mood and the direction of the retest. When the retest occurs from above, investors may choose to buy more, believing the same cost basis level would result in profits again in the future. Similarly, holders who were in loss prior to the retest can react by selling, fearing that the asset will drop again in the future. Considering these effects, the $111,000 may be considered a key support cushion for Bitcoin, while $117,000 a resistance barrier. “This range defines the current battleground between recent buyers and profit-takers,” noted Glassnode. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Returns To Neutral As BTC Breaks $115,000 It now remains to be seen which level BTC will visit next and how its retest will go. “A break in either direction could set the tone for the next major move,” explained the analytics firm. In some other news, the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator has been sitting at cycle lows recently, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. This oscillator is based on the SSR, which compares the Bitcoin circulating supply against the supply of the stablecoins. The SSR Oscillator is sitting at a low level at the moment, which indicates that the BTC supply is low compared to stablecoin liquidity. “Historically, such periods precede stronger bid-side support when market confidence returns,” said the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a retrace toward $113,500 earlier, but the coin has been quick to bounce back as its price has returned to $115,400.

Here’s What XRP Army Should Expect,https://timestabloid.com/the-wait-for-ripple-national-bank-two-days-heres-what-xrp-army-should-expect/,"Ripple’s push to expand its footprint into traditional banking is approaching a decisive point. The company’s 120-day review period for its application to establish the Ripple National Trust Bank (RNTB) ends on October 30, marking a significant moment in Ripple’s regulatory and strategic timeline. Filed on July 2 with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the application aims to create a federally regulated entity headquartered in New York, with Ripple Labs Inc. listed as the sponsoring organization. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a prominent crypto pundit, recently highlighted the approaching October 30 deadline and shared details of the leadership lineup for the proposed bank. The filing, signed by key Ripple executives, proposes the name Ripple National Trust Bank and lists its principal office at 111-119 West 19th Street, Floor 6, New York. Ripple’s 120-day review for its National Bank license ends in 2 days The full leadership lineup for (RNTB): John (Jack) McDonald – President John Zavaglia – Chief Operating & Trust Officer Stuart Alderoty – Chief Legal Officer Timothy Francis Keaney –… pic.twitter.com/CFLClcKRSa — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 28, 2025 Leadership and Strategic Direction The document identifies five key organizers, including John (Jack) McDonald (President), John Zavaglia (Chief Operating and Trust Officer), Stuart Alderoty (Chief Legal Officer), Timothy Francis Keaney (Institutional Strategy), and David Puth (Risk and Global Policy). This group represents a cross-section of Ripple’s leadership and signals the company’s intent to operate within the U.S. banking framework under direct federal oversight. This leadership structure positions Ripple National Trust Bank as an institution to integrate blockchain-based solutions with traditional finance. Potential Benefits for XRP and the Market If approved, Ripple National Trust Bank could play a central role in expanding the utility of XRP by creating regulated on-ramps for financial institutions. The community is excited, and some believe the OCC’s approval could send XRP to $10 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The trust bank would allow Ripple to custody digital assets, process settlements, and facilitate cross-border transactions within a federally supervised structure. Such developments could strengthen institutional confidence in using XRP as a bridge asset for payments and liquidity. Analysts suggest that a national trust bank designation would allow Ripple to streamline operations with fewer state-by-state regulatory barriers. This could accelerate partnerships with major banks and corporations seeking compliance-assured access to blockchain settlement tools. As adoption increases , XRP’s transactional demand could grow, potentially improving its market position. The OCC’s decision, expected shortly after the 120-day review period concludes, may set a precedent for how blockchain companies integrate within the U.S. financial system. The creation of a federally regulated trust bank would represent a major milestone for Ripple and XRP following years of navigating regulatory uncertainty.

After falling over 7% on October 10, Bitcoin has now found strong support at a major upward-sloping trendline. It’s worth noting that this is the same trendline that has held Bitcoin’s upward momentum ever since November 2022. In fact, the last two contact points with this trendline resulted in new all-time highs. So, going by this alone – and considering that another Fed rate cut could be just around the corner – there’s a high likelihood we could see a new ATH in the next few days. That said, given that Bitcoin today is not far from its mid May price (~$112K), speculation is rife about whether the token has lost steam. Bitcoin may need a deeper correction before setting the stage for another rally to new highs. To find out what’s what, we turned to DeepSeek, one of the most powerful AI chatbots out there. It swept through not only real-time price movements and industry updates but also what both big and small crypto analysts are saying across social platforms. DeepSeek was quick to filter out relevant Bitcoin chart analyses. Chief among them was one by @CryptooELITES, who has more than 258K followers on X. The analyst switched to Bitcoin’s weekly chart to show that in March, the token bounced 70% after a successful retest of a breakout from a major resistance line that had held the token down since April 2021. And now, $BTC is once again forming that exact same pattern. According to this analysis, we could see a similar leg-up this time around – remember, history tends to repeat itself – meaning Bitcoin could be headed for the $190K mark in the next few weeks. Exciting, right? After all, this gives you the opportunity to back low-cap altcoins that could ride $BTC’s momentum all the way to the moon. Here are our top three suggestions for the best crypto to buy now ahead of a $BTC rally. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin L2 for Solana-Like Speeds & Web3 Support Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is arguably the most promising way to ride Bitcoin’s upcoming rally – primarily because of its under-the-radar, low-priced nature. Currently in its presale phase, one $HYPER token is available for just $0.013185, and according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , it could soar 1,420% to reach $0.02 by the end of 2026. So, what is Bitcoin Hyper ? It’s a game-changing altcoin building the ‘best-ever’ Layer-2 (L2) solution for Bitcoin. It’ll integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to massively boost Bitcoin’s real-world utility. With this tech, the new L2 will increase Bitcoin’s throughput from the current 7 transactions per second to thousands, as it will use parallel execution – all while lowering costs and maintaining Bitcoin’s native security. Additionally, Hyper’s SVM will enable developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) – something not possible before within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Hyper’s non-custodial canonical bridge will let you convert your Layer-1 Bitcoin into wrapped, L2-compatible tokens, allowing you to seamlessly interact with the SVM-powered Web3 ecosystem. This means you’ll soon be able to access high-speed DeFi trading apps, NFT marketplaces, governance platforms, lending, staking, and gaming dApps, all compatible with $BTC. Get $HYPER tokens and join the Hyper DAO. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Next Potential Dogecoin Eyeing Insane Virality Maxi Doge ($MAXI) gives you a rare opportunity to turn back the clock and ride Dogecoin’s initial pumps. How so? Because Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin – one who’s aggressively building a loyal fleet of HODLers to take revenge on his elder brother. You see, Dogecoin is the reason Maxi had to grow up in loneliness. The OG crypto hogged all the limelight thanks to its fun-loving, celebrity-backed status. However, $MAXI used this setback to hit the gym, bulk up with caffeine shots and protein shakes, and dedicate his life to overthrowing Dogecoin as the best meme coin in the world. To achieve this, Maxi’s developers have reserved a whopping 40% of the total token supply for marketing, including paid PR campaigns, influencer collaborations, and social media blitzes. Plus, based on our $MAXI price prediction , a $100 investment today could potentially turn into $2,100 by the end of 2026, as $MAXI could reach a high of $0.0058 in just a few months. It’s currently available for just $0.0002655. In addition to raw gains, buying $MAXI will also unlock holder-exclusive events such as weekly trading competitions and leaderboard rewards. On top of that, $MAXI plans to partner with futures platforms, aiming for dominance across both CEXs/ DEXs and the derivatives trading market, right alongside his arch-rival $DOGE. Buy $MAXI and ride the new Doge’s pump. 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Viral Meme Coin Ready to Rally Again OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) , Donald Trump’s very own crypto coin, had a breathtaking start. Soon after its launch in the third week of January, it skyrocketed over 2,000% in just a couple of days, riding the popularity of the ‘crypto president’ of the United States. Since then, Trump has consistently rallied for pro-crypto causes. Still, that support has arguably not been reflected in the price of the $TRUMP coin, primarily due to the tariff wars and his somewhat controversial personality. But the token has now found strong support around the $5.3 level, and looks primed for a strong rebound. It’s currently challenging a major downward-sloping resistance line that has been pushing prices lower since February this year. Sure, this is an important resistance level, but given that it has already been tested over six times, there’s a high likelihood of a breakout now. If that happens, we could see a sharp run-up to at least the $24.5 level – a nearly 215% gain from current levels. The most recent fundamental catalysts behind this potential rally include Trump’s pardoning of Binance’s founder CZ and his push to appoint Mike Selig – an openly pro-crypto figure – as the new CFTC lead.

Recap : With Bitcoin rebounding from strong trendline support, now’s the time to load up on low-priced gems like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) before the next big breakout. Disclaimer : Invest in crypto only after doing your own research. The market is highly unpredictable, and none of the above is financial advice.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/comprehensive-report-on-ripples-xrp-current-status-released-does-it-look-healthy-here-are-the-details/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm Messari announced in its Q3 State of the XRP Ledger report that the XRP ecosystem performed strongly in the third quarter and made significant infrastructure improvements for enterprise-level use. According to the report, XRP closed the quarter at $2.85, a 27.2% increase, reaching its all-time high. Its market capitalization reached $170.3 billion, outperforming BTC, ETH, and SOL, which grew by only 13.3% combined during the same period. Messari's report argues that XRP Ledger (XRPL) now has enterprise-grade infrastructure for identity verification, financial compliance, and privacy. This includes storing the parameters of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) via multi-purpose tokens (MPTs), providing privacy protection with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and offering regulatory compliance with KYC/AML-verified access credentials. Messari states that these features will position XRPL for the forefront of corporate finance, DeFi, and asset tokenization. Related News: Nasdaq-Listed Company Moves to Acquire 10 Percent of This Altcoin's Supply The report notes that the tokenized real-world assets (RWA) market has gained significant momentum on XRPL. In the third quarter, RWA market capitalization on XRPL increased by 215% to $364.2 million. This growth was driven by projects such as Ondo Finance's OUSG treasury fund, Guggenheim's digital commercial paper, and tokenized real estate issued by Ctrl Alt. Furthermore, Ripple's dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, rose 34.7% quarter-over-quarter to reach $88.8 million in market capitalization, becoming the largest stablecoin on XRPL. The report, highlighting XRPL's deflationary nature, states that transaction fees are not distributed to validators but are burned directly, reducing the supply. Since the network's inception, 14.2 million XRP (approximately $40.5 million) has been permanently burned. However, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP each month, with unused tokens being locked back into escrow accounts. Messari states that this system will gradually release the remaining 35 billion XRP into circulation. Activity on the XRPL network also accelerated in the third quarter. The average daily transaction count increased by 8.9% to 1.8 million, while the number of daily active addresses increased by 15.4% to 25,300. The number of new addresses increased by a remarkable 46.3% to 447,200. While the total number of addresses has risen to 6.9 million, Messari stated that this data is more reliable than other networks, as the 1 XRP deposit requirement to open an account on XRPL prevents the creation of spam accounts. Looking at transaction types, the most frequently used transactions on XRPL are Payment (value transfer) and OfferCreate (limit order creation). OfferCreate transactions support transaction flow through the order book on XRPL's built-in decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure. This demonstrates that the XRP Ledger is evolving from a mere transfer network to a fully developed ecosystem of on-chain liquidity and financial instruments. *This is not investment advice.

ETH’s Fusaka mainnet activation is expected before the end of the year. After successive activations on Holesky and Sepolia earlier this month, Ethereum’s hard fork activation on Hoodi represents the third and final testnet deployment this year. The Ethereum Foundation previously predicted that Fusaka’s mainnet launch would begin at least 30 days after the Hoodi testing. Fusaka upgrade seeks to expand ETH’s scalability, efficiency, and security Ethereum’s next major upgrade, Fusaka, is now live on the Hoodi network! ✅ Fusaka mainnet activation is scheduled for December 3rd. Fusaka introduces multiple EIPs to improve scalability, strengthen security, and reduce costs. The upgrade will unlock the next phase of rollup… pic.twitter.com/VQkosIouZQ — Consensys.eth (@Consensys) October 28, 2025 Ethereum core developers had also scheduled the hard fork for December 3. The developers announced the launch date of the upgrade in the ACDC #165 developer call. The hard fork was activated on the Holesky testnet on October 1 and on the Sepolia testnet on October 14. Ethereum’s latest hard fork on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is aimed at establishing backend improvements to boost the efficiency, scalability, and security of the largest smart contract blockchain. Fusaka aims to increase ETH’s block gas limit from 30 million to 150 million units, aimed at supporting more transactions. The upgrade also seeks to expand blob capacity and introduce new node security features. Fusaka will also include about a dozen Ethereum Improvement Proposals. The upgrade will primarily include EIP-7594, which introduces Peer Data Availability Sampling, also known as PeerDAS. PeerDAS enables validators to verify large datasets, or blobs, by sampling small portions from peer nodes instead of downloading entire datasets. The upgrade enables validators to survey data blocks rather than full blobs, thereby improving data availability for Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem. The next hard fork follows the audit contest for Fusaka launched by the Ethereum Foundation four weeks ago. The contest offered up to $2 million in rewards for security researchers who detect bugs before the hard fork reaches mainnet. The audit contest, which ran from September 15 through October 13, was hosted on Web3 security platform Sherlock and co-sponsored by Gnosis and Lido. The Ethereum Foundation revealed that the contest also came with 2x rewards multipliers in week one and 1.5x in week two. Ethereum’s last major upgrade, Pectra, was launched approximately six months before the introduction of the Fusaka hard fork. According to bi-weekly core dev calls, Ethereum researchers are already planning the roadmap for the next major protocol upgrade, Glamsterdam. The next hard fork will focus on faster block times and scalability enhancements, including the full EVM Object Format. Tomasz K. Stanczak, the Ethereum Foundation’s co-executive director, previously urged core teams to prioritize the Fusaka hard fork and pause forward-looking debates about Glamsterdam. The Glansterdam upgrade is scheduled for early 2026. In August, Stanczak called for coordination among the Ethereum community to ensure there are no delays to Fusaka. He warned at the time that slippage in coordination was putting deadlines at risk. “I have suggested coordinators a few weeks ago to stop discussing Glamsterdam and focus on the delivery of Fusaka. Maybe sometimes less ACD calls may help with the process? Maybe the future fork calls should not be happening when the current fork testnet timelines are at risk?” – Tomasz Stanczak , Co-Executive Director at the Ethereum Foundation. The Glamsterdam upgrade is expected to include headline items such as enshrined proposer-builder separation (ePBS) at the protocol level—the upgrade blocks level access lists (EIP-7928) on the execution side.

Traders often prioritize speed, while liquidity providers focus on efficient asset allocation and security. Developers, meanwhile, need infrastructure that reduces complexity when building cross-chain tools. The challenge is that many crypto presale projects highlight innovation but struggle to solve the real frictions across DeFi. Mono Protocol enters the scene aiming to address these barriers through a modular, chain-abstracted approach that’s already drawing strong engagement in its ongoing presale. How Mono Protocol’s ecosystem solves DeFi pain points The 2025 crypto presale market features countless projects, yet few focus on solving structural DeFi challenges. Mono Protocol takes a different path, offering infrastructure-level solutions to unify the blockchain ecosystem. One of the biggest issues users face is multi-chain fragmentation. Assets are scattered across networks, making transfers inefficient. Mono Protocol simplifies this by offering seamless asset management across chains. Bridging is another pain point. Long wait times and high fees often make moving tokens between networks inconvenient. Through its integrated infrastructure, Mono Protocol reduces those inefficiencies, ensuring faster and more reliable execution. It also addresses MEV exploitation, a problem that frequently causes value loss for traders. Mono Protocol’s architecture is designed to minimize these vulnerabilities, protecting users from front-running and sandwich attacks. Finally, developers benefit from simplified tools that reduce the need for complex infrastructure, helping them deploy and scale cross-chain applications more efficiently. Together, these solutions position Mono Protocol as one of the few crypto presales solving practical problems rather than just introducing another token. Momentum builds as Stage 15 nears completion Momentum is often an indicator of strong market confidence in a presale’s long-term potential. Mono Protocol’s Stage 15 demonstrates this clearly. This stage prices tokens at $0.0450, ahead of a planned launch price of $0.500, offering early participants a significant advantage. The consistent participation from both retail and institutional investors suggests growing confidence in Mono Protocol’s model and its long-term utility. What’s notable is the inclusivity of the presale. Participants can use over 200 different assets to purchase tokens, lowering entry barriers for users from ecosystems such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. This flexibility highlights Mono Protocol’s focus on accessibility — a feature many competing presales overlook. Mono Protocol is gearing up for a major phase of development with three key events ahead. The Smart Contract Audit begins on October 30, ensuring transparency and system reliability. Next, the Launch Beta kicks off on November 7, allowing users to explore and test the platform’s new features. Finally, on November 13, the CEO Announcement and AMA will connect the team with the community to share exciting updates and upcoming plans.

The Reward Hub isn’t just about earning, it’s about being part of a collective vision for a unified Web3. Start today and experience how interaction becomes innovation within Mono Protocol’s ecosystem. Web3 integrations strengthening cross-chain infrastructure Mono Protocol’s vision extends beyond token sales. Its partnerships with key Web3 players form the foundation of its interoperability network. The first is LI.FI, a leading cross-chain bridge aggregator. Through this integration, Mono Protocol ensures smoother asset transfers and better liquidity aggregation across blockchains. The second is Celestia, which brings modular scalability. By separating consensus and data availability layers, it allows Mono Protocol to scale operations without compromising decentralization. Lastly, Chainlink integration adds secure and verifiable oracle data, ensuring accurate on-chain information for pricing and execution. Together, these integrations create a foundation that combines performance, security, and decentralization — elements critical for sustainable Web3 growth. Why Mono Protocol stands out in 2025’s presale market While many crypto presales rely on hype, Mono Protocol focuses on function. It directly addresses real issues that limit DeFi’s accessibility and scalability, creating infrastructure-level value that goes beyond speculation. With Stage 14 raised $2.6M, the project’s steady progress and technical depth suggest strong alignment between market demand and real-world application. Its integrations with LI.FI, Celestia, and Chainlink add credibility to its mission of making DeFi and Web3 development more efficient, secure, and connected. For anyone tracking the 2025 presale landscape, Mono Protocol stands out not for promises of quick returns, but for its potential to reshape how blockchain ecosystems communicate and transact.

Backed by industry giants Bitfinex and Tether, Stable is set to launch the second phase of its Stable pre-deposit campaign next week. This eagerly awaited phase aims to address key community concerns and foster a more inclusive environment for all participants. What’s Next for the Stable Pre-Deposit Campaign? Stable’s initial pre-deposit phase demonstrated immense demand, filling its $825 million cap in a mere 10 minutes. This unprecedented rush, while showcasing strong interest, also sparked discussions about equitable access. Now, Stable is taking proactive steps to ensure broader participation in its upcoming second phase. Launch Date: The second phase of the Stable pre-deposit campaign is scheduled to go live next week. Deposit Limits: New per-wallet deposit limits will be introduced. This crucial measure prevents a small number of large investors, often called “whales,” from dominating the entire deposit pool. Individual Wallet Requirements: Strict individual wallet requirements will be implemented. These measures aim to verify participants and further deter concentrated ownership. The project’s goal is clear: to distribute deposit opportunities more widely across its community, laying a foundation for a truly decentralized and robust ecosystem. Why is Fair Access So Crucial for Stable’s Future? The rapid conclusion of Phase 1 led to community speculation regarding potential insider advantages. Such concerns, if unaddressed, can undermine trust and hinder the long-term adoption of any blockchain project. Stable’s response to these challenges is vital for its credibility and sustained growth. Ensuring fair access and preventing concentration of power are fundamental principles in the blockchain space. When a few entities control a significant portion of a network’s assets, it can compromise decentralization and introduce vulnerabilities. Therefore, the strategic design of this Stable pre-deposit campaign phase is not just about fundraising; it is about building a trustworthy and resilient platform from the ground up. Learning from Phase 1: An Unprecedented Demand The first phase of Stable’s pre-deposit campaign was nothing short of extraordinary. The swiftness with which the $825 million deposit cap was met highlighted the market’s strong appetite for a stablecoin-focused Layer 1 blockchain. This overwhelming demand, however, also served as a critical learning experience for the Stable team. The community’s swift reaction and subsequent discussions provided valuable insights into participant expectations. By listening to feedback and adapting its strategy, Stable demonstrates a commitment to transparency and community engagement, which are essential for long-term success in the competitive crypto landscape. This iterative approach helps refine the Stable pre-deposit campaign for optimal outcomes. How Does Stable Ensure an Equitable Deposit Process? Stable’s leadership understands the importance of a balanced approach. The new mechanisms for Phase 2 are designed to foster broad participation while maintaining security and efficiency. These measures are a direct response to the lessons learned from the initial rush. Preventing Whale Domination: By setting per-wallet deposit limits, Stable actively discourages a few large players from cornering the market. This promotes a more diverse set of early adopters. Enhancing Community Trust: Individual wallet requirements help ensure that deposits come from genuine community members, reducing the likelihood of unfair practices and fostering greater confidence in the project’s integrity. Building a Stronger Foundation: A wider distribution of early deposits contributes to a more decentralized network from day one. This strengthens the network’s resilience and aligns with the core ethos of blockchain technology. For potential participants, this means a more level playing field. It encourages a broader range of individuals to get involved, ensuring that the Stable pre-deposit campaign genuinely reflects community interest rather than just institutional capital. The upcoming launch of Phase 2 for Stable’s pre-deposit campaign marks a pivotal moment for the Layer 1 blockchain. By implementing thoughtful limits and requirements, Stable is not only managing demand but also reinforcing its commitment to fairness and decentralization. This strategic move aims to build a more robust, community-driven ecosystem, setting a strong precedent for future blockchain initiatives. The success of this Stable pre-deposit campaign will be a testament to its dedication to its community and its vision for a stablecoin-centric future. Frequently Asked Questions about Stable’s Pre-Deposit Campaign Q1: What is Stable’s pre-deposit campaign?

A2: The second phase is being launched to address concerns about fair access after the first phase filled its cap very quickly. It introduces per-wallet limits and individual wallet requirements to ensure broader community participation and prevent whale domination. Q3: How will Phase 2 of the Stable pre-deposit campaign prevent whale wallets from dominating? A3: Phase 2 will implement per-wallet deposit limits, meaning each participating wallet can only deposit a certain amount.

A5: Stable is a Layer 1 blockchain focused on stablecoins, and it is led by prominent industry entities Bitfinex and Tether, known for their significant presence in the cryptocurrency market. Q6: Why is fair access important for a blockchain project like Stable? A6: Fair access is crucial for decentralization, community trust, and the long-term health of a blockchain. It prevents power concentration, reduces manipulation risks, and fosters a more robust and resilient ecosystem where many stakeholders have a voice.

A recent incident in South Korea serves as a stark reminder, where a group accused of orchestrating a massive crypto scam has been referred to prosecutors. This alleged fraud, totaling 5.8 billion won (approximately $4.3 million), highlights the crucial need for vigilance among investors. Unpacking the Deception: How This Crypto Scam Unfolded According to reports from YTN, the accused group allegedly defrauded 27 unsuspecting investors through a series of elaborate tactics. Their scheme was not just about empty promises; it involved sophisticated manipulation designed to exploit trust and greed. Understanding these methods is key to recognizing potential red flags in the future. Price Manipulation: The ring reportedly manipulated the prices of certain digital coins, creating an artificial sense of value and growth. This tactic makes an investment seem more attractive than it truly is. False Exchange Listings: A major part of their deception involved falsely claiming that specific tokens would soon be listed on prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. Such listings typically lead to price surges, making these claims highly enticing to investors. Guaranteed Returns: Luring victims with promises of large, guaranteed returns on coins that the group personally vouched for was another core element. In the volatile crypto market, “guaranteed returns” are often a tell-tale sign of a scam. These methods collectively created a compelling illusion of a lucrative, low-risk investment, ultimately leading to significant financial losses for the victims. Who Were the Victims of This Massive Crypto Scam ? The scale of this operation is considerable, impacting 27 individual investors who collectively lost millions. Each victim likely had hopes of financial growth, only to face the harsh reality of fraud. This incident underscores that even experienced individuals can fall prey to well-crafted schemes, especially when promises of quick wealth are involved. It’s a sobering reminder that the allure of rapid profits can sometimes overshadow critical due diligence. The referral of this group to prosecutors marks a significant step towards justice for those affected by this devastating crypto scam . Why Do These Crypto Scams Continue to Thrive? Despite increasing awareness, crypto scams unfortunately persist. Several factors contribute to their prevalence in the digital asset space: Market Volatility and Hype: The inherent volatility of the crypto market, combined with periods of intense hype, creates an environment ripe for exploitation. Investors eager for quick gains can become less cautious. Complexity and Information Asymmetry: Cryptocurrencies can be complex, and not all investors fully understand the underlying technology or market dynamics. Scammers leverage this knowledge gap. Regulatory Gaps: While regulations are evolving, the decentralized nature of crypto often means there are still gaps that fraudsters can exploit, especially across international borders. Anonymity: The pseudo-anonymous nature of some blockchain transactions can make it challenging to trace funds and identify perpetrators, emboldening criminals. Understanding these contributing factors is the first step in building a stronger defense against such fraudulent activities. Protecting Yourself: Actionable Insights Against Crypto Scams In a landscape where sophisticated fraud like this $4.3 million crypto scam can occur, proactive measures are essential. Here are vital steps you can take to safeguard your investments: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly investigate any project or token before investing. Look for whitepapers, team backgrounds, community sentiment, and genuine utility. Be Skeptical of “Guaranteed Returns”: No legitimate investment, especially in crypto, can promise guaranteed high returns. If it sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Verify Exchange Listings: Always check official exchange announcements directly on their websites, not through third-party claims or unofficial channels. Understand the Risks: Acknowledge that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Seek Independent Advice: If unsure, consult with a trusted financial advisor who understands the crypto market. By adopting a cautious and informed approach, investors can significantly reduce their vulnerability to fraudulent schemes. The Road Ahead: Legal Action and Investor Vigilance The referral of this group to South Korean prosecutors signals a commitment to tackling financial crime in the crypto sector. Legal actions like this are crucial not only for seeking justice for victims but also for deterring future fraudsters. However, legal processes can be lengthy and complex. Ultimately, the best defense against a crypto scam remains an educated and vigilant investor community. Staying informed about common scam tactics and adhering to best practices for digital asset security are paramount for navigating the evolving cryptocurrency landscape safely. This incident in South Korea serves as a powerful cautionary tale, reminding us that while the crypto market offers innovation, it also demands unwavering caution. Protecting your digital assets starts with awareness, thorough research, and a healthy dose of skepticism towards promises that seem too good to be true. Let this serve as a crucial lesson for all participants in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Crypto Scams Q1: What exactly is a crypto scam? A crypto scam is a fraudulent scheme designed to trick individuals into investing in fake cryptocurrencies, projects, or platforms, often with promises of high, guaranteed returns, leading to financial loss for the victims. Q2: How can I identify a potential crypto scam? Look for red flags such as guaranteed high returns, pressure to invest quickly, anonymous teams, vague project details, unofficial communication channels, and claims of exclusive access or listings that cannot be verified. Q3: What should I do if I suspect a crypto scam? If you suspect a scam, do not invest. If you have already invested, stop all communication with the perpetrators, gather all evidence, and report the incident to relevant financial authorities or law enforcement in your region. Q4: Are all cryptocurrencies risky investments? All investments carry some level of risk, and cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility. However, legitimate projects differ significantly from scams. Thorough research and understanding the inherent risks are crucial for any crypto investment. Q5: How can regulators help prevent crypto scams? Regulators play a vital role by establishing clear guidelines, enforcing anti-fraud laws, prosecuting offenders, and educating the public about the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. International cooperation is also key to tackling cross-border scams. Stay informed and help protect others in the crypto community!

According to Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg Intelligence, BSOL generated around $56 million in first-day trading volume, making it the most active newly launched ETF of 2025, he said in an X post on October 28. The fund was seeded with roughly $220 million; had the entire amount been deployed, trading volume could have approached $280 million, surpassing the debut of the Ethereum-based ETF. Final tally of Day One trading.. $BSOL : $56m $HBR : $8m $LTCC : $1m I can't believe how close I came. ETF sixth sense for the win. Wish there was a @Polymarket for this I'd be rich. https://t.co/TODOk13WUt — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 28, 2025 Alongside the strong volume, BSOL attracted about $222.8 million in assets on its first day. Balchunas described the launch as “unusually large for a crypto ETF debut,” noting that such flows suggest institutional investors are growing more comfortable with staking exposure. Notably, the fund offers exposure to Solana ( SOL ) and provides an estimated 7% annual yield derived from staking rewards on the Solana blockchain. BSOL is also notable as the first U.S.-approved ETF tied to Solana. Two other ETFs launched on the same day, the HBR ( Hedera spot ETF) and LTCC ( Litecoin spot ETF), recorded significantly lower first-day trading volumes of about $8 million and $1 million, respectively. Solana price analysis Meanwhile, despite BSOL’s strong debut, Solana’s price slipped nearly 3% over the past 24 hours to around $195 at press time, though it remains up 6% on the week. Analysts suggest the decline may reflect a long squeeze between holders and leveraged traders, a bearish sign that the ETF’s success hasn’t yet lifted broader market sentiment. Still, if institutional inflows persist, Solana could reclaim the $200 level, opening the path toward a potential move to $250.

53771369,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/ai-gaming-and-defi-7-trending-cryptos-leading-november-2025,1761723847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/53771369.jpeg,"AI, Gaming, and DeFi: 7 Trending Cryptos Leading November 2025",https://bitzo.com/2025/10/ai-gaming-and-defi-7-trending-cryptos-leading-november-2025,"While the broader market faces renewed volatility, certain sectors — particularly AI, gaming, and infrastructure — continue to shape crypto’s narrative heading into the final stretch of 2025. Some projects are defining new use cases, while others are feeling the weight of market corrections. Here are seven trending tokens to watch this November. 1. TRUE World ($TRUE) — A Real-World Revenue Engine in Web3 Gaming TRUE World by TRUE LABS has become one of the most discussed listings of 2025 — and for good reason. It’s the first-ever gaming utility token backed by a functioning gaming business with verified revenue and millions of active players. Unlike hype-driven GameFi tokens, $TRUE connects in-game activity directly to token utility and value circulation. The TRUE ecosystem operates on a positive economic loop: player engagement fuels platform revenue, a share of which flows back into buybacks and burn mechanics that sustain deflationary pressure. $TRUE also serves as the core currency for gameplay boosts, NFTs, staking, governance, and exclusive tournament access. With listings on major exchanges expected before year-end, TRUE represents a new model for Web3 sustainability — one built not on speculation, but on measurable product usage and real cash flow. Watch for official announcements at x.com/TRUExWorld 2. Story (IP) — Cultural Web3 Faces Its Toughest Quarter The digital culture and IP market continues to feel the chill. Story (IP), the token linked to creative ownership and entertainment assets, has fallen 35,7% this week. The decline mirrors reduced engagement in cultural Web3 projects, which depend heavily on community participation and brand collaborations. However, Story’s concept — tokenizing narrative and entertainment IP — remains compelling. If speculative capital rotates back toward creative assets, the project could see a 50% rebound, potentially targeting US$ 8,15. 3. Aptos (APT) — Strong Tech, Weak Market Even with ongoing technical upgrades and ecosystem expansion, Aptos (APT) saw a 35,2% drop as traders cut exposure to emerging blockchains. The correction appears more macro-driven than project-specific. Analysts note that if capital flows return to Tier-1 chains, APT could rebound above US$ 4,80, supported by its high-performance Layer-1 infrastructure and increasing DeFi integrations. 4. Aster (ASTER) — Interoperability Needs a Catalyst Aster (ASTER), a cross-chain interoperability network, was hit hard by risk aversion and capital rotation away from Asian altcoins, sliding 32,3%. The project’s fundamentals remain sound, but market appetite for mid-cap interoperability plays has thinned. Should Bitcoin stabilize and overall sentiment improve, Aster could rebound toward US$ 1,70, driven by renewed cross-chain activity and DeFi collaborations. 5. Pump.fun (PUMP) — Meme Season Ends (For Now) The summer euphoria around Pump.fun (PUMP), a leading meme-token platform, has cooled rapidly. Its 31,1% weekly decline highlights the volatility of narrative-driven assets. Still, history shows that when sentiment flips risk-on again, meme tokens often lead the initial bounce. A technical rebound toward US$ 0,0053 remains possible — though sustainability will depend on developer support and on-chain user retention. 6. Internet Computer (ICP) — Innovation Outpaced by Market Cycles Despite its impressive decentralized computing framework, Internet Computer (ICP) slipped 30,9%, pressured by thin liquidity and a lack of fresh catalysts. The project’s fundamentals — scalable smart contracts and Web-speed execution — remain intact, but investor focus has shifted toward liquid, high-turnover assets. With renewed optimism, ICP could revisit the US$ 4,40–4,50 range, provided developer activity and ecosystem growth regain visibility. 7. Sei (SEI) — Trading Blockchain Mirrors Volume Decline Sei (SEI), built for high-speed trading and low-latency DeFi, has declined 29,9% amid shrinking global trading volumes. The pullback reflects risk-off sentiment rather than technical flaws. If on-chain activity and DEX liquidity improve, SEI could recover to US$ 0,29. Its strong developer community and focus on orderbook performance keep it relevant within the infrastructure niche. Trending Cryptos in November 2025 Token Sector Notable Catalyst TRUE World ($TRUE) Web3 Gaming / GameFi Real-revenue Gaming ecosystem; buy-and-burn model Story (IP) Cultural Web3 / Entertainment Brand partnerships, new releases Aptos (APT) Layer-1 Blockchain Return of Tier-1 liquidity flows Aster (ASTER) Interoperability / Cross-Chain Risk-on recovery; Asian market strength Pump.fun (PUMP) Meme / Social Tokens Meme rebound in speculative phases Internet Computer (ICP) Decentralized Computing Renewed developer activity Sei (SEI) High-Speed DeFi Infrastructure Rising on-chain trading volume Final Take November 2025 underlines a market rotation: tokens with real-world backing, utility, or infrastructure use cases are holding narrative strength, while speculative assets face sharper pullbacks. In this environment, TRUE World stands out as the most structurally innovative listing — combining sustainable tokenomics, deflationary mechanics, and a working business engine.

53771393,616076,1761723861,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53771393.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction Ahead of FOMC Rate Cut: Is a Breakout Ahead for Top Altcoins Like $BEST?,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-prediction-ahead-of-fomc-rate-cut-best-crypto-to-buy/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Taking advantage of the renewed risk-on sentiment in the crypto market, $XRP has recorded a 9.45% surge on the weekly chart – outperforming $BTC and $ETH. 2⃣ It’s too early to tell whether $XRP can sustain the momentum, however, as derivatives market data and technical indicators give mixed signals. 3⃣ Meanwhile, the Best Wallet Token presale is approaching $17M, as investors pivot to early-stage infrastructure projects to offset losses from the October 10 deleveraging event. $XRP is one of the best performers among heavy-cap cryptos this week. For context, $BTC has surged 5% over the past seven days, while $ETH is up 4.5% . Considering the previous weeks’ bloodbath, the trend paints an optimistic picture for the market, but their gains pale in comparison to $XRP’s 9.45% . The cross-border remittance token has managed a steady climb for most of the week, briefly touching $2.69 before retracing slightly. Keeping up with the spot market’s energy, the derivatives market has also perked up, as open interest (OI) crosses $4.5B . But How Strong is the Rally? Multiple factors indicate that $XRP’s recent surge might be short-lived. It could be a while before it reclaims its all-time high of $3.65, since the rise in open interest could swing either way. For instance, the OI-weighted funding rate has declined, revealing that confidence in $XRP will be fragile in the absence of a significant broader market shift. Short positions likely anticipate another test of the key support level at $2.18. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is now at 51, while the current price is just slightly below the 50-day exponential moving average of 2.6852 , further indicating that the recent rally is slowing down. However, investors are awaiting a potential Fed rate cut on Wednesday, which could channel more capital into top altcoins . That partly explains the renewed activity in the derivatives market, which dropped to $3.49B on October 19 – its lowest point since late April. With the US and China set to discuss trade frictions and the Fed rate cut looking increasingly likely , $XRP could soon capitalize on the return of risk appetite and head for $3. Despite the crypto market simmering in uncertainty since October 10, a new crypto infrastructure coin has been attracting steady investor traction. The Best Wallet Token presale is making its way toward $17M, defying broader market trends. It’s not only retail investors who are contributing to that presale tally – whales have also being buying in. In fact, just a few hours ago, a hefty whale buy of $33.16K was recorded. Backed by a non-custodial wallet that boasts hundreds of thousands of downloads on iOS and Android devices, it’s clearly not just the token’s low presale price that’s drawing interest. Is Best Wallet Token the Next Crypto to Explode? Companies like Strategy continue to buy the crypto dip , as the market is entering a promising phase supported by friendlier regulations. While institutional giants can afford to buy $BTC and $XRP for a fortune, retail investors are playing a completely different game. For them, the smarter bets are emerging coins with much lower market caps. Not just any new coin, but those backed by promising projects. Smart investors are exercising this strategy while curating their portfolios ahead of the next crypto super cycle, likely to begin in November. This reallocation is behind the growing interest in the Best Wallet Token presale , which powers the Best Wallet ecosystem. Best Wallet Targets 40% Market Share by 2026 The project is on a mission to capture 40% of the global crypto wallet market share by 2026. It’s an ambitious target but not one that is far-fetched, considering the Best Wallet app is: Non-custodial and thus offers holders complete control over their private keys, staying true to the crypto market’s founding principle of financial freedom without middlemen. Multi-chain and flexible, letting users transfer assets across top blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain (50+ more will be added in the coming phases). Secured with Fireblocks’ MPC techology. Part of an extended ecosystem that offers features like cross-chain swaps, presale access, and – down the line – an everyday crypto shopping card. $BEST tokens play a key role in fueling this ecosystem, which looks beyond crypto storage and towards driving retail crypto adoption. For holders, it unlocks privileges like early access to vetted presales, lower fees, higher staking rewards, and voting rights. Being anchored to a thriving ecosystem with a growing user base, the token is expected to take off following its upcoming launch, making the current presale deal too good to ignore. But more importantly, organic demand could underpin the token’s value during volatile periods. Our Best Wallet Token price prediction sees the price potentially climbing to $0.62 during the course of next year, and reaching $0.82 by 2030. For early investors who buy the token at $0.025865 in the current presale phase and grab the 79% staking APY, that leaves room for jaw-dropping returns. Thinking of investing in $BEST? Take a look at our step-by-step guide to buying the Best Wallet Token before heading to the official presale website. Being a presale, however, the price rises in stages, while the staking APY lowers as more holders join the staking pool. And the next price surge is just a day away. So be sure to join the Best Wallet Token presale today to lock in the best deal . As always, do your own research before investing in crypto. This is not financial advice.

Stocks across the globe are smashing records as three big events collide; Trump’s return to the trade spotlight, Nvidia’s monster run, and Jerome Powell’s next move. U.S. stock futures barely moved Tuesday night, but it didn’t matter. The damage was already done during the day. The S&P 500 climbed 0.2% and broke above 6,900 intraday for the first time, inching toward 7,000. The Dow Jones added 162 points, up 0.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite led the charge with a 0.8% jump. After-hours, Dow futures fell by 33 points, or 0.07%. The S&P 500 stayed flat. Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up 0.02%. Asia rallies as Nvidia lifts chips, but Japan’s rally is razor thin Nvidia surged nearly 2% in overnight trading. The chipmaker hit a fresh record above $204, as reported by Cryptopolitan. This comes during an AI-fueled market surge, pushing Nvidia further into global spotlight. But Japan’s massive rally is starting to look top-heavy. The Nikkei 225 spiked 2.17%, closing at 51,307.65, a new record. But here’s the catch—only 43 stocks in the index moved higher, according to Bloomberg. That’s the fewest number of gainers seen during a +1.7% rally. Most of the move came from two names: Advantest Corp. and SoftBank. Advantest soared to its limit after raising its earnings outlook. The AI-chip test equipment maker, along with SoftBank, added 7,100 yen to the Nikkei this year, which is 60% of the index’s gain. The NT ratio, which compares Nikkei to the broader Topix, hit a record high, underlining just how concentrated this move is. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.76%, lifted by techs, while the Kosdaq slipped 0.28%. In China, the Shanghai Composite rose 0.69% to 4,015.83 and CSI 300 was up roughly 1%. Hong Kong was offline for holidays. In India, the Nifty 50 rose 0.50% to 26,064.70. Australia’s ASX 200 dropped 0.96% after consumer prices for Q3 came in at 3.2%, well above the 3% forecast. It’s the biggest gain in more than a year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. Bitcoin stalls, Europe cautious, Powell and earnings dominate Bitcoin is sitting just above $113,000, trying to escape the range it’s been stuck in. It bounced from $107,000 after Spot ETF netflows finally turned positive. But inflows are still weak at less than 1,000 BTC/day, way below the 2,500+ BTC/day seen during previous rallies. The $111K level is holding as support, while $117K has turned into a wall of sellers. The all-time high is over $125,000, hit a few weeks ago. Over in the currency world, dollar-yen option volume is drying up. Data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation shows Monday’s volume was the lowest this month, and Tuesday didn’t do much better. Traders are sitting on their hands, waiting for the Bank of Japan’s decision Thursday, and of course, the Fed’s announcement later today. Europe is nervous. European stocks are set to open in the red. FTSE is just under flat, Germany’s DAX seen down 0.4%, France’s CAC 40 off 0.16%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB dipping 0.12%, according to data from IG. Investors are all watching for Powell’s tone. The CNBC Fed Survey says 84% of traders expect another cut in December, and 54% see a third one in January. They’re pricing in a total of 100 basis points of cuts by the end of 2026, which would drop the Fed funds rate to 3.2%. Earnings season is stacked. Big Tech is on deck—Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are reporting after today’s close. Apple and Amazon follow tomorrow. Europe’s corporate calendar is just as loaded: Airbus, UBS, Banco Santander, Equinor, Deutsche Bank, BASF, Adidas, GSK, and Endesa will all release earnings Thursday. On top of that, Spain will publish its GDP data.

Clapp was built to remove that friction. By combining crypto portfolio management, fiat access, and secure storage in a single platform, it turns digital asset investing into a more structured, intuitive experience. A Unified Platform for Modern Investors Clapp.finance is a complete crypto management app that lets users buy, sell, and swap digital assets, manage portfolios, and withdraw directly to fiat — all under one regulated umbrella. For European users, the app supports direct EUR conversions and SEPA withdrawals, bridging the gap between crypto and traditional finance. It’s a clean, integrated solution for investors who want control and simplicity without switching platforms. Rich Asset Selection and Custom Portfolios Clapp supports a broad range of DeFi and CeFi tokens, giving users exposure to multiple market sectors. Its tailored portfolio options help investors diversify easily: Conservative Portfolio – Lower volatility, long-term assets. Moderate Portfolio – Balanced mix of blue chips and mid-cap tokens. Risky Portfolio – High-growth, high-risk exposure. AI & Big Data Portfolio – Tokens tied to the artificial intelligence economy. CEX Token Portfolio – Focused on centralized exchange coins. RWA Portfolio – Real-world-asset tokens bridging blockchain and traditional finance. Users can adopt these curated sets or build custom portfolios from scratch, adjusting allocations to match their personal strategy. Actionable Insights and Smart Tools What sets Clapp apart is how it turns data into decisions. Each portfolio includes real-time tracking of growth, profitability, and asset distribution, eliminating the need for spreadsheets or third-party trackers. The built-in Time Machine feature adds another layer of intelligence. It lets investors backtest portfolios against historical data and even simulate how regular rebalancing could have affected performance. This allows users to refine strategies safely before committing capital — a feature typically reserved for professional asset managers. Automation With Full Control Clapp’s smart rebalancing system keeps portfolios aligned automatically. As markets move, the app adjusts holdings to maintain the target mix. Unlike rigid robo-advisors, however, Clapp’s automation is flexible — users can rebalance manually, change weights, or pause automation anytime. It’s the ideal balance between guidance and autonomy: investors stay in control, but the system handles the heavy lifting. Secure and Regulated by Design Security and compliance are baked into Clapp’s infrastructure. All assets are protected through Fireblocks, a leading institutional custody solution used by major financial institutions. Clapp is also a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic and is expanding its regulatory footprint in Dubai, Slovakia, El Salvador, and Mauritius. This multi-jurisdiction approach shows a long-term focus on compliance — a quality still rare among consumer crypto platforms. Seamless Fiat Access Unlike most portfolio apps that end at analytics, Clapp integrates fiat on/off-ramps directly into its ecosystem. Users can convert crypto to euros (or vice versa) and withdraw through SEPA transfers without relying on third-party exchanges. This bridge between digital and traditional finance turns Clapp into more than a portfolio tracker — it’s a practical tool for managing real-world liquidity.

BTC and Ethereum top buy lists for their proven stability in the market, but one new name is starting to gain attention as a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been named one of the fastest growing altcoins in 2025. This DeFi crypto is still available cheap in presale at $0.035. The presale has seen strong attention, selling out 5 stages faster than predicted. Stage 6 is now live and nearly complete as FOMO reaches new highs. With its Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending mechanism, Mutuum Finance provides early investors an opportunity to be a part of a next-generation DeFi protocol with a lot of upside potential. As Bitcoin and Ethereum spearhead the general rally, astute traders are taking Mutuum Finance. MUTM is now being referred to as a high-potential point of entry for their portfolios, a top crypto to watch out for before the next bull wave really sets in. Bitcoin Defies Major Levels as Traders Wait for Fed Action and Bullish Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) is demonstrating incredible strength. BTC is still past support at the 61.8% Fibonacci level of $113,231. This is despite a bearish MACD crossover. With firm buying interest at pivot points and RSI at neutral 48.22, Bitcoin is set for a possible breakout above $114,000. The move can fuel the next wave of bullish momentum. While BTC remains at the center of news as the bellwether of the market, wise investors are also looking for promising early-stage projects with greater short-term potential. Among them is presale DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM), quickly gaining popularity and attracting those in search of the next high-flying cryptocurrency. Ethereum (ETH) Remains in Support Trendline, $4,800 Resistance in Sight Ethereum (ETH) remains firm as it continues to maintain its upper-hand support trendline on the daily chart, now having been probed seven times and left intact, indicating continuing buyer support. ETH needs to hold price above this trendline to maintain its climb. A strong run from here could lead us to the $4800 level. This is the zone where ETH was rejected before its fall. More rallies past here would see the altcoin reaching new highs above $5000. While ETH bulls aim to push higher, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking over in presale as a hot buy. The altcoin is still undervalued at just $0.035, but analysts see strong potential ahead. Mutuum Finance Aims to Reshape DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to be the next big DeFi project. The growth of the project has taken off beyond all expectation; over 17,530 investors and over $18.15 million have been raised in its ongoing presale phase. The huge growth rate exceeded the estimates of analysts, and Mutuum Finance is now one of the most important crypto projects to track in the DeFi ecosystem. Investors who buy now position themselves to make almost 2x gains when MUTM goes live. Earlier presales have already seen millions of MUTM tokens find buyers (resulting in clear investor demand and paving the way for early liquidity before mainnet goes live). The continued onslaught of such sales indicates increasing faith from holders who view not only Mutuum Finance as a DeFi project, but also as a basis for generating long-term utility rather than simply a short-term buying speculation project. DeFi the MUTM Way Mutuum Finance allows borrowers to fix the repayment charges in advance by fixing the borrowing rates by some multiple of market conditions. Though fixed interest rates are generally greater than variable interest rates but both of them provide security and assurance to the lenders and borrowers in the event of increasing interest rates and hence leading to secure and transparent lending process. BTC is breaking above $113K and ETH has a goal of $4,800 and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring. Phase 6 presale 80% sold at $0.035 – $18.15M DeFi and passive income on dual-lending place MUTM among the best cryptos to buy now and the top crypto to invest in prior to the next bull run.

In a significant development, South Korean insurer Kyobo Life Insurance is stepping into the future by embracing stablecoins. This move marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing acceptance and integration of blockchain technology within established financial services. The experimentation with Kyobo Life stablecoins is set to open new avenues for efficiency and innovation in the insurance sector. What Does Kyobo Life’s Stablecoin Experimentation Entail? Kyobo Life Insurance has officially joined Circle’s stablecoin-dedicated blockchain, Arc, as a partner. This strategic alliance positions the South Korean giant at the forefront of digital asset exploration. Decenter, a prominent financial news outlet, initially reported this groundbreaking collaboration, highlighting its importance for the broader financial landscape. The Arc project is not just any blockchain initiative; it is a significant endeavor attracting some of the biggest names in global finance. Esteemed firms like Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, HSBC, and Standard Chartered are also active participants in the Arc ecosystem. This high-profile involvement underscores the project’s credibility and its potential to reshape financial operations. Interestingly, Kyobo Life stands out as the sole South Korean financial company among these influential partners. This unique position grants Kyobo Life a distinct advantage, allowing it to pioneer localized applications and insights into stablecoin utility within the South Korean market. Their participation indicates a proactive approach to understanding and leveraging digital currencies. The potential for Kyobo Life stablecoins to revolutionize internal processes and customer interactions is immense. Why Are Kyobo Life Stablecoins a Game Changer for Finance? The decision by a major insurer like Kyobo Life to experiment with stablecoins is more than just a technological upgrade; it represents a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. This stability makes them an attractive option for financial operations where price predictability is crucial. For the insurance industry, the benefits of integrating stablecoins could be transformative. Consider the following advantages: Enhanced Efficiency: Stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions, especially for cross-border payments like claims processing or reinsurance settlements. Reduced Costs: Eliminating intermediaries and streamlining payment rails can significantly lower operational expenses. Increased Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear audit trail for all transactions, enhancing trust and compliance. New Product Development: Stablecoins could enable innovative insurance products, such as parametric insurance triggered by smart contracts or micro-insurance solutions for underserved markets. This embrace of Kyobo Life stablecoins sets a precedent for other financial institutions globally. It demonstrates a practical application of blockchain beyond speculative trading, moving towards real-world utility in core business functions. As more traditional players enter this space, the digital asset ecosystem gains further legitimacy and accelerates its mainstream adoption. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Kyobo Life Stablecoins While the opportunities presented by stablecoins are significant, Kyobo Life’s journey will undoubtedly involve navigating various challenges. Integrating a novel technology into a highly regulated industry like insurance requires careful consideration and robust frameworks. Some key areas that Kyobo Life will need to address include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is still evolving globally. Kyobo Life will need to ensure compliance with existing and future regulations in South Korea and any other jurisdictions where they operate. System Integration: Seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with existing legacy IT systems can be complex and resource-intensive. This requires skilled personnel and strategic planning. Security Concerns: While blockchain offers robust security, managing digital wallets, preventing hacks, and ensuring data privacy will be paramount. Customer Adoption: Educating customers and ensuring ease of use will be crucial for the successful rollout of any stablecoin-based services. Despite these hurdles, the long-term opportunities for Kyobo Life are compelling. By pioneering the use of Kyobo Life stablecoins , the insurer can gain a competitive edge, attract tech-savvy customers, and potentially expand its global footprint. This experimentation could lead to the development of next-generation insurance services, offering greater flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs. Imagine a future where insurance claims are settled instantly using stablecoins, or where premiums are paid digitally with minimal fees. This is the vision that Kyobo Life is now actively pursuing. Their involvement with Circle’s Arc project is not just an experiment; it’s an investment in the future of finance, paving the way for a more connected, efficient, and transparent insurance ecosystem. Kyobo Life Insurance’s venture into stablecoin experimentation through its partnership with Circle’s Arc blockchain marks a significant milestone for both the insurance industry and the broader digital asset space. As the sole South Korean financial institution among a cohort of global giants, Kyobo Life is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in integrating stablecoins into traditional financial services. This strategic move promises enhanced efficiency, reduced costs, and the potential for innovative new products, despite the inherent challenges of regulatory uncertainty and technological integration. The bold step taken by Kyobo Life underscores the growing recognition of stablecoins as a powerful tool for financial transformation, moving beyond speculation to deliver tangible real-world value.

Key Takeaways: Bitwise’s Solana ETF drew $69.5M in first-day inflows, nearly six times higher than rival SSK’s $12M debut. Institutions are showing renewed interest in Solana, marking what industry leaders call a “watershed moment” for the asset. Bitwise’s spot-based structure and staking yield give it an early advantage as competitors like SSK and Grayscale’s GSOL enter the race. The figure is nearly six times the $12 million debut haul of its closest competitor, the Rex-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), according to data from Farside. Bitwise Solana ETF Marks “Watershed Moment” as Institutions Enter SOL Market The Bitwise Solana Fund (BSOL) now stands as the clear favorite among institutional and retail investors eyeing Solana-based exposure. “Truly a watershed moment,” said Kyle Samani , managing partner at Multicoin Capital, noting that “the substantial majority of capital in the world was legally not allowed to trade or own Solana until today.” https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1983181496925204811 The two ETFs represent divergent strategies in Solana exposure. Bitwise’s BSOL offers a fully spot-based structure, directly staking all held SOL tokens in-house to pass along Solana’s full network yield, around 7% annually, to investors. The fund trades on the New York Stock Exchange and carries a modest 0.20% management fee, which Bitwise has waived for the first three months. In contrast, SSK takes a diversified approach. Roughly 54% of its portfolio is held in direct Solana, 43.5% in the CoinShares Physical Staked Solana ETP listed in Switzerland, and the remainder in JitoSOL, short-term government securities, and cash. Its staking rewards are paid monthly and classified as a return of capital for tax purposes. SSK trades on the Chicago Board Options Exchange with a 0.75% expense ratio. Analysts say BSOL’s early traction reflects institutional enthusiasm for Solana as a high-throughput blockchain with growing on-chain revenue. “Institutional investors love ETFs, and they love revenue,” said Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise. “Solana has the most revenue of any blockchain. Therefore, institutional investors love Solana ETFs.” Institutional investors love ETFs, and they love revenue. Solana has the most revenue of any blockchain. Therefore, institutional investors love Solana ETFs. I have a feeling the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF, $BSOL , is gonna be huge. This material must be accompanied by a… — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) October 28, 2025 Grayscale’s own Solana ETF, GSOL, is also set to begin trading on Wednesday, joining the race to capture institutional demand for Solana exposure. Despite the positive sentiment around the launches, traders remain cautious. Prediction market Myriad currently gives Solana just a 32.7% chance of reaching a new all-time high this year. As of Wednesday, Solana (SOL) is down 3.1% over 24 hours, trading at $194, while Bitcoin has dropped 3.2% from Tuesday’s peak of $116,000, per CoinGecko. Western Union to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin on Solana As reported, Western Union plans to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) on the Solana blockchain in the first half of 2026. The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, will allow users to move money globally with lower fees and faster settlement times, reducing reliance on traditional banking intermediaries and volatile currency conversions. CEO Devin McGranahan described the move as a continuation of Western Union’s 175-year mission to simplify money transfers, this time through blockchain technology. He said Solana was chosen for its speed, scalability, and low-cost transactions, which are crucial for the company’s high-volume remittance business. By leveraging blockchain rails, Western Union aims to make remittances nearly instantaneous and more transparent. If widely adopted, USDPT could drive stablecoin use beyond crypto trading and into everyday payments, bill settlements, and cross-border commerce, marking a pivotal step toward mainstream digital dollar adoption.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold below $1 as buyers lost confidence, resulting in a decline below Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.

A significant governance proposal has emerged, aiming to revolutionize the approach to dYdX token buybacks and potentially reshape the value proposition of the DYDX token. This move could mark a pivotal moment for the decentralized exchange. What’s the Buzz Around dYdX Token Buybacks? Currently, the dYdX decentralized exchange allocates only 25% of its on-chain trading fees towards buying back DYDX tokens from the open market. This mechanism helps to create demand and reduce the circulating supply of the token. However, a new governance proposal, submitted by the community, seeks to dramatically increase this allocation. If approved, the proposal would direct a full 100% of all on-chain trading fees to fund dYdX token buybacks . This isn’t just a theoretical discussion. The proposal outlines a concrete three-month pilot program. During this period, the exchange anticipates buying back a substantial amount of DYDX, estimated to be between $5 million and $10 million worth of tokens. The community believes this change could significantly impact the DYDX token’s economics. It reflects a strong desire to strengthen the token’s value and align it more closely with the success of the dYdX platform. How Could Increased dYdX Token Buybacks Benefit DYDX Holders? The potential benefits for DYDX token holders are considerable. When a protocol buys back its own tokens, it typically removes them from circulation, either by burning them or holding them in a treasury. This action can lead to several positive outcomes: Supply Reduction: By consistently reducing the available supply of DYDX tokens, the mechanism can, in theory, create scarcity. This scarcity often contributes to upward price pressure, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Enhanced Value Proposition: A robust buyback program signals confidence in the token’s future and its underlying platform. It can make DYDX a more attractive asset for investors and long-term holders. Community Empowerment: This proposal originates from the community, demonstrating the power of decentralized governance. Holders have a direct say in shaping the token’s economic model. Direct Protocol Alignment: Allocating all fees to dYdX token buybacks directly aligns the protocol’s success with the token’s value. As trading volume on dYdX grows, so does the potential for buybacks, creating a virtuous cycle. Navigating the Potential Challenges of Enhanced dYdX Token Buybacks While the prospect of increased dYdX token buybacks is exciting, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. No financial mechanism is without its complexities, and this proposal is no exception. One key factor is market volatility. The effectiveness of buybacks can fluctuate depending on market conditions. If the price of DYDX is highly volatile, the buyback program might not achieve its intended impact as efficiently. Another aspect involves the technical implementation. Ensuring the smart contracts and automated processes for these buybacks are secure and efficient is paramount. Any glitches could undermine confidence in the program. Furthermore, while the pilot program offers a clear path forward, future decisions will still rely on community consensus. Sustaining support for this model or adapting it based on the pilot’s results will require ongoing active governance and participation from DYDX holders. A Look at the Future: What’s Next for dYdX Token Buybacks? The proposed three-month pilot program is crucial. It will serve as a real-world test, providing valuable data on the effectiveness and impact of dedicating 100% of trading fees to dYdX token buybacks . This data will be instrumental in informing future governance decisions. The dYdX community will closely monitor metrics such as the amount of DYDX bought back, the impact on token liquidity, and overall market sentiment. This iterative approach is a hallmark of decentralized finance, allowing for agile adjustments based on observed outcomes. Comparing dYdX’s tokenomics with other decentralized exchanges could also provide insights. Many protocols experiment with different fee structures and value accrual mechanisms. The success of this pilot could set a new standard or inspire variations across the DeFi landscape. Ultimately, this proposal represents a significant step towards a more robust and community-aligned economic model for the dYdX ecosystem. It highlights the dynamic nature of decentralized governance and the continuous pursuit of value optimization for token holders. The dYdX community is actively shaping its future. This governance proposal for enhanced dYdX token buybacks demonstrates a clear commitment to strengthening the DYDX token’s position and fostering a thriving, sustainable decentralized exchange. It’s a powerful example of how community-led initiatives can drive meaningful change in the crypto space, potentially unlocking significant value for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the current allocation of trading fees for DYDX token buybacks? Currently, only 25% of the on-chain trading fees generated by the dYdX decentralized exchange are allocated for DYDX token buybacks. 2. What does the new governance proposal suggest for dYdX token buybacks? The new governance proposal suggests increasing the allocation of on-chain trading fees for DYDX token buybacks from 25% to 100%. 3. How long is the proposed pilot program for these increased buybacks? If approved, the proposal would initiate a three-month pilot program to implement the 100% fee allocation for buybacks. 4. What is the estimated value of DYDX tokens expected to be bought back during the pilot? During the three-month pilot program, the exchange is expected to buy back between $5 million and $10 million worth of DYDX tokens. 5. How do dYdX token buybacks generally benefit token holders? Token buybacks typically benefit holders by reducing the circulating supply of tokens, which can create scarcity and potentially lead to increased demand and price appreciation, assuming other factors remain constant.

A number of super political action committees (PACs) focused on crypto are pooling together a major $263 million war chest, according to Bloomberg. Fairshake Leads With $141 Million The legislative victories with the passage of the GENIUS Act, coupled with the Trump family’s endorsement of crypto, are reportedly prompting many newer super PACs to pivot from previous strategies and align more closely with Republican candidates. A primary focus is a proposed crypto market-structure bill that seeks to implement comprehensive changes to the oversight of digital assets, potentially empowering the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has been more receptive to the industry’s interests. Collaborations have further emerged between crypto firms and Trump-affiliated ventures, along with donations to Trump’s inauguration and military events. Several companies are also contributing to the development of a new White House ballroom, with notable supporters including Coinbase, Ripple , and the US arm of Tether (USDT). Fairshake remains the largest PAC, reporting $141 million in its coffers as of the end of June, after spending more than $133 million to back pro-crypto candidates during 2024. In its efforts to promote crypto-friendly policies across party lines, Fairshake allocated around $10 million each to support Democratic senators Elissa Slotkin and Ruben Gallego, both of whom successfully won their races in Michigan and Arizona. They were among the 18 Democratic senators who voted in favor of the GENIUS Act, which facilitated broader usage of stablecoins, a favored instrument of the crypto sector. New Super PACs Arise To Boost Pro-Crypto Candidates Another new organization, the First Principles Digital PAC, identifies itself as a Republican-focused entity dedicated to electing pro-crypto leaders. Led by Republican strategist Jason Thielman, this PAC was established after the 2024 elections and reported approximately $954,000 in cash as of the end of June. Fellowship PAC, which emerged in September with $100 million in commitments, is another new player, though its donors have not been publicly disclosed. Initial filings indicate its treasurer is an executive from Cantor Fitzgerald , the financial firm previously headed by Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick. Democrats are increasingly apprehensive about the financial firepower of the crypto sector. Erik Balsbaugh, who has campaigned for Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton, now directs a new group called Open Frontier, which aims to amplify progressive voices within the crypto conversation. “Many on my side are striving to understand this industry,” Balsbaugh stated. “There’s a lack of trustworthy messengers, and significant skepticism about crypto remains.” Democrats Reevaluate Stance Ahead of this new election cycle, Bloomberg reports that there are indications that the industry’s growing financial reserves and political clout are prompting some Democrats to reassess their positions. Even Sherrod Brown has moderated his criticisms, with his campaign manager stating, “Cryptocurrency is increasingly becoming integrated into America’s economy, especially in Ohio. Industry executives are also looking beyond the immediate target of the market-structure bill, which Republicans hope to advance before the midterms.

On Tuesday, the company announced its intention to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT), a new stablecoin, alongside its Digital Asset Network designed to integrate digital and fiat currencies. Western Union New USDPT Stablecoin Built on the Solana (SOL) blockchain and issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, USDPT aims to broaden the options for transferring money for customers, agents, and partners, while also bolstering Western Union’s treasury capabilities. Through this initiative, the company plans to provide users with access to digital assets, allowing them to send, receive, spend, and hold USDPT with ease, supported by Western Union’s global compliance and risk management framework. Related Reading: China Intensifies Crypto Crackdown With Latest Warning Against Stablecoins Devin McGranahan, President and CEO of Western Union, expressed the company’s commitment to harnessing emerging technologies to empower customers and communities. “As we transition into the digital asset space, USDPT will enable us to take ownership of the economics associated with stablecoins,” McGranahan stated. He also highlighted the significance of the Digital Asset Network, which aims to simplify cash off-ramps for digital assets by partnering with wallets and wallet providers, thereby allowing seamless access for customers via Western Union’s extensive global network. Western Union anticipates that USDPT will launch in the first half of 2026, with plans for users to access the stablecoin through partner exchanges, ensuring broad availability and user-friendliness. Stablecoins To Reduce Reliance On Traditional Banking During Western Union’s third quarter of the year earnings call last Thursday, McGranahan revealed that the company has initiated a pilot program utilizing stablecoins for value transfer. He noted that this pilot aims to leverage blockchain technology and stablecoins to decrease reliance on traditional correspondent banking systems, which will help shorten settlement times and enhance capital efficiency.

However, with the enactment of the GENIUS Act, McGranahan indicated that new opportunities are emerging for integrating digital assets into the company’s operations, enhancing efficiency, reducing friction, and ultimately improving the customer experience. Western Union facilitates the transfer of billions of dollars annually, boasting a market capitalization of over $2.9 billion as of October 28, and generating more than $1 billion in adjusted revenue in the third quarter of the year alone. Despite the announcement, SOL’s price has failed to react positively, currently attempting to hold the $200 line as the cryptocurrency’s next short-term support.

The $1.25 billion purchase of the global prime broker has positioned Ripple to service some of the world’s largest financial institutions through a structure they already trust. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto commentator on X, highlighted the significance of the deal by sharing a video in which Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse explained the purpose of the acquisition. Garlinghouse stated, “Our acquisition this week, Hidden Road, we paid $1.25 billion for what’s called a prime broker. And this allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that.” The acquisition of Hidden Road allows institutions like BlackRock and Wall Street to access a safer prime broker, Enabling them to conduct more secure transactions directly on their balance sheets. @bgarlinghouse #XRP https://t.co/blwvZVihSh pic.twitter.com/ijcnq5jKM0 — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 27, 2025 Institutional Trust and Infrastructure Growth Hidden Road, now known as Ripple Prime , serves as a multi-asset prime broker offering clearing, financing, and liquidity services across traditional and digital markets. With over 300 institutional clients and an annual clearing volume in the trillions, its integration into Ripple’s operations brings a level of institutional-grade security and compliance infrastructure previously uncommon in the crypto sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The acquisition gives Ripple an immediate foothold in a regulated environment that is essential for attracting major financial entities seeking a stable and compliant entry into digital assets. For those institutions, access to a familiar prime brokerage model may eliminate one of the most persistent barriers to entry in the crypto market. Ripple Prime ensures that Ripple can conduct these institutional transactions directly on balance sheets with improved risk management and regulatory oversight. This step moves XRP and the XRP Ledger closer to being utilized as settlement and liquidity tools within large-scale financial operations. Expanding XRP’s Functional Role The integration of Hidden Road opens opportunities for using Ripple’s own stablecoin, RLUSD, as collateral within institutional trading environments . As these mechanisms expand, the XRP Ledger may see increased transaction activity related to post-trade settlements and asset tokenization, all of which contribute to a more practical use case for XRP itself. This acquisition strengthens Ripple’s ability to connect traditional finance with digital asset markets . If financial institutions begin leveraging the XRP Ledger for settlement efficiency and liquidity management, demand for XRP could increase as part of broader utility-driven adoption.

Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF ($BSOL) – aka the first-ever Solana Staking ETF approved for trading in the United States – made a blockbuster debut on Tuesday, October 28. It became the biggest crypto ETF launch since Ethereum, with $222.9M in seed capital and a staggering $ 69.5M in inflows on its very first day . To put that number in perspective, REX Osprey’s Solana Staking ETF saw ‘just’ $12M in first-day inflows – meaning Bitwise’s figure was roughly 480% higher. $BSOL is beginning life with $220M in assets. Impressive, already half the size of $SSK. Surprised they didn’t hold off tho and have it come in on Day One to get volume and flows higher. Good news is now we’ll have only organic, easier to measure true demand. – Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas Such massive growth on day 1 is a telltale sign that the industry is hungry for user-friendly investment options into the biggest cryptocurrencies. Plus, given that $BSOL offers more than 7% annual rewards by staking 100% of your $SOL, it’s naturally destined to become a go-to choice for Solana HODL investors. Crypto ETFs are crucial for the growth of the industry because they make investing in digital assets easier and more accessible to everyone. Thanks to them, investors no longer need to navigate complex jargon around crypto wallets, private keys, or blockchain networks. The approval of these ETFs by regulators – and now their enthusiastic reception by the public – signals growing confidence and acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class. It’s a clear sign that the industry is moving in the right direction, i.e., toward broader mainstream adoption. Now, if you want to make the most of this building momentum – particularly in the case of Solana – it’s worth looking at under-the-radar gems that could ride alongside the biggest cryptos but deliver far better returns in the process. To help you out, we’ve handpicked the best meme coins going around right now. 1. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Unique Mine-to-Earn Cryptocurrency Offering Real Rewards Despite crypto’s open-to-everyone ethos, the fact remains that crypto mining is one of the most gated ventures in the space – given its high setup and maintenance costs as well as the technical expertise required. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , however, is a new cryptocurrency project that’s bringing crypto mining to everyday users through its never-before-seen, gamified, and engaging ecosystem that turns mining into an interactive experience. As soon as you buy $PEPENODE tokens , you’re given an empty virtual server room, which you then populate by buying meme mining nodes and experimenting with different combinations to achieve your desired results. The trick is to get this combination right, because each mining node is unique, with different capabilities, characteristics, and efficiencies. But don’t mistake this for a video game with no real-world rewards. Your goal as a $PEPENODE miner is to rank as high as possible on the leaderboard, which will earn you real rewards like free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FATCOIN tokens. It’s worth noting that these rewards will be distributed after PEPENODE’s TGE (Token Generation Event) and once its virtual mining simulator goes live. According to our $PEPENODE price prediction , it could skyrocket after listing, reaching a high of around 0.0072 by 2026 – a massive 540% ROI from current price levels. Right now, 1 $PEPENODE is priced at just $0.0011227, with the project having already raised nearly $2M in its ongoing presale. Ride the crypto mining revolution – grab your $PEPENODE tokens today! 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Doge’s Distant Cousin Aiming to Become the Biggest Meme Coin Don’t mistake Maxi Doge ($MAXI) for just another meme coin looking to ride the market’s love for dog-themed tokens. It, in fact, carries the potential to become the next Dogecoin. A big reason for that is it combines an absurd yet thrilling anti-Dogecoin narrative with massive investor hype, putting it in a prime position to become the next 1000x crypto . According to Maxi’s story, it is Dogecoin’s distant cousin – one whose childhood was destroyed by his elder cousin’s overwhelming popularity, which hogged all the limelight while they were growing up. But credit to Maxi’s resilience, he made a ‘dawg’ out of himself, hitting the gym, lifting heavy weights, bulking up, and creating the perfect strategy to overtake Dogecoin’s dominance. Maxi’s master plan is to go insanely viral, which is why it has reserved a whopping 40% of its total token supply for marketing. This includes high-ticket influencer collaborations, social media campaigns, and major PR pushes. That’s not all; $MAXI also plans to go beyond the usual CEX and DEX listings and launch on futures platforms, offering itself as the ultimate tool for degen meme coin traders who love taking leveraged bets and chasing whale-like returns. Based on our $MAXI price prediction , the token could climb to $0.0058 by the end of 2026, meaning a $100 investment today could turn into $2,100 in just a few months. Even better, the project is currently in its presale phase, so you can buy Maxi Doge at some of its lowest-ever prices – currently just $0.0002655. Join the junior Doge in its brutal title fight – get your $MAXI tokens today. 3. Unstable Coin ($USDUC) – Viral Satirical Meme Coin Primed for Another Rally Unstable Coin ($USDUC) is a clever satirical take on the entire stablecoin industry, particularly Circle’s USDC. Although there’s no point in finding logic in any viral meme coin – the lack of logic is precisely why they become so popular – Unstable Coin’s concept is truly unique. It mocks how stablecoins are bringing ‘stability’ to crypto, which, by its very essence, is supposed to be memetic and highly volatile. This simple yet amusing idea has clearly resonated with investors. Launched in May this year, $USDUC is up over 32,000% so far and is currently bouncing off a major support zone around $0.0165. This same level previously triggered a massive 350% rally in August. So, we could see a similar sharp move upward from here, potentially pushing the token close to new all-time highs – a gain of roughly 230% from current levels. Fancy some raw meme coin energy? Grab your $USDUC tokens on MEXC today. Recap : With Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF ($BSOL) now alive and kicking, it’s the perfect time to load up on low-cap coins – top picks include PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and Unstable Coin ($USDUC). Disclaimer : Kindly do your own research before investing in crypto, since it’s highly volatile and unpredictable. This article is not financial advice.

Five years after MicroStrategy’s first bitcoin purchase - during which time no companies dared follow its lead - hundreds of DATs have emerged. Many investors compare crypto assets - especially L1 tokens - to equities, commodities, or currencies, even though they are more different than similar. By Lorenzo Valente Introduction During August and September 2025, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) dominated the vehicles through which digital assets have gone mainstream on Wall Street. It must have been a surprising turn of events to those in the community who assumed that ETFs would continue to play the role that DATs have started to usurp. What happened? Several years ago, MicroStrategy pioneered the bitcoin DAT model, but investors did not understand how to apply it to other digital assets. This paper describes why the DAT phenomenon has been controversial in four sections: DATs description The DAT landscape The rationale for a DAT mNAV premium Risks associated with DATs DATs Description A Digital Asset Treasury ((DAT)) is a company that holds cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ether, or solana (SOL-USD) directly on its balance sheet, to which investors can gain exposure by buying its stock. Unlike SEC-regulated 1 spot Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD) ETFs that hold crypto passively and issue shares backed one-for-one with holdings, DATs are companies - operating businesses that can use leverage, corporate strategy, or financing to manage their holdings. While ETFs provide the regulated exposure germane to public investment instruments, DATs introduce corporate risk and potential upside or downside beyond the underlying asset. Long before the phrase “digital asset treasury” evolved, MicroStrategy developed the first “DAT” for bitcoin. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, the company deemphasized its enterprise software business to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible. As of September 15, 2025, MicroStrategy (Renamed “Strategy” (MSTR)) had acquired more than 632,000 BTC for $46.5 billion - an average of $73,527 per coin. 2 Today, the company controls more than 3% of the scheduled 21 million bitcoin supply. 3 MicroStrategy accumulated its bitcoin position with various financing strategies. While it began by issuing convertible senior notes, followed by senior secured notes at a 6.125% yield, 4 the real breakthrough was an at-the-market ((ATM)) equity program. Because its stock, MSTR, was trading at a substantial premium to book value, Saylor issued new shares, diluting existing holders but using the proceeds to buy more bitcoin and increase its bitcoin per share. In effect, its shareholders supplied the capital to leverage MicroStrategy’s exposure to bitcoin. The approach has caused quite a bit of debate. Critics denigrate DATs by suggesting, “They’re selling 50 cents for a dollar.” 5 What does that mean? If a DAT were to trade at twice its market net asset value (mNAV), investors would be paying two dollars in equity for every dollar’s worth of bitcoin on the balance sheet. In other words, the premium seems irrational and unsustainable. Thus far, MicroStrategy’s stock has defied that analysis and rewarded shareholders handsomely. Except for a brief dip into discount territory during the bear market between March 2022 and January 2024, MSTR has been priced at a significant premium to mNAV. More importantly, Saylor has weaponized that premium strategically by issuing shares well above book value and increasing MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings accretively. As a result, not only has MSTR compounded shareholder exposure to bitcoin, but it also has outperformed a simple buy-and-hold bitcoin strategy since its first bitcoin purchase in August 2020 significantly. 6 The DAT Landscape Five years after MicroStrategy’s first bitcoin purchase - during which time no companies dared follow its lead - hundreds of DATs have emerged. The new vehicles are accumulating ETH, SOL, HYPE, ADA, ENA, BNB, XRP, TRON, DOGE, SUI, AVAX, and many other digital assets. Now the market is beginning to rally around the largest-cap assets, as a handful of well-capitalized DATs are competing to accumulate ETH and SOL. Combined, ETH-focused DATs have acquired 3.74% of the ether supply, 7 and Solana DATs 2.31% of the SOL supply, 8 as shown below. Source: Blockworks as of August 25, 2025.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. In our view, while some DATs may have been created for short-term opportunistic reasons, the winners could become more efficient wrappers than spot ETFs for some digital assets. By exploiting their corporate structures, 9 DATs can deploy leverage, corporate financing, and strategic optionality that ETFs cannot. These advantages will pertain as long as their mNAV premiums prove sustainable, a topic we explore in the following sections. Why Might The mNAV Premium Be Warranted? As an asset manager with significant exposure to crypto, ARK Invest has taken an active interest in the emerging DAT space. Recently, we invested in one of the leading ETH-focused DATs, Bitmine Immersion (BMNR). While approaching DATs cautiously and monitoring their rapid evolution closely, we can understand the reasons that some DATs trade at a an mNAV premium, among them the following: DATs’ Revenue / Staking Yield DATs’ Speed of accumulation / Velocity DATs’ Liquidity and Inexpensive Capital DATs’ Optionality Revenue / Staking Yield Smart contract Layer 1 blockchain protocols (L1s) 10 - Ethereum, in particular - offer native yields through staking, which rewards participants for securing the network. In the digital asset ecosystem, that yield is effectively the risk-free rate, as it is generated within the protocol and does not involve counterparty risk. In contrast, spot ETFs in the US do not allow staking for yield on the underlying asset. Because of Ethereum’s design, even if regulators were to change their position, ETFs probably would be able to stake a limited percentage of their holdings - perhaps less than 50% - as the network enforces “churn limits” that restrict how many validators can enter or exit during each epoch. 11 Essential for security, the limits prevent malicious actors from spinning up or shutting down large numbers of validators at once, ensuring that any changes do not overwhelm consensus or state management. As a result, staking or unstaking ETH can take up to two weeks. While ETFs could use liquid staking protocols 12 and tokens to circumvent the limits, compliance, liquidity, and centralization risks are likely to prevent ETFs from staking significant portions of their holdings. In contrast, DATs can benefit from significant optionality. Typical DATs are extremely lean organizations, often run by very small teams that generate outsized revenue. At a $10 billion market cap, if all ETH is staked, Bitmine Immersion, for example, generates ~$300 million of free cash flow annually, 13 capital that can be redeployed into mergers and acquisitions (M&A), token purchases, on-chain opportunities, or shareholder distributions. Speed Of Accumulation / Velocity Justifying DATs premium-to-book value are the speed of asset accumulation and the growth in cryptoassets per share. DATs can grow cryptoassets per share more quickly than the price appreciation of the underlying asset and, by extension, accelerate revenue growth by staking yield. Consider Bitmine. On July 13, the company held 163,142 ETH across roughly 56 million fully diluted shares. 14 At $2,914 per ETH, ETH per share was 0.0029, or $8.45. Just 31 days later, our estimates suggest that Bitmine’s holdings and shares had expanded to 1.15 million ETH and 173 million of fully diluted shares, respectively. 15 At $4,700 per ETH, ETH per share was 0.0066 ETH, or $32.43. In one month, the price of ETH rose about 60%, and Bitmine’s ETH/share increased by 130%. In other words, Bitmine’s ability to arbitrage its mNAV premium through at-the-market equity ((ATM)) issuance and accretive purchases added significantly more value than holding ETH directly. Of course, this dynamic will persist only with an mNAV premium and ATMs deployed accretively. Should the premium narrow or drop to a discount, DATs would have to rely on other capital-market tools, like liquidating a portion of their underlying token holdings to repurchase shares. The Shapley Value decomposition method breaks down the drivers of Bitmine’s (BMNR’s) stock performance, attributing the changes to three variables: the ETH price, growth in ETH per share, and shifts in the mNAV premium or discount, as shown below. As of August 25, ETH/share had been the biggest contributor to BMNR’s price and shareholder return. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025. Note: This chart is based on the Shapley Average Value, which uses only public data (e.g., stock price, mNAV, eth AUM, price of ETH, FDV shares). Data as of August 25, 2025. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Liquidity And Inexpensive Capital Liquidity is the main reason a DAT deserves a premium. At-the-market equity programs (ATMs) and convertible bonds work only if an equity is liquid. An ATM relies on meaningful daily turnover and a DAT’s ability to absorb steady share issuance without depressing the price. The same is true for convertibles: investors are buying a bond plus the option to convert into equity. The option has value only if the equity is liquid enough to be sold or hedged efficiently. Without liquidity, the instrument will not attract serious investors and/or will become prohibitively expensive for the issuer. Scale also matters because debt markets typically serve large companies. Investment banks and institutional lenders depend on demand in the secondary market, which is a function of market cap and float/liquidity. In practice, most broadly syndicated debt deals and institutional convertible offerings are accessible only to companies with market caps greater than ~$1–2 billion. Below that threshold, the cost of capital rises sharply, and financing options often are limited to bespoke or venture-style credit facilities. MicroStrategy, for example, was able to issue multiple rounds of convertibles totaling billions of dollars because its equity was liquid and its market cap was in the tens of billions at the time. Preferred share issuance illustrates the same point. Structured equity deals like those MicroStrategy has pursued require both balance-sheet heft and secondary liquidity to attract institutional investors. Preferred share buyers must believe that they will be able to exit or hedge positions. Illiquid DATs have no access to this financing channel. In other words, liquidity lowers the cost of capital. To compensate for illiquidity, investors demand higher returns, so illiquid DATs have to pay up in one or more ways: deeper discounts on equity issuance, higher coupon rates on debt, or more onerous covenants. In contrast, a liquid DAT can raise capital less expensively 16 to accumulate BTC or ETH, creating a flywheel effect that reinforces the premium. Optionality Many investors compare crypto assets - especially L1 tokens - to equities, commodities, or currencies, even though they are more different than similar. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) highlight this distinction and demonstrate how ETF wrappers can be an inefficient way to gain exposure to L1s. The DAT corporate structure offers optionality that investors often value at a premium to book value. Large DATs can acquire tokens at a discount in distressed circumstances, such as the ongoing FTX bankruptcy sales, or through the purchase of other DATs trading below mNAV. To illustrate, with a $10 billion market cap, Bitmine Immersion could issue just 2–3% of its stock and acquire an ETH-focused DAT worth $200 million at a discount, an accretive acquisition. Beyond such mergers and acquisitions (M&A), ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum offer other opportunities. Because those networks support tens of billions of dollars in liquidity and applications, a sufficiently scaled DAT can monetize by securing or providing liquidity on-chain. Indeed, protocols might offer incentives to attract large, balance-sheet-heavy participants into their ecosystems. Another arbitrage opportunity involves the spread between traditional and on-chain interest rates which, at times, has exceeded 500 basis points (bp), or 5%. 17 In a low-rate environment, DATs could borrow USD in traditional financial markets at a low cost and deploy the funds in on-chain lending pools at materially higher yields. Today, stablecoin pools like sUSDS, sUSDe, or SyrupUSDC offer annualized yields of ~7%, roughly 300bp (~3%) higher than Treasury yields, giving DATs the opportunity to capture incremental revenue streams beyond simple token appreciation. Risks While DATs offer new ways to gain exposure to cryptoassets, they also introduce significant risks that investors must weigh carefully. The first is dependence on market premiums. The DAT model - particularly the growth in crypto per share - relies on stocks trading at a premium to mNAV. When the premium compresses, a DAT’s ability to issue accretive equity diminishes and can disappear, forcing them to slow purchases or to liquidate tokens and repurchase shares. Second, liquidity can cut both ways. While liquid stocks enable access to inexpensive capital, they also can become the source of illiquidity during market downdrafts. In an extended downturn, DATs could enter a negative feedback loop: collapsing share prices, higher cost of capital, and potential redemptions that force token sales. Third, regulatory uncertainty looms large. Unlike ETFs, DATs operate in a gray area that could invite scrutiny around accounting treatment, disclosures, and other regulatory questions which apply more to investment funds than to operating companies. Regulatory intervention could impair access to capital markets or limit optionality. Fourth, governance and operational risks could be underappreciated. Many DATs are managed by small teams overseeing multi-billion-dollar treasuries. Weak controls, poor risk management, or misaligned incentives can erode value very quickly. In the worst case, some DATs could evolve into reckless on-chain hedge funds in disguise - chasing yield, levering up balance sheets, and allocating capital with limited transparency, creating the risk of hidden exposures and even bankruptcy. Conclusion The rise of Digital Asset Treasuries offers a new way for investors to gain exposure to crypto assets. What began with MicroStrategy’s seemingly idiosyncratic bet has evolved into a broader phenomenon, with DATs proliferating across Ethereum, Solana, and other leading Layer 1 blockchain protocols. While critics dismiss the model as “selling fifty cents for a dollar,” the reality is more nuanced. The DAT corporate structure offers unique potential advantages - ones that ETFs cannot match - that justify their premiums to book value: the ability to increase ETH or SOL per share more quickly than the price appreciation of the underlying asset; the liquidity and scale to access inexpensive capital across the capital stack; and the optionality to pursue M&A, token purchases, and on-chain opportunities. Unlike ETFs, DATs are not passive wrappers for digital assets. They are dynamic capital-market vehicles with the potential to magnify exposure, capture protocol yields, and allocate capital. For some assets, they may prove not only to be more sustainable but also to be more efficient than ETFs. Far from a passing arbitrage, DATs could become enduring institutions at the intersection of the traditional financial markets and the new world of digital assets. DISCLOSURE: Digital Asset Risk Digital assets, often referred to as cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether are relatively new investments, which have unique and substantial risks and which may be more volatile than other types of investments. Digital assets operate without central authority or banks and are not backed by any government. Even indirectly, digital assets may experience very high volatility. Digital assets are not legal tender. Federal, state or foreign governments could restrict the use and exchange of digital assets. Digital asset exchanges could stop operating or permanently shut down due to fraud, technical glitches, hackers or malware. Digital assets, like bitcoin and ether, are subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for the digital asset, and other factors. There is no assurance that a digital asset will maintain its value over the long term. 1 Cryptocurrencies are classified as commodities rather than securities. As such, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are structured as commodity-based exchange-traded products (ETPs) registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (“33 Act”) rather than traditional investment companies that are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“40 Act”) like most other ETFs. Therefore, although the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to some degree, they do not offer the same investor protections as traditional investment companies that are subject to the regulations set forth by the 40 Act. 2 Based on data from Saylor, M. 2025. “Strategy has acquired 525 BTC for ~$60.2 million at ~$114,562 per bitcoin…” X. 3 Ibid. 4 See MicroStrategy. 2021. “MicroStrategy Completes $500 Million Offering of 6.125% Senior Secured Notes Due 2028 with Bitcoin Use of Proceeds.” 5 Carter, N. 2025. “in the end its going to be very funny…” X. 6 MSTR stock has outperformed the buy and hold strategy from the first bitcoin purchase of the company on August 11, 2020. Data as of October 22, 2025. MSTR stock went up from 14 usd to 300 usd (20.8x), versus bitcoin, which rose from 11,410 USD to 110,000 USD (9.6x). MSTR stock’s outperformance of BTC price is attributable to the accretive usage of the share issuance to buy BTC. 7 Based on data from Blockworks as of August 25, 2025. 8 Based on data from Blockworks as of August 25, 2025. 9 A Digital Asset Treasury can use its corporate structure to exploit leverage and financing in ways an ETF cannot. By holding crypto directly on its balance sheet, a DAT can borrow against those reserves through secured loans or convertible bonds, effectively levering its exposure. It can also issue new shares if its stock trades at a premium to the value of its underlying assets, turning that premium into additional capital to buy more crypto. ETFs, by contrast, are constrained to issuing and redeeming shares at net asset value and cannot borrow against their holdings, which limits them to passively tracking the asset. 10 Colloquially, “Layer 1 blockchain”—or “L1”—refers to the base protocol of a blockchain network, which is responsible for essential functions like transaction processing, consensus mechanisms, and data storage on its own chain. 11 As used within the crypto community, an “epoch” is a unit of time used primarily in the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus system to organize validator activity and block finalization. 12 Liquid staking protocols are platforms that enable users to stake their cryptocurrency holdings on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain while retaining liquidity via a yield-bearing token that rebases. 13 Based on data from UltraSound Money, data as of August 25, 2025. Our calculation assumes that Ethereum yield is approximately 3%, resulting in a total of $300 million. 14 Based on data from Deepnewz. 2025. “Bitmine ( BMNR ) Raises $250 Million, Sells 55.56M Shares, Stock Surges 400% as Tom Lee Launches ""MicroStrategy of Ethereum"" Treasury.” 15 Based on public data regarding prices of stock, ETH, and mNAV, for example, as of August 25, 2025. 16 In finance, preferreds are hybrid securities—a class of stock that blends features of both stocks and bonds, offering fixed-dividend payouts and preferential claims on assets in bankruptcy or liquidation over common stockholders, but with lower priority than bondholders. Also known as preferred stock, they usually pay higher yields than common stock to compensate for their intermediate risk level and lack of voting rights. 17 Note: A basis point ((BP)) is equal to 0.01%, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point.

The recent positive performance brings XRP’s year-to-date gains to 28%, with further gains expected ahead of the FOMC meeting today. Analysts are expecting a rate cut later today, and this could push XRP’s price higher in the near term. FOMC meeting could push prices higher XRP has been one of the best performers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap in the last seven days. The coin has benefited from a rise in the general market sentiment. The Fear and Greed Index has surged from a 30-day low of 25 to 42 as investors shake off the effects of the ongoing tariff war between the United States and China. This has allowed Bitcoin to climb above $115k in recent days, with altcoins such as XRP also benefitting heavily. In addition to that, the market cap of Ripple USD (RLUSD), the network’s native stablecoin, is about to reach $900 million for the first time in history, indicating the growth of the broader Ripple ecosystem. XRP’s price has also benefited from increased institutional adoption in recent weeks. Evernorth recently completed its $1 billion worth of XRP acquisition, making it one of the largest XRP corporate treasuries. The company joins VivoPower International in the list of XRP-focused treasuries, with companies such as Trident Digital Tech Holdings also making plans to launch similar initiatives. Finally, the CME-listed futures tied to XRP and Solana saw record open interest on Monday as the demand for the regulated products continues to rise. The derivatives giant reported a record 9,900 XRP and micro XRP active contracts on Monday. It also saw 15,600 open positions in standard and micro SOL futures, bringing the total for the two to $3 billion. The milestone reveals the increasing adoption of regulated futures as a preferred venue for investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies. XRP stabilises above $2.6, eyes the $3 mark The XRP/USD 4-hour chart remains bearish and inefficient ahead of the crucial FOMC meeting later today. XRP faced a rejection from the 50-day EMA at $2.68 earlier this week and declined to the 200-day EMA at $2.61 on Tuesday. However, it has slightly bounced back and is now trading above $2.62 per coin.

The case, unveiled at the 2025 Financial Street Forum Annual Meeting on October 28, particularly shows Beijing’s growing sophistication in tracking and prosecuting cross-border crypto transactions amid broader warnings from Chinese officials about stablecoins threatening global financial stability . China’s central bank has called stablecoins a ""threat"". At the #FinancialStreetForum , PBoC Governor Pan Gongsheng reaffirmed tighter crypto oversight. #Stablecoins #China #PBoC https://t.co/IMBzTToszD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 27, 2025 Between January and August 2023, the group orchestrated a complex operation converting client funds into USDT stablecoins to facilitate illegal cross-border transfers, processing 1.182 billion yuan ($166 million) through multiple accounts. The Beijing Municipal People’s Procuratorate detailed how the scheme used virtual currency as a “ bridge ” for disguised foreign exchange trading, with individual members handling amounts ranging from 149 million to 469 million yuan. Advanced Forensics Crack Crypto Money Trail Lin Jia led the operation under instructions from unnamed parties, collaborating with Lin Yi, Xia, Bao, and Chen to funnel client funds through multiple bank accounts registered in their names. The group converted incoming yuan payments into USDT through various Tether trading platform accounts under their control, then completed cross-border transfers through platform transactions while profiting from each exchange. The prosecution deployed specialized technical methods to overcome the inherent challenges of crypto investigation, combining financial data analysis with blockchain transaction tracing. Investigators compared temporal correlations between traditional bank accounts and virtual currency trading accounts, identifying suspicious patterns in fund flows that contradicted defendants’ claims of legitimate “ crypto speculation .” The procuratorate remotely examined data from overseas platforms to verify evidence-collection procedures, ensuring legal compliance while building their case. This “ full coverage ” approach solved what prosecutors called the “ evidence collection dilemma ” in cross-border economic crimes involving both capital and personnel across multiple jurisdictions. The Haidian District People’s Court delivered its first-instance judgment on March 21, 2025, with all five defendants accepting their sentences without appeal. The case provided authorities with what they described as “ key judicial practice references ” for handling similar crypto-related financial crimes in an increasingly digital world. Beijing Escalates Stablecoin Warnings Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China, issued stark warnings at the same Financial Street forum, calling stablecoins a threat to global financial stability and monetary sovereignty. “ Stablecoins, as a form of financial activity, still cannot meet the basic requirements of financial supervision ,” Pan stated, citing failures in customer identification and anti-money laundering compliance. The central bank chief emphasized that stablecoins “ have amplified weaknesses in the global financial system ” and expose vulnerabilities for terrorist financing and money laundering. Pan confirmed that the PBoC would maintain its zero-tolerance policy toward private digital currencies while closely monitoring developments in the overseas stablecoin market. These warnings come as stablecoin markets reached around $310 billion in capitalization, with Tether and USD Coin accounting for about 84% of the combined supply (59% and 25%, respectively) and processing over $46 trillion in settlements annually. Source: DefiLlama Tech Giants Forced to Abandon Hong Kong Stablecoin Plans Ant Group and JD.com halted their stablecoin issuance plans in Hong Kong following direct instructions from the PBoC and Cyberspace Administration of China in mid-October. Officials told both companies that the right to issue currency must remain exclusively with the state, not private enterprises. The intervention reversed earlier momentum, as Ant had announced in June plans to pursue stablecoin licenses in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg. Despite the setback, Ant filed trademarks in Hong Kong for virtual assets and blockchain technology , including “ ANTCOIN ,” while its Whale blockchain platform processed one-third of global payment transactions valued at over $1 trillion last year.

Meanwhile, the Chinese government appears to be the limiting factor to adoption. Last month, Hong Kong’s stablecoin licensing regime attracted 77 expressions of interest from banks, technology firms, and Web3 startups, with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority conducting preliminary meetings while cautioning that only limited licenses would be approved initially.

As 2025 approaches its final quarter, one project is quickly earning that label: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.035, this DeFi token has already raised over $18.1 million and gathered more than 17,500 holders, but some analysts believe it could still be the cheapest 20x opportunity. Presale Momentum and Investor Growth Mutuum Finance’s presale is now in Phase 6, and interest is accelerating fast. Each token is priced at $0.035, and once this phase sells out, the price will rise to $0.04, followed by a launch price of $0.06. The presale follows a fixed-price and limited-allocation structure, where each stage has a set number of tokens. Once the allocation is sold, the price moves to the next tier. This design has created steady demand as buyers rush to secure tokens before the next price jump. So far, Mutuum Finance has raised more than $18.1 million, sold over 780 million tokens, and onboarded 17,500 holders — figures that rival projects which are already live. With the total supply capped at 4 billion MUTM, and 45.5% allocated to the presale, the project maintains a balanced and transparent distribution model. What Mutuum Finance Is Building At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that aims to make DeFi more secure and transparent. The protocol allows users to supply liquidity, earn interest, or borrow assets directly through smart contracts. A key part of the ecosystem is mtTokens — yield-bearing ERC-20 tokens that represent a user’s deposit plus accrued interest. They give depositors a simple way to track and withdraw their assets while earning passive income. Mutuum Finance also features a buy-and-distribute model, where a portion of the platform’s revenue from lending fees is used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market. These purchased tokens are then redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This mechanism creates constant buying pressure, helping strengthen the token’s price over time. Security has been a major focus from the start. The project successfully completed a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 Token Scan score, which is considered an excellent rating for smart-contract safety. Combined with a $50,000 bug bounty program, Mutuum Finance has positioned itself as one of the more transparent and reliable early-stage DeFi projects on the market. Stablecoin, Oracles, and Analyst Price Forecast Mutuum Finance’s roadmap includes plans to introduce an on-demand, over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. This token will be minted and burned through the platform’s lending protocol, and interest generated from stablecoin loans will go directly to the treasury. That structure creates a continuous income loop that strengthens both the ecosystem and the value of MUTM. The team also plans to integrate Chainlink oracles and other decentralized data feeds to ensure accurate and real-time price information for supported assets. Reliable oracles are critical for DeFi lending protocols because they prevent liquidation errors and keep lending markets stable during volatility. Analysts covering the DeFi sector are bullish on Mutuum Finance’s future. Based on current presale momentum, planned feature releases, and its revenue-driven token model, several forecasts suggest that MUTM could rise to between $0.60 and $0.70 within 12–18 months after launch — roughly a 15–20x increase from the current presale price. They note that projects like Aave followed similar early patterns: strong audits, clear lending models, and rapid post-launch adoption that pushed their native tokens to record highs. Many believe Mutuum Finance could follow that same trajectory, given its strong fundamentals and early-stage positioning. V1 Launch and Whale Participation The next major step for Mutuum Finance is its V1 protocol launch , set to go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This event will introduce the project’s main components, including the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot — all essential for a fully operational lending ecosystem. The launch will initially support ETH and USDT, chosen for their stability and liquidity, before expanding to other major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Once live, this milestone will mark Mutuum Finance’s shift from a presale project to a working protocol, a development that often drives major investor confidence. Presale activity has already shown strong signals from large holders. On-chain data indicates that multiple whales have made six-figure purchases during the recent phase, with one investor reportedly acquiring $150,000 worth of MUTM tokens in a single transaction. Analysts say this kind of participation signals institutional interest — something rarely seen at this stage in a DeFi project’s life cycle. Whale accumulation matters because it shows confidence from experienced investors who often enter early in projects with strong fundamentals. Combined with a growing retail base, this mix of participants creates a healthy market structure heading into launch. Why Mutuum Finance Could Be the Cheapest 20x Opportunity Mutuum Finance has several factors working in its favor: a clear roadmap, working product timeline, sustainable token mechanics, and visible investor traction. Its ability to combine revenue generation with real DeFi functionality gives it an edge over meme-driven projects that rely purely on community momentum. At $0.035, the token remains accessible to early buyers, but that window may close soon as Phase 6 nears sellout. Once it transitions to Phase 7 at $0.04 and then to the $0.06 launch price, the opportunity for early entry will narrow quickly. The project’s buy-and-distribute model, stablecoin development, and on-chain lending revenue give it real value beyond speculation. This structure also explains why analysts see it as one of the potential best crypto to buy now, expecting strong post-launch appreciation.

This token is rapidly gaining attention in the crypto community due to its affordable entry point and robust presale performance. The Rising Star of DeFi: Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is not just another token in the vast crypto space. It is a decentralized platform designed to revolutionize how lending and borrowing are done in the blockchain world. With a current valuation of just $0.035 per token and over $18.1 million raised in the recent phase of its presale, it is positioned as a potentially lucrative investment. The design of its presale, which features a structured pricing tier that increases with each phase, has fueled rapid acquisition among crypto investors, pushing the total number of token holders to over 17,500. Presale Dynamics and Strategic Token Distribution The presale of Mutuum Finance is strategically structured into phases, with the price set to increase from the current $0.035 to $0.04, and eventually to $0.06 at launch. This pricing strategy not only incentivizes early investment but also manages demand across different investor tiers. Currently, with 45.5% of its total 4 billion MUTM tokens allocated for presale, the project ensures a balanced distribution, setting a solid foundation for future market stability. Innovative Features and Platform Security At the heart of Mutuum Finance is a platform that supports decentralized finance by allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn through its protocol. This is facilitated by mtTokens, yield-bearing tokens that represent the user’s stake and accumulated interest, enhancing the transparency and efficiency of digital asset management. Security is also a top priority, evidenced by a successful CertiK audit and a $50,000 bug bounty program, ensuring the platform's robustness against potential threats. Upcoming Developments and Market Positioning Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance plans to implement a stablecoin system and integrate Chainlink oracles for enhanced price accuracy and stability. These features are poised to further establish its market position and attract a broader user base. Moreover, with a projected price increase to $0.60-$0.70 post-launch, as estimated by industry analysts, the potential for a significant return on investment is evident, especially when compared to similar projects like Aave which have seen substantial growth after their initial launches. Strategic Market Movements and Whale Interest The anticipation for Mutuum Finance's V1 protocol launch on the Sepolia Testnet is building, with significant interest from large-scale investors or 'whales' who have reportedly made substantial purchases in recent phases. This level of interest, combined with the project’s development trajectory and early presale success, suggests that Mutuum Finance could indeed be the most undervalued 20x opportunity as we head into the last quarter of 2025.

The digital asset world is buzzing. OKX, a leading global exchange, has announced the imminent listing of new OKX perpetual futures contracts for ENSO and OL. This opens fresh avenues for traders to capitalize on market movements with significant leverage. Are you prepared? What Are OKX Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? OKX perpetual futures are advanced trading instruments. They let you speculate on an asset’s price without owning the underlying crypto. Unlike traditional futures, they lack an expiry date, offering flexibility. This flexibility, with leverage, can amplify potential profits – but also risks. The core appeal is leverage. OKX offers up to 50x leverage for both ENSO and OL contracts. This means small capital can control a larger position, potentially multiplying returns. However, leverage is a double-edged sword; it magnifies losses quickly. Diving into ENSO and OL: New OKX Perpetual Futures Contracts Today marks a significant milestone. OKX has confirmed the following schedule: ENSO/USDT Perpetual Futures: Launching today at 10:00 a.m. UTC. OL/USDT Perpetual Futures: Following shortly at 10:15 a.m. UTC. Both listings provide a chance to engage with ENSO and OL price movements. ENSO is known for its decentralized exchange aggregator. OL is associated with the OEC ecosystem. These new OKX perpetual futures listings offer direct exposure without needing spot tokens. This benefits those hedging positions or speculating on future price directions with enhanced capital efficiency. Navigating the Exciting World of OKX Perpetual Futures Trading Trading perpetual futures demands a solid grasp of market dynamics and risk management. While 50x leverage is alluring, approach these contracts with a well-thought-out strategy. Start with smaller positions if new to leveraged trading. Setting stop-loss orders is indispensable to protect capital from market reversals. Benefits for traders include increased liquidity. Listing on a major exchange like OKX brings more trading volume, leading to tighter spreads. Also, profit from both rising and falling markets. Traders can go “long” or “short,” offering flexibility. However, challenges exist. High volatility in crypto markets, with significant leverage, means rapid price swings can lead to quick liquidations. Careful position management, continuous monitoring, and adapting your strategy are paramount. Your Action Plan for Trading OKX Perpetual Futures Ready for action? Here are actionable insights before trading ENSO and OL perpetual futures on OKX: Educate Yourself: Understand perpetual futures mechanics, margin, funding rates, and liquidation risks. OKX academy offers resources. Start Small: Begin with a modest portfolio portion to familiarize yourself with the platform. Risk Management: Always implement stop-loss orders. Never risk more than you can afford. Use isolated margin. Stay Informed: Monitor news for ENSO, OL, and the broader crypto market. Practice: Utilize demo accounts or paper trading to test strategies. Approach these new OKX perpetual futures listings with caution and a defined plan to unlock exciting trading opportunities. The listing of ENSO and OL perpetual futures on OKX is a significant development. With up to 50x leverage, these contracts offer immense potential and considerable risks. Success hinges on discipline, understanding, and robust risk management. As OKX innovates, staying informed and strategic is key to navigating these dynamic markets. Frequently Asked Questions About OKX Perpetual Futures Q1: What are the key differences between spot trading and OKX perpetual futures? A1: Spot trading involves buying actual crypto.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced updated guidance on Wednesday, alongside a sector-wide no-action position that runs until June 30, 2026. ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said, “ distributed ledger technology and tokenization are reshaping global finance ,” and that the guidance provides regulatory clarity that enables firms to innovate confidently in Australia. The regulator granted an in-principle decision to provide relief for distributors of certain stablecoins and wrapped tokens, with feedback invited on draft relief instruments until November 12. Licensing Requirements The updated Information Sheet 225 clarifies that many widely traded digital assets constitute financial products under current law and will remain so under proposed government reforms. Service providers dealing with these assets must hold Australian Financial Services licenses, ensuring consumers receive full legal protections and allowing ASIC to act against harmful practices. ASIC will factor in the current no-action position when considering historical conduct, but will continue pursuing egregious behavior involving significant consumer harm or widespread systemic misconduct. The regulator also proposed extending omnibus account structures for digital assets under specified conditions, amending existing custody standards to accommodate blockchain-based holdings. The framework builds on practical relief ASIC provided this year to facilitate the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Project Acacia , a research project examining wholesale tokenized asset markets. Australia's central bank progresses Project Acacia CBDC testing with 24 industry participants conducting real-money transactions as potential economic gains reach AU$19B annually. #CBDC #Australia https://t.co/r5LIhbazpc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 10, 2025 Government Reforms Drive Comprehensive Digital Asset Framework The guidance aligns with the Australian government’s broader digital asset platform reforms, with draft legislation released in September proposing penalties of up to 10% of annual turnover for platforms breaching new rules. The proposal requires exchanges and operators to secure Australian Financial Services licenses, with firms facing fines of A$16.5 million, three times the benefit gained, or 10% of annual turnover for misleading conduct and unfair contract terms. Australia is set to slap crypto platforms with fines as steep as 10% of turnover under tough new draft rules, the Treasury said Thursday. #Australia #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/eVdrLlJgnd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 The consultation period for the draft law closed on October 24, which was one of the most significant moves yet to regulate an industry that includes major global players such as Coinbase and Kraken. Smaller platforms holding less than A$5,000 per customer and processing under A$10 million in annual transactions will be exempt from full licensing requirements. Treasury officials said the new regime will bring digital asset and tokenized custody platforms under the Corporations Act, extending consumer protections and formal licensing requirements. Regulators’ efforts are a balancing act as they seek to protect investors without stifling innovation in a market where Australia’s crypto adoption rate reached 31% in 2025 , up from 28% in 2024, according to a16z’s State of Crypto 2025 report. Source: a16z Stablecoin Market Expansion ASIC granted class relief in September for intermediaries distributing stablecoins issued by licensed Australian Financial Services providers, exempting them from the need for separate market, clearing, and settlement licenses until June 2028. Catena Digital Pty Ltd became the initial qualified issuer for its AUDM stablecoin, with ASIC planning to extend relief to additional licensed issuers addressing commercial viability concerns raised during consultation. The temporary relief responds to industry feedback warning that stablecoin distribution faced significant barriers under existing licensing regimes, with issuers indicating operations would lack commercial viability without intermediary exemptions. Distributors must provide Product Disclosure Statements to retail clients as the sole condition for accessing relief, while maintaining consumer protection standards and reducing operational barriers. Australia's crypto adoption hits 31% outpacing other developed nations as stablecoins power $46T in transactions and crypto market cap crosses $4T globally. #Australia #Crypto #Adoption https://t.co/ujNdEiEQDn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 24, 2025 Australia is growing rapidly in adoption. According to a16z’s State of Crypto 2025 report , Australia and South Korea lead developed nations in token-related web traffic, with the country’s adoption indicators showing activity focused more on trading and speculation than in other markets. Self-managed superannuation funds now account for a quarter of the pension system, with crypto exposure jumping sevenfold since 2021 to A$1.7 billion across Australia’s $2.8 trillion pension pool.

Its Phase 6 pre-sale has already raised more than $18.15 million, with more than 80% of tokens already sold and only a short window remaining for investors to grab allocations at the current price of $0.035 per token. The level of buying has produced a stampede of FOMO as early investors are eagerly looking at the potential of what may be a 10x return when MUTM goes live on major exchanges. Mutuum Finance is being likened to Solana in terms of how it has the potential to shake up the DeFi sector. As the supply continues lagging behind the demand and presale tokens are rapidly diminishing, Mutuum Finance is selling a new crypto with high likelihood of attracting serious market interest so the early adopters and DeFi fans can jump ship onto a high-potential project before the next huge price increase. At $200, Solana (SOL) Is Facing Major Resistance. Solana (SOL) is testing a large resistance zone, that is, it is testing the same price zone that it was its price high last week namely; the resistance zone is at $199-200. A clean breakout would create the opportunity of a charge towards $210 plus but a failure to do so may trigger a short term fall as the investors reprice momentum. This tier indicates the volatility as well as the potential upside in the existing crypto market. As SOL must deal with such resistance, new-upside potential investors are also looking at new cryptos that have growth potential in the nascent stage. One of them is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is a rapidly growing DeFi token and whose unique approach to lending assets, combined with its presale momentum, offers an alternative means of expecting next-breakout opportunity. It is one of the best crypto to purchase according to the early adopters of DeFi who are serious about making good returns. The Ultimate Presale of the Year Since beginning its multi-stage crypto presale in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recorded an all-time high traction. Presale phases provide investors with an unconditional visibility of future price growth that is expected, and early riders with an opportunity to make money on titanic potential gains. Having a value of $0.035 in Phase 6, MUTM token had increased by almost 3 times in value, starting with the value of $0.01 in Phase 1, delivering people who invested early in the project a near 3x profit. At this presale stage, it has raised 18.15 million funds, invited more than 17,550 investors and sold an astonishing 80 percent of Phase 6. By the time this stage is achieved, the token will have increased by 14.3% in value to 0.04 during Phase 7 and this once again indicates that the demand is increasing. This gigantic traction solidly makes MUTM the best crypto to purchase prior to the subsequent massive market movement, an early-stage advancement high DeFi asset. Of the entire supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, 1.76 billion will be applied in presale, and over 760 million have already sold out in previous rounds. This persistent sell-through is testament to intense investor demand from both retail and institutional investors, with many six-figure whale donations. This persistent rate of accumulation is testament to how much more the market believes in Mutuum Finance’s long-term vision and its genuine DeFi utility than speculation frenzy. It also confirms MUTM as a new crypto capturing serious investor attention. Lending and Borrowing on Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance lending protocol contains a stable borrowing rate mechanism that serves to make the borrower’s experience more predictable and the platform as a whole more rate-stable. Stable rates are calculated through a weighted average of the current variable rate at the moment and current market conditions. Fixed rates are wiser because fixed rates represent a hedge against future volatility in interest rates and are therefore usually charged slightly more than variable rates, a fair trade for more stability and less exposure to volatility. These stable rates, however, do not stay fixed. The protocol also features a dynamic rebalancing process triggered by abnormally high levels of market volatility. If, for instance, the prevailing supply rate falls to 90% or lower than would be seen with freely variable borrowing, the system is capable of raising the borrower’s stable rate to reach liquidity equilibrium and improve platform stability overall. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $18.15 million from 17,550+ investors, with 80% of Phase 6 at $0.035. Its dual-lending strategy, stable lending rate, and potential for passive income make it bring true DeFi utility, and this makes MUTM the top crypto to buy in 2025 while also representing a new crypto for those seeking early-stage innovation.

In this case, the TD Sequential indicator, a tool known for predicting market turning points, has triggered a fresh sell signal, according to insights from cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez. In an X post on October 29, the analyst noted that the TD Sequential has consistently identified trend reversals for XRP over the past three months. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Each previous instance marked a notable shift in price momentum, often preceding sharp declines after local highs. The latest signal, appearing as XRP hovers near recent recovery levels, suggests the token could be approaching another correction phase. Based on Martinez’s outlook, XRP has previously turned lower each time the TD Sequential signaled exhaustion, first near $0.74, then $0.68, and later around $0.62, each followed by substantial pullbacks. The current setup mirrors those past conditions, strengthening the bearish outlook. If historical accuracy holds, XRP could retreat toward the $2 psychological level, especially if selling pressure accelerates. Such a drop would align with the broader cryptocurrency market cooling. Whales offloading XRP Meanwhile, this technical warning is backed by whale activity, as large holders appear to be offloading. Data shared by Martinez on October 28 indicated that despite XRP’s recent surge, whales took advantage of the price rebound to secure profits. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1983157300362915934 Addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP collectively offloaded more than 140 million tokens in the past few days, signaling a potential cooling in momentum. XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.63, having plunged 0.5% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe, the token is up almost 10%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, at the current price, XRP is sitting right on its 200-day simple moving average ( SMA ), a level that often acts as a key indicator of long-term trend direction. However, the 50-day SMA at $2.79 remains above the current price, suggesting that short-term momentum is still weaker and the asset may face resistance around that zone. On the other hand, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 51.69, signaling a neutral stance with neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This indicates that XRP is in a consolidation phase, where price direction could shift depending on whether bulls manage to reclaim the 50-day SMA or bears push it below the 200-day average.

In fact, it’s becoming even more critical than ever, for data is no longer just about analytics and insights – more than ever, it has become the engine that’s driving the growth of the artificial intelligence industry. But just like oil, it seems that good quality data is a finite resource, and that means the AI industry simply can’t get enough of it. Enter OORT , a decentralized data cloud for AI, which has just announced the global launch of its DataHub Launchpad . The company is pitching the new service as the “TikTok for Data”, but unlike other data-focused startups, it’s actually trying to kill two birds with one stone. In addition to catering to AI developers, it’s simultaneously tackling another very real problem – growing Web3 communities. But how? Quite simply, it pays people to provide that data and join Web3 communities. The platform works like a marketplace, where AI projects and social media influencers can create “campaign types” and advertise what they need. AI data collection campaigns are for AI developers, who will describe the type of data they want, so contributors can go off and collect it, earning rewards for doing so. Social media campaigns are different, and involve influencers and brands creating data tasks that incentivize followers to do the data collection for them. For instance, a social media personality might request people to upload videos or images of colorful hair styles for an image database to their Instagram account and tag them in it. Followers will earn incentives for doing this, similar to an online quest platform such as Zealy. There are also survey campaigns, these involve collecting feedback from users regarding different products and services. In every type of campaign, users are rewarded for their participation in the shape of OORT tokens. So, projects to pay a global audience to drive community growth and create the high-quality AI training data they need, which influencers and brands can expand their online communities through incentives. OORT launched DataHub Launchpad in early access for whitelisted projects last month, and from today it’s now open to anyone who wants a low-cost source of quality data, community engagement or a chance to earn a bit of money on the side. “It’s a win-win: projects get the diverse, human-generated data they desperately need, while users get rewarded for their time and contribution,” OORT founder and Chief Executive Dr. Max Li promised. “We’re excited to see a vibrant community grow around this concept, similar to how platforms like TikTok have connected creators and audiences.” Although the platform is only just opening up, OORT has already built a solid community of data creators and they’ve gotten a fair bit of work done already. In July, their contributions were curated into the company’s first image dataset and listed on data marketplaces including Google Cloud’s Analytics Hub, the Databricks Marketplace and the Snowflake Marketplace. The dataset is available, either in whole or in part, to any enterprise that needs a set of high quality images for AI training, with prices ranging from two cents to 10 cents per image. To ensure that each contributor is rewarded fairly, the data they provide is tokenized on the blockchain, which means it can be traced back to its source. This allows OORT to reward each individual who provided an image every time a company pays to access it. OORT’s DataHub Launchpad represents one of the first real-world tests to see how far decentralized data collection can go towards fulfilling an extremely urgent demand. The internet has almost been exhausted, and the proliferation of AI-generated content makes it much less useful for AI developers. But much of the rest of the world’s data is owned by private companies that either don’t want to share it, or charge a high price for doing so. That’s why OORT thinks there will be big demand for the high-quality, targeted datasets it aims to provide. The platform can also aid in community growth. Far too brands, projects and wannabe influencers struggle to attract an audience, yet building a sustainable community following is absolutely essential to their success. OORT is offering them a way to do that by rewarding followers for their interactions, as well as the opportunity for additional revenue streams when they monetize the datasets their fanbase creates. If OORT can help individuals and projects to build up an audience while simultaneously feeding the AI frenzy, its DataHub Launchpad really could be something special.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-29 09:33:39

This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a significant stride in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly evolving digital asset market. This collaboration marks a pivotal moment, signaling growing institutional confidence and participation. What Does This Institutional Crypto Options Trade Involve? This groundbreaking transaction focused on cash-settled Bitcoin and Ethereum options. These are financial contracts giving the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price. Cash-Settled: Settlement is in fiat currency, not physical crypto. This allows for exposure without direct custody. Hedging: Both firms used these options to manage exposure to crypto price volatility, a common risk mitigation strategy in traditional finance. OTC (Over-the-Counter): The trade was executed directly between the two parties, allowing for customized terms and privacy, unlike public exchange trades. This use of familiar financial instruments for institutional crypto options is crucial. It shows how established banks integrate digital assets into existing frameworks, making crypto more accessible for a broader institutional audience. Why is This Institutional Crypto Options Deal a Game Changer? This collaboration isn’t merely a transactional milestone; it represents a profound shift in how major financial institutions view and interact with the crypto space. Here’s why it’s so significant: Mainstream Validation: Engagement from Goldman Sachs and DBS signals legitimacy and maturity for the digital asset market. Risk Management Innovation: Options for hedging demonstrate sophisticated risk management applied to crypto, essential for attracting more institutional capital. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Adapting traditional instruments for digital assets fosters a more interconnected global financial ecosystem. Regulatory Progress: Such transactions often pave the way for clearer regulatory frameworks, as regulators observe regulated entities in action. Asia’s Growing Influence: DBS’s involvement highlights Asia’s increasing importance, suggesting its market frameworks will align with global institutional standards. This move by two major banks suggests that the era of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is already here, moving beyond speculation to strategic financial integration. What’s Next for Institutional Crypto Options and Digital Assets? The completion of this inter-bank trade opens doors to a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into mainstream financial services. We can anticipate several key trends: Increased Institutional Participation: More banks, hedge funds, and asset managers will likely explore similar hedging mechanisms and direct crypto exposure. Development of New Products: This success could spur the creation of diverse crypto-linked financial products, including structured notes and swaps, tailored for institutional investors. Enhanced Market Liquidity: Greater institutional involvement typically leads to deeper liquidity, reducing volatility and making the market more efficient. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: Increased participation by regulated entities will likely accelerate comprehensive regulations for digital assets, including specific guidelines for institutional crypto options . Challenges like regulatory uncertainty, technological complexities, and market volatility remain, but the momentum is undeniable. Institutions are finding ways to navigate these complexities, pushing the market forward. Conclusion: The landmark institutional crypto options trade between Goldman Sachs and DBS marks a crucial turning point for the digital asset landscape. It’s a clear indicator that major financial players are not just observing but actively participating in shaping the future of crypto, bringing sophisticated financial tools and risk management practices to this nascent market. This collaboration underscores a growing confidence in digital assets and paves the way for further integration of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. The future of finance looks increasingly digital, and this partnership is a powerful testament to that transformation.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/global-payment-giant-visa-launches-support-for-four-new-stablecoins-and-four-blockchains-details-here/,"Global payments giant Visa is preparing to offer support for four different stablecoins on four separate blockchains as part of its strategy to expand its crypto services. Visa Launches Support for Four New Stablecoins and Four Blockchains The move aims to expand Visa's stablecoin-based services globally, company CEO Ryan McInerney explained at the 2025 fiscal year-end investor meeting on Tuesday. “We are starting to support four stablecoins running on four different blockchains, enabling conversion from two different currencies to over 25 traditional fiat currencies,” McInerney said. Visa already supports stablecoins like USDC, EURC, PYUSD, and USDG on Ethereum, Solana, Stellar, and Avalanche. The new expansion will further strengthen the company's presence in the stablecoin ecosystem. The CEO noted that stablecoins have gained particularly strong momentum, noting that over $140 billion in crypto and stablecoin transaction volume has been processed through Visa since 2020. He also emphasized that stablecoin-linked card spending quadrupled in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to last year. McInerney stated that Visa's next step will be to develop stablecoin solutions for banks. The company will begin supporting banks to mint and burn their own stablecoins through the Visa Tokenized Asset Platform. It also aims to increase the use of stablecoins in international money transfers through its Visa Direct service. *This is not investment advice.

All defendants pleaded guilty and accepted prison terms ranging from two to four years, without plans for appeal. A report released by the Beijing Municipal People’s Procuratorate on October 28 highlighted the case to demonstrate its high-quality and efficient performance in the financial sector (2024-2025). It was discovered that the gang used cryptocurrency as a means to transfer funds across borders illegally between January and August 2023. Under the instruction of others, Lin Jia colluded with Lin Chen, Bao, Yi, and Xia to use multiple bank cards under their names, which were linked to an illegal foreign exchange company upstream. Through these cards, the five reportedly received large sums of RMB funds from clients, such as Liu and others. Lin Moujia converts received RMB to USDT through Tether accounts 北京检察院披露借助虚拟货币变相买卖外汇案：涉案金额超11亿元 买美股算不算？？ — 茄哥币富 🔶BNB🔶DOGE (@qqzsss) October 29, 2025 The report revealed that Lin Moujia and others swapped the received RMB with USDT through multiple Tether accounts under their control. They then completed cross-border transfers through platform transactions as a cover to disguise the forex activity from which they profited. The five defendants, including Bao Moumou and Xia Moumou, moved amounts ranging from over RMB 149 million to over RMB 469 million. However, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate (BMP) said it has successfully thwarted new crypto crimes by establishing a comprehensive evidence system and optimizing its case-handling strategies. Meanwhile, it acknowledged the challenges posed by the high concealment in crypto transactions. It also acknowledged the difficulty in obtaining cross-border data evidence and the ease with which criminals confuse the nature of their activities. The BMP further explained that it has restructured its case-handling approach by merging crypto characteristics and transaction patterns, using financial data as a starting point. The procuratorate now compares temporal correlations between bank and crypto trading accounts and analyzes abnormal fund flows. It boasted of accurately identifying multiple anomalies by tracing crypto transactions in real-time. The Beijing Municipal Procuratorate also noted that it faces more formidable challenges from highly professional, technical, and covert financial criminals. It asserted that it is committed to handling each case efficiently despite crypto criminals developing increasingly sophisticated methods and complex patterns. Court rules out crypto speculation as an unreasonable excuse Based on evidence presented in the case, the court reportedly ruled out crypto speculation as an unreasonable excuse for the defendants. Instead, it considered the defendants’ subjective knowledge of their illegal forex trading activities. The court ultimately achieved a precise crackdown on new crypto-forex crimes and provided a reference for handling similar cases in the future. The procuratorate also said it has established a targeted evidence collection plan that combines standardized review and technology empowerment. First, it entrusts its technical personnel to conduct technical collaboration and remotely examine the contents and paths of data retrieved from overseas by investigators. It then fully reproduces the entire evidence collection to ensure the legality and authenticity of the content collected. Second, the procuratorate disclosed that it will adopt a complete coverage-typological evidence collection strategy to guide investigative agencies in optimizing evidence collection. The strategy will also strengthen the demonstration of the rationality and scientificity of the proportion of collected evidence. The procuratorate believes that this will resolve the dilemma of cross-border evidence collection, particularly for personnel-intensive or capital-intensive economic crimes. Third, the review for special audit reports and other financial evidence was optimized. The procuratorate claimed to accurately identify each defendant and form a solid evidence system by verifying on-chain data. It emphasized that this laid a foundation for accurate conviction and sentencing, effectively solving the evidence collection problem in crypto crimes. The BMP also stated that it will continue to intensify its efforts to penalize financial criminals in key areas and expand research into emerging financial crime patterns, among other initiatives. It vowed to strengthen the effectiveness of its legal supervision and promote collaborative efforts in combating crypto crimes. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A prominent market analysis firm, 10x Research, has issued a compelling report suggesting a remarkable 70% probability of MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion this year. This isn’t just a fleeting rumor; it’s a detailed assessment, indicating that even if broader market conditions become challenging, this monumental event remains highly likely. For investors and market watchers alike, this potential inclusion represents a powerful validation of MicroStrategy’s unique strategy and the growing influence of digital assets. What’s Driving This High Probability for MicroStrategy S&P 500 Inclusion? According to the report, shared by Cointelegraph, the current odds for MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion are estimated at a robust 70%. This isn’t a speculative guess but a conclusion drawn from MicroStrategy’s unique position and financial performance. The firm’s strategic embrace of Bitcoin has not only differentiated it but also positioned it for significant financial milestones, even amidst a volatile global economy. What makes this forecast particularly intriguing is the resilience it implies. Even if the wider economic landscape faces headwinds, the specific factors contributing to MicroStrategy’s potential inclusion appear to be strong enough to withstand such pressures. This speaks volumes about the company’s financial health, its consistent growth trajectory, and its growing influence within both the tech and crypto sectors. The Bitcoin Advantage: A Catalyst for MicroStrategy S&P 500 Inclusion A major turning point is anticipated with MicroStrategy’s upcoming third-quarter earnings announcement, scheduled for October 30. This report is expected to reveal substantial profits, specifically an estimated $3.8 billion, derived directly from its considerable Bitcoin holdings. 10x Research highlights these impressive earnings as the crucial catalyst needed to reignite and solidify expectations for the company’s entry into the prestigious S&P 500 index. Significant Profitability: The projected $3.8 billion in Bitcoin profits demonstrates a strong financial performance, a key criterion for S&P 500 eligibility. This level of profitability is not easily overlooked by index committees. Strategic Asset Management: MicroStrategy’s bold strategy of holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset is now yielding substantial returns, attracting serious attention from traditional financial analysts and fund managers. Market Re-evaluation: These earnings will undoubtedly force a re-evaluation of MicroStrategy’s intrinsic value, its long-term viability, and its suitability for one of the world’s most influential stock indices. This financial strength, underpinned by its digital asset strategy, positions MicroStrategy as a unique candidate, bridging the gap between traditional enterprise software and the innovative world of cryptocurrency. Why Does S&P 500 Inclusion Matter for MicroStrategy? The implications of MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion extend far beyond just prestige. Joining the S&P 500 would bring a cascade of benefits, fundamentally altering MicroStrategy’s market standing and investment profile. It represents a significant validation of its business model. For one, it would significantly increase the company’s visibility among institutional investors. Index funds and ETFs that track the S&P 500 would be mandated to purchase MicroStrategy shares, creating a massive influx of passive demand. This automatic buying pressure could lead to enhanced stock liquidity, a tighter bid-ask spread, and potentially a higher, more stable valuation for the company. Moreover, inclusion often translates to a lower cost of capital for the company, as its perceived risk decreases. It signals a stamp of approval from the traditional financial world, legitimizing MicroStrategy’s unique business model and its significant Bitcoin exposure to a broader, more conservative investor base. This could also open doors for easier access to financing for future growth initiatives. Looking Ahead: Key Dates and Expectations for MicroStrategy S&P 500 Inclusion All eyes will be on October 30, the date of MicroStrategy’s third-quarter earnings announcement. This event is not merely a routine financial update; it is poised to be a pivotal moment for the company’s future trajectory. Analysts and investors will scrutinize the report, particularly the Bitcoin-related profits, for confirmation of the strong financial health and consistent profitability required for index inclusion. If the earnings report meets or exceeds expectations, the conversation around MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion will intensify dramatically. It would likely trigger a fresh wave of positive sentiment and increased analytical coverage, further bolstering the 70% probability outlined by 10x Research. This period could see significant market movement in MicroStrategy’s stock as the anticipation builds. The path to S&P 500 inclusion requires consistent profitability, a substantial market capitalization, and sufficient liquidity. MicroStrategy’s recent performance, especially its Bitcoin-driven profits, suggests it is actively meeting these stringent criteria, making its case for inclusion increasingly compelling. The company’s ability to generate significant earnings from its non-operating assets is a unique differentiator. In conclusion, the prospect of MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion this year is not just a possibility but a highly probable outcome, according to leading market analysis. The anticipated $3.8 billion in Bitcoin profits from its third-quarter earnings are set to be the decisive factor, propelling the company into a new era of mainstream financial recognition. This move would not only validate MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin strategy but also open doors to unprecedented institutional investment and market visibility, marking a significant milestone for both the company and the broader digital asset space. It’s a testament to how innovative strategies can bridge traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the estimated probability of MicroStrategy’s S&P 500 inclusion this year? According to 10x Research, there is a high probability of around 70% for MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the S&P 500 this year. What role do Bitcoin profits play in this potential inclusion? MicroStrategy’s projected $3.8 billion in profits from its Bitcoin holdings during the third quarter are expected to serve as a major catalyst, solidifying its financial health and making its case for inclusion more compelling. When is MicroStrategy’s next key earnings announcement? MicroStrategy is scheduled to announce its third-quarter earnings on October 30, an event that analysts believe will be crucial for its S&P 500 prospects. What are the main benefits of S&P 500 inclusion for MicroStrategy?

A US senator warned that crypto bills might not pass until early 2025, and that delay has community members looking at coins already delivering progress like AVAX and TON right now. MoonBull ($MOBU) taps into the hottest trading excitement in 2025 with community-powered tokenomics that reward early conviction. This best crypto presale combines meme energy with real mechanics that work for everyday market participants. It is already turning attention its way with features built for long-term holders.

Half of the total 73.2B supply is directed to the stage-based sale, meaning the community controls most of the token supply instead of whales taking over. Liquidity of 7.32B tokens remains locked for 2 years, keeping the market stable and providing deep trading support. A strong 20% allocation goes into staking at a 95% APY during the early launch, which powers long-term holding. The 11% referral share gives both referrers and referees a 15% bonus, sparking organic growth and keeping the hype active. Extra value comes from burns and community incentives that reward participation while reducing tokens in circulation. Influencer and team allocations stay locked for months with vesting to secure commitment and prevent dumps.

If someone joined in the early stages with $15,000 in $MOBU, the current Stage 5 shows an ROI of over 163.36% already. At a listing price of $0.00616, the projected ROI could reach 9,256%, turning that same $15,000 into serious, life-changing value. 23 total stages give room for viral growth without losing scarcity.

Avalanche price charts show clear recovery patterns forming with rising holder confidence at 168.24K members. The FDV stands at $14.5B while the 24h volume ratio stays strong at 5.45%. Current data suggests AVAX has upside potential if the broader market catches a Q4 bounce into November. Toncoin (TON) Price News Shows Resistance Break Attempts: Can It Run? Toncoin price today sits at $2.21 with a $5.59B market cap and $146.6M in daily volume, signaling strong liquidity. Analysts track a bullish falling wedge pattern that shows TON bouncing from lower support levels. This chart structure gives community members hope for short-term gains. Toncoin latest news highlights target levels at $2.36, $2.85, $3.60, $4.22, $5.08, and $6.65 if the wedge confirms. Market watchers believe a breakout could shift sentiment quickly. Community interest and daily returning activity give TON energy that could support a strong finish going into late Q4. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Will Flex the Hardest in Q4? Can the best crypto presale really outperform established coins amid delays in US crypto regulations? The MoonBull presale price of $0.00006584 offers a low entry, and the 15% referral rewards help community members stack more tokens while waiting for the next stage price lift, which could come within days. Avalanche and Toncoin show solid positions supported by liquidity and strong charts. MoonBull ($MOBU) could still deliver faster growth, as Stage 5 is far from its planned listing value.

After coming back to retest its bull market parabola, Bitcoin (BTC) looks ready to make its way back to its own all-time high. Is this just the beginning of a future huge move? U.S. stock market breakout Source: TradingView While a large majority of respected economists and analysts continue to sound the alarm on the U.S. as well as the global economy, the above weekly chart for the S&P 500 Index is painting a spectacularly different picture. The Index has just broken out of an ascending channel that had its first beginnings back in January 2018. The same doomsayers would argue that this rise just isn’t sustainable. However, one might look at the gold and silver prices. Both have just had quite a rapid correction, but both have now just as quickly rallied back above supports. Global liquidity to dry up, but the trend is up That said, according to Michael Howell, founder and CEO of Crossborder Capital, global liquidity is about to dry up. However, he says that it’s important to differentiate between the cycle and the trend. The cycle might be reaching its peak, but the trend of sound value assets like gold and Bitcoin should continue to rise against debasing fiat currencies. So, as far as the cycle goes, could Bitcoin now enter into its final stage, and could we see a proper cycle top? $BTC breakout arriving soon Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC reveals that the price is still holding above the major trendline. A breakout should be arriving soon as the price runs into the descending trendline (faint dotted line). Given that the Stochastic RSI indicators for this time frame have just ticked up, the breakout would be more likely to the upside. A higher high above $116,430 would be the first target. W pattern playing out so far Source: TradingView The daily chart gives a better view of the W pattern that formed below the major trendline. So far, this has broken to the upside and has now come back to confirm the break at the neckline. A bounce would be expected from here. Huge 8-year trendline breakout on the horizon Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for the $BTC price illustrates the trajectories of this, and the previous bull markets. It can be seen that either the 8-year ascending trendline or the current bull market parabola will have to break. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are coming down fast. Could they begin to reverse at the 25.00 level, as has happened before? The weekly Stochastic RSI indicators have already bottomed and crossed back up, so if the 2-week indicators also do so, this will signal massive upside price momentum. A break above the 8-year trendline looks to be the more probable outcome. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The feature becomes effective October 30, 2025, at 8 a.m. UTC, with full rollout expected by November 3, 2025, at 6 a.m. UTC. The new functionality is designed to enhance trading efficiency and responsiveness by dynamically adjusting funding rate settlement frequencies in line with real-time market conditions. When a Perpetual Contract’s funding rate reaches its preset upper or lower limit during settlement, the system will automatically shift the settlement frequency to once per hour. This adjustment allows funding rates to more accurately reflect prevailing market dynamics and volatility. According to Bybit, future updates to funding rate limits and settlement frequencies will be implemented automatically and may occur without separate announcements. Operational Example If a Perpetual Contract initially settles every four hours—at 4 a.m., 8 a.m., and 12 p.m. (UTC+8)—and carries upper and lower limits of ±2%, the system will behave as follows: Scenario 1: If the funding rate reaches ±2% at 8 a.m. (UTC+8), the settlement frequency will automatically change to once per hour, with the next settlement occurring at 9 a.m. (UTC+8). Scenario 2: If the funding rate is 1% at 8 a.m. (UTC+8), the frequency remains unchanged. Reversion and Adjustment Timing Following an automatic change to hourly settlements, the system may revert to longer intervals—every two, four, or eight hours—depending on market conditions, without prior notice. The adjustment is typically completed within about four minutes. For example, if the rate reaches the limit at 8 a.m. (UTC+8), the new frequency will be visible by 8:04 a.m. (UTC+8). Scope and Exceptions Bybit noted that the automatic adjustment feature may be disabled for certain contracts based on liquidity or volatility considerations. The feature will not initially apply to BTCUSDT, BTCUSDC, BTCUSD, ETHUSDT, ETHUSDC, ETHUSD, ETHBTCUSDT, or ETHWUSDT Perpetual Contracts. Funding Rate Settlement Schedule (UTC+8) Every 8 hours: 12 a.m., 8 a.m., 4 p.m. Every 4 hours: 12 a.m., 4 a.m., 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m., 8 p.m. Every 2 hours: 12 a.m., 2 a.m., 4 a.m., 6 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 12 p.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 6 p.m., 8 p.m., 10 p.m. Bybit stated that traders can review the latest settlement frequency directly on the platform to adapt their strategies as market conditions evolve. #Bybit / #CryptoArk About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 60 million users.

The recent surge in the US Dollar , driven by renewed trade optimism and anticipation surrounding the upcoming Federal Reserve decision, sends ripples across all financial markets, including digital assets. While seemingly distant, these traditional finance movements significantly influence capital flows, investor sentiment, and ultimately, the stability and valuation of cryptocurrencies. Staying informed about these shifts can provide a clearer picture of potential market directions. The Resurgence of the US Dollar: What’s Driving It? The US Dollar has recently demonstrated notable strength against a basket of major currencies. This upward trend is not accidental but a confluence of several factors creating a powerful tailwind for the greenback. Investors often flock to the dollar during times of uncertainty, viewing it as a safe haven asset. However, the current momentum is also fueled by more positive economic indicators and specific policy expectations. Economic Resilience: Data points suggesting robust economic activity in the United States often bolster confidence in the dollar. Strong employment figures or better-than-expected GDP growth can signal a healthy economy, attracting investment. Yield Differentials: Higher bond yields in the U.S. compared to other major economies can make dollar-denominated assets more attractive, drawing in foreign capital and boosting demand for the currency. Global Liquidity: As the world’s primary reserve currency, demand for the dollar for international transactions and debt servicing remains consistently high. Trade Optimism: A Catalyst for Dollar Gains One of the primary drivers behind the dollar’s recent gains is a palpable sense of trade optimism . News and developments indicating progress in international trade relations, particularly between major economic blocs, tend to reduce global uncertainty and encourage risk-on sentiment in some areas while strengthening the dollar due to its reserve status and perceived stability. Historically, trade disputes have created volatility and dampened global economic prospects. Conversely, any sign of de-escalation or progress in trade negotiations can inject confidence into markets. This confidence can manifest in various ways: Factor Impact on Trade Optimism Effect on US Dollar Positive Trade Talks Reduces uncertainty, boosts global growth expectations Increases demand for the dollar as a stable, reserve currency Reduced Tariffs/Barriers Facilitates international commerce Strengthens economic outlook, supports dollar Strong Export Data Signals healthy global demand for US goods Directly supports the dollar’s value When businesses anticipate smoother international trade, they often feel more secure in their investments and expansion plans, which can have a ripple effect across currencies. The Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Role: What to Expect? All eyes are on the upcoming Federal Reserve decision. The Fed, as the central bank of the United States, holds immense sway over global financial markets. Its monetary policy decisions directly impact the value of the US Dollar , interest rates , and overall economic conditions. Investors and analysts are keenly watching for signals regarding: Interest Rate Hikes: Will the Fed continue its tightening cycle, pause, or even hint at cuts? Each scenario carries significant implications for borrowing costs and currency valuations. Quantitative Tightening (QT) / Easing (QE): The Fed’s balance sheet operations, either reducing (QT) or expanding (QE) its holdings of government bonds and other securities, affect the money supply and long-term interest rates. Economic Projections: The Fed’s updated forecasts for inflation, GDP growth, and unemployment provide crucial insights into its future policy path. Forward Guidance: Any statements or hints about future policy actions are closely scrutinized, as they can preemptively move markets. A hawkish stance (favoring higher rates) typically strengthens the dollar, while a dovish stance (favoring lower rates or easing) can weaken it. The market’s reaction will hinge on how the Fed’s communication aligns with or deviates from current expectations. Understanding Interest Rates and Their Global Impact Interest rates are a fundamental tool of monetary policy, and their trajectory has profound effects on currency valuations and investment flows. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it generally makes dollar-denominated assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, more attractive to global investors. This increased demand for dollar assets translates into increased demand for the US Dollar itself, driving up its value. Conversely, lower interest rates can make a currency less appealing to foreign investors seeking higher returns, potentially leading to capital outflows and a weaker currency. The differential between interest rates in different countries is a key factor influencing the Forex Market . For instance, if the U.S. offers significantly higher rates than Europe, investors might move capital from euro-denominated assets to dollar-denominated ones, strengthening the dollar against the euro. Higher interest rates also impact domestic borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, influencing economic activity and inflation. This complex interplay of factors is what makes central bank decisions so impactful. Navigating the Dynamic Forex Market The Forex Market , or foreign exchange market, is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, where currencies are traded. The recent strength of the US Dollar against other major currencies is a prime example of the market’s dynamic nature. Currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY are constantly reacting to economic data, geopolitical events, and central bank announcements. Key aspects of the current Forex Market environment include: Dollar Index (DXY): This index measures the dollar’s value against a basket of six major currencies. A rising DXY indicates broad dollar strength. Emerging Market Currencies: A strong dollar can put pressure on emerging market currencies, especially those with dollar-denominated debt, as it makes their debt more expensive to service. Commodity Currencies: Currencies of commodity-exporting nations (like the Australian Dollar or Canadian Dollar) often react to global commodity prices and trade sentiment. Understanding these interdependencies is vital for anyone tracking global finance, including those in the crypto space, as movements in the Forex Market can signal shifts in global liquidity and risk appetite. How Do These Macro Trends Impact Cryptocurrency? While cryptocurrencies often operate independently, they are not immune to traditional market forces. A strengthening US Dollar and rising interest rates can have several implications for the crypto market: Reduced Risk Appetite: Higher interest rates make safer, fixed-income investments (like U.S. Treasuries) more attractive. This can lead investors to pull capital from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin Dynamics: Stablecoins pegged to the dollar, such as USDT or USDC, become more appealing as a holding asset within the crypto ecosystem during periods of dollar strength, offering a temporary haven from crypto volatility. Liquidity Squeeze: A strong dollar can indicate tighter global liquidity conditions, which can sometimes lead to selling pressure across various asset classes, including crypto. Capital Flows: Global capital flows, influenced by interest rate differentials and economic outlooks, can indirectly affect the amount of money available for speculative investments in crypto. Crypto investors should monitor these macro indicators to better gauge the broader financial environment their digital assets operate within. Challenges and Risks on the Horizon Despite the current wave of trade optimism and dollar strength, several challenges and risks could alter the trajectory of the Forex Market and broader financial landscape: Inflationary Pressures: Persistent inflation could force the Federal Reserve to adopt a more aggressive stance on interest rates , potentially slowing economic growth. Geopolitical Tensions: Unforeseen geopolitical events can quickly erode trade optimism and introduce new layers of market uncertainty, leading to shifts in currency preferences. Global Economic Slowdown: A significant slowdown in major economies outside the U.S. could eventually drag down U.S. growth, impacting the dollar’s strength. Policy Missteps: Any perceived misstep by the Federal Reserve in managing inflation or growth could trigger market volatility. These factors highlight the complex and often unpredictable nature of global finance, requiring constant vigilance from investors. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors, particularly those with exposure to cryptocurrencies, understanding the current macro environment offers actionable insights: Monitor Fed Communication: Pay close attention to the Federal Reserve’s statements, press conferences, and economic projections. These provide direct clues about future interest rates and monetary policy. Track Economic Data: Keep an eye on key economic indicators from the U.S. and major global economies, such as inflation rates, employment reports, and GDP growth. Diversify Portfolios: While crypto offers unique opportunities, a diversified portfolio that considers traditional assets and their relationship with the US Dollar can help manage risk. Assess Stablecoin Holdings: Recognize that dollar-pegged stablecoins gain relative strength during periods of dollar appreciation, potentially offering a temporary hedge within the crypto space. Stay Informed on Trade News: Developments in international trade can quickly shift market sentiment, affecting risk assets and currency valuations. Being proactive in observing these trends can empower better decision-making in a rapidly evolving financial world. Conclusion: Navigating a Dynamic Financial Landscape The recent ascent of the US Dollar , driven by robust trade optimism and the looming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates , underscores the intricate web of global finance. These macro-economic forces exert significant influence across all asset classes, including the increasingly interconnected cryptocurrency market. While the immediate outlook suggests continued dollar strength, the Forex Market remains highly sensitive to new data and policy shifts. Staying informed about these crucial developments is paramount for investors seeking to navigate the complexities and capitalize on opportunities in today’s dynamic financial landscape. The interplay between traditional finance and the digital asset space continues to evolve, making comprehensive understanding more valuable than ever.

Its primary roles include conducting the nation’s monetary policy, supervising and regulating banking institutions, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. Q2: How do interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve impact the US Dollar? A2: When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates , it generally makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to global investors seeking higher returns. This increased demand for U.S. assets leads to a higher demand for the US Dollar , thus strengthening its value against other currencies. Q3: What does ‘trade optimism’ mean for global markets? A3: ‘ Trade optimism ‘ refers to a positive sentiment among investors and businesses regarding international trade relations. It typically implies expectations of reduced trade barriers, fewer disputes, and smoother global commerce. This often leads to increased investor confidence, potentially boosting economic growth and impacting currency valuations in the Forex Market . Q4: Who is the current Chair of the Federal Reserve? A4: The current Chair of the Federal Reserve is Jerome Powell . He plays a key role in guiding the Fed’s monetary policy decisions and communicating them to the public. Q5: How does a strong US Dollar affect countries with dollar-denominated debt? A5: A strong US Dollar can significantly impact countries, particularly emerging economies, that have substantial debt denominated in dollars. As the dollar strengthens, it becomes more expensive for these countries to repay their dollar-denominated debt using their local currencies, potentially leading to financial strain and increased debt burdens. This can be a major concern for entities like the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The study emphasizes Bitget’s $23.1 billion trading volume, which places it second among global exchanges, and the quick growth of its institutional clientele, which positions the platform as a significant liquidity hub in the evolving digital asset market of 2025. The report indicates that institutional participation on Bitget increased significantly this year, with institutional spot trading volume increasing from 39.4% in January to 72.6% in July . Similar trends were seen in futures activity, where market makers increased from 3% of volume at the beginning of the year to over 56.6% by the middle of the year . These shifts have coincided with record order-book depth and consistent spreads across major trading pairs, including BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, and SOL/USDT, metrics now on par with those of the largest global exchanges. “Bitget’s progress this year has been backed by measurable improvements. Order book depth and execution metrics now track closely with that of other CEXs, while reported institutional volume on its spot markets has risen from under 40% to over 70%. With observed tightening in spreads, greater depth, and a wider presence of funds active on the platform, Bitget appears to be evolving in line with features typically associated with institutional-grade venues,” said Nicolai Søndergaard, Research Analyst at Nansen. Bitget’s liquidity depth is still one of the most consistent in the industry. Bitget’s Amihud illiquidity ratio of 0.0014, which is in close alignment with other top platforms, and its Roll spread estimate of 9.02 basis points, which places it close to the global median, were also highlighted in the report. Even during times of high volatility, these results demonstrate consistent order-book depth, low slippage, and tight execution . “Liquidity is the heartbeat of any market, and institutional investors know it’s what separates speculation from structure,” said Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget. “Our evolution into a Universal Exchange (UEX) is about giving these participants more than access; it’s about giving them confidence. We’re building an ecosystem where institutions and retail traders operate on the same solid foundation, from execution to custody.” The platform’s institutional loan and custody infrastructure has also expanded significantly. Bitget now provides tailored lending programs offering up to $10 million USDT with flexible terms, cross-collateral support for 300+ assets, and integrations with major custodians, including Fireblocks, Copper, and OSL. Bitget’s shift into a Universal Exchange (UEX) marks a defining phase in its growth. By bridging centralized and decentralized finance, Bitget is building a unified framework for trading, investing, and liquidity provisioning. Its combination of deep order books, institutional tooling, and tokenized market access signals a broader transformation of crypto exchanges into full-scale financial gateways. Institutional adoption is no longer a trend, it’s the structure of the market. Execution quality and liquidity are emerging as the new standards of trust as professional funds, corporate treasuries, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) increase their holdings. Bitget’s ongoing rise in this market demonstrates its capacity to uphold institutional norms while redefining what an exchange in the UEX era can be.

The project launched its presale quietly but has already built momentum through clear token rules and a capped supply that rewards early participation. With bigger coins moving slowly, traders are rotating into smaller projects that still have room to grow. To understand why, it helps to look at what makes low-cap launches so appealing right now. Best Cheap Crypto to Buy Now – Why Low-Cap Coins Are Gaining Attention Low-cap cryptocurrencies are becoming a key focus for traders who want higher upside potential without needing a massive investment. Unlike top-tier assets that already carry huge market caps, smaller coins can move faster when demand rises. Many of these projects, like Noomez ($NNZ), are launching with transparent supply limits and community-driven presales. The appeal lies in accessibility, as a few hundred dollars can still make a noticeable difference in holdings. As presales grow more structured and public audits become common, low-cap launches are attracting both retail and early institutional attention. Noomez ($NNZ) Launches With a Deflationary Presale Model Built for Growth Noomez ($NNZ) is a new meme coin built on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) with a total supply of 280 billion tokens . Half of that, 140 billion , is being released through a structured 28-stage presale that started this week. Prices begin at $0.00001 and rise gradually to $0.0028 by the final stage, allowing early buyers to secure lower-cost entries. Each stage lasts up to seven days and closes automatically once sold out. Key structure details: Stages 1–7: 12.7 billion tokens each Stages 8–14: 5 billion tokens each Stages 15–21: 2 billion tokens each Stages 22–28: 300 million tokens each This setup rewards early interest while maintaining long-term scarcity. Vault Events, Staking Rewards, and Airdrops Keep Noomez Competitive Noomez is an excellent, cheap presale coin thanks to its powerful combination of features. Vault Events Add Real Incentives During Presale Noomez introduces two major milestones called Vault Events at Stage 14 and Stage 28 . The first includes a 14 million $NNZ airdrop and a large supply burn. The second goes further with a 28 million $NNZ reward, NFT drops, USDT prizes, and a final burn before launch. These events mark progress, reward holders, and reinforce the project’s deflationary structure. Dual Staking Rewards Encourage Long-Term Holding The staking system operates in two parts. During presale, users can lock $NNZ for rewards that vest 30 days after launch . Post-launch, holders can stake for 30 to 365 days , earning higher yields for longer terms. This setup gives the best cheap crypto to buy right now ongoing earning potential without constant trading. Stage X Million Airdrops Build Fair Engagement Each presale stage ends with a Stage X Million Airdrop , where one wallet wins a token amount equal to the stage number, for example, Stage 10 gives 10 million $NNZ . Every buyer who spends at least $20 per stage gets a fair, single entry. The process is transparent, removing the advantage of large investors and keeping community engagement active throughout the sale. Why Noomez Stands Out Among New Low-Cap Launches Beyond its presale mechanics, Noomez ($NNZ) introduces long-term value through the Noom Engine , a system that automatically distributes partner tokens to all holders without manual claiming or gas fees. Projects that collaborate with Noomez contribute part of their supply, which will give $NNZ holders ongoing rewards long after launch. Liquidity will be locked permanently, and team wallets follow a six to twelve-month vesting schedule for stability. These transparent mechanics position Noomez as a structured, community-driven launch designed to keep value flowing well beyond its presale.

Nasdaq’s Record Recalls 2021 BTC Pattern",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-poised-for-new-run-beyond-125000-nasdaqs-record-recalls-2021-btc-pattern/,"The second part of the year has seen a notable surge in the US stock market, while Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market has faced its share of uncertainty and significant corrections. With the Nasdaq recently surpassing the 26,000 mark, leading analysts are now suggesting that this milestone could be a clear indicator for Bitcoin to finish the year at new highs. What Historical Patterns Indicate According to experts at The Bull Theory, the pattern observed with the Nasdaq reaching all-time highs typically suggests a flow of liquidity, an increased risk appetite, and a shift of capital into growth assets. As this phase develops, it often sets the stage for Bitcoin’s next significant movement. Related Reading: China Intensifies Crypto Crackdown With Latest Warning Against Stablecoins Data compiled by the analysts supports this assertion. Historically, in the first 30 days following a Nasdaq all-time high, Bitcoin has averaged a gain of approximately 7%. This return tends to grow, reaching about 14% within 60 days and climbing to an average of 25% by the 90-day mark. This pattern is not merely coincidental; it reflects a capital rotation where liquidity does not disappear but instead shifts from traditional markets into higher-risk assets like Bitcoin. The current situation appears to follow a similar trajectory. The Nasdaq’s rise to 26,000 indicates a wave of liquidity building beneath the surface. With rate cuts beginning and quantitative tightening coming to an end, global capital is once again seeking yield. This scenario mirrors the conditions that contributed to Bitcoin’s significant breakouts in previous years, particularly in 2017, 2020, and 2023. As such, the analysts note that the next four to five months may represent an acceleration phase for Bitcoin, coinciding with a potential pause in equities, which could lead to crypto becoming the primary outlet for liquidity. Bitcoin Poised For Breakout Similar To 2020-2021 Cycle Analysts like Ash Crypto also noted on social media that the BTC/NASDAQ weekly chart is revealing a repeating pattern reminiscent of the 2020-2021 cycle, during which Bitcoin significantly outperformed traditional tech stocks. In both cycles, the October to March timeframe has historically prompted major upward movements. Related Reading: The Next Chapter For Crypto: Legislative Clarity, Institutional Support Set Stage For Major Growth After a period of consolidation within a rising wedge, the BTC/NASDAQ pair appears poised for another breakout. Should this pattern repeat, Bitcoin may see substantial gains compared to the Nasdaq in the fourth quarter and into early 2026, Ash Crypto noted. Notably, this sets the stage for a major rally that could see Bitcoin prices surpassing current records of over $126,000. However, the market is still characterized by increased volatility, and there is no clear path ahead for BTC. The leading cryptocurrency is trading at $113,350 after a 2% correction in Tuesday’s trading session, following an initial surge above $115,000. This puts BTC 6.5% below record highs.

This time, traders are turning their focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Instead of hype-driven tokens like Dogecoin, they are watching a project built on real decentralized finance utility. With strong presale momentum and growing community trust, many now see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best crypto to invest in before its price climbs higher. DOGE Price Prediction Bearish The analyst anticipates that Dogecoin’s price may decline by the stated end date, according to quantitative analysis and current market indicators. The take-profit level simply outlines a potential price range within this timeframe — it is not a guarantee that the price will reach it. Traders are advised not to go all-in or use leverage aggressively. Allocating only a portion of available capital helps maintain balanced risk exposure. This strategy aligns with institutional-style portfolio management rather than the high-risk, all-or-nothing methods often promoted on social media. Performance is evaluated across the full analysis window, whether or not the take-profit level is achieved. This outlook remains valid until November 19, 2025, after which the data and market conditions will be reassessed. The analysis will be reviewed and updated every 28 days to ensure alignment with evolving technical and macroeconomic trends. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Growth and Expanding Reach Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035 per token. From a total of 170 million tokens set for this phase, most have already been taken by early supporters. Across all rounds, the project has generated about $18.1 million and attracted more than 17,500 holders. These numbers reflect how quickly traders are joining before the next price step. The next phase, Phase 7, will increase the price to $0.040. That’s a 15 percent rise, showing clear confidence in the token’s growing demand. The total supply of MUTM remains fixed at four billion, giving clear visibility to participants. With the dashboard already live, investors can easily view their holdings and track presale progress in real time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only growing fast but also introducing features that stand out in the DeFi market. Its design focuses on creating value through real use, not speculation. The platform will include both Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending systems, making it flexible for every kind of user. Under the Peer-to-Contract model, users will lend assets like USDT or ETH into shared liquidity pools and earn interest as borrowers use those funds. The Peer-to-Peer option will allow users to agree on personal lending terms directly with each other. This dual model blends stability and flexibility, meeting the needs of both retail and professional traders. The first version of the protocol , expected to go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, will include the Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and Liquidator Bot modules. TAt the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This early testnet launch gives users a chance to explore the platform’s core functions before the full release. Allowing hands-on testing helps build trust and excitement, which could attract more users and positively impact the token’s value. How Utility Creates Real Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses a strong demand-based structure. Every time someone lends, borrows, or stakes, it requires MUTM tokens. This creates continuous buying pressure as users interact with the platform. Lenders will earn interest through mtTokens, which represent their share in the pool and the rewards they have gained. Those mtTokens can be staked in special contracts to earn even more MUTM rewards. The platform will use the revenue generated from its lending and borrowing activities to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. The purchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This buy-and-distribute process supports long-term engagement, rewarding loyal participants and encouraging consistent staking activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to release its beta version around the token’s public debut. The beta will allow users to experience lending, borrowing, and staking features firsthand. Such access usually brings a rush of new interest as more people explore how the system works. Each new user who interacts with the platform adds real transactional demand for the MUTM token, strengthening the ecosystem’s value loop. Community Building and Early Investment Advantage The team is hosting a $100,000 giveaway where ten winners will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. To bring more excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already launched its leaderboard and dashboard. The leaderboard highlights the top fifty contributors, rewarding them with extra MUTM tokens. A 24-hour bonus also gives the top trader each day a reward of $500 in MUTM. These programs make the ecosystem interactive and keep participants active. Traders who joined early have already seen impressive returns. For example, someone who bought in Phase 2 at $0.015 with $10,000 now holds tokens valued around $23K at the current $0.035 price. Once Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches the $1 mark after its listing, that same holding would grow to about $666K. This kind of clear, number-backed growth shows why many see it as the best crypto to invest in before wider market exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also caught the attention of those tracking the growing crypto ETF trend. As more institutions look toward DeFi-based opportunities, projects that combine usability, transparency, and steady buyback mechanics stand to gain most. With Phase 6 nearly sold out and the next round priced higher, timing is key. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands ready to become the next major breakout in the crypto market, showing real potential to reach $1 — not through hype, but through a growing base of users, real transaction activity, and constant market demand.

Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has just dropped an exciting announcement that’s set to shake up the derivatives market. Today, the platform is launching AT perpetual futures , offering traders a powerful new instrument to engage with the market. This development introduces a new trading avenue for the AT token, promising significant opportunities for those ready to navigate the dynamic world of futures trading. What Are AT Perpetual Futures and Why Are They Important? For those new to the concept, perpetual futures contracts are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, hence the term ‘perpetual.’ The upcoming AT perpetual futures contract on Binance will be paired against USDT, a stablecoin, providing a stable base for price discovery. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Price Speculation: Bet on both rising (long) and falling (short) prices of AT. Increased Liquidity: Futures markets often boast higher liquidity, which can lead to tighter spreads and better execution prices. The significance of this listing cannot be overstated. It provides a sophisticated tool for traders to manage risk, hedge existing spot positions, or simply capitalize on market movements for the AT token. Unlocking Opportunities with Binance’s AT Perpetual Futures One of the most compelling features of this new listing is the leverage. Binance will support leverage of up to 50x for the AT perpetual futures contract. Leverage allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 50x leverage, a $100 investment can control a position worth $5,000. This high leverage can amplify potential gains significantly. Traders can take advantage of even small price fluctuations in AT to generate substantial returns. Furthermore, the 24/7 nature of crypto markets means opportunities are always available, allowing for flexible trading strategies. However, it is crucial to understand that while leverage can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases the risk of losses. Responsible trading and robust risk management strategies are paramount when dealing with high leverage products like AT perpetual futures . Navigating the Risks: What Traders Need to Know About AT Perpetual Futures While the prospect of 50x leverage is enticing, it comes with inherent risks. High leverage means that a small adverse price movement can lead to rapid liquidation of your position, resulting in the loss of your entire margin. Therefore, understanding and managing these risks is not just advisable, but essential. Key Risk Management Strategies: Start Small: Begin with a small portion of your capital to gain experience. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses automatically. Understand Margin: Be aware of your margin requirements and liquidation prices. Educate Yourself: Continuously learn about futures trading and market dynamics. Binance’s platform offers various tools to help traders manage their risk, including different order types and margin modes. Utilizing these tools effectively is key to a sustainable trading journey with AT perpetual futures . How to Get Started Trading AT Perpetual Futures on Binance Getting started with trading AT perpetual futures on Binance is straightforward for existing users. First, ensure your Binance account is verified. Then, you’ll need to transfer funds to your futures wallet. The contract goes live at 11:30 a.m. UTC today, so prepare in advance! Actionable Steps: Log in to your Binance account. Navigate to the Futures trading section. Transfer USDT from your spot wallet to your futures wallet. Select the AT/USDT perpetual contract. Place your orders, remembering to consider your risk tolerance and leverage settings. Always remember to trade responsibly. The excitement around new listings like AT perpetual futures can be high, but a disciplined approach is vital for long-term success in the volatile crypto market. In conclusion, the listing of AT perpetual futures on Binance opens up a significant opportunity for traders seeking to capitalize on the AT token’s price movements with enhanced leverage. While the potential for substantial gains is evident, it is equally important to approach this new instrument with a thorough understanding of the associated risks and a commitment to sound risk management practices. This move further solidifies Binance’s position as a leading platform for advanced crypto derivatives, offering diverse tools for its global user base. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price of an underlying asset without an expiry date. It continuously rolls over, unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed settlement date. Q2: What is the maximum leverage offered for AT perpetual futures on Binance? Binance will support leverage of up to 50x for the AT/USDT perpetual futures contract. Q3: When will the AT/USDT perpetual futures contract be listed? The AT/USDT perpetual futures contract will be listed today, at 11:30 a.m. UTC. Q4: What are the main risks associated with trading AT perpetual futures with high leverage? The main risks include potential for rapid liquidation of your position and significant financial losses due to amplified price movements. A small adverse market move can lead to the loss of your entire margin. Q5: How can I manage risk when trading AT perpetual futures? You can manage risk by starting with a small capital, utilizing stop-loss orders, understanding your margin requirements, and continuously educating yourself on futures trading strategies and market conditions.

Trump Family Token Hits Binance.US — Investors Turn to Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the Next 1000x Crypto October 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Binance.US will trade Trump-owned World Liberty Financial’s (WLFI) and USD1 tokens today onwards. Noteworthy here is the listing coinciding with President Trump facing political backlash for the pardon of Binance’s CZ . On other news, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff passing a resolution condemning the pardon, calling the whole deal a corrupt act that favors the Trump family crypto interests. Alt text: Post on Binance.US’s X page about $USD1 listing. Rep. Ro. Khanna went one step ahead and proposed a legislation to ban the president , his family, and the congress from trading cryptos or stocks. Lawmakers shed spotlight on a $2B UAE-backed investment that was funnelled through World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin, connecting Binance to Trump family ventures. That said, The White House defended the pardon, calling any charges politically motivated. While the Trump-backed token drama dominates headlines, investors are exploring emerging presale opportunities with high potential. One name leading that charge is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , shaping up as the next 1000x crypto contender. Read more about $MAXI doge in our detailed guide. Can $XRP Sustain its Rally Ahead of the FOMC Rate Cut as Bitcoin Hyper Rockets Past $25M? October 29, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The risk appetite in the crypto market is improving, and XRP best represents this trend with a 9.45% surge on the weekly chart , overtaking both Bitcoin and Ethereum. As Open Interest (OI) crosses $4.5B , activity in the derivative market shows promise too. However, the OI-weighted Funding Rate has declined slightly, indicating that bears expect another test of the key support level at $2.18. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) at 51 further makes it harder to confirm whether the bullish momentum can be sustained until the potential Fed rate cut on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale has just smashed through $25M, as investors diversify their portfolios into early-stage infrastructure coins. The project is building a Layer 2 solution that could make the Bitcoin blockchain faster and easier to use. In addition, it aims to turn the blockchain programmable for a wide range of decentralized applications using SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) integration. Could $HYPER be the next 1000X crypto?

The company’s long-awaited application for a national trust bank charter with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is in the public review phase, marking a key moment in its expansion into traditional financial infrastructure. The company plans to launch the Ripple National Trust Bank . The filing positions the company to operate under federal banking oversight if approved. The move has generated renewed optimism among XRP supporters who see the development as a potential game-changer for the digital asset’s market trajectory. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) stated on X that XRP could rise to $10 in no time if Ripple’s application is approved. The comment encapsulates the sentiment that a successful charter could significantly strengthen XRP’s credibility and utility in the financial system. REMINDER: RIPPLE’S OCC BANKING LICENSE APPLICATION IS NOW PUBLIC — “RIPPLE NATIONAL TRUST BANK” ENTERS REVIEW PHASE. $XRP TO $10 IN NO TIME IF APPROVED! pic.twitter.com/tuSm8gvkh6 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 27, 2025 A Strategic Step Toward Banking Integration Ripple’s application aims to establish a federally chartered trust bank that would allow it to provide custody and fiduciary services, manage digital asset reserves, and potentially gain access to Federal Reserve payment rails through a master account. This structure could allow Ripple to handle RLUSD under direct federal supervision, reducing its dependence on third-party financial intermediaries. Such access to established banking infrastructure would give Ripple the ability to bridge digital and traditional finance within a regulated framework. The company’s focus on institutional-grade financial services aligns with its strategy to use the XRP Ledger for cross-border transactions and liquidity management. Why Approval Could Boost XRP A federally approved trust bank could enhance XRP’s standing among institutional players. By operating within a regulated banking environment, Ripple would gain a level of credibility rarely afforded to crypto-focused entities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This validation could drive greater adoption of XRP for payment settlement and liquidity provision, strengthening its fundamental use case. If Ripple secures the charter, the company could integrate XRP more deeply into its payment ecosystem, potentially increasing transactional demand for the token. The Path Ahead for XRP Ripple’s pursuit of federal oversight signals its intent to operate within the framework of U.S. financial law, which could help the company avoid regulatory uncertainty similar to its prolonged legal battle with the SEC that hindered XRP’s growth. The outcome of this application will significantly impact investor confidence and market sentiment regarding XRP. If the charter is approved, Ripple’s strengthened regulatory position may provide the foundation that analysts like Steph Is Crypto believe could send the asset toward the $10 mark.

Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped to almost $112,000, while Ethereum (ETH) and many other leading altcoins have also posted losses. Pi Network’s PI is in the opposite corner with a double-digit gain. BTC Slips Ahead of Fed’s Decision The primary cryptocurrency registered an impressive uptick on Monday (October 27), temporarily climbing above $116,000. It surpassed that level yesterday, too, but since then, BTC has been in an evident downtrend. Several hours ago, the price tumbled to approximately $112,300. The bulls managed to reclaim some lost ground, and as of this writing, Bitcoin is hovering around $113,000, representing a 1.2% decline on a daily scale. BTC Price, Source: TradingView The heightened volatility comes just hours before the FOMC meeting, during which the Federal Reserve will decide whether to raise, lower, or keep interest rates in the United States unchanged. The odds of a 0.25% drop are almost certain (according to bets on Polymarket), and we will see how the official announcement impacts the crypto sector. According to some analysts, Bitcoin is at a crossroads and its valuation could either shoot above $120,000 or collapse well below $100K. Lower interest rates are generally considered good news for bulls, as they could dampen investor appetite for traditional financial products and encourage investment in digital assets.

Three stand out not just for next week, but to hold and buy for the long term, Cardano ( ADA ), TRON ( TRX ), and Stellar ( XLM ). Each sits in or near the top 15 by market capitalization, each has unique drivers, and each is priced to capture asymmetric upside if sentiment rotates back into altcoins. Cardano (ADA) At $0.65, Cardano has gained more than 86% over the past year, though it has given back nearly a fifth of its value in the past month. Despite that pullback, ADA has remained inside the global top 10, a sign of resilience through multiple cycles. ADA 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold The most telling datapoint is on-chain: wallets holding 100,000 or more ADA grew their balances by 2.1% last week, suggesting large holders are quietly building positions. Retail flows remain mixed, but that kind of accumulation points to long-term confidence. The regulatory backdrop has also shifted. Under the U.S. CLARITY Act, Cardano is formally recognised as a commodity alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, removing a persistent source of uncertainty. On top of that, Grayscale has applied for a Cardano ETF, with Bloomberg assigning 75% odds of approval. If greenlit, it would open the door to institutional demand much like Bitcoin’s 2024 rally did. The challenge for ADA is turning technology into traction. Upgrades such as Hydra and x402 improve throughput and developer capacity, but adoption in AI and DeFi is still in its early stages. Investors are betting that if institutional inflows line up with real network utility, ADA can push back toward the $1 mark. TRON (TRX) TRON tells a very different story. Trading at $0.30, TRX is up 81% year-on-year and has fallen around 11% in the past month. Its 2024 all-time high of $0.44 is still some distance away, but the fundamentals are clear. TRX 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold The network now hosts over half of all Tether in circulation (around $78 billion) and processes more than $20 billion in daily stablecoin transfers. In Colombia, TRON accounts for an astonishing 95% of stablecoin payments, showing its real-world reach in emerging markets. On the DeFi side, new projects such as SunPerp DEX (launched Q3 2025) are adding depth, while TRON’s presence on Nasdaq-linked platforms signals its intent to bridge traditional and digital finance. Every transfer also burns TRX through transaction fees, gradually tightening supply. What makes TRON stand out is its consistency. It may not generate the same headlines as more experimental chains, but it has embedded itself into global payments infrastructure. For investors, that makes TRX one of the steadier sub-$1 assets in terms of demand and utility. Stellar (XLM) Stellar is priced near $0.32, up a remarkable 237% in the past year. Often moving in tandem with XRP, Stellar has also benefited from the momentum surrounding XRP’s ETF progress. XLM 1-year price chart. Source: Finbold The network’s next big moment is Protocol 24, due late 2025. The upgrade will bring zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for private transactions as well as more efficient smart contract execution. If it follows the pattern of the 2023 Soroban upgrade, which triggered a seven-fold increase in total value locked, Stellar could see another wave of growth. The other piece of the puzzle is real-world asset tokenisation. Stellar’s RWA sector has reached $639 million in value (+26% month-on-month), driven by Franklin Templeton’s $446 million tokenised treasury fund. Competition, however, is fierce. Ripple’s CBDC partnerships mean Stellar must fight to retain relevance in the cross-border payments sector. Not every sub-dollar token deserves attention, but Cardano, TRON, and Stellar each combine low entry points with clear catalysts. The risks remain, but so do the opportunities for outsized returns when liquidity rotates back into altcoins.

The goal is to keep real traders and communities engaged with Four.meme , by showing launches can be protected from early-entry traders. In the past, meme launches have often seen whales move in immediately to snipe the supply or trade quickly. Four.meme will instead introduce a waiting period, and if bots come in to trade early, they will lose all their winnings to fees. The fees will then be used in the launchpad’s liquidity program and token buybacks. Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao praised the change. The current fee configuration is set by the platform and may be altered for future launches. Four.meme leads fee generation among meme platforms Meme tokens are still interesting for traders, as long as they have paths to users and liquidity inflow. Four.meme is one of the platforms with the highest fee production, up to $520M annualized. For the past week, it had the highest fee production , surpassing smaller launchpads. The platform is yet to catch up with Pump.fun, but has shown significant growth in fee generation. The launchpad already locks in $7.17M in value, offering small-scale activity and retail opportunities. The platform’s fees are still volatile, peaking above $4M per day. On some days, the launchpad produces less than $1M in fees. Four.meme is constantly innovating, testing new ways to launch and curate tokens, including protected names and offering liquidity to hand-picked projects. Four.meme boosts BNB token usage Most of the Four.meme tokens use a bonding curve against BNB, boosting the token usage. The native token of BNB Chain recovered to $1,114.15 based on overall Binance ecosystem activity. So far, Four.meme has sent 9,646 graduating tokens to PancakeSwap, recently achieving record volumes on the secondary market. Graduated Four.meme tokens are boosting activity on PancakeSwap, with most of the trading against BNB. | Source: Dune Analytics Most of the volumes are against BNB liquidity, though there are options for trading against USD1 . As a whole, the ecosystem of graduating tokens from Four.meme has grown to nearly $800M in valuation. The platform remains highly active in terms of fees and activity, though still lagging behind the valuations of previous meme seasons. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Lost Its Place to These Two Altcoins!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/solana-sol-experienced-a-major-pullback-in-this-area-lost-its-place-to-these-two-altcoins/,"Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR) made their US debuts, and the anticipated ETFs have begun trading. While Solana has had great success with ETFs, it has lagged behind in another area. According to The Block, Solana's share of L1 fees has fallen to single digits. At this point, Hyperliquid (HYPE) and BNB Chain have attracted investor attention this year by increasing their share of the large Layer 1 (L1) fee market. In contrast, Solana's share of the main Tier 1 network fees fell from over 50% at the beginning of the year to just 9%. In the face of the fading decline, Hyperliquid's share rose to over 40%, while BNB Chain's share rose to around 20%. This shift has been attributed to multiple factors, including market demand, user preferences, and structural changes. The decline in Solana’s fee revenue was primarily attributed to the decline in memecoin trading on the network. Data suggests that the memecoin trading frenzy on Solana decreased sharply following the launch of the ‘TRUMP’ token earlier this year, which was the primary driver of the revenue decline. Memecoin trading once accounted for the majority of the Solana network's fee revenue, but activity has since declined significantly, reducing network traffic. In contrast, Hyperliquid and BNB Chain rapidly increased their fee share by strengthening their revenue structures focused on derivatives trading. Because derivatives trading generates higher fee revenue per transaction unit than memecoin trading, even a relatively small increase in user numbers led to a large increase in network revenue share. *This is not investment advice.

Experts predict a potential run to $3 if the key resistance level is broken. XRP ETF approval hopes and Fed rate cut fueling market optimism. Smart money is flowing into utility-focused presales ahead of altcoin season. $XRP is once again ignoring the broader market while Bitcoin and Ethereum decline red. Currently hovering above $2.65 with a cheeky 1.5% gain, $XRP didn’t get the memo that everyone else is having a bad time. According to crypto expert CRYPTOWZRD , $XRP needs to stay above the $2.62 support level, as breaking through the $2.75 resistance could lead to a surge toward $3. $XRP whales are accumulating at levels we haven’t seen before. While retail investors are doom-scrolling through red candles, smart money is quietly loading its position. Add in the potential XRP ETF approval and the Fed’s expected 25 basis point rate cut , and you’ve created a perfect storm brewing. If you’re not positioning yourself in the best altcoins to buy now, you might be late to the party. Again. While everyone’s watching $XRP test support levels with the focus of a hawk, let’s discuss three presale altcoins that could surge during this altcoin season. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Infrastructure Play Whales Are Quietly Loading Prioritize hardware support, swaps/bridges, EVM + non-EVM, and strong security (audits, phishing alerts, biometrics, social recovery/MPC). Skip custodial risk and outdated add-ons, choose speed, safety, and full control. Best Wallet is more than a wallet; it’s a comprehensive DeFi and NFT hub with a presale launchpad on the horizon. It speaks multi-chain fluently, which matters when altcoin season arrives and every chain comes to life. Remember juggling seven wallets last cycle? Yeah—Best Wallet turns that chaos into one clean, connected stack. Best Wallet token ($BEST) holders get exclusive access to early presale opportunities, reduced trading fees, and governance rights over which projects get featured on the platform. It’s a VIP pass to the hottest club filled with degens, and the bouncer is a smart contract. Currently in presale at $0.025865, the token has already raised over $16.7M from investors who clearly understand that infrastructure plays win in bull markets, including a $33K buy in just 10 hours ago. Early Best Wallet Token price predictions suggest significant upside as the platform scales and trading volume increases. When $XRP finally rips past $2.75 and sparks the altcoin feeding frenzy, you’ll want a wallet built for chaos. Best Wallet is that stack, multi-chain, fast, and battle-ready. Get in early, and you’re positioned if volumes explode at launch. Join Best Wallet token ($BEST) presale now . 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The Layer 2 That Finally Makes Bitcoin Usable Bitcoin is painfully slow with just 3-7 transactions per second . We’ve all been there, waiting 30 minutes for a transaction to confirm while watching the crypto market move without you, like you’re stuck in traffic while everyone else is already at the party. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) decided that wasn’t good enough and built a Layer 2 rollup for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper fuses Solana’s SVM with Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. Think Bitcoin’s trust with Solana-level speed: near-instant finality, tiny fees, and the same hard security that made BTC the OG. The $HYPER token is currently in presale at $0.013185, and the project has already raised over $25.1M. Whale buys of $379.9K and $274K show that smart money is recognizing that Bitcoin needs scaling solutions and Bitcoin Hyper is actually delivering. Analysts are already eyeing Bitcoin Hyper price predictions that suggest significant upside post-launch. The tokenomics are refreshing, with 30% allocated to development, as it appears they genuinely want to build something. Novel concept in crypto, I know. The presale is structured in stages with price increases as it progresses, so early birds genuinely do get better entry points. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper before the next price increase. Staking is available from day one, and with Bitcoin’s dominance likely to remain strong, regardless of what happens in the altcoin market, $HYPER offers a solid hedge that still provides sweet presale upside potential. Join Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale now . 3. DeepSnitch AI ($DSNT) – The Intelligence Edge That Separates Winners from Exit Liquidity Wouldn’t it be nice to know what the whales are doing before everyone else does? That’s exactly what DeepSnitch AI is building, and it’s about time someone did this properly. DeepSnitch combines artificial intelligence with blockchain surveillance tools to provide regular traders with the same insights that whales and institutions have been using for years. Five AI-powered tools analyze wallet movements, identify accumulation patterns, detect suspicious activity, and provide a heads-up when smart money is making moves. The DeepSnitch AI token ($DSNT) is currently in Stage 2 presale at just $0.02032, having raised over $476K. That’s dirt cheap for a project with actual utility that solves a real problem. When $XRP finally breaks through $2.75 and altcoin season goes nuclear, having DeepSnitch AI in your toolkit means you’ll see the next wave coming before most people realize there’s a wave at all. Read more about DeepSnitch AI ($DSNT). $XRP is testing support while whales stack sats and experts call for a potential run to $3. Whether you’re betting on $XRP to break through or hedging your bets with high-potential presales, position now or cry later. Best Wallet token gives you the infrastructure, Bitcoin Hyper gives you the Bitcoin upside with actual functionality, and DeepSnitch gives you the intelligence edge. If there was ever a time to position yourself for the next leg up, it’s probably now.

Key Takeaways: BitMine added 27,316 ETH worth $113 million, boosting its total Ethereum holdings to over 3.3 million ETH ($13.2B). The firm is now the largest corporate holder of Ethereum and the second-largest crypto treasury after Michael Saylor’s Strategy. CEO Tom Lee sees Ethereum as a “neutral chain” poised for institutional adoption, while cautioning that Bitcoin remains vulnerable to major market swings. The transfer allegedly came from custody platform BitGo, though the company has yet to confirm the transaction. BitMine Becomes Largest Corporate Holder of Ethereum With $13.2B Treasury Earlier this week, BitMine announced its total Ethereum holdings surpassed 3.3 million ETH, valued at around $13.2 billion. This solidifies BitMine’s position as the largest Ethereum-holding corporation and the second-largest crypto treasury overall, behind Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Led by Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, BitMine has outlined an ambitious goal of accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, positioning itself as a long-term backer of the blockchain’s expanding financial ecosystem. The firm counts heavyweight institutional supporters such as Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, Bill Miller III, Digital Currency Group, Founders Fund, Galaxy Digital, Kraken, and Pantera Capital. Lee has been vocal about Ethereum’s potential, describing it as a “truly neutral chain” likely to win favor among Wall Street institutions and US policymakers. Tom Lee( @fundstrat )'s #Bitmine just bought another 27,316 $ETH ($113M) and currently holds 3.34M $ETH ($13.3B). https://t.co/STJqKkdLMx https://t.co/EWFNQ8CMI9 pic.twitter.com/LjydR5CXVp — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 29, 2025 At press time, Ethereum (ETH) has fallen 2.36% over the past 24 hours, trading around $4,000, according to The Block’s market data. Last week, Lee also warned that Bitcoin’s volatility isn’t gone , and it could still fall by as much as half its value. His comments come amid rising optimism that Bitcoin’s price swings have softened thanks to spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased institutional participation. However, Lee cautioned that Bitcoin continues to move in tandem with traditional markets, and tends to amplify those moves. “The stock market has more frequent 25% drawdowns,” he said. “So if the S&P is down 20%, Bitcoin could be down 40%.” Lee added that while the broader economy has matured in recent years, Bitcoin’s correlation with equities means sharp corrections are still likely. Tom Lee Doubles Down on Ethereum as DAT Bubble Shows Signs of Bursting As reported, Lee has reaffirmed his bullish stance on Ethereum (ETH) , revealing a $1.5 billion purchase following last weekend’s market crash. Despite warning that digital asset treasuries (DATs) are trading below their net asset value (NAV), suggesting a potential bubble burst, Lee told Fortune he views the pullback as a long-term buying opportunity. Lee’s move was mirrored by BitMine Immersion Technologies, which accumulated 379,271 ETH worth roughly $1.5 billion across three major purchases this week, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The mining firm now holds over 3 million ETH, or 2.5% of the total supply, making it one of the largest corporate holders of Ether. BitMine reportedly aims to control 5% of all ETH in circulation, positioning itself as a key player in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The surge represents the largest year-on-year increase in crypto reporting since records began and signals growing transparency in the country’s digital asset market. Source: Skatteetaten The total value of declared cryptocurrency holdings more than doubled to NOK 40.3 billion ($3.9 billion), the highest figure ever reported. Sevenfold Growth in Crypto Declarations — What’s Behind Norway’s Tax Turnaround? Tax Director Nina Schanke Funnemark said the increase reflects the success of recent measures aimed at encouraging voluntary compliance. “It is gratifying that more people are reporting that they own cryptocurrency and in this way ensuring that the tax is correct,” she said. “We have taken several measures in recent years to increase this number, and we see that these measures are having an effect.” In 2019, fewer than 10,000 Norwegians reported owning crypto assets. That number has now grown more than sevenfold. The increase comes after the tax agency began sending out digital reminders, known as dults, to taxpayers who may own crypto or virtual assets but failed to declare them. The latest data also reflects rising market prices throughout 2024, which significantly boosted the total declared value of digital holdings. Skatteetaten noted that crypto gains reached NOK 5.5 billion, while reported losses totaled NOK 2.9 billion for the same period. Under Norwegian law, cryptocurrency is treated as a capital asset, not a currency, meaning that profits and losses from trading are subject to capital gains tax. Source: Skatteetaten The current tax rate is a flat 22%, and the same rate applies to deductions for realized losses. Gains are triggered when digital assets are sold, swapped, or used to pay for goods or services. For example, if an investor sells 1 ETH that was purchased for 20,000 Norwegian kroner and sells it later for 50,000 kroner, the 30,000-kroner profit is taxed at 22%, resulting in a 6,600-kroner liability. FIFO to Wealth Tax: How Norway Calculates and Enforces Crypto Obligations The Norwegian system uses a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method to calculate the cost basis of crypto sales, assuming the first coins bought are the first ones sold. In addition to capital gains tax, crypto holders must declare their digital assets as part of their net wealth each year. Wealth above NOK 1.7 million is subject to Norway’s wealth tax, with rates that vary based on income and municipality. Those earning from mining, staking, or airdrops must report such proceeds as regular income, which is taxed at a progressive rate depending on the taxpayer’s income level. Source: Skatteetaten Norway’s crypto taxation system relies heavily on self-reporting, meaning individuals are responsible for disclosing their own crypto activity through Skatteetaten’s online portal. Taxpayers must calculate their holdings, trades, and income in Norwegian kroner using the exchange rate on the transaction date. Failing to declare these assets can result in additional tax penalties or audits. Funnemark said many first-time filers tend to report small sums, but authorities have also uncovered large undeclared amounts through audits. Those who correct their declarations voluntarily can amend filings up to three years back to avoid penalties, provided the correction occurs before an official audit is initiated. How Far Will Norway Go to Keep Crypto in Check? The report added that from 2026, Norway’s oversight will expand further under new third-party reporting rules. Exchanges and wallet providers operating in the country will be required to report user data directly to Skatteetaten, giving the tax authority more accurate insight into residents’ crypto activity. “This is an important step towards more correct taxation of digital assets,” Tax Director Nina Schanke Funnemark said. “With this development, we will have a much better overview of who owns crypto assets, both in Norway and abroad.” Taxes collected from cryptocurrency activity in Norway flow into the country’s general government revenue, helping to fund public infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social services. Crypto-related tax income is treated no differently from that derived from stocks or other capital investments. The latest rise in declarations coincides with a broader regulatory tightening in Norway’s digital asset sector. In 2025, the government moved to align national law with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation , introducing licensing requirements for crypto service providers and stronger consumer protection rules. A temporary ban on new high-energy crypto mining projects was also announced in June, citing environmental concerns and energy conservation priorities. Norway government announces a temporary ban on new power-hungry crypto mining centers. #CryptoMining #Norway https://t.co/3MCBUdEqOc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 20, 2025 Meanwhile, the government’s ethics watchdog, which oversees the $1.8 trillion Government Pension Fund Global, in 2024 said it was preparing to investigate crypto and gambling firms in its portfolio over money laundering risks. The council’s findings could lead to divestment from some companies, reflecting Norway’s cautious but active approach to the crypto sector.

Customers will be getting the same prices and promotions, with the added benefit of using digital coins to make the payment through instant conversion to Belarusian fiat. Cryptocurrencies accepted for Geely and Belgee cars in Belarus A car dealership in Minsk, the capital city of Belarus, has launched a new service allowing buyers to spend cryptocurrency on their new vehicle. Tochka, the auto retailer, is offering the alternative payment option in collaboration with WhiteBird, one of the oldest licensed crypto platforms in the country. Belarusian media describes the initiative as the first case of integrating crypto payments in the Eastern European nation’s automotive market. Buyers can choose any of the models offered by Geely , as well as Belgee, a joint venture controlled by the Chinese automotive conglomerate and the Belarusian state-owned BelAZ. The latter is one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of large dump trucks and other heavy transport equipment for the mining and construction industries. Speaking to the Belarusian news outlet Office Life, a Tochka representative emphasized: “This is not an experiment or a promotion, but a full-fledged service operating within the legal framework of Belarus.” The spokesperson also noted Tochka embarked on the project to “meet the wishes of the modern generation of car drivers.” Crypto payments made possible through conversion to fiat Buyers can place crypto orders without even visiting the dealer’s office, as payments are processed online. They only need to contact Tochka and confirm the final price in Belarusian rubles. Customers are then transferred to a WhiteBird employee who helps them with exchanging their crypto into fiat at a preferential rate set specifically for the project. Once the transaction is finalized, the vehicle can be picked up at the showroom or delivered to any address in the territory of Belarus. Prices for crypto owners are the same as those for clients paying with rubles. They will also enjoy the same discounts for Geely or Belgee cars. The dealership expects to sell up to 10% of the cars it offers from the two brands for cryptocurrency under the newly implemented scheme. Belarus reacts to growing popularity of cryptocurrency Crypto payments have been gaining traction in Belarus, a close economic and political ally of both China and Russia, especially under Western sanctions that have restricted the access of its citizens and companies to traditional financial channels. The trend was recently highlighted by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who noted that the volume of external payments through cryptocurrency exchanges reached a record $1.7 billion in the first seven months of the year. Belarus is a regional leader in terms of efforts to regulate digital assets. It legalized crypto business for residents of the Belarus Hi Tech Park ( HTP ) in 2018, with a presidential decree signed by Lukashenko in late 2017. This year, the country’s long-term leader urged government officials and regulatory bodies in Minsk to swiftly update the national framework in order to catch up with the industry. Speaking at a conference devoted to the development of the digital token economy in early September, he was quoted by the official BelTA news agency as stating: “The task of the state in these conditions is to determine understandable, transparent rules of the game and mechanisms for control in this sphere.” WhiteBird, car dealer Tochka’s partner for the crypto payments feature, is registered at the HTP hub and is arguably the first coin trading platform to obtain a Belarusian license. In September, the exchange also helped Wildberries, Russia’s largest online retailer, to offer its Belarusian customers the option to pay with major cryptocurrencies, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The Russian e-commerce giant now accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin Tether (USDT), among others, through an integration with WhiteBird in Belarus.

This event is bringing the network one step closer to a faster and more efficient system. Developers and users are watching closely as the upgrade prepares for a December 3 mainnet release. What the Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade Does The Fusaka upgrade is designed to make Ethereum transactions quicker, cheaper and safer. It comes after a series of successful test runs on the Holesky and Sepolia networks, which have helped developers fine-tune the new system before the official rollout. The Ethereum Fusaka upgrade has gone live | source: X The Ethereum Fusaka upgrade focuses on making the network more efficient rather than adding flashy new features. It improves how data moves across the blockchain, reducing the load on validators and lowering transaction costs. One of Fusaka’s main features is Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS). This technology allows validators to check only parts of the network’s data instead of downloading everything. It cuts down bandwidth use and helps the network process more transactions in less time. Fusaka also increases the size of “blobs,” which are data packets used by layer-2 solutions such as rollups. These layer-2 systems handle large batches of transactions off-chain before settling them on Ethereum . The larger blob size means more data can fit into each block, helping the network scale for higher traffic without slowing down. How Fusaka Affects Developers and Users For developers, the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade means updating their software and testing applications to make sure that they are compatible. The new PeerDAS system and larger blob sizes may require changes to how layer-2 solutions and validators manage data. Regular users, however, will notice improvements without needing to take any action. Transactions will confirm faster and fees will drop thanks to the more efficient data handling. Because Fusaka is backward compatible, users won’t need to move their funds or change their wallets. All existing smart contracts will continue working as before. Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade and the Future of Scaling Ethereum’s development roadmap has long focused on scaling the network to handle more users and larger applications. Fusaka represents another step toward that goal. After Fusaka, Ethereum is planning more updates that will further expand blob capacity and introduce new proposals to improve efficiency. The following hard fork, known as Glamsterdam, is already under discussion among core developers. This next stage is expected to include features that separate block proposers from builders and improve fairness while reducing congestion. Each upgrade builds on the one before it. This makes sure that Ethereum can support its entire ecosystem of Dapps without compromising security or stability. What the Fusaka Upgrade Means for Ethereum’s Growth The Fusaka upgrade shows Ethereum’s steady progress toward becoming a fully scalable blockchain. The combination of PeerDAS and larger blob capacity gives developers more room to build Dapps. For users, the update promises faster transactions and lower costs. The network’s stability will also improve, which is important for institutional use and large-scale applications. Ethereum’s ongoing development pace therefore improves trust among its global community. Each upgrade, including Fusaka brings it closer to handling the heavy demands of the growing Web3 ecosystem.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-29 11:54:09

Currently trading at $113K, Bitcoin ($BTC) may be far from the $126K ATH it set just two weeks ago, but the price is at least stable for now. With the US Federal Reserve meeting today, however, things could go into a frenzy again, especially if the meeting ends with a fresh round of rate cuts. Then, all bets are off for the world’s largest cryptocurrency again, potentially leading to yet another rally. What many aren’t aware of, though, is that Bitcoin still has untapped potential considering its status. This is what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is looking to unlock, which could further drive up Bitcoin’s value in the future. The Trouble with the Bitcoin Blockchain The Bitcoin blockchain is notoriously slow, as it can only process up to seven transactions per second (TPS). Now, compare it to the Solana blockchain, for example, which can handle up to 65K , and you’ll see where the problem lies. Because of its snail-like pace, transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain tend to be super expensive too. It’s no wonder, then, that developers typically choose Solana to launch the best meme coins . Then there’s the limited use of $BTC. Sure, it’s the most valuable cryptocurrency out there, but you can’t stake it, for example.

CEO Mert Mumtaz framed the change in sweeping terms: “today, Solana changes forever… we’ve solved the biggest data/RPC problem that exists,” he wrote , arguing that the status quo—historical queries hitting Google Bigtable—has been “slow,” “expensive,” and “inflexible.” What This Means For Solana Mumtaz highlighted the practical pain point every Solana indexer or wallet developer knows: getting the “first tx for a Solana address without looping back endlessly” and pulling the “most recent 100 txs for an address” both require chaining calls and traversals that can balloon into “thousands of RPC calls.” “Not anymore,” Mumtaz said. At the heart of the release is a Helius-exclusive RPC method, getTransactionsForAddress, backed by a distributed archival storage layer that the company claims is “1,000x faster, more flexible, and more scalable.” Functionally, the method merges today’s common two-step pattern—getSignaturesForAddress to enumerate signatures, then getTransaction to hydrate details—into one call that can return fully decoded transactions, with bidirectional time ordering and range filters by slot or timestamp. Helius’ documentation spells out that it enables reverse search without back-traversal and supports pagination tuned for large, active accounts. The company also emphasizes that this is not a core Solana RPC addition; it’s a proprietary extension available on Helius nodes, priced at 100 credits per request on Developer plans and above.Performance claims span both the new method and legacy endpoints, with Helius saying getBlock, getTransaction, and getSignaturesForAddress are now “10x faster,” while the archival system under the hood delivers the headline throughput improvements for historical queries. The framing is squarely aimed at eliminating Bigtable-bound latency spikes and reducing call counts by “100x” alongside “10x lower latency” and “1000x less code.” Those assertions track with common developer complaints documented across Solana forums about slow historical hydration on busy addresses, but the hard numbers here are Helius’ own benchmarks. The strategic context matters. Solana’s on-chain activity continues to skew toward high-throughput consumer and payments use cases, which punish inefficient data access patterns. The launch landed the same day the first US spot Solana ETF went live on the NYSE —Bitwise’s BSOL. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BSOL recorded a volume of $56 million on day one. “BSOL’s $56m is the MOST of any launch this year.. More than XRPR, SSK , Ives and $MNU. And what’s amazing is it seeded with $220m. It could have invested seed on Day One, which would have resulted in $280m-ish, would be even more than ETHA’s debut . Strong start either way,” Balchunas wrote .

This marks one of the boldest national crypto initiatives in Europe. Lawmakers from the Union of the Right for the Republic (UDR) introduced a bill proposing that France purchase up to 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply over the next seven to eight years. The Bitcoin reserve bill would make France the first European nation to hold a massive strategic Bitcoin stockpile. It shows growing interest among governments for lower reliance on outdated monetary systems. What the Bitcoin Reserve Bill Proposes The proposal was introduced by Éric Ciotti (president of the UDR) and was supported by several party members. It outlines a national plan to acquire 420,000 BTC gradually through mining, public investment and strategic holdings. According to Alexandre Laizet, the Director of Bitcoin Strategy at The Blockchain Group, France intends to use nuclear and hydroelectric energy for mining. France is considering a bill to accumulate 2% of Bitcoin’s supply | source: X The mined BTC would then become part of a long-term national reserve and would be permanently held by the state. This approach shows France’s intention to combine renewable energy use with financial innovation. It also shows a trend toward using surplus electricity to support public mining efforts. This is as opposed to selling it cheaply or letting it go unused. Why France Opposes the Digital Euro Alongside the Bitcoin initiative, lawmakers are rejecting the European Central Bank’s digital euro proposal. They argue that a centralised digital currency would give authorities too much control over personal finances. The National Assembly’s resolution states that such a system could allow the ECB to monitor or freeze funds, which would threaten privacy and individual freedom. Lawmakers compared it to China’s digital yuan and warned that Europe risked repeating the same model. The ECB has been developing the digital euro over the last two years, with plans to finish the preparation phase by the end of this year and then launch around 2029. However, France’s pushback shows resistance within the bloc. A Push for Euro-Based Stablecoins Beyond Bitcoin, the Bitcoin reserve bill encourages euro-denominated stablecoins. Lawmakers want to strengthen Europe’s position in the international stablecoin market, which remains dominated by dollar-backed assets like Tether and USD Coin. Data from the International Monetary Fund shows that 91% of stablecoins in circulation are linked to the US dollar. Only a small fraction, or about $259 million in total cap, is represented by euro-backed coins. France is also pushing for Euro-backed stablecoins | source: X The bill therefore, urges the European Commission to relax regulations under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. This would make it easier for European institutions to issue stablecoins. Strengthening France’s Crypto Industry The Bitcoin reserve bill comes as France’s crypto sector expands. The country’s regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has been approving more firms under national crypto rules ahead of full MiCA implementation in 2026. The AMF recently licensed BPCE’s subsidiary Hexarq to provide crypto custody and trading services. It also approved Lise Exchange, France’s first tokenised stock platform under the EU’s Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Pilot Regime. At the same time, the ACPR (France’s banking regulator) has conducted anti-money laundering reviews of major exchanges, including Binance and Coinhouse, to make sure that they are compliant before MiCA takes full effect. Chainalysis data shows France processed about $180 billion in crypto transactions over the last year. This ranks Europe’s top three markets behind Germany and the UK.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-29 12:00:32

This milestone makes it the best ETF launch of 2025, not just in crypto but among more than 850 U.S. ETFs launched this year. A Record-Breaking Debut According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, BSOL’s $56 million in first-day volume was the highest in 2025, beating the launches of about 850 other new funds, including the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR). For comparison, on its first day, September 18, XRPR raised $37.7 million, with $24 million coming within its first hour and a half. Additionally, within five weeks, it had more than $100 million in assets under management. BSOL’s final figure outpaced XRPR’s debut returns by more than $18 million, and strong investor confidence was anticipated even before trading began. Balchunas had predicted it would hit $52 million on its opening day, which was only $4 million shy of the eventual amount. Bitwise Asset Management launched BSOL on Nasdaq under the Securities Act of 1933. This gave investors direct access to SOL with staking rewards of about 7% and no management fees for a limited time. The launch was part of a group of three new crypto funds . The other two were ETFs for Hedera (HBAR) and Litecoin (LTC), which saw first-day volumes of $8 million and $1 million, respectively. These new funds reached the market thanks to an automatic legal provision that allowed their registrations to proceed without manual sign-off from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was especially helpful because parts of the U.S. government are currently shut down. Meanwhile, Grayscale confirmed that its Solana Trust (GSOL) would convert into an ETF on October 29, further expanding investor options around the Solana ecosystem. SOL Price Action and Market Outlook Following BSOL’s debut, Solana’s market performance was mixed. As of this writing, the asset is trading at about $195, down 2.3% over the last 24 hours. However, it has risen 5.1% over the last week, suggesting that while the ETF news didn’t cause an immediate price jump, it may have contributed to positive mid-term sentiment toward the asset. Some analysts say the strong ETF debut could spark interest from more institutional investors, helping keep prices stable in the short term. SOL has dropped 7.1% in the last 30 days, but it is up a modest 7.6% over the past year. Still, its daily trading volume of $7.7 billion and a market cap of $107 billion make it one of the more liquid and actively traded cryptocurrencies in the market.

In a post dated October 28, the firm wrote that “risk appetite is returning as softer CPI data and improving Trump-Xi relations lifted markets, with yields easing and volatility declining,” adding that “Bitcoin reclaimed $115k on ETF inflows and short squeezes, while DeFi and AI sectors led the recovery.” Wintermute’s Bullish Crypto Outlook For Q4 The desk framed the impulse as both macro- and microstructure-driven. On the macro side, Wintermute pointed to “a softer US CPI print (3.0% YoY vs 3.1% expected)” and “the announcement of a Trump-Xi summit in Seoul,” which it said catalyzed “a broad rebound across assets” as the S&P 500 gained 1.9%, the VIX hovered “around 16,” and Treasury yields eased with rate-cut odds firming into this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. On the crypto side, the update said “Bitcoin performed well with a 5.3% gain, climbing above $115k… amplified by $160m in short liquidations,” while “Ethereum tracked higher toward $4,200,” and “gold unwound nearly 7% from its highs, signaling a rotation from defensive assets into risk assets.” Related Reading: China Intensifies Crypto Crackdown With Latest Warning Against Stablecoins Wintermute characterized the advance as broadening beneath the surface. “DeFi and AI names led gains on strong protocol revenue prints and improving on-chain activity,” while “Utilities and Tooling benefited from infrastructure-related rotation as new L2 deployments and restaking primitives drew liquidity.” Derivatives posture turned supportive, too: “On the perp side, funding rates turned positive again across most majors… though positioning remains far from crowded.” The firm also flagged a turn in base money for crypto beta: “Stablecoin supply is ticking higher for the first time since September, reinforcing that macro tailwinds are beginning to translate into fresh inflows. Spot demand from US spot ETFs, according to Wintermute, continues to anchor the structure even as activity cooled. “US spot BTC ETFs absorbed moderate inflows through the week even as volumes thinned, underscoring sticky structural demand.” Meanwhile, derivatives leverage “is rebuilding at a measured pace after the early-month flush,” which the firm framed as healthier—“cleaner leverage and more balanced funding.” The house view into November is unambiguously constructive and leans on seasonality and positioning. One passage distilled the stance: “While Uptober had a bit of a false start, macro tailwinds, cooling inflation, ‘stabilizing’ geopolitical tension and a dovish FED are setting the stage for a supportive rest of the year, which historically (Q4) has been the strongest for Bitcoin.” Related Reading: ‘It’s All One Trade’ — Crypto Bull Run Isn’t Done, Says Dan Morehead In its closing summary, Wintermute reiterated that “positioning is cleaner, volatility subdued, and capital rotation is gradually steering toward crypto. With liquidity conditions improving and sentiment stabilising, the setup into Q4 remains constructive, favouring further risk-on continuation.” A Decisive Week For Crypto The note drew immediate amplification from market commentators. DeFi analyst Ignas compressed the message into a trading takeaway: “Wintermute is telling you to max bid,” citing “yields… easing, volatility… down, and BTC reclaimed 115k helped by ETF inflows and short squeezes.” He highlighted Wintermute’s own line that “macro tailwinds, cooling inflation, ‘stabilizing’ geopolitical tension and a dovish FED are setting the stage for a supportive rest of the year.” Whether this marks an outright regime shift or a tactically favorable window will hinge on this week’s event risk—namely the Fed decision and any concrete outcomes from the Trump–Xi engagement. Wintermute, however, is explicit about the current state of play: markets are “rotating back into risk” with “cleaner positioning” and “calmer volatility,” Bitcoin “has reclaimed early-October losses with steady ETF inflows,” and sector leadership in DeFi and AI is consistent with an early-risk rotation. “With cleaner positioning, calmer volatility, and better macro visibility, the setup into November looks healthy for further recovery and rotation across crypto,” the firm concluded. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.78 trillion.

Today, BOS (BitcoinOS) , the unifying operating system transforming Bitcoin for digital economies, has officially launched the $BOS token at $200 million FDV, trading is live on Binance Alpha along with Kucoin, Gate, Kraken US, Bitget, MEXC, and PancakeSwap DEX. The $BOS token is positioned to fulfill critical functions, serving as the incentive layer to ensure that the BOS network remains secure, performant and decentralized. While computation and verification happen on Bitcoin, a specialized node network is required to: Generate ZK proofs from computation Monitor the system for fraudulent activity Submit challenge transactions to Bitcoin when fraud is detected Provide verification services for non-technical users BOS aims to maximum value accrual by operating a buy-and-burn mechanism. As the BOS network grows and more chains integrate, more computation will be required due to increase in transactions, resulting in more $BOS token payments. This creates a BTC-native economy where $BOS token holders effectively earn BTC-denominated returns as the network grows. The more activity on BOS, the more BTC flows into buying and burning $BOS tokens, creating deflationary pressure while rewarding network participants. Since inception, BOS has announced integrations with key projects from several ecosystems, notably Cardano, Litecoin, Arbitrum, Mode Network, RISC Zero, Merlin Chain and Nubit. BOS has also demonstrated a series of significant technological innovations that unlocks $2.2 trillion worth of Bitcoin liquidity across ecosystems and institutions. Highlights include an industry-first bridgeless cross-chain asset transfer , the launch of Charms , the first protocol for programmable tokens on Bitcoin, and the introduction of Grail Pro , an institutional-grade protocol that allows institutional BTC yield generation while retaining self-custody. The BOS Tokenomics comprises a total supply of 21 billion tokens, a symbolic nod to Bitcoin’s supply. Distribution of the tokens are as follows: Successful pre-sale and airdrop campaigns were conducted earlier in the year, accounting for 3% of the total token allocation. Those who participated in the pre-sale will be able to claim their tokens when trading begins, followed by other early supporter communities including Cardano and EVM ecosystems.

Crypto influencers Mason Versluis and Mickle have taken opposing sides in the controversy after Western Union confirmed it will build a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, USDPT, on the Solana blockchain. The remittance giant’s decision to partner with Solana, not Ripple, has fueled speculation that XRP’s long-standing dominance in cross-border payments could be under threat. Mason Versluis Calls It “Bad News for XRP” Mason Versluis reacted quickly, describing the news as “crazy” and potentially damaging for XRP. “Solana just did something crazy, and this could be bad news for XRP,” he said in a recent video. According to Versluis, “Western Union has partnered and chosen to build exclusively on Solana — not with Ripple, not with XRP.” He emphasized that this partnership is “a basic fact” rather than an opinion. “They are choosing Solana,” he continued, explaining that Western Union is rejecting the need for a bridge currency. “They are saying there is no bridge currency. There are stablecoins on Solana,” Versluis said. He added that this approach challenges Ripple’s core mission. “You guys know XRP — that’s its main mission, to be the bridge currency ,” he explained. “But what I’ve started to realize is that all crypto already does that. Crypto itself is a bridge currency.” This company will be bankrupt before it moves a billion dollars on Solana. You keep focusing on Blockbuster, I'll focus on Netflix. https://t.co/N32NhpRTjK pic.twitter.com/DbsgOqfEQT — mickle (@xrpmickle) October 29, 2025 Western Union’s Solana Partnership Western Union’s official release confirmed that the USDPT stablecoin will be launched on Solana in partnership with Anchorage Digital Bank. The company said its new “Digital Asset Network” will enable faster, cheaper, and fully compliant global payments. Western Union’s CEO, Devin McGranahan, described the initiative as a vital step toward digital modernization. “As we evolve into the digital-assets space, Western Union’s USDPT will allow us to own the economics linked to stablecoins,” McGranahan stated. The company plans to integrate the stablecoin into its international transfer system, linking on-chain liquidity to its massive global network. The rollout is scheduled to begin in early 2026. Solana was chosen for its transaction speed and scalability, as well as its ability to process thousands of payments per second at minimal cost. Western Union aims to merge its decades of compliance experience with Solana’s blockchain efficiency. Is This a Threat to XRP? Versluis believes the decision undermines XRP’s unique role as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. “They are propagating this idea that there is no bridge currency,” he said. “They are saying stablecoins are the bridge currency.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 However, XRP supporters argue that Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity network remains unmatched in its ability to settle multi-currency transactions instantly. Stablecoins like USDPT, they note, are pegged to a single fiat currency and therefore lack true interoperability. Ripple’s system allows value to move between currencies without pre-funded accounts, which remains a key advantage. The challenge for Western Union will be scaling this new system while maintaining liquidity, regulation, and consumer trust. Converting such a large international network into a blockchain-based model will require time, capital, and flawless execution. Mickle Fires Back While Versluis viewed Solana’s deal as a potential blow to Ripple, Mickle dismissed it entirely. He posted, “This company will be bankrupt before it moves a billion dollars on Solana.” His comment was a direct reference to Western Union’s plan, which he believes is unsustainable. Mickle’s remarks reflect a broader sentiment among XRP supporters. Many see Western Union’s blockchain pivot as a desperate attempt to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving payments industry. By comparing Western Union to “Blockbuster” and Ripple to “Netflix,” Mickle implied that XRP’s model remains the superior, scalable solution. The Future of Global Payments The Western Union–Solana partnership marks a major turning point in blockchain adoption. It brings two different payment philosophies into direct competition: Solana’s stablecoin-based model and Ripple’s bridge-asset framework. Versluis sees this as a “major shot” at XRP, while Mickle calls it a doomed venture. Time will determine who is right. If Western Union succeeds, stablecoins may reshape international remittances. But if Ripple’s technology continues to attract financial institutions, XRP could remain the leading bridge asset in global finance. One thing is clear — the race to revolutionize payments is far from over. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Yala hacker , responsible for a significant multi-million dollar theft, has been successfully apprehended by police in Bangkok. This remarkable development not only brings justice closer but also confirms the recovery of most of the stolen funds from Yala, a prominent Bitcoin-native liquidity protocol. It’s a pivotal moment, signaling a growing capacity for law enforcement to tackle digital asset crime and offering a renewed sense of security to the crypto community. What Exactly Happened to the Yala Protocol? Yala, a protocol designed to enhance Bitcoin’s utility by providing liquidity, became the target of a sophisticated cyberattack last month. The exploit resulted in a substantial loss, estimated at approximately $7.64 million in digital assets. Such incidents can be devastating, causing immediate financial distress for users and casting a shadow of doubt over the security of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The aftermath of a hack often involves a frantic scramble by the protocol team to understand the breach, secure remaining assets, and communicate with their community. The Target: Yala, a Bitcoin-native liquidity protocol, vital for enabling more flexible use of BTC. The Damage: Roughly $7.64 million in funds were siphoned off through a complex exploit. The Aftermath: Uncertainty and concern for users, alongside an urgent need for action from the Yala team. How Was the Yala Hacker Tracked Down and Arrested? The arrest of the Yala hacker is a significant testament to the evolving capabilities of law enforcement in the digital age. Following the hack, the Yala team quickly engaged with authorities, providing crucial information that aided the investigation. Police in Bangkok, leveraging their expertise in cybercrime, meticulously traced the digital footprints left by the perpetrator. This collaborative effort between the protocol and law enforcement proved instrumental in identifying and apprehending the individual. What makes this case particularly noteworthy is the successful recovery of a substantial portion of the stolen assets. In many crypto hacks, funds are quickly laundered and dispersed, making recovery incredibly difficult, if not impossible. The fact that most of the funds were retrieved sends a powerful message: the anonymity once afforded by blockchain is not absolute, and dedicated investigative work can yield tangible results. This success offers a rare but vital example of justice being served in the often-turbulent world of crypto security. What Does This Arrest Mean for Crypto Security and User Trust? The apprehension of the Yala hacker has far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. For too long, the perception has been that crypto criminals operate with impunity, shielded by decentralization. This incident challenges that notion, demonstrating that determined law enforcement can penetrate these layers. It serves as a potent deterrent, reminding would-be attackers that their actions have consequences, even in the digital realm. Furthermore, this successful recovery effort is a crucial step in rebuilding and strengthening user trust. When protocols are hacked, confidence can plummet, hindering adoption and innovation. Seeing a positive resolution, where funds are recovered and justice is pursued, reassures users that their assets are not entirely without recourse. It highlights the growing maturity of the crypto industry, where security measures and legal frameworks are slowly catching up to technological advancements. Key positive impacts for the crypto community: Stronger Deterrence: Criminals may think twice before targeting crypto protocols. Increased Confidence: Users gain more trust in the security and legal recourse available in the crypto space. Enhanced Cooperation: A clear example of successful collaboration between private crypto entities and public law enforcement. Precedent for Recovery: Offers hope that fund recovery is possible, even for large-scale exploits. Moving Forward: Lessons Learned from the Yala Hacker Incident While celebrating this victory, it’s essential to acknowledge that the threat of cyberattacks remains constant. The Yala hack, despite its positive resolution, underscores the critical importance of continuous vigilance and robust security practices. Protocols must prioritize regular, independent security audits, implement multi-factor authentication, and develop comprehensive incident response plans. For users, the message is clear: always practice due diligence, use strong, unique passwords, and be wary of phishing attempts. The story of the Yala hacker ‘s arrest is more than just a news item; it’s a powerful narrative about the evolving landscape of digital asset security. It showcases that while challenges persist, the combined efforts of innovative protocols and dedicated law enforcement can lead to remarkable outcomes. As the cryptocurrency industry continues its rapid growth, such instances of justice and recovery will be vital in fostering a safer, more trustworthy environment for all participants.

These are tokens that combine utility, momentum, and upside potential while still being accessible. Among those standing out today are Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , SUI, and Jupiter (JUP), each of which offers a different flavour of opportunity and could slot alongside a core position like Cardano for a diversified portfolio aiming at 10× growth before the cycle peaks. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Whales Are Quietly Accumulating Let’s start with Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a token that’s turning into something of a phenomenon. It’s already CertiK-audited, listed on CoinMarketCap, and currently in stage 13 of its presale, priced at $0.0022. The project has raised over $27.2 million and sold more than 16.5 million tokens, demonstrating the powerful community momentum surrounding this meme driven gem. Whale wallets have reportedly been joining the presale, and for good reason. Meme coins have a history of delivering some of the biggest returns in the crypto space, but LILPEPE stands out for its structured roadmap and professional execution. This isn’t just a meme coin with funny branding, it’s a whole ecosystem being built around culture, speed, and investor security. Adding to the hype is the Little Pepe $777K Giveaway, where ten winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. If LILPEPE follows its roadmap, even modest investments could turn into life changing profits. Whales seem to know it, and that’s why accumulation is ramping up.\ SUI: A Rapid Recovery That Signals Strength The next big name on the list is SUI, a project that’s showing remarkable resilience. Not long ago, SUI dropped to around $0.55, leading some to believe it had lost its steam. But in true crypto fashion, it made a powerful comeback, now trading at $2.52. That kind of recovery doesn’t happen by accident, it’s a sign of strong investor confidence and deep liquidity support. Whale data confirms that large transactions have been steadily increasing on SUI, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. That’s a bullish signal in any market, but especially now when confidence in the altcoin sector is returning. Analysts predict that if the broader market continues its rebound, SUI could be poised for 1,000% gains, particularly given its growing ecosystem and increasing developer interest. Jupiter (JUP): Quietly Building Pressure with Big Airdrops Jupiter (JUP) has been building one of the strongest user driven ecosystems on Solana. The key catalyst? Stakers are now eligible for massive upcoming airdrops, and that’s been driving demand through the roof. Whale movements suggest accumulation has been steady since the airdrop announcements. Airdrop incentives usually lead to heavy short-term buying pressure, but in Jupiter’s case, it’s turning into something more sustainable. Holders are locking in their tokens, reducing circulating supply and creating a perfect storm for potential price acceleration. Analysts are calling for 100% to 200% upside as Jupiter continues to cement itself as one of the core players in Solana’s DeFi infrastructure. If Solana’s momentum keeps up, JUP could easily become one of the network’s breakout assets. Conclusion If you believe that the next crypto cycle will favour both platforms and infrastructure and the cultural lightning of meme coins, then pairing Cardano with signals from Little Pepe (LILPEPE), SUI, and Jupiter (JUP) could be a strategic move. At current prices and with the roadmaps in play, these tokens under $1 represent accessible entry points with meaningful upside. If the market follows the script many long-term investors anticipate, this quartet could be part of a portfolio that not only retains value but also transforms it before the cycle ends.

Focusing on altcoins like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , SUI, and Jupiter (JUP) might be particularly lucrative. These tokens are not only affordable but also hold promise due to their unique market positions and growth potential alongside a more established cryptocurrency like Cardano. Introduction to Potential High-Growth Tokens For those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolio, focusing on tokens that maintain a low buy-in price coupled with strong market fundamentals might be key. Here we spotlight three such cryptocurrencies: Unraveling the Potential of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is distinguishing itself in the crypto market as a compelling meme coin with solid backing and a well-defined roadmap. Currently in the thirteenth stage of its presale at merely $0.0022 per token, LILPEPE has garnered over $27.2 million from sales, with more than 16.5 million tokens already distributed. The project has achieved these figures alongside a strong community support, indicating a robust growth potential. The ongoing excitement is further amplified by a sizeable $777K giveaway in LILPEPE tokens, promising substantial rewards for participants. The Resilience and Recovery of SUI SUI represents another captivating option, notable for its swift recovery in market price and investor interest. After experiencing a significant drop to $0.55, SUI surged back, currently trading at $2.52. This rebound is a testament to the ongoing confidence and substantial investment it continues to attract, positioning it as a viable candidate for exponential growth in the near future. Jupiter (JUP)'s Strategic Moves in the DeFi Space JUP is slowly making its mark within the Solana network's DeFi sector, driven by its strategic airdrop campaigns which have enhanced holder engagement and token stability. These efforts are expected to significantly reduce the available supply while fostering a bullish sentiment amongst investors, potentially doubling or even tripling its market value as it solidifies its position in the market. Comprehensive Viewpoint Investors looking to capitalize on the next cryptocurrency surge might consider incorporating these tokens into their portfolios. With their current low prices and promising roadmaps, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), SUI, and Jupiter (JUP) offer accessible investment opportunities with substantial upside potential, especially when held alongside a foundational asset like Cardano.

On-chain data from Etherscan shows that the attacker withdrew Shiba tokens multiple times by providing legitimate Merkle leaf exit requests from a root signed by 10 different addresses. It seems like multiple signer keys appear to have leaked in Shibaswap, causing a $2.8M loss today @Shibtoken . The attacker ( https://t.co/B9pqiGqIvy ) withdrew multiple times by providing legit Merkle leaf exit requests from a root signed by 10 different addresses. The ""legit""… — Tikkala Security (@TikkalaResearch) September 12, 2025 For context, a signer key is the private cryptographic key an account uses to sign transactions on a blockchain. Whoever has that private key can authorize actions from that account, move tokens, call smart-contract functions, mint and burn tokens if the contract grants those powers. Leaked Signer Keys on Shibaswap Drained $2.8M SHIB tokens This loophole is what the attacker capitalized on through the root hash to steal nearly $3 million in SHIB. Tikala Security’s auditing team found that the exit() call function in the root chain manager contract on Shibaswap, which verifies if any request is a legitimate leaf under that root hash, gave the attacker room to control and manipulate the root hash at will. Source: X/ TikkalaResearch Many SHIB holders are now fearful that the OG meme coin is about to crash. Looking at market data, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been in a downtrend for most of 2025, currently down 45% on YTD performance, which has resulted in muted trading activity. At press time, SHIB maintains a $6 billion market cap but can only boast a $150 million trading volume, small compared to the likes of PEPE, which, with a $3 billion market cap, is still seeing about $400 million in trading volume. Shiba Inu price prediction: Analysts Eye Critical $0.0000119 Breakout However, market analysts believe SHIB is in its “calm before the storm” moment, as the price is quietly gathering strength in a major demand zone. $SHIB the calm before the explode. Shiba Inu momentum is at historic lows. The price is quietly gathering strength in a major demand zone. This silence could be the sound of accumulation. And every accumulation has its breakout. pic.twitter.com/tv8RMtlKex — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 25, 2025 The signals point to a forthcoming bounce from the support zone that could launch the price toward targets at $0.00001170, $0.00001430, $0.00001600, and $0.00001850. On the technical front, the SHIB/USDT daily chart shows the token consolidating near a strong buy zone between $0.0000098 and $0.0000108, an area that has historically triggered multiple rebounds. Price recently tested this level again after a sharp drop, suggesting potential accumulation by buyers. A descending trendline continues to cap upside momentum, defining the short-term bearish structure. Source: TradingView For a reversal to gain traction, SHIB must break above the nearby resistance at $0.0000119, which aligns with the descending trendline. A confirmed breakout above that region could open the path toward the next major supply area near $0.0000176. Until that breakout occurs, SHIB remains range-bound, with price likely to oscillate between the strong buy zone and short-term resistance. Traders Flee to PepeNode With $2M Raised in 30 Days SHIB’s weaker price action has sent short-term traders searching for higher upside elsewhere. PEPENODE has emerged as a standout option with its mine-to-earn model designed for every type of investor. This new presale project has raised nearly $2 million in just over a month. With PEPENODE, users can create mining setups in a virtual environment by purchasing miner nodes, and top miners earn bonuses in popular meme coins like Pepe and SHIB. PEPENODE is currently priced at $0.0011138 per token, with prices rising every few days as tokens sell out rapidly. You can purchase the token directly through the official PEPENODE presale website using ETH, USDT, USDC, or bank cards.

Just a day after its launch, the new Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) has attracted nearly $300 million in assets, offering a 7.3% annual percentage yield (APY) to investors by staking 100% of the fund’s assets. Meanwhile, Western Union announced the launch of a Solana-based stablecoin, USDPT. This new stable asset will hit the market in the first half of 2026 and will work with “partner exchanges” to make the token available to users. “Our Digital Asset Network and USDPT will be an enabler in achieving our mission to make financial services accessible to people everywhere,” commented the head of Western Union, Devin McGranahan Solana Price Prediction: RSI Sends Buy Signal as Positive Momentum Accelerates In the past 7 days, SOL has booked a 7% gain while bulls seem to be doing their best to keep the token above $200 ahead of the Fed’s interest rate decision. It has bounced off a key support at $180 multiple times, favoring a bullish short-term outlook. This price area shows confluence between both horizontal and trend line supports and could serve as a launching pad to propel it to a new all-time high soon. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also sent a buy signal as it rose above the 14-day moving average, emphasizing that positive momentum is accelerating. As institutional adoption grows and Wall Street becomes enamored with this high-yielding Solana-linked product, billions could flow to the token in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, top crypto presales like SUBBD ($SUBBD) will also attract significant attention from investors during this cycle. This project could be a hidden gem in the Ethereum ecosystem as it prepares to launch its decentralized content distribution platform. SUBBD ($SUBBD) Brings AI and Web 3 Innovation to the Creator Economy SUBBD ($SUBBD) is building an all-in-one AI-powered content creation platform designed for the Web3 era. It helps creators streamline their workflow by allowing them to generate and edit videos with AI — all without leaving the platform.

The $SUBBD token is at the center of this thriving ecosystem, serving as a payment method for subscriptions, exclusive content purchases, and staking. What makes SUBBD stand out is its integrated AI Creator and AI Personal Assistant, allowing influencers to launch virtual influencer personas or automate content tasks seamlessly. Early $SUBBD buyers will reap the highest returns once the platform is officially launched. To buy $SUBBD before the next price increase, visit the official SUBBD website , and connect your favorite wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

Accordingly, the famous giant whale James Wynn joined the XRP community. James Wynn, in his post from his X account, announced his decision to invest a significant portion of his portfolio in XRP. Wynn, who claimed to have achieved great success by earning over $100 million in just 70 days trading futures, also became known for losing a similar fortune of millions of dollars in leveraged trading in mid-2025. Wynn, who is famous for both profit and loss, said he spent 24 hours researching XRP and decided to invest $25 million or more as a result. Stating that he believes XRP can revolutionize banking systems, the giant whale argued that investing in XRP is a gamble, as is the case with all investments. Finally, Wynn called on the XRP community (both critics and advocates) to educate himself about XRP. At this point, XRP supporter lawyer Bill Morgan reminded Wynn that XRP has never fallen outside the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in its 13-year history, a testament to XRP's resilience. *This is not investment advice.

Traders are also watching for hints that the Fed could slow or halt balance-sheet runoff, a shift that would inject liquidity into financial markets. The dollar has softened amid growing expectations of a broader easing cycle. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said markets are “on a knife-edge between hope and hesitation,” noting that a dovish Fed could lift risk assets like crypto, while a hawkish tone could trigger a quick pullback. The decision and press conference by Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2 p.m. ET will be closely parsed for clues on policy direction.

He added that capital could rotate into altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and XRP, further enhancing crypto’s appeal as a growth and inflation hedge. Beyond the Fed, this week’s macro backdrop includes the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting and earnings from big tech giants, including Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $112,760, showing a mild 0.15% decline over the past 24 hours. BTC traded sideways through most of the session, reaching an intraday high near $113,800 before dipping to a low around $111,900. A decisive breakout above $115,000 could pave the way for a move toward $118,200 and $121,000, signaling renewed bullish momentum. However, failure to hold above $112,000 may open the door for a retest of the $110,500 support zone, where buying interest previously emerged. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading at $3,986, up 0.16% in the past 24 hours. ETH touched a session high of around $4,050 before briefly pulling back to $3,920. If ETH breaks above $4,100, it could challenge the $4,250 and $4,400 resistance levels. On the downside, a drop below $3,900 could push the price toward $3,750, with further weakness potentially testing the $3,600 zone. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment has slipped back into the fear zone, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index standing at 39 , down from 42 (neutral) yesterday. Compared to last week’s reading of 29 (fear), sentiment has improved modestly but remains subdued. The index continues to show hesitation, highlighting a market still recovering from recent volatility and lacking clear bullish momentum. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $202.48 million in net inflows on October 28, marking another strong day for institutional demand. The cumulative total net inflow now stands at $62.34 billion, with a total value traded of $4.18 billion and $154.81 billion in total net assets, representing 6.88% of Bitcoin’s market cap, according to data from SoSoValue. Out of the 12 ETFs, three recorded positive inflows. Ark & 21Shares (ARKB) led with $75.84 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $67.05 million, and BlackRock’s IBIT with $59.60 million. Likewise, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a strong rebound in demand on October 28, recording $246.02 million in net inflows, ending their brief slowdown. The cumulative total net inflow has now risen to $14.73 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Out of the nine listed ETFs, four posted positive inflows, while only one recorded minor outflows. Fidelity’s FETH led the day with $99.27 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA with $76.37 million and Grayscale’s ETH with $73.03 million.

This year alone, projects have conducted over $1.4 billion in token buybacks, a strategic move that is reshaping how we view value and sustainability in the digital asset space. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful maneuver by projects to strengthen their ecosystems and reward their communities. Understanding the Power of Token Buybacks What exactly are token buybacks ? Simply put, it’s when a project repurchases its own tokens from the open market. Think of it like a company buying back its shares to reduce the number of outstanding shares, thereby increasing the value of the remaining ones. In crypto, this often involves using project revenue or treasury funds to acquire tokens, which are then typically burned (permanently removed from circulation) or locked up. This action directly impacts the token’s supply, making it scarcer and potentially more valuable. It signals strong confidence from the project team in their long-term vision and financial health. For investors, it can be a powerful indicator of a project’s commitment to driving value for its holders. The Staggering $1.4 Billion Surge in Token Buybacks : Who’s Leading the Charge? The numbers speak volumes about the current enthusiasm for token buybacks . Year-to-date, the total volume has blown past $1.4 billion. This massive figure highlights a significant shift in how projects are managing their tokenomics and engaging with their communities. Leading the charge is HYPE, which has conducted an astounding $640 million in buybacks. This substantial investment demonstrates HYPE’s dedication to its token’s stability and growth. Following closely are other notable players like ZRO, with $150 million in buybacks, and PUMP, contributing $140 million to this impressive total. These figures, as reported by Unfolded, underscore a broader market movement. Key takeaways from this surge: Increased Project Confidence: Teams are using capital to directly support their token’s value. Supply Reduction: Fewer tokens in circulation can lead to price appreciation, assuming consistent demand. Investor Alignment: Buybacks can signal a project’s commitment to long-term value for holders. Why Are Token Buybacks So Appealing to Projects? Projects engage in token buybacks for several compelling reasons. Primarily, it’s a direct mechanism to reduce the circulating supply of their native token. A reduced supply, coupled with steady or increasing demand, naturally creates upward pressure on the token’s price. This can benefit existing holders and attract new investors who see the project actively working to enhance value. Moreover, buybacks can act as a form of capital distribution, returning value to token holders without the complexities of traditional dividends. It’s a transparent way for projects to demonstrate financial strength and operational success. By reducing selling pressure and improving liquidity, buybacks contribute to a healthier and more stable market for the token. Benefits often include: Price Stability: Counteracting downward price movements. Enhanced Value: Boosting the value of remaining tokens. Community Trust: Building confidence among investors and users. Strategic Capital Management: Efficiently utilizing treasury funds. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities in Token Buybacks While the benefits of token buybacks are clear, it’s also important to consider the nuances. Not all buybacks are created equal, and their effectiveness can vary depending on market conditions, the project’s fundamentals, and the transparency of the buyback program. Some critics argue that poorly executed buybacks can be short-term fixes rather than long-term solutions, or even be used to manipulate market perception. For investors, understanding the specifics of a project’s buyback strategy is crucial. Is it a one-off event or a consistent, programmatic approach? Is the project truly generating enough revenue to sustain these buybacks without depleting vital development funds? These questions help in assessing the genuine impact and sustainability of such initiatives. However, when done right, programmatic buybacks can offer significant opportunities for value appreciation and a more robust token ecosystem. The surge in token buybacks this year is a clear indication of a maturing cryptocurrency market where projects are increasingly focused on sustainable value creation. From HYPE’s massive contributions to the efforts of ZRO and PUMP, these actions highlight a proactive approach to tokenomics. As the market continues to evolve, understanding the dynamics of buybacks will be essential for both projects aiming to thrive and investors seeking informed decisions. This trend is not just about numbers; it’s about building stronger, more resilient digital economies. Frequently Asked Questions About Token Buybacks What is a token buyback in cryptocurrency? A token buyback is when a cryptocurrency project uses its funds, often from treasury or revenue, to repurchase its own tokens from the open market. These tokens are then usually burned (removed from circulation) or locked up. Why do crypto projects conduct token buybacks? Projects conduct token buybacks primarily to reduce the circulating supply of their token, which can increase scarcity and potentially boost its price. It also signals confidence in the project’s future and can return value to token holders. Which projects have conducted significant token buybacks this year? This year, HYPE has led with $640 million in token buybacks, followed by ZRO with $150 million and PUMP with $140 million, contributing to a total market figure exceeding $1.4 billion. How do token buybacks benefit investors? For investors, token buybacks can lead to increased token value due to reduced supply. They also demonstrate a project’s commitment to supporting its token’s price and fostering long-term growth, potentially increasing investor confidence. Are there any risks associated with token buybacks? While generally positive, risks can include short-term market manipulation if not transparently executed, or if a project depletes crucial development funds for buybacks. Investors should assess the project’s overall financial health and strategy. Did you find this deep dive into the world of token buybacks insightful?

Thompson revealed that over the past several months, numerous teammates and former players have reached out to him, seeking advice on how to move part of their earnings into digital assets. He highlighted a changing attitude toward wealth preservation and control, particularly among high-net-worth athletes who are looking beyond traditional markets.

He said that many now “want it to work and do something” rather than staying in places that do not offer the best returns. This sentiment aligns with a growing belief that cryptocurrencies, especially established ones like XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin, offer stronger potential for long-term value . Thompson explained how he advises players at different stages in their careers. For rookies, he encourages a disciplined approach, suggesting that even a small portion of discretionary income can be allocated to crypto. “Take half of that and go open yourself a wallet,” he said, urging them to learn about assets such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP. The focus, he emphasized, should be on education and responsible exposure rather than speculation. Why XRP Is Gaining Momentum Among the assets Thompson mentioned, XRP’s inclusion stood out to many in the crypto community. While XRP has high institutional appeal , the asset has increasingly attracted interest from retail investors and now, it appears, from professional athletes as well. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Its appeal lies in its efficiency, fast settlement times, and the fact that it is part of a growing financial ecosystem supported by regulated entities. According to Xaif, athletes are now allocating up to 5% of their net worth to cryptocurrencies, seeing assets like XRP as a haven for preserving and growing wealth. A New Phase of Athlete Investment Strategy Thompson’s comments reflect more than personal interest. They point to a shift in how athletes think about their financial independence. He described the move into crypto as part of a desire among players to feel “like their own boss,” referencing names like LeBron James, Alex Rodriguez, and Magic Johnson as examples of figures who have embraced ownership and entrepreneurship. As this mindset spreads, assets with real utility , such as XRP, are poised to benefit. The involvement of prominent figures like Thompson gives further visibility to the asset’s value proposition, helping normalize the idea of professional athletes diversifying into blockchain-based financial systems.

I see it as an asymmetric bet, wrongly seen by the market as a Bitcoin treasury play. At a 1.20x mNAV premium versus MicroStrategy's 1.34x, MARA's ~53,000 BTC holdings worth $5.9B justify a higher multiple given its mining inflows and AI potential. MARA's mining business alone merits a ~$5B valuation, projecting 64,000 BTC mined through 2048 worth ~$7.4B at current prices or up to ~$48B+ in a bullish Bitcoin case. A two-phased AI pivot, contracting 200 MW power capacity then leveraging Exaion's partnership for GPUs, could add $405 Mln Yearly in gross margin and represent a catalyst for the stock. I rate MARA a Strong Buy with 2x from mining and 3x from AI upside, though dilution, AI bubble risks, and BTC dependence remain significant risks. I last covered MARA Holdings, Inc ( MARA ) in July , arguing the market was sleeping on the true potential of this Bitcoin miner. This stock is roughly flat since my last coverage in July, underperforming the broader market. But holders (including myself) may be especially frustrated by the fact that many of MARA’s peers have significantly outperformed it, as the chart below shows. MARA vs. peers, YTD (Seeking Alpha) The most prominent example of outperformance is that of IREN Limited ( IREN ). This crypto miner began a strategic pivot to AI cloud services in July 2025, leveraging its existing GPU-powered data centers for high-performance computing. After reporting its first AI Cloud revenue for FY2025, the stock more than quintupled against its levels in July. Even miners that did not explicitly pivot to AI have significantly outperformed MARA. CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ), for example, is outperforming MARA YTD by a factor of more than 5. The company achieved so by avoiding shareholder dilution and by contracting 1 GW power capacity, which helped with profitability. In this article, I will explain why I believe MARA may be on the cusp of a strategic pivot that could ignite new growth for the company and boost its (so far, lagging YTD) stock performance. MARA: trading like a Bitcoin Treasury Company Readers may have noticed how in my previous chart I included Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) for comparison with MARA and other miners. Strategy, a company I recently covered , is a Bitcoin proxy investment that is underperforming MARA itself, with flat returns YTD. This is not by chance. I think the market is seeing both MARA Holdings and Strategy as Bitcoin treasury companies. Even if they are not alike. Personally, I define a Bitcoin treasury company as a company whose main purpose is to acquire and hold Bitcoin long term, believing in the future of this cryptocurrency as a global reserve asset. In that sense, a Bitcoin treasury company’s other operations become as a secondary strategic priority. MARA officially announced it would start a BTC “hold” strategy back in January 2021 (previous to that, they resorted to sell most of the Bitcoin they mined to finance themselves). The company has also been very vocal about how important holding Bitcoin long term is for the company, celebrating reaching 50,000 in their treasury in July. In my view, this amounts to a continued Bitcoin treasury strategy. I think this strategy has so far punished MARA for what concerns market recognition. MARA currently holds ~53,000 Bitcoins, which are worth ~$6 Bln at the time of writing (with Bitcoin at ~$115,000 per coin). With a market capitalization of ~$7.2 Bln (Seeking Alpha data), the company trades at an mNAV premium of 1.20X. This is less than Strategy’s mNAV premium , which stands at ~1.34X at the time of writing. I find this difference very difficult to justify and worthy of calling MARA an asymmetric bet in the stock market. First of all because MARA, contrary to Strategy, is one of the largest Bitcoin miners on the planet. This means there is a relatively certain future inflow of Bitcoins that MARA will generate and must be accounted for by investors. Strategy, on the other hand, can only resort to issuing debt or diluting shareholders to monetize their mNAV premium and acquire more Bitcoin. The other reason why I find MARA’s valuation very cheap has to do with the potential of the business in case of an AI (and energy) pivot, something I believe MARA, contrary to Strategy, could do and that I will cover shortly. My point is that MARA’s focus on a BTC treasury strategy has punished the stock and blindsided the market to view this company purely as a box of Bitcoin trading at a slight premium. This cannot be further from the truth, as I will now outline in my next sections. MARA’s BTC mining business is worth ~$5 Billion by itself As one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the world, I think much of MARA’s value lies in how much Bitcoin the company can be expected to mine in the next few years. I have touched on this topic in my previous coverage for this stock, and previously calculated the following Bitcoin metrics: I expect MARA to produce ~27,000 Bitcoins until the 2028 halving (20 BTC per day, multiplied by 1349 days until mid-April 2028). I then expect the company to produce ~16,000, ~9700, ~ 5700, ~3500, and ~2100 Bitcoins for the following five halvings (ending in 2048). The total [is] 64,000 Bitcoins. At current market prices [NDR: Prices from March 2025], 64,000 Bitcoins are worth $5.7 Billion. Given my Bitcoin valuation model has an expected value between $112,500 and $200,000 per coin, I would assign the value of these Bitcoins at between $7.2 Billion and $12.8 Billion. Should Bitcoin mature into a global reserve asset, matching gold's market capitalization at roughly $750,000 per coin, these Bitcoins would be worth $48 Billion. [NDR: Assumptions and quotes from my March 2025 article ] At current Bitcoin market prices, the 64,000 Bitcoins that MARA will mine in the upcoming two decades are worth ~$ 7.4 Billion. But an investment in MARA inevitably makes sense only assuming a bull case for Bitcoin (more on this inherent risk later in this article). Assuming a (conservative, for a bullish case ) long term price per Bitcoin of ~$ 250,000 per coin, and a 30% long term net profit margin for MARA, this stack of Bitcoin is worth ~$ 4.9 Billion in net profit, which represents roughly MARA’s market capitalization at the time of writing. In other terms, I think MARA's BTC mining business is worth a 2X from share price levels at the time of writing. To note, these assumptions are speculative and can only serve as a rough estimate of how much MARA's mining business is worth. For example, MARA is unlikely to ever monetize its mining business by simply liquidating acquired Bitcoin and ""pocketing"" a 30% net margin as I assumed in my model. This would be inconsistent with their BTC ""hold"" strategy. They are, in my view, more likely to maintain a long term BTC hold strategy and rather focus on monetizing an AI pivot. What’s important for the sake of my thesis, however, is that today’s ~ $1.2 Billion market valuation of MARA’s entire mining business (the company market cap minus the market value its BTC holding) is, in my view, clearly cheap. Readers can make their own conclusion about how much MARA’s future inflow of ~64,000 Bitcoin is worth. What’s reasonable, I believe, is that it should be worth significantly more than $ 1.2 Billion. MARA could pivot to AI with a two-phased approach To understand what MARA’s AI pivot could look like, we can benefit from the fact that many of its direct peers have already done such a pivot. This is why, for a start, it’s important to understand the difference between MARA and companies like IREN and CleanSpark. To that purpose, I have compiled a simple table with key figures and facts. Sources for the below data points are MARA’s BTC report and Q2 shareholders letter , IREN’s FY25 report and Yahoo Finance , unless specified otherwise. MARA Holdings IREN CleanSpark Power Capacity 1.1 GW owned; 760 MW active for mining 810 MW online; 2,910 MW secured total 1.03 GW under contract; 808 MW utilized Cost per KWh $0.04/kWh $0.035/kWh $0.056/kWh Data Centers geographical footprint US-focused with a presence in Europe via Exaion partnership Canada (Prince George: 50 MW air-cooled) & Texas (100k+ GPUs), optimized for dense AI Exclusively US portfolio (e.g., Tennessee via GRIID acquisition, College Park GA for AI) AI/HPC Hardware Early stage, no major owned GPUs yet 23,000 GPUs already deployed Nascent, no GPUs deployed yet. With the above in mind, I believe MARA could follow a 2 steps approach to pivot away from sole crypto mining: Start contracting power capacity for AI applications, meaning committing access to a defined volume of electrical power through long-term agreements with utilities or energy providers. This is a similar approach to what CleanSpark has recently done. Use the revenue from contracting power capacity to acquire GPUs and rent them out directly for AI applications. This is the same approach IREN followed. The reason behind this two-phased approach is that, as per my table above, MARA does not own or deploy a significant amount of GPUs. The company rather uses so-called “ASICs” (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are custom built chips designed specifically for mining Bitcoin. The ultimate goal of this strategy would be to rent out directly GPUs for AI cloud services or rentals of high-performance computing. Which is what IREN has been doing, thanks to its 23,000+ GPUs in active use. The Exaion partnership: a first step towards AI, unnoticed by the market? A signal that MARA may be actively thinking about an AI pivot is its recently expanding footprint in Europe. MARA recently acquired a majority stake in Exaion, with the option of buying the entire company in the future. Exaion is a European based company that provides secure cloud and AI infrastructure, formerly a subsidiary of EDF, a large French energy company. Exaion operates 1,250 GPUs across its four data centers at the time of writing. It is unlikely, in my opinion, that these GPUs could be put to any other use in the immediate term (they are already utilized in Exaion’s business, which will continue to serve existing clients, including EDF). However, I find it interesting that management used the following wording related to the acquisition: Exaion would transition to a larger-scale international commercial deployment. By integrating Exaion’s platform, operations, and engineering expertise, MARA expects to expand its capabilities into AI/HPC infrastructure development In my view, this is a signal that management is thinking about an AI pivot. In the context of my two-phased approach, this is equivalent to preparing for step 2 (the most profitable one). With Exaion, MARA has access to the HPC infrastructure needed to deploy GPUs. Were MARA to complete its full acquisition of Exaion, it could accelerate its move to step 2 (i.e. renting out GPU computational power) by leveraging Exaion’s existing assets. While the markets have not reacted to news of the Exaion partnership so far, I think this may act as a catalyst if MARA’s management outlines their plan in the upcoming weeks. An AI pivot could represent a further ~3X upside for MARA Assigning an exact monetary value to an AI pivot for MARA is a difficult exercise, considering the company has not yet announced any plans in that direction. As a thought starter however, I will still outline what could be the financial impact of MARA starting to contract out power capacity for its first year of operations. My assumptions are as below: 200 MW of dedicated AI capacity to rent out (what’s left of 1.1GW of total capacity, less 760 MW currently utilized for mining) A rate of $220 / Kw / Month, which is the midpoint of 2025 global data center colocation pricing . A utilization rate of 90%, accounting for setup and downtime for the first year, resulting in 8,760 hours / year of operations A Power cost of $0.04/KhW, MARA’s own blended rate as of Q2 2025 For simplicity, I will exclude other OPEX cost With the above assumptions in mind, I estimate a potential additional Gross Margin of $ ~400 Million, as per calculations below. Gross Revenue 200 MW × 1,000 kW/MW × $220/kW/mo × 12 mo $528 million Adjusted Revenue (90% Util.) 90% of $ 528 Mln $475 million Power Costs 200 MW × 1,000 kW/MW × 8,760 hrs × $ 0.04/kWh $70 million Net Earnings (Gross Margin) $ 475 Mln- $ 70 Mln $405 million Exactly what value the market may assign to such a new business (if it is ever announced) is a difficult and somewhat speculative exercise. First, because the market is likely to look well beyond the additional gross marginality of a single year of operations. More importantly, because MARA’s own financials are the results of mark-to-market accounting obligations in relation to the BTC they hold. This makes isolating and benchmarking this new revenue stream a difficult exercise at best. A more interesting exercise can be, once again, looking at the cases of IREN and CleanSpark. IREN, CLSK, P6M (Seeking Alpha) CleanSpark roughly doubled year-to-date (+115%), while IREN performed significantly better with a more than 800% return YTD, as per chart above. I think a bull run for MARA could manifest as something in between these two peers. At face value, MARA’s AI pivot is more comparable to CleanSpark: simply contracting 200 MW of extra power capacity for AI use cases. However, I think Exaion’s partial acquisition may drive further gains in the market on expectations of an accelerated roll out to phase 2 using its assets. In summary, I would expect an AI pivot for MARA to represent a ~3X upside for the stock, purely based on the price action of MARA’s direct peers and my two -phased AI pivot theory. Obviously, such a bull scenario could only manifest as long as the market remains convinced demand for AI applications (and data centers) is going to continue and/or accelerate. This is something I will cover in my next section, together with other risks linked to investing in MARA. Risks: shares dilution, AI bubble and crypto winter A bet on MARA remains a leveraged bet on Bitcoin and, if a pivot were to come, on AI. The market is likely to assign a premium valuation to MARA only as long as AI remains a hot investment theme, and Bitcoin continues its secular bull run. In this sense, investors should carefully consider whether they deem likely that the current climate of euphoria on both topics is going to continue. Readers who are bearish on Bitcoin or believe that AI is a bubble should of course stay out of an investment in MARA Holdings altogether. A further potential risk of an investment in MARA is linked to shareholders dilution. Historically MARA’s management has been heavily diluting shares, as the chart below shows. Looking forward, I expect this trend to continue, considering that the company’s “HOLD” strategy means MARA needs to incur in dilution to finance its expenses. MARA share count (MacroTrends) This represents a significant headwind for MARA, which can only be compensated by strong retail demand for the stock. While I see MARA as an asymmetric bet in the market, it is a highly speculative and high risk bet, depending both on execution (management announcing an AI pivot) and overall market sentiment. Anyone interested in entering a position in MARA should bear this in mind. Conclusion: MARA is an asymmetric bet on AI and BTC mining MARA has lagged behind Bitcoin and its crypto mining peers year-to-date. I think this may be about to change, as a result of two elements: A two-phased pivot to AI, first focusing on renting out power capacity and then acquiring and renting out GPUs, leveraging the recent deal with Exaion. A continued Bitcoin bull run that may awaken the market to MARA’s mining business long term potential, which I estimate will mine ~64,000 Bitcoins in the next two decades. These two elements respectively represent a 2X and 3X upside from current prices, according to my calculations. This potential for asymmetric returns brings me once again to recommend a “ STRONG BUY ” for MARA Holdings. I will look at signs of an AI pivot in the next earnings release, which is set for early November.",MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-29 13:31:44

As the team behind the coin issues a new caution, investors are left wondering if SHIB can regain its edge in the meme coin market before the anticipated market swings in November. Dive into the details to uncover which tokens might be poised for growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Seeks New Heights Amid Price Stability Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been steady, hovering between $0.0000098 and $0.0000109. The current trend is stable, with a slight uptick of 1.69% over the past week. However, it faced declines over the past month and six months. SHIB's value could climb to its first resistance level at just over $0.0000113, marking a potential increase of around 5%. If momentum picks up, it could reach a second resistance point, implying a rise close to 14%. Although it's slightly below short-term and long-term moving averages, the RSI suggests we're neither in an overbought nor oversold market, hinting at balanced trading conditions. Conclusion The Shiba Inu burn rate surge signals a concentrated effort to limit coin supply, which could positively impact its value. However, the team has issued a new warning, which might cause temporary concern among investors. If SHIB navigates these challenges effectively, it has the potential to regain interest and possibly flip the meme cycle back in its favor. Success before November's market fluctuations could solidify SHIB's position against other coins like Dogecoin, indicating potential stability and growth.

That’s according to satellite images, shipping logs, and customs records reported by the Financial Times. Mittal’s joint venture, HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited (HMEL), accepted at least four crude cargoes at the Guru Gobind Singh Refinery in Punjab between July and September, all traced back to Russia. The crude was hauled from Russia’s Murmansk port, crossing international waters on vessels already hit with U.S. sanctions. These ships didn’t even try to hide, they shut off their transponders, or in some cases, gave out fake GPS signals to disguise their true locations. By the time the tankers reached the Gulf of Oman, the cargo switched to a different ship called the Samadha, which is not on the U.S. sanctions list but is under EU blacklisting. That final leg took the oil directly into India . Mittal refinery received $280 million worth of crude The value of the four shipments was close to $280 million, and there’s still no clarity on whether HMEL even knew what ships were involved. The shady transport tactics suggest someone, somewhere, was working hard to dodge the restrictions. What’s also unclear is who coordinated the use of sanctioned vessels in the first place. What’s not unclear is that the Guru Gobind Singh Refinery, part-owned by Mittal Energy, ended up receiving the goods. Lakshmi Mittal, who made his fortune in steel, is best known today as the executive chairman of ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest integrated steel and mining company. He’s been living in the UK for years, but recently told people close to him that he’s planning to leave the country over upcoming tax changes. He’s also been a member of Goldman Sachs’s board since 2008. The timing of these oil deals couldn’t be worse for Indian companies. The U.S. Treasury just ramped up its Russia play by putting Rosneft and Lukoil (Russia’s top two oil giants) on a new blacklist last week. That’s part of Trump’s campaign to choke off Moscow’s war funding and push Vladimir Putin into some kind of peace negotiation with Ukraine. Trump enforces sanctions as India buys Russian barrels “We have implemented those sanctions. We plan to enforce them,” said Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, speaking on Bloomberg TV. He said the new measures are aimed at stopping Russia’s oil cash flow, which is helping fund the war. This was Trump’s first major financial hit on Moscow since taking office. The idea is to force Putin to negotiate or at least call a ceasefire. “This will maybe be the thing to unlock President Putin coming to the table and ending this war,” Whitaker said. The U.S. is betting on pressure and is fully expecting more battles on the trade front. “President Trump holds all the cards. This is just one card that he’s playing. There are many more.” Despite the sanctions, market reaction has been mixed. Crude prices initially jumped, but it didn’t last. There’s confusion around how far Washington is willing to go to enforce the new rules. Russia has been hit with sanctions for most of the war, but its oil exports are still flowing. According to Kpler, Russia has been moving 5 million barrels per day of crude this year. Out of that, India has taken in 1.7 million b/d, while the second biggest buyer has been China.

Accountable, an innovative on-chain credit analysis startup, has successfully secured a remarkable $7.5 million in seed funding. This substantial investment, led by industry giant Pantera Capital and joined by OKX Ventures and Onigiri Capital, signals strong confidence in Accountable’s vision for the future of digital finance. What is Accountable and Why Does On-Chain Credit Matter? Accountable is pioneering a new approach to credit assessment within the blockchain ecosystem. They utilize zero-knowledge (zk) technology to analyze creditworthiness directly on the blockchain, without revealing sensitive personal data. This advancement is crucial because traditional credit systems often struggle to integrate with the decentralized nature of crypto, leaving many users without access to essential financial services. The concept of on-chain credit is designed to bridge this gap, offering several key benefits: Enhanced Privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs allow for verification of data without exposing the underlying information. Greater Accessibility: It opens up lending and borrowing opportunities to a wider global audience, including the unbanked. Reduced Bias: Credit decisions can be more objective, based on verifiable on-chain activity rather than traditional, often biased, metrics. Increased Transparency: While data remains private, the underlying rules for credit assessment are transparent on the blockchain. How Does Zero-Knowledge Tech Enhance On-Chain Credit Analysis? Zero-knowledge technology is the backbone of Accountable’s platform. Imagine proving you have sufficient funds for a loan without ever revealing your exact balance, or demonstrating a strong repayment history without disclosing your entire transaction ledger. That’s the power of zero-knowledge proofs. For on-chain credit , this means: Secure Data Verification: Users can prove certain financial attributes (e.g., consistent income, low debt) without sharing the raw data. Trustless Environment: Lenders can trust the validity of credit scores because they are cryptographically verified, even if they don’t see the specific details. Compliance Potential: It could help DeFi protocols meet regulatory requirements for ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) or ‘Anti-Money Laundering’ (AML) without compromising user privacy. This innovative use of ZK technology is set to create a more secure and private infrastructure for lending and borrowing in the decentralized space, addressing one of the biggest challenges in scaling DeFi. What Does This Funding Mean for the Future of On-Chain Credit? The $7.5 million seed funding is a strong validation of Accountable’s potential and the broader importance of on-chain credit . This capital will fuel the development and expansion of their platform, with a mainnet launch anticipated in mid-November. This launch is expected to be a pivotal moment, introducing their privacy-preserving credit analysis tools to the wider DeFi community. This investment signifies a growing trend where venture capitalists are actively seeking out projects that solve real-world problems within the crypto space. Accountable’s success could: Accelerate DeFi Adoption: By making credit more accessible and secure, it lowers barriers for mainstream users. Spur Innovation: It encourages other projects to explore privacy-enhancing technologies for financial services. Set New Standards: Accountable’s approach could become a benchmark for responsible and private credit assessment in Web3. The journey to a fully integrated and accessible decentralized financial system still has challenges, but startups like Accountable are paving the way for a more inclusive and efficient future. A New Era for Decentralized Lending Accountable’s successful funding round marks a significant step forward for the entire DeFi ecosystem. By leveraging zero-knowledge technology, they are not just building a product; they are contributing to a more private, secure, and accessible financial future. Their work on on-chain credit analysis has the potential to democratize access to capital and unlock new opportunities for millions worldwide. Keep an eye on their mainnet launch in November; it could truly be a game-changer for decentralized lending. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is on-chain credit?

The announcement came from the Masumi team, which is developing the Cardano-based infrastructure and implementing x402 support. Developed initially by Coinbase and expanded with partners across the web ecosystem, x402 revives the idea of automated internet micropayments, allowing bots and AI agents to handle payments on-chain independently. “This is very big for cardano,” said Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of the blockchain, in a post on X. According to Masumi, the x402 standard enables HTTP-based payment requests and allows AI agents to: Pay for resources and services via API Perform transactions with ADA and USDM Interact with other AI systems without intermediaries Masumi has enhanced x402 with a trust layer — integrating identity, reputation, transparent auditing, and refund mechanisms. This framework could transform Cardano into the financial backbone of an “agent economy”, where autonomous systems trade, collaborate, and pay each other seamlessly. Proof of Concept and DeFi Automation A Proof-of-Concept is already active: users can mint a test memecoin by paying 2 USDM and a small amount of ADA. The team believes this integration could automate DeFi protocols, from token swaps to lending and staking, all without direct user interaction with smart contracts. This is significant, as Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem still trails behind competitors. According to DefiLlama, Cardano’s current market cap stands at $36.2 billion, with $290.4 million in locked DeFi liquidity and $36.2 million in stablecoins. In comparison, Ethereum and Tron hold $163 billion and $79 billion in stablecoins respectively. Hoskinson has repeatedly criticized the Cardano Foundation for the slow DeFi rollout despite $15 million in 2024 marketing spend, including a sponsorship deal with FC Barcelona. In October 2025, the Cardano community approved an additional $33 million in ADA to boost stablecoin liquidity for DeFi projects. Masumi is now testing x402 on smart contracts and offering users a public demo to refine the standard’s real-world mechanics. What’s Next for Cardano The x402 integration is part of the Cardano Foundation’s updated roadmap, which also includes: Implementation of CIP-0113 and CIP-0143 standards Adoption of a new payment framework Expanded support for DeFi and Web3 startups A 12% marketing budget increase planned for 2026 If successful, Cardano could become the first major blockchain to create a functional AI-driven transaction network, bridging the gap between autonomous systems and decentralized finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-29 13:44:59

Accordingly, Binance founder and former CEO CZ warned against purchasing a memecoin created in connection with his statue recently placed in front of the US Capitol in Washington DC. While it was stated that the memecoin created in relation to CZ's statue is CZSTATUE, CZ stated in his post on X that the memecoin linked to his statue is merely an attempt to profit from his own name and urged the public not to purchase it. CZ added that he would not accept the statue as a gift and described it as extremely egoistic for a person to have his own statue in his home. While I appreciate this gesture, the fact that there's a memecoin associated with it means the creator is probably looking to make a quick profit by interacting with me.

The Ifo business climate index report shows a moderate rise in October, as manufacturers struggle. According to the Ifo report, 10.4% of companies in Germany’s electronics and optical industries reported raw material shortages in October, an increase from 7% in July and 3.8% in April. Across the entire manufacturing sector, approximately 5.5% of companies reported difficulties in sourcing raw materials. The Ifo report also highlighted a persistent shortage, particularly in high-tech and precision industries. The Ifo business climate index rose to 88.4 in October from 87.7 Klaus Wohlrabe, head of surveys at the Ifo Institute, stated that the chip shortage has resurfaced in German manufacturing industries. He cited trade restrictions on critical raw materials and rare earth elements as crippling supply conditions. Wohlrabe highlighted the electronic components and optical devices sectors as the most affected. 📈Die Stimmung unter den Unternehmen in Deutschland hat sich verbessert. Der #ifoGeschäftsklimaindex stieg im Oktober auf 88,4 Punkte, nach 87,7 im September. Die deutsche Wirtschaft hofft weiter auf eine Belebung der Konjunktur im kommenden Jahr. @KlausWohlrabe @FuestClemens pic.twitter.com/icNbDgiJTy — ifo Institut (@ifo_Institut) October 27, 2025 The Ifo data suggests that bottlenecks, which had eased considerably earlier this year, are again emerging as a threat to production capacity and export performance. With many electronics firms relying on imports from Asia and constrained by geopolitical tensions, manufacturers struggle to secure steady deliveries of semiconductors, chips, and optical sensors —raw materials essential to Germany’s automotive, machinery, and green-tech sectors. The Ifo business climate index rose to 88.4 in October, up from 87.7 in September. This increase was boosted by optimistic expectations for a better upcoming month. The report noted that companies’ situation worsened for the third month straight, reflecting a moderate but fragile rebound. Carsten Brzeski, Global Head of Macro at ING, revealed that after months of stagnation, the German economy is still trying to find its footing. He added that material shortages, weak external demand, and an uncertain policy environment are the key factors limiting Germany’s recovery. According to Brzeski, the renewed challenges may easily cut industrial output growth in Q4, risking another year of stagnation. Brzeski wrote that German industries no longer dictate the rules of the game. They are currently experiencing global supply frictions. He noted that China is shifting from an export destination to a system rival. China’s tight export controls add pressure to the German chip shortage The recent tightening of controls imposed by the Chinese government has exacerbated Germany’s slowing growth . The restrictions have increased the cost and lead time for critical raw materials used in automotive sensors, power electronics, and advanced optical devices. These areas maintain Germany’s global leadership in the manufacturing industry. Germany faces bureaucratic hurdles, skilled labor shortages, and slow disbursement, which risk further impacting growth even with the €500 billion fiscal stimulus package announced earlier this year for infrastructure and defense. The government has also delayed implementing the structural reforms necessary to boost its competitiveness, despite Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s promise. Business leaders have urged the government to reduce bureaucracy and improve digitalization. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report from earlier this month, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce tightened controls on rare earth exports and processing technologies, thereby preventing unauthorized overseas cooperation. The country accounts for over 90% of the world’s rare earth and magnet products. It produces 17 elements that power electric vehicles, aircraft engines, and military radars. Beijing then restricted the export of rare earth materials in response to the U.S. ban on exporting chipmaking equipment to China. Initially, in August, shipments of rare earth magnets from China surged 10.2% from July, and production increased by 15.4% year-over-year. That was due to an agreement between China, the U.S., and Europe to expedite shipments and ease controls. The latest controls were prompted following a reported inconsistency in rules agreed upon by the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands.

His analysis, which was posted on the social media platform X, focuses on the XRP/ETH weekly chart, where he highlighted the formation of a bullish divergence that has not appeared since mid-2024. The development, he says, signals a constructive shift in momentum that will favor XRP’s price action over Ethereum for the next three months. A Rare Weekly Bullish Divergence Favors XRP Over Ethereum In his update, Charting Guy explained that the XRP/ETH weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) was previously rejected but has now reversed into a bullish divergence. The RSI has turned upward from a low region, while the price closed at a lower low last week, which is a tell-tale sign of waning selling pressure and XRP building strength against Ethereum. Related Reading: Here’s What The XRP Open Interest Reset Means For The Price This green-marked divergence on the analyst’s XRP/ETH chart, which is shown below, mimics a setup that preceded another major swing in XRP’s favor. The yellow RSI moving average has also started to flatten, and this is another signal that momentum could be stabilizing before a breakout. The last time this same configuration occurred was in June 2024, just before XRP began a multi-month surge against Ethereum. Back then, the XRP/ETH pair rose from 0.00015 to as high as 0.0003 in August 2024, before retracing and then finally picking up again in November 2024. The pattern outlined by the analyst shows XRP/ETH currently consolidating near the 0.00063 ratio level. This time, the setup looks equally compelling. The RSI’s upward curve points to market participation on the XRP side, while Ethereum’s relative momentum continues to slow. If the pattern repeats, it could mark the start of another short-term cycle of the token strength against ETH. Short-Term Projection Favors XRP As shown by the projection drawn in blue on the chart above, Charting Guy visualized a scenario where XRP climbs sharply relative to Ethereum. The projection uses the performance of the pair between July 2024 and March 2025 to predict the next move. From here, the projection places the XRP/ETH pair trading above 0.00015 by March 2026. Related Reading: Ethereum and Solana Price Ready To Send Hard? Legendary Analyst Says It’s Time To Pay Attention He concluded his analysis by stating, “I am VERY bullish on $XRP > $ETH the next 3 months.” His three-month forecast implies that XRP could regain a leadership position among major altcoins during the next quarter.

Yet, for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy, reaching a clear FOMC consensus on interest rates is proving to be a significant hurdle. This insight comes from Nick Timiraos, a respected reporter for The Wall Street Journal, widely recognized as the unofficial spokesperson for the U.S. Federal Reserve. Why is FOMC Consensus So Challenging Right Now? Timiraos recently highlighted that the path to a unanimous decision on interest rates is fraught with difficulty. His observations stem from the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which revealed a noticeable split among committee members. It’s not often that such divisions are so clearly articulated, making this situation particularly noteworthy. A significant minority of members expressed a desire for further rate cuts. Their rationale? Primarily for risk management, aiming to buffer against potential economic downturns. Conversely, a substantial portion of the committee felt no immediate need for additional rate adjustments, signaling confidence in the current economic trajectory. This divergence of opinion underscores the inherent complexities in economic forecasting and policy setting, especially when differing views on risk and opportunity prevail among such influential decision-makers. How Do Data Gaps Impact FOMC Consensus ? Typically, economic data serves as the crucial bridge that helps to reconcile these differing perspectives within the FOMC. Fresh, comprehensive metrics provide a common ground, allowing members to reassess their positions and gravitate towards a shared understanding of the economic landscape. However, the current situation presents a unique challenge. The recent government shutdown has unfortunately brought the collection of several key economic metrics to a standstill. This halt in data flow has created a vacuum, leaving committee members with insufficient new information to sway their existing viewpoints. Without fresh data, the foundational basis for shifting opinions is simply absent. This lack of current economic data means: Members are largely operating on pre-existing assumptions and older information. The ability to identify emerging trends or confirm existing ones is severely hampered. The opportunity for data-driven compromise and a stronger FOMC consensus is diminished. It’s a stark reminder of how essential timely and accurate data is for informed decision-making at the highest levels of economic governance. What Are the Broader Implications for FOMC Consensus and Markets? The inability to forge a strong FOMC consensus due to data scarcity carries significant implications, not just for the Federal Reserve but also for financial markets and the broader economy. Uncertainty can breed caution, influencing investment decisions, business planning, and consumer confidence. When the Fed’s direction is less clear, markets may experience increased volatility as participants try to anticipate future moves without solid guidance. Businesses might delay expansion plans, and consumers could become more conservative with spending, all stemming from the ripple effect of policy ambiguity. Key takeaways for observers: Heightened Scrutiny: Future FOMC statements and speeches will be scrutinized even more closely for any hints of evolving perspectives. Data Dependency: The market’s focus will intensify on the resumption of data collection and its subsequent impact on policy outlook. Potential Delays: Major policy shifts might be postponed until a clearer picture emerges, reinforcing the Fed’s data-dependent approach. In essence, the absence of fresh economic data isn’t just a technical glitch; it’s a fundamental impediment to achieving a cohesive FOMC consensus . As Timiraos points out, without new information, bridging the existing divides among members becomes an incredibly difficult task, leaving the path forward for interest rate policy shrouded in uncertainty. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Nick Timiraos and why is his opinion significant? Nick Timiraos is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal. He is often called the U.S. Federal Reserve’s unofficial spokesperson because of his deep connections and accurate reporting on the Fed’s internal discussions and policy outlooks, making his insights highly influential. Q2: What is the FOMC? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System. It is responsible for setting key interest rates and influencing the money supply to promote maximum employment and price stability in the U.S. economy. Q3: Why is achieving FOMC consensus on interest rates important? A strong FOMC consensus signals a clear and unified direction for monetary policy, which helps provide stability and predictability for financial markets, businesses, and consumers. A lack of consensus can lead to uncertainty and market volatility. Q4: How does a government shutdown affect the FOMC’s decision-making? A government shutdown halts the collection and release of crucial economic data (e.g., employment figures, inflation reports). This deprives FOMC members of up-to-date information, making it difficult to assess current economic conditions accurately and to find common ground for policy adjustments. Q5: What are the potential consequences of the FOMC lacking a clear consensus? Without a clear FOMC consensus , there can be increased market uncertainty, delayed policy decisions, and potential volatility in asset prices. Businesses and investors may become more cautious, impacting overall economic activity. If you found this analysis helpful, consider sharing it with your network!

BTC held above $113,000 on cautious trading, surpassing the performance of the precious metal. As expected, BTC shows signs of inflows shifting from gold. The precious metal entered correction territory after dipping under $4,000 per ounce. The inflows into BTC ETF started to recover, while gold inflows diminished in the past week. BTC inflows inched up, while gold ETF inflows shifted direction on October 21, following one of the biggest corrections for gold in more than a decade. | Source: The Bold Report Gold reached peak ETF inflows as of October 21, with liquidity declining since then for the past week. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, gold consolidated and prepared for its next directional move. Spot gold retreated to $3,997.32, considered in correction territory. The precious metal took a step back as focus shifted to the value of the US dollar and the upcoming Fed interest rate decision. Gold also suffered after a shift to risk-on assets. BTC switches to risk-on asset BTC this time showed it did not act as ‘digital gold’ and extended its gains, behaving more closely to tech stocks and risk-on assets. BTC has shown it can grow under many types of investment conditions, switching between a safe haven and hedge, or a risk-on asset. BTC retained its levels against gold in the past day, buying between 28 and 29 ounces of gold. After the most recent recovery, BTC traded at $113,590, with signs of recovering inflows both from crypto insiders and mainstream buyers through ETF. The recent shift in liquidity led to expectations of another BTC rally, as the asset is sometimes considered undervalued compared to gold. ETF inflows for BTC started picking up in the past few days, coinciding with gold’s slide. For now, BTC buying is more cautious, while at the same time ETF buyers are risking with Ethereum, expecting more growth from the network. BTC still leads gold for the year to date BTC shrank its yearly gains to 56.3%, though still leading gold. The precios metal is up a net 45% for the year, while silver gained 40% net. The correlation of gold to BTC is now at 0.59, a relatively low level. The next move for both gold and BTC will determine how the correlation develops. Gold has shown signs of losing support, and is expected to go lower. BTC trades on a different set of factors, both linked to crypto natives and ETF demand. The digital asset is also exploring its performance in connection to reward halving cycles, raising the question of whether the current rally is nearing its end. The Bitcoin fear and greed index recovered to 51, showing neutral behavior for traders. Recently, the BTC market moved on extreme fear, but quickly recovered its previous activity levels. Gold sentiment is also neutral, with 50% of traders going long on gold and 50% going short and betting on currency recovery for the US dollar. Gold may ease further in the case of signals from the Fed on quantitative easing. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The company behind the widely recognized writing assistant, Grammarly, is undergoing a transformative rebranding , taking on the identity of its recent acquisition, Superhuman. This strategic move is not just a name change; it signals a profound shift towards a more integrated and AI-powered future, promising to redefine how we approach our daily tasks and digital interactions. Superhuman: A Bold Rebranding Strategy Unveiled Typically, when a larger entity acquires another, the acquired brand is either absorbed or integrated into the parent company’s existing identity. However, the company formerly known as Grammarly is charting a different course. Following its acquisition of the acclaimed email client Superhuman in July, the entire company is now embracing the name Superhuman . This bold strategic decision highlights the significance of the acquired brand and its vision for the future. Despite this overarching company rebranding, the core Grammarly product, which millions rely on for writing enhancement, will retain its familiar name. This ensures continuity and avoids confusing its loyal user base. However, the company has indicated that other acquired products, such as Coda, a versatile productivity platform brought into the fold last year, are being considered for rebranding in the long run. This indicates a cohesive strategy to unify its diverse offerings under the new Superhuman banner, creating a powerful, integrated productivity suite . Unveiling Superhuman Go: Your New AI Assistant Central to this transformation is the launch of Superhuman Go , an innovative AI assistant seamlessly integrated into Grammarly’s existing browser extension. This assistant is designed to be more than just a writing aid; it’s a contextual intelligence tool poised to enhance various aspects of your digital workflow.

Users can easily experience Superhuman Go by activating a toggle within their Grammarly extension, allowing them to connect it to their preferred applications. Furthermore, the company offers an ‘agent store’ where users can explore different specialized AI agents. This includes a robust plagiarism checker and an advanced proofreader, both launched in August, providing a comprehensive toolkit for professional and personal use. This commitment to an evolving productivity suite demonstrates a clear path towards a more intelligent and integrated digital workspace. Grammarly’s Strategic Evolution and Market Competition For the past several years, the company known as Grammarly has been on a deliberate trajectory to evolve into a comprehensive productivity suite. Its acquisitions of Coda and Superhuman were key steps in this strategic expansion. With the introduction of Superhuman Go, the company is now strongly positioned to compete with established giants in the productivity space, such as Notion, ClickUp, and Google Workspace. These platforms have aggressively integrated AI-powered features into their offerings, raising the bar for digital tools. The strategic shift to a broader productivity suite , powered by advanced AI, allows Superhuman to offer a more holistic solution that anticipates user needs and automates routine tasks.

Trump told reporters Tuesday evening while in Japan that Toyota, the biggest automaker in the world, would invest around $10 billion in America. But Hiroyuki Ueda, a senior Toyota official, said the company made no such clear promise in discussions with Japanese authorities and the U.S. Embassy before Trump arrived. “During the first Trump administration, I think the figure was roughly around $10 billion, so while we didn’t say the same scale, we did explain that we’ll keep investing and providing employment as before,” Ueda told reporters at the Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo. “So, probably because of that context, the figure of about $10 billion came up.” Ueda stressed that Toyota did not tell officials it would put $10 billion into American operations over the coming years. He also said investment talks never came up when Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda had a short conversation with Trump at a U.S. Embassy gathering Tuesday night. Trump’s Japan visit produces little concrete action The confusion over Toyota’s investment plans came during Trump’s three-day Japan visit, which wrapped up Wednesday. The trip featured plenty of warm words between American and Japanese leaders but produced little concrete action on a massive $550 billion investment program Japan has promised. Trump spent Monday through Wednesday in Japan, where he praised Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi repeatedly and talked about a new “golden age” for relations between the two countries as reported by Cryptopolitan . Trump met with Takaichi, who became Japan’s first woman prime minister, on Tuesday. He welcomed her promise to speed up certain initiatives and put his signature on agreements covering trade and other matters. Despite all the ceremony, not a single project moved forward under Japan’s $550 billion investment commitment while Trump was in the country. Two Japanese officials confirmed that the program, which calls for Japan to fund projects that America will control, has not actually started. “No specific projects have been finalized at this point,” Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama said Tuesday when asked about the pledge. An agreement signed in early September by then-economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick lays out how the process should work. Projects will get recommended by a committee led by the commerce secretary, then the president must approve them. “We can’t say for sure how long the process will take at this stage,” Akazawa, now serving as Japan’s trade minister, told reporters Tuesday. Trump headed to Korea after leaving Japan, where another big investment promise, $350 billion this time, has gotten stuck. Arguments over how fast the money should flow, where it comes from, how projects get picked, and how profits get divided have slowed things down there. Fact sheets list potential projects Japanese trade and finance officials put out a fact sheet about the $550 billion program during Trump’s stay. The paper lists 21 American and Japanese companies interested in taking part, with some information about possible projects and their business size based on investment or revenue figures. Companies mentioned include Panasonic with energy storage systems and Westinghouse with small nuclear reactors. The White House released its own statement Tuesday naming project types like energy, artificial intelligence, electronics, critical materials, manufacturing, and logistics, with estimated investment amounts. Akazawa said nobody knows yet how many listed projects will happen or how much financing will come from Japanese institutions. He noted the framework stays open to companies from other countries and could involve financing from banks outside Japan and America too. The uncertainty around the investment program continues as trade negotiations between the two countries face ongoing challenges over various trade issues.

Amidst this renewed interest, XRP and ADA find themselves at a critical juncture. With market volatility on the horizon, the stage is set for potential movement. Delve into the details to discover which cryptocurrencies might be ready to surge. Traders analyze resistance and support levels to predict upcoming market moves — just as Outset PR tracks the performance metrics of media platforms to align its campaigns with shifting market dynamics. By observing these trends, Outset PR ensures its stories resonate with the moment, much like investors identifying assets poised to break out in uncertain conditions. XRP Shows Slight Gains and Potential Breakout Signs Source: tradingview XRP is currently priced around the mid-two dollars, shifting between two dollars and forty-three cents and two dollars and seventy-seven cents. The coin shows a slight uptick of almost nine percent over the past week, hinting at possible upward movement. If it can break the nearest resistance just under two dollars and ninety cents, it might aim for a second resistance over three dollars, representing about a fifteen percent potential rise. With the current RSI around fifty-three, XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating balanced trading. This stable range offers XRP a chance to strengthen, although its journey has been a roller coaster as shown by a six-month boost of over nineteen percent. Cardano Shows Mixed Signals Amid Price Swing Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) is trading between 63 and 71 cents. It's currently stuck below a resistance of 74 cents but holding above 58 cents. Over the past week, it saw a small increase but has dropped significantly over the past month. The coin's recent price trend suggests some uncertainty. For Cardano to rise to its next notable resistance, it needs to climb to 82 cents, which is a potential gain of over ten percent from the higher end of its current range. Still, it's not too strong right now, as indicators show more sellers than buyers. There's potential, but it faces several hurdles to see major growth.

While the world focuses on market movements, developers seem to be laying the groundwork for the next generation of blockchain privacy. This hidden shift could redefine how institutions use XRP for global settlements. A Quiet but Powerful Transformation According to community researcher Pumpius, developers have quietly integrated Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) into Rippled, the core XRPL software. This is not a routine upgrade. It represents a deep structural change that could make XRPL both private and auditable. The integration of ZKPs allows users to verify transactions without revealing any sensitive information. Ripple engineers have discussed ZKPs before, describing them as a bridge between privacy and compliance. By embedding this technology directly into XRPL, the network could support shielded transactions and confidential settlements without compromising transparency. HIDDEN XRP UPGRADE EXPOSED Something massive just happened quietly on the XRP Ledger and almost nobody is talking about it. Developers have now integrated Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) directly into rippled, the core XRPL software. This unlocks: Shielded transactions… https://t.co/2xHTCLInhn — Pumpius (@pumpius) October 28, 2025 Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs on XRPL Zero-Knowledge Proofs enable one party to prove a claim without revealing the underlying data. On XRPL, this means a transaction can be validated without disclosing who sent it or how much was transferred. It could also create a framework for private settlement channels that operate securely under regulatory oversight. If fully adopted, these upgrades may introduce new transaction types like ZkDeposit, ZkWithdraw, and ZkPayment. Such innovations would place XRPL among the few global blockchains offering protocol-level privacy built for institutional use. The Emerging Role of DNA Protocol This development also strengthens the position of DNA Protocol . The project has been building identity and token systems on XRPL that rely on private data frameworks. Its native token, $XDNA, is designed to interact with decentralized identity and information layers. With ZKP technology now in play, DNA Protocol could operate seamlessly within this new environment. Private identities, shielded transfers, and encrypted data verification may soon become everyday features on XRPL. If Ripple’s ecosystem moves in this direction, XRP could act as the transparent bridge while $XDNA powers the private layer beneath it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional and Strategic Implications For institutions, this marks a critical moment. ZK integration transforms XRPL into a dual-use network—transparent enough for regulators, yet private enough for sensitive settlements. Global banks could transfer value discreetly while maintaining provable compliance. Corporations could settle high-value contracts without exposing strategic data. This is the balance the financial world has been waiting for: privacy without secrecy, regulation without restriction. Ripple’s design philosophy has always emphasized interoperability and trust. The inclusion of zero-knowledge technology could now elevate that trust to an entirely new level. XRP Market Update As of report time, XRP trades at approximately $2.65, holding firm in a volatile market. Analysts note that supply levels on major exchanges are decreasing, suggesting growing long-term accumulation. Technical upgrades like ZKP integration may further strengthen investor confidence and enhance XRP’s real-world utility. The Road Ahead The community now awaits official documentation from Ripple or the XRPL Foundation confirming the upgrade. If verified, this marks the beginning of a new privacy era in institutional blockchain infrastructure. The implications stretch beyond token price or short-term hype. The XRP Ledger may be evolving into the world’s first privacy-enabled, regulation-ready financial network—one capable of hosting both open liquidity and hidden settlement channels. Privacy, once seen as a risk, may now become Ripple’s most valuable feature. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Among the most captivating phenomena is Shiba Inu (SHIB) , the self-proclaimed “Dogecoin killer.” Since its meteoric rise, investors and enthusiasts alike have been gripped by one burning question: what does the future hold for SHIB? This article dives deep into the intricate world of Shiba Inu price prediction for the years 2025, 2026, and extending to 2030, exploring the potential for SHIB to reach the coveted $0.00005 mark. Understanding the Shiba Inu Phenomenon and Its Price Dynamics Shiba Inu began as an experiment in decentralized community building, inspired by Dogecoin. It quickly garnered a massive following, fueled by social media buzz and the allure of significant gains. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that often focus on specific technological advancements or real-world applications from the outset, SHIB’s initial value proposition was largely driven by its meme status and the strength of its community, often referred to as the “Shib Army.” However, SHIB has evolved beyond a mere meme. Its ecosystem now includes: ShibaSwap: A decentralized exchange (DEX) where users can dig (provide liquidity), bury (stake), and fetch (swap tokens). Shibarium: A Layer-2 blockchain designed to improve scalability, reduce transaction fees, and enhance the utility of the SHIB ecosystem. SHIB: The Metaverse: A virtual world allowing users to own digital land and interact within a decentralized environment. Burning Mechanisms: Efforts to reduce the circulating supply of SHIB tokens, potentially increasing scarcity and value over time. The price of SHIB, like any other cryptocurrency, is influenced by a complex interplay of supply and demand, market sentiment, broader economic conditions, and specific developments within its ecosystem. Predicting its exact trajectory is challenging, but by analyzing these factors, we can formulate a comprehensive SHIB price forecast . Shiba Inu 2025: What Could Drive SHIB’s Performance? Looking towards Shiba Inu 2025 , several factors could significantly influence its price. The continued development and adoption of Shibarium are paramount. A successful Shibarium could lead to increased utility for SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens, driving demand. Lower transaction costs and faster speeds could attract more developers and users to build on the network, expanding the ecosystem’s reach. Furthermore, the general sentiment of the broader cryptocurrency market will play a crucial role. If the market enters another bull run, driven by institutional adoption or favorable regulatory environments, SHIB, being a high-beta asset, could see amplified gains. Conversely, a bearish market could suppress its growth. Community initiatives, marketing efforts, and potential partnerships could also provide catalysts. The SHIB Army’s ability to maintain engagement and attract new members remains a key strength. Our analysis suggests that by 2025, SHIB could see a modest but significant appreciation, potentially trading within a range that brings it closer to its all-time highs, depending heavily on market conditions and ecosystem advancements. Will SHIB Price Forecast Reach $0.00005 by 2026 or 2030? The question of whether SHIB can reach $0.00005 is a common one among investors. Achieving this price target requires a substantial increase from its current levels, necessitating a significant market capitalization expansion and sustained demand. This target, while ambitious, is not entirely out of the realm of possibility over the longer term, especially when considering the potential impact of continued token burning and ecosystem growth. For 2026, the trajectory will likely be a continuation of trends established in 2025. If Shibarium proves successful and attracts substantial decentralized application (dApp) development and user activity, it could provide a strong fundamental basis for price appreciation. Token burning initiatives, if implemented effectively and consistently, could also gradually reduce the supply, making each remaining SHIB token more valuable. Extending to 2030, the long-term viability of SHIB will depend on its ability to evolve beyond its meme coin origins and establish itself as a significant player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and metaverse spaces. The success of SHIB: The Metaverse and its integration with Shibarium could unlock new avenues for utility and demand. Regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies globally could also provide a more stable environment for growth. Here is a hypothetical SHIB price forecast range for these years, assuming moderate to strong market growth and ecosystem development: Year Potential Low ($) Potential High ($) Target $0.00005 Achievability 2025 $0.000015 $0.000030 Challenging, but possible with strong bull run 2026 $0.000020 $0.000045 Attainable with sustained growth and utility 2030 $0.000040 $0.000080+ Highly probable, potentially exceeding target Disclaimer: These are speculative predictions based on current trends and potential future developments. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and actual prices may vary significantly. This is not financial advice. Key Factors Influencing SHIB’s Future Trajectory Understanding the fundamental drivers behind SHIB’s potential growth is crucial for any investor considering its SHIB future . These factors extend beyond simple market sentiment: Shibarium Adoption and Ecosystem Growth: The success of the Layer-2 solution is arguably the most critical factor. Increased transaction volume, dApp deployment, and user engagement on Shibarium directly translate to increased utility and demand for SHIB and its associated tokens. Token Burning Initiatives: The SHIB community has actively pursued token burning strategies to reduce the vast circulating supply. Consistent and significant burns could create scarcity, which historically can lead to price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases. Community Strength and Engagement: The “Shib Army” is one of SHIB’s most powerful assets. Sustained community engagement, active participation in governance (via BONE), and viral marketing campaigns can maintain interest and attract new investors. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends: SHIB’s price often correlates with the overall performance of the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. A bull market typically lifts most altcoins, while a bear market can lead to widespread declines. Development and Innovation: Continuous development of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including new features for ShibaSwap, advancements in SHIB: The Metaverse, and strategic partnerships, can demonstrate long-term viability and attract investment. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving cryptocurrency regulations globally can either hinder or foster growth. Clear, favorable regulations could bring more institutional money into the market, benefiting assets like SHIB. The Role of Meme Coin Analysis in SHIB’s Trajectory While Shiba Inu has developed a robust ecosystem, its origins as a meme coin continue to influence its market dynamics. Meme coin analysis requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional cryptocurrencies. Key aspects include: Community Sentiment: The emotional connection and loyalty of the community are paramount. Positive sentiment, viral trends, and social media buzz can drive rapid price surges. Social Media Presence: A strong presence on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Telegram is vital for meme coins. News, updates, and community activities often spread rapidly through these channels. Influencer and Celebrity Endorsements: While less predictable, endorsements from prominent figures can trigger significant price movements. Narrative and Hype: Meme coins often thrive on a compelling narrative or a wave of hype. Sustaining this narrative, even as the project matures, is important. For SHIB, the challenge is to balance its meme appeal with its growing utility. If it can successfully transition from being primarily a meme coin to a project with substantial real-world or digital-world applications, its long-term stability and growth potential will be significantly enhanced. Challenges and Risks for SHIB’s Journey Despite the optimistic outlook, several challenges and risks could impact SHIB’s price trajectory: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, are notoriously volatile. Sudden price drops or pumps are common, making investment risky. Competition: The meme coin space is crowded, with new projects constantly emerging. SHIB faces competition from established players like Dogecoin and newer, trendy tokens. Scalability and Adoption of Shibarium: While promising, Shibarium’s success is not guaranteed. If it fails to attract significant users or developers, its impact on SHIB’s value could be limited. Tokenomics Concerns: Despite burning initiatives, SHIB still has a very large circulating supply. Achieving significant price appreciation (e.g., to $0.00005) requires a substantial market cap, which could be challenging without aggressive burning. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the crypto market matures, regulators may impose stricter rules, potentially impacting decentralized projects and meme coins. Actionable Insights for SHIB Holders For those considering or currently holding SHIB, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand SHIB’s ecosystem, its development roadmap, and the broader market trends. Do not rely solely on social media hype. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into one asset. Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are unpredictable, and capital loss is a real possibility. Stay Informed: Follow official Shiba Inu channels, reputable crypto news sources, and market analysts to stay updated on developments that could impact SHIB’s price. Consider Long-Term Potential: While short-term gains are enticing, SHIB’s more significant potential may lie in its long-term ecosystem development and utility growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are answers to some common questions about Shiba Inu’s future: Q1: What is the highest SHIB can go? A1: There is no theoretical upper limit, but reaching significant price points like $0.01 would require an astronomical market capitalization, far exceeding current crypto giants. While ambitious, its potential is tied to ecosystem growth and burning. Q2: Will SHIB reach $0.00005? A2: Based on our SHIB price forecast and considering factors like Shibarium adoption, burning mechanisms, and overall market sentiment, reaching $0.00005 is a plausible target in the coming years (e.g., by 2026-2030), especially if the broader crypto market experiences a strong bull run. Q3: Is SHIB a good investment for the long term? A3: SHIB’s long-term investment potential hinges on its ability to transition from a meme coin to a utility-driven ecosystem. If Shibarium , ShibaSwap , and the metaverse projects gain significant adoption, it could be a viable long-term hold, but it remains a high-risk, high-reward asset. Q4: Who created Shiba Inu? A4: Shiba Inu was created by an anonymous individual or group known only as Ryoshi in August 2020. Ryoshi famously sent 50% of the total SHIB supply to Vitalik Buterin , the co-founder of Ethereum . Q5: What is Shibarium? A5: Shibarium is a Layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum, designed to enhance the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Its purpose is to provide faster transactions, lower fees, and a more robust platform for decentralized applications and services within the SHIB universe. Conclusion: Navigating SHIB’s Promising but Volatile Future The journey of Shiba Inu from a playful meme coin to a developing ecosystem has been remarkable. Our Shiba Inu price prediction for 2025, 2026, and 2030 suggests a potential for significant growth, with the $0.00005 target appearing increasingly plausible in the coming years, particularly by the end of the decade. This optimism is largely underpinned by the continued success of Shibarium, aggressive token burning, and the unwavering strength of its community. However, it is vital to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and subject to rapid shifts. While the SHIB future holds considerable promise, investors must approach it with caution, conduct thorough research, and understand the inherent risks. The path to $0.00005 will likely be a dynamic one, filled with both opportunities and challenges, making vigilance and informed decision-making paramount.

They represent protocols deploying treasury assets to remove circulating supply, often by purchasing tokens from the open market. That’s a major shift in market structure, from inflationary emissions to deflationary support. Aggregate Buyback Overview As of October 2025, aggregated buyback inflows stand at $1.2 billion, absorbing an average of 4.59% of total circulating supply across tracked protocols. Top Three by Value $HYPE, $916.66M (76.38%) $PUMP, $151.12M (12.59%) $JUP, $62.2M (5.18%) Together, these three account for 94.1% of total buyback value. It’s a highly concentrated trend, a handful of projects are driving nearly all the recorded absorption. Buybacks vs Emissions Across the eight protocols analyzed, buybacks have offset roughly 110% of emission value this year. That means, on aggregate, more tokens were purchased and removed from circulation than were created via inflation. In practice, that’s one of the few times in this cycle where net token supply turned deflationary for a measurable period. Do Buybacks Impact Price? The data paints a mixed picture. Among projects running active buyback programs, only two have seen significant price appreciation since launch, $HYPE and $AAVE. $HYPE → +200% since the HL Assistance Fund began treasury buybacks. Consistent support from Hyperliquid’s revenue pool has allowed $HYPE to weather volatility and maintain strong liquidity. $AAVE → +94% since its April buyback program began, marking one of the most effective treasury-driven recoveries this year. By contrast, $PUMP rallied early but has since cooled, down 29% since the program’s first phase. Other tokens like $JUP, $ETHFI, and $RESOLV continue to trade under pressure, showing that not every buyback guarantees market recovery. Jupiter’s Next Move For $JUP, structural changes may be the next catalyst. The protocol has proposed a DAO vote to approve a 121M token burn, shorten unstaking periods from 30 days to 7, and refine its voting scope. That’s a clear signal that Jupiter is resetting its token economy around sustainable governance and liquidity flow. But for now, market reaction remains muted. The Buyback Paradox Buybacks sound bullish on paper, but in practice, they can cut both ways. If a token’s core utility weakens, buybacks can quickly turn from support mechanisms into capital sinks, draining treasury funds without delivering long-term price relief. That’s why analysts view these programs as short-term stabilizers, not standalone growth tools. They work best when paired with strong utility and consistent revenue inflows. As one trader put it on X, “Buybacks buy time, not conviction.” Market Trend Analysis Buyback activity peaked between Q2 and Q3 2025, coinciding with major unlock periods across Solana, Ethereum Layer 2s, and DeFi protocols. Three distinct patterns emerged: 1. Meme and retail-driven tokens, like Pump.fun and Bonk, showed stronger relative absorption due to active community liquidity and faster turnover. 2. DeFi protocols, such as AAVE and RESOLV, relied on structured, revenue-linked repurchases but moved slower in execution. 3. Revenue-backed platforms, like Hyperliquid ($HYPE), displayed consistent execution, buying tokens across market cycles instead of one-time events. Beyond Burn Events Buybacks are evolving. They’re no longer one-off burn announcements meant to drive temporary hype. Instead, they’re being built into long-term supply management frameworks, often automated through treasury smart contracts. Hyperliquid’s “HL Assistance Fund” model and AAVE’s “Treasury Buyback Stream” are now viewed as case studies in sustainable capital rotation. As these structures mature, expect buybacks to become a core metric in how protocols manage tokenomics, just like emissions, staking yield, or TVL once were. Broader Market Implications This wave of buyback activity suggests a maturing crypto economy. Protocols are starting to mirror traditional finance tactics, share repurchases, yield management, and deflationary offsets. The difference? In crypto, every transaction is on-chain and transparent, allowing real-time tracking of treasury behavior. That visibility creates new analytical tools. Sites like Tokenomist.ai are now tracking on-chain buyback flows the same way CoinMarketCap tracks volume or supply, turning treasury management into a quantifiable metric. The $1.2B in buyback inflows seen so far in 2025 marks one of the strongest supply-side contractions since the last bull cycle. Still, price impact remains uneven. Buybacks can support token floors, but they don’t rebuild fundamentals. For projects like $HYPE and $AAVE, consistent execution has rewarded holders. For others, it’s a reminder that buybacks alone can’t fix weak demand or broken token design. As the market heads into 2026, watch how protocols evolve these programs, from reactive treasury interventions into systemic, yield-backed capital strategies. Because in a year where emissions flood the market, absorption is the real alpha. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Bitwise Asset Management has officially launched the first-ever U.S. Solana Staking ETF, trading under the ticker $BSOL. Within its first 90 minutes, the ETF surpassed $20 million in trading volume, signaling strong institutional demand for Solana exposure. Today is a watershed moment for Solana! Introducing the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF: $BSOL BSOL is built to maximize Solana’s 7%+ average staking rewards* for investors, targeting 100% of assets staked through Bitwise Onchain Solutions, powered by the high-performance tech of… pic.twitter.com/OPAhdyHvpS — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) October 28, 2025 A Historic First for Solana This marks the first SEC-approved Solana ETF, and it didn’t disappoint out of the gate. $BSOL opened with $220 million in assets under management on day one, a staggering debut for a non-Bitcoin product. For comparison, that’s already half the size of $SSK, another staking ETF launched in July. That kind of early momentum isn’t just hype. It’s real capital rotating into Solana from institutions and fund managers who have been waiting for a legitimate, regulated product. Breaking: Bitwise spot Solana staking ETF ( $BSOL ) surpasses $20M in trading volume within its first 90 minutes. pic.twitter.com/urS4srxmfO — The Solana Post (@thesolanapost) October 28, 2025 Why It Matters The launch of $BSOL could reshape how investors view Solana. For years, Ethereum has dominated institutional narratives, but now, Solana finally has its own regulated gateway. If current inflows continue, $BSOL could position Solana as the next major institutional narrative after ETH. Bitwise’s ETF directly stakes Solana on-chain, allowing holders to capture staking rewards while maintaining liquidity through traditional markets. That combination, yield + regulated access, is exactly what large investors have been asking for. Built to Capture Solana’s Staking Yield The fund is structured to maximize Solana’s 7%+ average staking rewards, using Bitwise’s onchain infrastructure and validator network. All staking operations are powered by Bitwise Onchain Solutions, integrated with high-performance tooling from @heliuslabs, one of the core Solana infrastructure providers. For a limited time, Bitwise is waiving management fees (0%) to encourage early adoption and liquidity buildup. In traditional ETF terms, that’s an aggressive opening move, and it’s clearly working. Why Solana? Solana isn’t just another blockchain, it’s one of the fastest-growing technology platforms in the world. In the past year alone, Solana has generated over $2 billion in network revenue, according to ecosystem data. That’s more than any other chain in 2025. Known for its high throughput and ultra-low fees, Solana’s architecture supports tens of thousands of transactions per second, with gas fees averaging less than a cent. Five years post-launch, Solana has achieved mainstream traction across DeFi, NFTs, payments, and now, capital markets. Bitwise just launched its Solana staking ETF ($BSOL) and it came out swinging. – $220M in assets on day one – Already half the size of $SSK , which launched in July That kind of opening volume isn’t retail noise, it’s real capital rotating into Solana. If flows hold, $BSOL … https://t.co/vT4beYstnF pic.twitter.com/qoyoDh3urg — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) October 28, 2025 Institutional Confidence Is Building Institutional demand for Solana exposure has been steadily rising since late 2024, following a surge in developer activity and DeFi TVL. The introduction of $BSOL gives funds and advisors a compliant, yield-generating Solana vehicle, unlocking a new wave of inflows from traditional capital. For context, Solana currently trades around $198 with a market capitalization exceeding $109 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. That puts it firmly in the top three crypto assets by market value, and now, with its own ETF, it stands on equal footing with Ethereum and Bitcoin in the eyes of U.S. regulators. The ETF’s Impact on Solana’s Ecosystem Beyond market optics, the ETF directly strengthens Solana’s staking layer. Every $BSOL share represents underlying Solana tokens that are actively staked. That means more SOL is being locked into validator nodes, tightening circulating supply and supporting network security. If the ETF continues to grow, it could indirectly drive higher staking participation rates and long-term network stability. For the ecosystem, this translates into real economic weight, Solana’s validators, infra providers, and DeFi protocols all stand to benefit from greater institutional liquidity. Bitwise’s Broader Strategy Bitwise has positioned itself as one of the most aggressive asset managers in the digital asset ETF race. After successfully launching spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the firm’s move into Solana was the next logical step, but the staking element sets $BSOL apart. By combining traditional ETF exposure with onchain yield, Bitwise bridges legacy finance and decentralized infrastructure in a single product. It’s a signal that tokenized yield-bearing assets are maturing into a recognized asset class. Market Reaction: Real Flows, Not Retail Noise Within hours of trading, $BSOL’s performance outpaced expectations. Volume crossed $20 million in the first 90 minutes, and liquidity metrics indicate that institutional desks and trading firms were among the first movers. “This isn’t retail noise, this is real capital,” as one market analyst put it on X. The strong opening suggests that institutions see Solana as the next major blockchain with credible ETF traction, a phrase that’s already circulating across crypto Twitter. What This Means for Solana’s Future The launch of $BSOL could mark a new phase for Solana’s global perception. Ethereum once had the spotlight after its ETF approvals, now, Solana steps into that role with a similar pathway to regulated access. For investors, it offers a blend of growth exposure and staking yield. For developers, it validates years of work on Solana’s performance and reliability. And for institutions, it offers something rare, onchain yield, delivered through a traditional financial wrapper. Crypto Goes Mainstream, Again 2025 has been the year crypto finally broke into the mainstream asset class conversation. With spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already thriving, Solana’s inclusion via $BSOL cements its place as the third pillar of institutional crypto portfolios. As capital markets continue to move onchain, products like $BSOL make that transition tangible, bridging Wall Street and Web3. Bitwise called Solana a “rising star, just getting started.” Judging by today’s numbers, they might be right. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Many projects promise innovation but fall short when tested by real-world demand and user engagement. Mono Protocol was designed differently. Built for efficiency, it focuses on solving long-standing DeFi challenges like high gas fees, delayed transactions, and unreliable cross-chain execution. With an active Reward Hub , Mono Protocol is positioning itself as the next potential big presale crypto for 2025. Its growing momentum and clear roadmap show how well-planned presale crypto projects can redefine trust in Web3 and blockchain ecosystems. Solving DeFi’s Biggest Pain Points with Mono Protocol Mono Protocol stands out among the top crypto presale projects for its technical precision and user-first design. It operates as a DeFi interoperability layer that enables fast and secure cross-chain transfers, up to 40% faster than traditional routes, with no compromise on safety. Reliability is another core advantage. Mono guarantees cross-chain execution without reverts, ensuring transactions complete as intended. This eliminates one of the most frustrating issues in decentralized trading: failed or reverted transfers. On the cost side, Mono offers lower fees compared to standard bridges. Its structure prevents frontrunning, reduces price impact, and eliminates unnecessary value loss. These combined features place Mono among the most efficient blockchain-based solutions in the current crypto presale list, setting a new benchmark for DeFi performance and reliability. Mono Protocol’s Presale Gains Momentum Across DeFi and Web3 Stage 15 of Mono Protocol’s presale crypto event continues to gain traction across the DeFi and Web3 community. The token price is currently $0.0450, with a projected launch price of $0.500, reflecting strong early interest in the new crypto presale 2025 landscape. Mono’s Reward Hub adds an interactive layer to participation. Users can complete referral, social, and presale challenges to earn bonus $MONO and unlock promo codes. Each activity encourages engagement while strengthening community ties. The upcoming smart contract audit reinforces Mono’s transparency. A beta launch on November 7 and an AMA session on November 13 mark key milestones, showing how this presale ICO maintains consistent progress toward public release. How Remittix Connects DeFi and Global Payments Remittix is another blockchain-based project designed to simplify cross-border payments. By removing intermediaries, it reduces transaction costs and increases speed for international transfers. Its primary audience consists of fintech users and payment networks that need efficient remittance solutions. However, unlike broader DeFi ecosystems such as Mono Protocol, Remittix’s reach is narrower, appealing mainly to institutional users. Despite this, its infrastructure demonstrates how blockchain continues to reshape traditional financial systems. Best Wallet Token Simplifies Digital Asset Management Best Wallet Token is tackling the challenge of fragmented wallet systems. It integrates staking, trading, and payments within one platform, giving users a single hub for managing their crypto activities. This presale crypto project focuses on accessibility and convenience, making DeFi tools more usable for the average person. However, its long-term success depends heavily on mobile adoption rates, as the ecosystem relies on widespread app usage. Compared to larger blockchain frameworks, it’s still in early development but contributes meaningfully to wallet innovation in Web3. Bitcoin Hyper Expands DeFi on Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper builds on Bitcoin’s established reputation by adding DeFi features and staking utilities. It allows users to earn yield directly from Bitcoin’s base network, merging stability with decentralized earning potential. While this idea appeals to those who trust Bitcoin’s foundation, Bitcoin Hyper still faces scalability limitations. The experience isn’t as smooth or fast as newer crypto presales like Mono Protocol that are built on multi-chain infrastructures. Yet, it signals a growing movement to expand Bitcoin’s functionality beyond being just a store of value. The Future of Web3 Finance Through Mono Protocol As the next potential big presale crypto in 2025, Mono Protocol exemplifies how thoughtful design and transparent development can restore trust in decentralized systems. Its cross-chain performance, verified audits, and interactive community hub position it as one of the few cryptocurrency presales that balance innovation with accountability. Mono isn’t just another entry in the crypto presale list, it’s a blueprint for how Web3 platforms can merge reliability, accessibility, and engagement into one ecosystem. With continued progress across audits, beta launches, and user-driven initiatives, Mono Protocol may set a new standard for how presale ICOs can sustainably scale within the DeFi landscape.

The milestone highlights its transformation from a graphics-chip maker into one of the most influential forces in the global AI industry. Nvidia’s shares have grown twelvefold since the start of 2022 and are up 82% this year. The company reached this new milestone just three months after crossing the $4 trillion mark — a valuation that now exceeds the entire cryptocurrency market and represents nearly half the value of the Stoxx 600 stock index. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Matt Britzman called the achievement “not just a record, but a statement.” He noted that Nvidia has evolved from a chip maker into an industry creator — and that the market still underestimates the company’s vast potential. Earlier this year, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that Nvidia’s order book for AI chips has surpassed $500 billion , alongside plans to build seven supercomputers for the U.S. government. The Billion-Dollar Impact and Market Buzz According to Bloomberg, Huang’s net worth is estimated at $174 billion , making him the ninth-richest person in the world. Under his leadership, the H100 and Blackwell chips have become the backbone of leading AI models, including those developed by OpenAI and xAI. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital Management, remarked that “the current AI expansion is fueled by mutual funding among a few major players.” He cautioned that if investors begin demanding returns over promises, the growth cycle could slow. Nvidia’s dominance has also drawn regulatory attention . U.S. export restrictions on advanced chips have positioned the company as a strategic player in Washington’s technology policy toward China. Still, Huang has urged collaboration, warning against excluding Chinese developers — who make up nearly half of the world’s AI specialists. Despite rising competition from AMD and emerging startups, Nvidia remains at the forefront of the AI revolution.",News|Business,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-29 15:30:47

Those figures confirm a resurgence that has seen those investment vehicles raising more this year compared to the previous two years. SPACs make $24 billion comeback According to SPAC data platform SPACAnalytics , 2025 has already seen 110 new SPAC IPOs, raising over $22 billion, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. IPO volume this year. This is coming after SPACs were left for dead after their moment in the sun between 2020 and 2021. They raised a record $250 billion in those two years before the bottom fell out as poor returns brought everything crashing down. In the first quarter of 2025, 19 new SPAC listings returned the optimism around the market, raising a combined $3.1 billion. Most of those rounds were also led by seasoned sponsors. Speculative frontiers benefit from SPAC return The last time SPACs were relevant, most of the funds went into electric vehicles and fintech. However, this new cycle is being powered by nuclear energy, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency, sectors that combine frontier innovation with a healthy dose of risk. SPACs’ interest in nuclear technology projects may not be unrelated to the boom in data center infrastructures in the United States and across the world, as well as the power demands that accompany them. Major tech giants have recently committed to agreements to revamp nuclear facilities or build new ones to power data centers and AI infrastructures, and the projection is that more of such facilities may spring up in the near future as power consumption surges exponentially globally. Quantum computing has also seen an interest surge as Big Tech firms like Microsoft, Google, and AMD have claimed major breakthroughs in the high-potential sector. The crypto industry, which has seen a major turnaround in fortunes since the last quarter of 2024, is reappearing in SPAC pipelines as digital asset adoption rebounds thanks to a pro-crypto White House led by President Donald Trump. Are investors taking any lessons from the past? Since January 2019, only 11% of the 589 companies that went public through SPAC mergers trade above their original listing price, according to Bloomberg data shared by The Kobeissi Letter . Another 31% have been acquired or gone bankrupt, while nearly half have lost between 50% and 99% of their value. Only 11% of the companies that went public through SPAC mergers trade above their original listing price. Source: Bloomberg data shared by The Kobeissi Letter . However, proponents argue that this new generation of sponsors is more disciplined, although that optimism has not faced a major test this year. The sectors receiving the most attention are doing relatively well, either from the market side of things or the regulatory outlook. If crypto prices crash, quantum development stalls, or nuclear projects hit regulatory roadblocks, the very sectors powering the SPAC comeback could also trigger its next collapse.

It has gained over 4% in the past week, though it remains slightly lower on the day. Traders are watching key price zones and the upcoming FOMC rate decision for the next move. Price Retests Key Support Zone Bitcoin recently pulled back into the $111,000–$112,000 range, an area that previously acted as resistance. The level is now holding as support. The price has bounced modestly since, trading back above $113,000. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that Bitcoin tested lower levels and found some buying pressure. He also warned traders to avoid leverage on days with macro events like today’s expected FOMC rate decision, citing the likelihood of heightened volatility. So far, so good for #Bitcoin . Retest of the lower levels to find buying pressure and that’s, with a weak bounce, been found. Volatility should be going up enormously today as the FOMC event kicks in, and I would, again, urge nobody to trade leverage on a day like this if… pic.twitter.com/etO845EBmS — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) October 29, 2025 Bitcoin is still above its short-term moving average. As long as the $111,000 zone holds, the broader trend remains intact. The next key test lies between $119,000 and $120,000—a range that previously triggered a rejection. A clean move above this area would open the way toward $123,000. Meanwhile, the TD Sequential indicator has issued another sell signal. Analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that past signals from this tool have preceded sharp reversals, including a recent 19% drop. Gap Watch and Elliott Wave Structure On the long-term chart, Bitcoin left a price gap around $110,900–$113,000. According to another popular analist, this gap was “ partially filled today .” He added that a full fill “ would be better before markets move higher .” In a separate update , recent price action still fits a potential ABC corrective structure. If current levels fail to break higher, a C-wave drop could follow, with possible downside targets between $97,000 and $94,000. Large Holders Stay Active On-chain data continues to show strong activity between $112,000 and $117,000. More than 1 million BTC have changed hands in this zone. Long-term holders remain dominant, despite the recent pullback. Source: CryptoBusy/X Ali said that Bitcoin must break above $120,000 to open the path toward the $143,000 region, based on pricing band models. For now, the $111,000–$120,000 range remains the key area to watch. It’s important to take the above in the context of the upcoming FOMC meeting as well.

As market activity increases ahead of the FED's interest rate decision, investors are searching for answers to the question, “What will the FED interest rate decision be this month?” Despite the limited data release due to the recent government shutdown in the US, it is considered certain that the FED will reduce its policy rate. At this point, the FED's 25 basis point cut tonight is priced in at 99.9%, while leaving interest rates unchanged is priced in at only 0.1%. When Will the October Fed Interest Rate Decision Be Announced? The FED will announce its October interest rate decision on October 29, 2025 at 21:00 Turkish time. Following the decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make oral statements regarding both the economic outlook and the future of monetary policy at 21:30. What was the FED's September Interest Rate Decision? In September, the Fed lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4-4.25%, in line with expectations, marking its first rate cut of the year. This was the first time the Fed had made a decision to cut interest rates in 2025. What are the FED Expectations? The Fed is expected to continue the interest rate cuts it initiated in September in October. At this point, the FED is expected to lower the policy rate to the 3.75%-4.00% range following the latest inflation data. Jefferies global economist Mohit Kumar said that while a rate cut is considered a certainty, he expects Fed Chair Jerome Powell to adopt a cautious stance on the issue after the FOMC meeting today. Apart from this, Morgan Stanley economists also predict that the Fed will make a 25 basis point cut today. Related News: Critical Fed Interest Rate Decision to Be Announced Tomorrow: Morgan Stanley Announces Its Outlook for October and Beyond! Stands Out from the Others! Finally, analyst firm QCP Capital said the Fed was preparing to make a 25 basis point move due to the data outage, but that didn't leave Powell much room for new guidance. Analysts say the lack of official data since the US government shutdown has effectively forced the Fed to act blindly. Without inflation or labor pressure, any policy readjustment would be premature. Trump Criticizes Powell Ahead of Fed Decision! US President Donald Trump took aim again just hours before the Fed's decision, criticizing Jerome Powell for being slow to cut interest rates. In his speech in Gyeongju, South Korea, Trump stated that the Fed has been slow to cut interest rates, saying, “We will not have a Fed that raises interest rates because they are worried about inflation three years from now.” Trump stated that he expects the economy to grow by 4% in the first quarter of 2026 and argued that current monetary policy is negatively impacting the business environment. *This is not investment advice.

Some analysts point at a $0.248 price point if $DOGE breaks out of the symmetrical triangle pattern. House of Doge becomes majority stake holder in the Italian soccer team US Triestina Calcio 1918, which expands on $DOGE’s real-world utility. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) reaches $3.8M in presale promoting no stop-loss trading and yolo entries at 1000x leverage. Dogecoin remains bullish, believe analysts, despite a 4% drop over the last 24 hours, suggesting a $0.22 breakout if momentum recovers in this Q4. $DOGE lost its footing following October 10’s market crash, which vaporized $19B in leveraged positions , causing it to crash by 27.8% in just two days. Since then, the coin struggled to regain momentum, but failed to consolidate in the green, partly because Bitcoin didn’t make it either. $BTC also failed to retain momentum above $115K on three different occasions and is now trading at $112.6K on a 2.46% 24-hour loss. Despite this bearish performance, the market is confident in $DOGE’s Q4 performance and Maxi Doge’s ($MAXI) $3.8M presale could contribute to that. Can $DOGE Reclaim $0.22? $DOGE shows signs of a bullish tendency, which could support a push to $0.22 if momentum starts to build up. Analysts like Trader Tardigrade go even farther than that, suggesting a price point of $0.248 in case of a breakout from the Symmetrical Triangle pattern. But how is a breakout possible considering $DOGE’s rather bearish recent performance, which largely stems from massive sells? As analyst Ali points out, whales sold over 500M $DOGE over the past week. The answer is that this is a problem of perspective. While some whales sold in bulk, others started their accumulation phase. As Onchain Lens noted, one whale wallet withdrew over 15M $DOGE from Binance, worth $2.95M. Only sold $1,450-worth of tokens. This type of whale activity is usually a sign of consolidation in preparation for a coming bull phase and $DOGE’s chart performance shows exactly that. With the coin now at $0.1936 and whales making massive moves ahead of the coming FOMC meeting , we expect a momentum buildup into November. A breakout above $0.20 could fuel a more consistent push to $0.22 and above. The hints are there, especially with $DOGE’s 24h trading volume which is now 33.75% in the green. It was over 60% earlier today, suggesting increased investor movements. The price remained stable throughout, though, which means something big may be coming this week. And let’s not forget House of Doge’s decision to acquire a majority stake in the Italian soccer team, US Triestina Calcio 1918, which expands on $DOGE’s real-world utility, adding even more legitimacy into the mix. Long-term, $DOGE will likely break above $0.250, especially with projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) adding more flavor to the dish. How Maxi Doge Makes Trading Fun Maxi Doge ($MAXI) turns trading into a big boy’s game, where only the toughest can survive. The Maxi Doge philosophy is simple and it fuels the entire ecosystem: retire at 22. There are no shortcuts, excuses, or barriers to overcome. Everything goes in a straight line with no plan Bs or safety nets. This explains why Maxi Doge trades at 1000x leverage, buys green candles, and chases pumps while on a diet of Red Bull and Maxitren 9000. Maxi Doge presents itself as the solution to moderate, lukewarm trading, and offers unhinged investing as the alternative. The solution is in your face: Maxi Doge embodies sheer willpower: lift, trade, repeat. The $MAXI community channels that energy, sharing leveraged strategies, competitions, and meme-driven camaraderie to unlock maximal gains together. — Maxi Doge, Official whitepaper The presale has been doing very well recently, raising over $3.8M as investors took notice and started succumbing to the FOMO fever. $MAXI now sells at $0.0002655, which means this is the best time to invest, given the project’s potential and meme impact. If $MAXI can replicate even a fraction of $DOGE’s 34,441% all-time ROI, we’re looking at a slam dunk. Don’t take this as financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) before investing.

One such voice, Michael Saylor, co-founder and Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, has made a particularly bold Bitcoin price prediction . He anticipates the digital asset could reach an astonishing $150,000 by the close of this year. This forecast, shared during an interview with CNBC, has naturally captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. What Drives Michael Saylor’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Michael Saylor’s optimism isn’t just a hunch; it’s rooted in a deep understanding of market dynamics and Bitcoin’s evolving ecosystem. His confidence stems from several key factors that he believes are setting the stage for significant price appreciation. These include the unprecedented institutional inflows, particularly through spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and Bitcoin’s unique supply economics. Saylor highlights how Bitcoin is increasingly being recognized as a superior asset class. Its limited supply, coupled with growing demand from both retail and institutional players, creates a powerful upward pressure on its value. This perspective positions Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational component of modern portfolios. The Impact of Institutional Adoption on Bitcoin’s Trajectory The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been a game-changer. These investment vehicles have opened the floodgates for traditional finance to access Bitcoin, leading to billions of dollars flowing into the asset. This institutional embrace is a significant validation for Bitcoin and a major driver for any ambitious Bitcoin price prediction . Increased Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for large funds and individual investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Legitimacy: Regulatory approval for ETFs adds a layer of credibility, attracting more conservative investors. Supply Shock: As institutions accumulate Bitcoin through ETFs, the available supply on exchanges diminishes, potentially leading to price surges. MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has been a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, holding a substantial amount of BTC on its balance sheet. This strategy reflects a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Is a $150,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction Achievable by Year-End? Achieving a $150,000 price point within a year might seem ambitious to some, but historical trends and upcoming events lend credence to such a possibility. The Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, traditionally precedes significant bull runs. This scarcity model is a core tenet of Bitcoin’s value proposition. Furthermore, the broader macroeconomic environment, including potential interest rate cuts and a weakening dollar, could also favor scarce assets like Bitcoin. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile. While the potential for substantial gains exists, so does the risk of price fluctuations. Navigating the Volatility: What Should Investors Consider? For those looking at a Bitcoin price prediction like Saylor’s, understanding market dynamics and managing risk is paramount. A long-term perspective is often recommended, as Bitcoin’s journey has historically been one of significant peaks and valleys. Diversification: Do not put all your investment capital into a single asset. Research: Always conduct your own due diligence before making investment decisions. Long-Term Strategy: Consider Bitcoin as a long-term hold rather than a short-term trade. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Michael Saylor’s insights are highly valued due to his extensive experience and MicroStrategy’s significant investment in Bitcoin. His predictions, while optimistic, are based on a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing Bitcoin’s market position. Michael Saylor’s bold Bitcoin price prediction of $150,000 by year-end injects a powerful wave of optimism into the crypto market. His conviction, fueled by institutional adoption and Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, paints a compelling picture of future growth. While the path to such a valuation will undoubtedly involve market volatility, the underlying fundamentals highlighted by Saylor suggest a robust trajectory for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Investors should approach such forecasts with a balanced perspective, combining enthusiasm with prudent risk management and thorough research. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin price prediction for year-end? Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, predicts that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by the end of the current year. Why does Michael Saylor believe Bitcoin will reach $150,000? His prediction is largely based on increasing institutional adoption, particularly through spot Bitcoin ETFs, and Bitcoin’s fixed supply dynamics which create scarcity and demand. What role do Bitcoin ETFs play in this prediction? Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide an accessible avenue for large institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, leading to significant capital inflows and reducing the available supply on exchanges, thereby driving up prices. Is Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin price prediction guaranteed? No, market predictions, especially in the volatile cryptocurrency space, are never guaranteed. They represent an expert’s informed opinion based on current data and trends, but actual market performance can vary. What factors could challenge this optimistic Bitcoin price prediction? Potential challenges include unexpected regulatory changes, macroeconomic downturns, increased market competition, or unforeseen technological issues that could impact investor confidence. How should investors react to such a bold forecast? Investors should view such forecasts as a perspective to consider, not a definitive outcome. It’s advisable to conduct personal research, understand the risks, and align any investment decisions with individual financial goals and risk tolerance.

In 2028, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $15.81 to a minimum of $13.00. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $48.15 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture, which ensures network security—and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on the Acala Network, which enhances functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility, contributing to its substantial market capitalization. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.11 Market Cap $6.79B Trading Volume $274.48M Circulating Supply 1.62B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $3.17 24-hour Low $3.01 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 4.80% 50-Day SMA $ 4.04 14-Day RSI 50.02 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 71(Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $ 4.13 Polkadot price analysis: DOT faces pressure as price holds between $3.01 support and $3.19 resistance DOT remains stuck between $3.01 and $3.19, showing market indecision as traders await a clear breakout. Repeated rejections at $3.19 highlight intense selling pressure and limited upside momentum. The $3.01 support level is holding but remains vulnerable to a break, which could trigger further downside movement. October 29, 2025 – Polkadot (DOT) is trading at $3.11, showing a 2.08% decline in the past 24 hours. The token’s performance reflects continued volatility in the crypto market, with both retail and institutional investors closely monitoring key technical levels. Over the last trading session, DOT fluctuated between a low of $3.01 and a high of $3.19, indicating a narrow yet active trading range. Sellers appear dominant near the upper resistance zone, while buyers attempt to defend the lower boundary to prevent further losses. Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT bears hold control amid a narrow range The daily chart indicates a persistent downtrend, with DOT trading below key short-term moving averages. The $3.19 resistance has repeatedly capped upward movements, confirming intense supply pressure at that level. Meanwhile, the $3.01 support level acts as a critical base, preventing a steeper decline. A break beneath this level could accelerate bearish momentum toward lower targets, while any recovery above $3.19 might indicate a shift in trend strength. Momentum oscillators show subdued buying power, suggesting that bears remain in control for now. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Price action shows an early attempt at recovery during the latter part of the trading day, but overall sentiment remains defensive. Sustaining above the $3.10 region could provide short-term relief and stabilize the pair, while maintaining this level would be crucial for attracting new buyers. If bulls manage to push DOT above $3.19, a short-term rally could follow toward $3.25. Conversely, failure to hold the current range could lead to extended sideways movement between $3.00 and $3.10 as the market awaits stronger volume confirmation. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT consolidation persists below key resistance On the 4-hour chart, DOT shows minor recovery attempts from its session low but remains confined within a descending channel. Buyers are actively defending the $3.01 support, yet the price continues to face repeated rejection near $3.15, indicating persistent selling pressure at higher levels. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Short-term momentum indicators suggest a period of consolidation rather than an immediate reversal. A breakout above $3.19 could shift the near-term trend toward bullish territory, while continued rejection under that threshold would reinforce bearish control. Traders are now focusing on this $3.01–$3.19 range as the defining zone for DOT’s next directional move, awaiting a decisive close to establish clear market momentum.

Polkadot’s short-term outlook remains neutral to bearish as it trades between $3.01 and $3.19, showing indecision among traders. A breakout from this tight range could determine DOT’s next significant move. If buyers push above $3.19, DOT may rally toward $3.25–$3.30, signaling renewed strength. However, continued rejection below this level would likely extend the sideways trend. A drop below $3.01 could trigger further losses, potentially reaching $2.95–$2.90, which would increase selling pressure. For now, traders are watching these key levels closely to gauge DOT’s next direction. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot remains a strong blockchain project thanks to its interoperability and parachain technology, which continue to attract developers and long-term supporters. Its fundamentals are solid, but short-term momentum is limited as DOT trades between $3.01 and $3.19, reflecting market indecision. For long-term investors, this range could present an opportunity for accumulation, while short-term traders should remain cautious until a clear breakout occurs. Overall, Polkadot’s long-term potential remains intact; however, its near-term price movement will depend on broader market trends. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot (DOT) is down today as selling pressure persists and market momentum weakens. The token has repeatedly failed to break above the $3.19 resistance level, leading to a 2.08% drop to around $3.11. Technical indicators suggest limited buying strength, while broader crypto market volatility, driven by Bitcoin’s consolidation, further adds to the bearish tone. Low trading volume and a lack of major ecosystem updates have also dampened investor interest. For now, DOT remains range-bound between $3.01 and $3.19; a break below support could send it toward $2.95, while a move above resistance might spark a short-term rally toward $3.30. Recent news on Polkadot Grayscale has updated its S-1 registration filings with the SEC for two proposed cryptocurrency ETFs—one for Cardano (ADA) to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GADA and another for Polkadot (DOT) to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker DOT. Both funds would hold the underlying assets directly, track CoinDesk pricing indices, and use Coinbase Custody, mirroring the firm’s existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The filings update earlier 19b-4 applications from February 2025, though SEC approval remains pending, with the Cardano ETF decision now delayed to October 26. 🚨Polkadot ETF Update: Grayscale filed S-1 registration statements with the SEC to launch @Polkadot (DOT).

Analysts have been talking about its upcoming halving event , and the excitement has been building across social media and trading groups. TAO has done well and has proven that network-based tokens can attract serious attention. Yet with a market value that already sits above $4 billion, it might find it challenging to spike much higher in this current fragmented market cycle. While the big players like TAO dominate crypto media these days, the real growth often happens at the ground level, in new projects that are rewriting the rules before the mainstream even notices. If TAO is yesterday’s headline, BlockchainFX is tomorrow’s front page. BlockchainFX: The New Power Player in Global Trading BlockchainFX has arrived to bring all forms of trading into one powerful app. It calls itself the world’s first crypto-native trading super app. The platform combines crypto, forex, stocks, exchange-traded funds, commodities, and more in one smooth and simple platform. Most traders today have to juggle between apps: one for crypto, another for stocks, and maybe a totally different one for forex. BlockchainFX changes that experience completely. It is already live and running, with millions raised in its presale. Early buyers are not just holding tokens; they are already earning rewards. It offers more than 500 tradable assets in one place. The easiest way to imagine BlockchainFX is to think of Binance, Robinhood, and MetaTrader coming together into one single platform. Trading on BlockchainFX feels like a glimpse into the future. You can move from Bitcoin to gold, then into Tesla stocks or even an exchange-traded fund without having to switch platforms. It all happens in seconds inside one secure and fast environment. Imagine selling Bitcoin after a rally, moving those profits into gold for safety, then using them to buy Tesla stock or even a trending meme coin like PEPE. All of this happens within one session, without fees for moving assets or waiting on bridges. This unified design finally connects the $84 billion-a-day crypto market with the $7.5 trillion-a-day forex market. It gives Web3 traders a gateway into traditional finance and allows traditional traders to access crypto with ease. Beyond Trading BlockchainFX is much more than a trading app. It is a complete ecosystem built to give value back to its users. Holders earn passive income in both BFX and USDT every single day from the trading activity on the platform. Up to 70% of all trading fees collected by the platform are shared directly with the community in BFX and USDT. This means that every trade helps generate daily rewards for all holders. It creates a living and breathing circular economy where traders and holders benefit together. The platform also offers AI Copy Trading, which allows users to automatically mirror the strategies of professional traders. Even beginners can benefit from expert-level trades without needing deep technical knowledge. Then there is the BFX Visa Card. It turns those digital earnings into real spending power. You can use it in stores, withdraw from ATMs, and spend globally with no restrictions. Presale Power BlockchainFX presale is live right now, and it is already generating excitement with more than $10 million raised.

Early access gives buyers the lowest token price and the highest lifetime rewards. There is also a $100 Biggest Buy-In Competition for the top supporters. It is another way BlockchainFX is showing appreciation for its early community. The Halloween Bonus Bonanza Right now, the Special Halloween Offer, known as CANDY40, is live. It runs from October 24th to November 3rd and gives buyers a 40% bonus on every purchase. This offer is already active and available to everyone who joins the presale today.

Users just need to do a few easy tasks to boost their chances. The giveaway will start after the presale sells out. However, joining early gives you a better chance to win. How to Join the Presale and Start Earning Instantly Many investors remember how Binance Coin, or BNB, fueled Binance’s rise to global dominance. $BFX has that same kind of potential, but with a wider mission and a broader reach.

A New Institutional Gateway to Ethereum The “Ethereum for Institutions” site, launched by EF’s Enterprise Acceleration team, provides a roadmap for organizations adopting Ethereum. The platform offers resources and technical pathways to support institutional adoption. “Ethereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world’s financial value is coming onchain,” Ethereum Foundation stated. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build.” The site highlights Ethereum’s decade-long reliability — with over 1.1 million validators and continuous uptime — while spotlighting leading companies such as BlackRock, Visa, eToro, and Coinbase, which already manage billions in assets and trillions in transaction volume using Ethereum-based solutions. ZK Privacy and Compliance: The Next Institutional Frontier Recognizing privacy as a key institutional requirement, the Ethereum Foundation emphasizes the use of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enable compliant, audit-ready applications on public rails. Projects like Chainlink, RAILGUN, Aztec Network, and Zama are featured for pioneering privacy-preserving smart contracts that allow secure counterparties and business logic without sacrificing transparency or composability. These advancements represent a leap for institutions balancing compliance mandates with the need for secure, programmable finance. “Privacy solutions are no longer theoretical — they’re live and scaling in production,” Ethereum Foundation notes. Tokenization, Stablecoins, and Real-World Assets Ethereum said it dominates the real-world asset (RWA) and stablecoin sectors, hosting over 75% of all tokenized RWAs and 60% of global stablecoin supply. Institutions can now explore market infrastructure at institutions.ethereum.org/rwas-stablecoins, where tokenized treasuries and onchain credit platforms are reshaping capital markets. From BlackRock and Securitize to Ondo Finance, Centrifuge, and Maple, major financial firms are deploying tokenized instruments that offer 24/7 settlement, transparency, and composability. Stablecoins issued by Tether, Circle, PayPal, and Ethena Labs are also highlighted for their role in accelerating global onchain payments. Restaking, Layer-2s, and the Composable Financial Stack The foundation said Ethereum’s Layer-2 networks — including Linea, Starknet, Base, Scroll, and Unichain — now secure over $50 billion in value, offering the throughput and cost efficiency required for global-scale applications. At the same time, staking and restaking protocols like Ether.fi, EigenLayer, Lido, RocketPool, and Symbiotic are enabling institutions to participate in Ethereum’s security model while earning yield on staked ETH. With 67% of DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) and the deepest liquidity across any blockchain, Ethereum continues to lead as the settlement layer for institutional-grade decentralized finance. The new Ethereum for Institutions portal is a living resource, continuously updated to feature ecosystem builders, regulatory innovations, and enterprise-grade integrations. Institutions can engage directly with the Ethereum Foundation’s Enterprise Acceleration team via institutions.ethereum.org — joining a growing global movement to bring finance fully onchain.

This significant event, flagged by the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, has sent ripples through the digital asset community, prompting questions about security and asset control. When such a large sum of Tron-based USDT frozen , it’s not just a technical hiccup; it signals a critical moment for understanding how digital assets are managed and secured on the blockchain. For many, the idea of their digital money becoming inaccessible is a major concern, highlighting the unique challenges and centralized aspects within some decentralized systems. What Does it Mean When Tron-based USDT is Frozen? To truly grasp the gravity of this situation, it’s essential to understand what ‘frozen’ actually means in the context of cryptocurrencies like USDT. Unlike traditional bank accounts, where funds can be seized by authorities, freezing USDT on a blockchain like Tron involves a specific mechanism. Tether, the issuer of USDT, has the technical capability to blacklist addresses. When an address is blacklisted, any USDT held within it becomes unusable and cannot be transferred. This action is usually taken in response to law enforcement requests, regulatory compliance, or to mitigate illicit activities such as hacks or scams. Therefore, the $11.21 million in Tron-based USDT frozen is effectively locked down, preventing further movement. This capability, while intended for security and compliance, also underscores a degree of centralization within stablecoin operations. While the underlying Tron blockchain is decentralized, the issuance and control of USDT itself retain centralized elements, allowing for such interventions. The Impact of Frozen Tron-based USDT on Users and the Ecosystem An event where a substantial amount of Tron-based USDT frozen carries several implications, affecting not only the direct holders of those funds but also the broader Tron and stablecoin ecosystem. For the individuals or entities whose funds were frozen, the immediate impact is a complete loss of access to their assets. This situation can lead to significant financial distress and legal battles, especially if the funds were legitimate. Moreover, it can erode trust in stablecoins and the platforms that host them. Users might start questioning the true ‘decentralization’ of their assets and the extent of control issuers like Tether possess. Loss of Trust: A major freeze can make users wary of holding large amounts of stablecoins, especially if the reasons for the freeze are not immediately transparent. Regulatory Scrutiny: Such incidents often attract increased attention from regulators, potentially leading to stricter rules for stablecoin issuers and blockchain platforms. Market Volatility: While not directly causing market crashes, these events can contribute to a climate of uncertainty, influencing investor sentiment. How Can You Protect Your Digital Assets? In light of this incident involving Tron-based USDT frozen , it’s crucial for every crypto holder to prioritize security and understand the risks involved. Protecting your digital assets goes beyond just choosing a strong password; it involves strategic decisions about where and how you store your funds. Consider these actionable insights to enhance your security: Diversify Your Holdings: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spreading your assets across different cryptocurrencies and stablecoins can mitigate risk. Understand Stablecoin Mechanisms: Research how your chosen stablecoin operates. Know if the issuer has freezing capabilities and under what circumstances they might be exercised. Utilize Hardware Wallets: For significant amounts, cold storage solutions like hardware wallets offer superior security against online threats and centralized freezes. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments in the crypto space. Alerts from services like Whale Alert can provide early warnings about potential issues. Practice Prudent Transaction Habits: Always double-check recipient addresses before sending funds. Be wary of unsolicited messages or phishing attempts. What Happens Next for the Frozen Tron-based USDT? The fate of the $11.21 million in Tron-based USDT frozen remains to be seen. Typically, such funds remain inaccessible until a resolution is reached. This could involve a legal process, where authorities determine the rightful owner or the illicit nature of the funds. In some cases, if the funds were part of a hack or scam, efforts might be made to recover and return them to the victims, though this process can be lengthy and complex. Alternatively, if the funds are deemed to be involved in illegal activities, they may be permanently confiscated. The transparency of the blockchain, however, ensures that the frozen funds are publicly visible, even if they are untransferable. This ongoing situation serves as a powerful reminder of the evolving landscape of digital finance. While cryptocurrencies offer unprecedented freedom and innovation, they also come with unique risks and challenges that require constant vigilance from users and continuous development from platforms. Concluding Thoughts on the Frozen Funds The incident of $11.21 million in Tron-based USDT frozen is more than just a headline; it’s a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in the digital asset world. It highlights the delicate balance between decentralization and centralized control, particularly within stablecoin ecosystems. For users, it underscores the paramount importance of security, due diligence, and staying informed. As the crypto space matures, understanding these nuances becomes critical for safe participation. While the promise of a decentralized future remains strong, events like this serve as valuable lessons, pushing the industry towards greater transparency, robustness, and user protection. Always be vigilant and proactive in managing your digital wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does it mean when Tron-based USDT is ‘frozen’? When Tron-based USDT is ‘frozen,’ it means that the issuer, Tether, has blacklisted the specific blockchain address holding those funds. This action renders the USDT at that address untransferable and unusable, effectively locking them down. It’s usually done for regulatory compliance or to combat illicit activities. Q2: Why was this specific $11.21 million in Tron-based USDT frozen? While the exact reason for this specific freeze isn’t always immediately public, such actions are typically initiated by Tether in response to requests from law enforcement agencies, court orders, or internal investigations into suspicious activities like hacks, scams, or money laundering. Q3: Can frozen Tron-based USDT ever be unfrozen or recovered? Potentially, yes. If the freeze was a mistake, or if a legal process determines the funds are legitimate and should be released, Tether might unblacklist the address. However, if the funds are definitively linked to illicit activities, they may remain permanently frozen or confiscated by authorities. Q4: Does this incident affect all USDT, or just Tron-based USDT? This particular incident specifically involves USDT issued on the Tron blockchain. While Tether has the ability to freeze USDT on other blockchains where it operates, this specific freeze event was identified on the Tron network. The general mechanism for freezing can apply across different chains, but each incident is specific to the funds and blockchain involved. Q5: How can I protect my USDT from being frozen? To protect your USDT, ensure you acquire it from legitimate sources, avoid engaging in any illicit activities, and use secure, self-custody wallets (like hardware wallets) for significant amounts. Staying informed about regulatory changes and stablecoin policies is also crucial. While individual users cannot prevent a freeze initiated by Tether, understanding the risks helps.

This development, initially reported by Unfolded, marks a significant moment for the crypto media landscape and raises questions about the future of specialized journalism in this volatile sector. For many, Blockworks has been a go-to source for insightful coverage, making the news of its core content division ceasing operations quite a surprise. What Does the Blockworks News Business Shutdown Mean for Crypto Media? Blockworks has long been recognized as a key player in providing dedicated coverage of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. Its news business has delivered daily updates, in-depth analyses, and interviews with leading figures, catering to a niche audience hungry for specialized information. The reported closure suggests a potential re-evaluation of its operational strategy, focusing on other areas of its business. This decision could reflect broader challenges facing digital media outlets, particularly those operating within rapidly evolving and often unpredictable markets like crypto. Generating sustainable revenue through traditional news models can be tough, even for established brands. It prompts us to consider the evolving models for crypto content and how platforms will adapt. Navigating the Evolving Crypto News Landscape The crypto news industry is dynamic, constantly adapting to market cycles and technological advancements. This reported shift by Blockworks could signal a consolidation or a move towards more diversified revenue streams beyond conventional news reporting. Many crypto media companies are exploring different approaches to engage their audience and ensure financial viability. Content Diversification: Many outlets are moving beyond just news to offer research, data analytics, and educational resources. Event Focus: Conferences and networking events often provide a more stable income stream and direct engagement opportunities. Subscription Models: Premium content, newsletters, and exclusive insights are becoming increasingly popular. Podcast and Video Growth: Visual and audio formats continue to gain traction, offering new avenues for content delivery and monetization. The challenges for a dedicated Blockworks news business might include intense competition, the need for constant innovation, and the difficulty of monetizing free content effectively. The Future of Blockworks Beyond News While the news business is reportedly closing, it is crucial to remember that Blockworks is a multifaceted organization. They are well-known for their highly regarded industry events, such as Blockworks Digital Asset Summit (DAS), and their extensive research and data offerings. These segments of their business are distinct from their daily news operations and have built a strong reputation within the institutional crypto space. Therefore, this move does not necessarily mean the end of Blockworks entirely, but rather a strategic pivot. The company may be choosing to double down on its most profitable and impactful ventures, leveraging its expertise in areas like institutional insights and community building through events. This strategic refocus could allow them to allocate resources more efficiently and solidify their position in specific niches. Is This a Trend for Crypto News Outlets? The reported closure of the Blockworks news business could be an isolated incident, or it could be indicative of a wider trend. The past few years have seen significant fluctuations in the crypto market, impacting advertising revenues and investor interest in many crypto-focused ventures. Media outlets are not immune to these economic pressures. Other crypto news sites might observe this development closely, evaluating their own business models and sustainability. The demand for high-quality, reliable crypto journalism remains strong, but the methods of delivering and monetizing that content are continually evolving. It highlights the importance of adaptability for any media entity in the fast-paced digital asset space. In conclusion, the reported shutdown of the Blockworks news business is a notable event for the cryptocurrency media landscape. While it signifies a shift for a prominent player, it also underscores the dynamic nature of content creation and consumption in the digital asset industry. This development will undoubtedly lead to discussions about sustainable models for crypto journalism and how outlets can best serve their audiences in the years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is Blockworks shutting down completely? A1: No, reports indicate that only the Blockworks news business is shutting down. The company is expected to continue its other operations, such as events and research. Q2: Why is Blockworks shutting down its news business? A2: While an official statement detailing the reasons isn’t available, such decisions often stem from strategic refocusing, challenges in monetizing news content, or a desire to concentrate on more profitable business segments like events and institutional research. Q3: What does this mean for crypto journalism? A3: This move could signify a shift towards more specialized content, event-driven revenue models, or subscription-based services in crypto journalism. It highlights the ongoing evolution and challenges within the sector. Q4: Where can I find reliable crypto news now? A4: Many other reputable crypto news outlets continue to operate, offering a variety of content. Readers should seek out sources known for their journalistic integrity and in-depth reporting.

As much as Dogecoin (DOGE) sparked so many imaginations with its meme-fueled boom, a new player has arrived: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Sitting at $0.035 in Phase 6 presale, MUTM has already gained more than $18.15 million and is closing in on a 20% price hike to $0.04 in the subsequent phase. With more than 17,550 investors already on board, the project is gaining massive momentum. As the crypto world keeps evolving, entities like Mutuum Finance are setting the pace when it comes to utility and investor interaction. For future portfolio diversification with upcoming crypto coins that are high-potential, MUTM is an option worth considering. This makes it one of the best crypto to buy for early-stage exposure. Dogecoin (DOGE) Gains Momentum in Anticipation of Possible Breakout Dogecoin (DOGE) is exhibiting fresh vigor, remaining in position near the $0.19 support and quietly building up for its next big move. Technicals indicate that if DOGE can breakout of its current resistance, a move up to $0.25 and beyond is very much in the realm of possibilities. The chart is looking good, in keeping with what experts have termed a bullish beauty, and holding out for longer may just be reward for shortstop traders anticipating the breakout. As DOGE holds its ground, investors are also exploring new projects with excellent growth potential. One such new crypto coin is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rapidly growing DeFi token that’s making waves with its new double-lending mechanism and excellent presale performance, presenting an alternative way to tap into upside in the changing crypto landscape. MUTM is clearly positioned as the best crypto to buy now for those seeking early-stage DeFi opportunities. Project Growth and Key Milestones Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly ascending the list of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of 2025 in the wake of a record-breaking presale. The project has managed to break through six rounds of presale, having raised $18.15 million from over 17,500 investors, with Phase 6 already more than three-quarters sold out. At the rate of $0.035, the token is an interesting entry point ahead of the price hike in the next phase by 14.28%, and MUTM is an interesting early-phase growth opportunity for shrewd investors. Holders can also earn their passive income by investing assets such as USDT into Mutuum liquidity pools to receive APY-based rewards that change based on market demand. For instance, with an APY of 10%, an investment worth $70,000 would yield approximately $7,000 annually, and investors can easily build up their crypto fortune via compounding and automatic accrual over the long run. This practical utility makes MUTM a new crypto coin to consider for both short-term and long-term portfolio strategy. The Sudden Surge of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is an innovative DeFi crypto project designed to revolutionize cryptocurrency borrowing and lending into an open, clear, and reward-gathering procedure. It is founded on two complementary models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). With the P2C model, investors invest money such as ETH or USDT in collective pools of liquidity and earn passive returns in terms of variable APY rates that vary automatically with the utilization of the pool. The P2P model offers lenders and borrowers themselves a say in the terms of a loan and interest rate, and reaches beyond traditional mainstream conventional markets to more assets such as DOGE, SHIB, and other yet-to-be-launched tokens. Depositors are issued mtTokens as a receipt for their deposit, irrevocably tied to the value of the underlying asset. mtTokens automatically earn interest and may also be staked to earn additional MUTM rewards. Some of the platform fee is utilized to purchase MUTM tokens in the public market, which is paid out to the stakers, hedging for long-term token value loss and ecologic sustainability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has reached $18.15 million with more than 17,550 supporters, and Phase 6 well over 75% sold out at $0.035. Its P2C and P2P dual-lending models, mtTokens, and buyback feature offer passive income, simple borrowing, and durable demand, making MUTM one of the top new crypto coins to track in 2025 with short-term prospects and long-term DeFi growth potential. The project is undeniably the best crypto to buy now for investors looking to access new crypto coin opportunities with real utility.

The cryptocurrency market often delivers unexpected twists, and recently, investors witnessed a notable development. The Bitcoin price fall below the significant $112,000 threshold has certainly captured widespread attention. According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $111,989.67 on the Binance USDT market. This dip prompts many to wonder about the underlying causes and potential future implications for the broader crypto landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Fall When the world’s leading cryptocurrency experiences a significant drop, it sends ripples across the entire digital asset ecosystem. This particular Bitcoin price fall signifies a moment of heightened volatility, a characteristic trait of the crypto market. While such movements can be unsettling, they are not entirely uncommon. Market dynamics are complex, influenced by a multitude of factors ranging from macroeconomic indicators to specific market events. For new investors, understanding these fluctuations is crucial, as they form an integral part of navigating the cryptocurrency space effectively. What Drives a Sudden Bitcoin Price Fall? Several elements can contribute to a rapid depreciation in Bitcoin’s value. Pinpointing a single cause is often challenging, as it’s typically a confluence of various pressures. Here are some common drivers: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic instability, interest rate hikes, or inflationary concerns can push investors towards safer assets, away from riskier ventures like crypto. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors of stricter cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can trigger sell-offs. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin (known as ‘whales’) selling significant amounts can create downward pressure. Market Sentiment: Negative news cycles, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), or a general lack of confidence can lead to panic selling. Technical Indicators: Breaking key support levels, like the $112,000 mark in this instance, can trigger automated selling orders. These factors collectively shape the market’s direction, and a sudden Bitcoin price fall often reflects a shift in one or more of these areas. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors For both seasoned traders and newcomers, a significant dip like this presents both challenges and potential opportunities. How investors react often defines their long-term success in the crypto market. Consider these actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the fundamentals of any asset before investing. Avoid Panic Selling: Emotional decisions during a market downturn often lead to losses. Evaluate your investment thesis calmly. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider buying small, regular amounts over time, regardless of price. This strategy can mitigate risk during volatile periods. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, these can help limit potential losses if the price continues to fall. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one asset. Spreading investments across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can reduce overall risk. Staying informed and maintaining a disciplined approach are paramount when facing a volatile market and a notable Bitcoin price fall . The Broader Impact of a Bitcoin Price Fall Bitcoin’s status as the market leader means its movements significantly influence other cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins. A substantial Bitcoin price fall can lead to a ripple effect, causing many altcoins to follow suit. This interconnectedness highlights the importance of monitoring BTC’s performance as a bellwether for the entire crypto market. While short-term dips can be concerning, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated resilience, recovering from numerous significant corrections over its lifetime. Investors often view these periods as part of the natural market cycle, offering opportunities for long-term accumulation for those with a strong conviction in its future. Conclusion: Staying Resilient in Volatile Times The recent Bitcoin price fall below $112,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. While such events can test investor resolve, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making, risk management, and a long-term perspective. The crypto journey is rarely a straight line, but with careful planning and continuous learning, market participants can navigate these fluctuations more confidently. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when Bitcoin falls below a certain price point? A1: When Bitcoin falls below a significant price point, it often indicates that a key support level has been broken. This can trigger further selling pressure and signal increased market volatility. It means that the market sentiment has shifted, at least temporarily, towards bearishness. Q2: Should I sell my Bitcoin when there’s a price fall? A2: The decision to sell during a Bitcoin price fall depends entirely on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Panic selling is often discouraged as it can lock in losses. Many long-term investors choose to hold (HODL) or even buy more during dips, a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging. Q3: How long do Bitcoin price falls typically last? A3: The duration of a Bitcoin price fall can vary significantly. Some dips are short-lived, lasting only hours or days, while others can extend for weeks or months, forming part of a broader bear market. Historical data shows Bitcoin has always recovered, but past performance is not indicative of future results. Q4: What is dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and how can it help during a Bitcoin price fall? A4: Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. During a Bitcoin price fall , DCA allows you to buy more Bitcoin when prices are low, effectively lowering your average purchase price over time and potentially yielding better returns when the market recovers. Q5: Is a Bitcoin price fall necessarily a bad thing? A5: Not necessarily. While a Bitcoin price fall can be unsettling, many investors view it as an opportunity. For those looking to enter the market or increase their holdings, a dip can present a chance to buy Bitcoin at a lower price. It’s a natural part of market cycles and can ‘cleanse’ the market of overleveraged positions.

One of these crucial metrics is the Bitcoin Short-Term Holders SOPR. Rising Bitcoin STH SOPR Signals Warning Amid fluctuating market action, Bitcoin Short-Term Holders’ Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is showing that these investors are approaching a crucial point. In a recent quick-take post on the CryptoQuant platform, Yonsei Dent, a market expert, outlined that the key metric is drawing close to the upper band. BTC STH-SOPR indicator shows the on-chain breakeven threshold for short-term holders. It is worth noting that when the value is more than 1.0, it indicates that these investors are generally making profits . On the other hand, when the metric drops below the 1.0 level, it suggests that the investors are realizing losses. Given that the Bitcoin short-term holder SOPR hints at the aggregated action of a large number of market players, the metric also has a strong statistical aspect. About 95% of all data points are typically captured by the ±2 standard deviation range. Therefore, a move above that range takes place less than 5% of the time, which makes this trend an uncommon event. Using a combination of the Bollinger Band setup and the short-term holder SOPR, Yonsei Dent highlighted that a steady move to +2σ usually signals resistance or profit-taking zones. Meanwhile, when it is approaching -2σ, it often suggests support or accumulation opportunities . However, the STH SOPR currently still has some room before reaching the +2σ upper band. While the metric moves closer to the upper band, Dent has underlined the importance of monitoring the indicator to confirm whether momentum has begun to turn or if short-term overheating is gradually appearing. BTC Has Not Yet Reached Its Top Despite the potential profit-taking from short-term holders, Joao Wedson, the founder of Alphractal, claims Bitcoin is yet to reach its top for this cycle due to past cycles’ trend. Unlike past cycles, few investors were observed buying the top out of euphoria during a similar period. In previous ATHs, Bitcoin would spike with pure enthusiasm and then plummet just as quickly, barely having time to breathe above new highs. As a result, thousands of investors were stuck at the top, where their profits turned into losses within days. However, recent trends show that this cycle could be charting a different course . After reclaiming the $100,000 landmark, BTC appears to have spent almost 1 year holding above this critical area. During the period, the flagship asset has been consolidating and steadily testing a range that would likely be a pure mania in past cycles. In a shocking twist, Wedson highlighted that the real euphoria has not yet kicked off. At this point, the expert is uncertain whether it will happen this cycle or the true top is still ahead , noting that euphoria came before consolidation in previous cycles. However, it appears that euphoria was preceded by consolidation, which changes everything this time.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Spent Output Profit Ratio|Bitcoin STH SOPR|Bollinger Band|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Joao Wedson|Yonsei Dent,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-29 16:00:37

Bold Forecast Calls For $100 Before 2030,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/massive-xrp-rally-ahead-bold-forecast-calls-for-100-before-2030/,"Based on reports, several asset managers have updated filings for spot XRP exchange-traded funds, naming tickers such as GXRP and XRPZ.

At the same time, Ripple’s move to acquire GTreasury for $1 billion has been highlighted by some analysts as a step closer to the $120 trillion corporate treasury market. Those developments, taken together, are keeping optimism alive among traders and community figures. Analyst Claims Accelerated Timeline According to social posts and comment threads, the analyst known as 24hrscrypto1 told followers “something big is going on” and reiterated a previously stated $100 target for XRP, while suggesting the date might come sooner than the earlier claim of by 2030. At current trading near $2.60, reaching $100 would represent roughly a 4,000% increase from today’s level. Other commentators have offered similar high-end ranges. Something big is going on.. All I can say is, we will see a $100 XRP way before 2030 😶 — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) October 17, 2025 For example, CryptoCharged COO Matthew Brienen has described a $100–$1,000 band as “highly possible” inside a five to 10 year span, citing use cases in cross-border payments. Wealth mentor Linda Jones has used a personal example to make a point: a $100 investment once bought about 400 XRP at $0.25 each, but that same $100 today would buy fewer than 35 XRP, a detail some see as evidence of growing scarcity. Institutional Accumulation And Supply Concerns Some observers argue that steady buying by banks and funds has been taking place behind the scenes during volatile stretches. If large holders continue to add positions and trading liquidity thins, the market could face a supply-demand imbalance that would push prices higher quickly. That is the basic line supporting ultra-ambitious forecasts. Yet whether institutions will hold XRP long term or use it actively in payments remains a crucial unknown that would determine how the story actually plays out. Market Moves And Community Momentum Social voices continue to matter. A prominent community commentator using the name UnknowDLT has described XRP as one of the major opportunities for this generation and the next, language that keeps retail interest high. XRP will end up being one of the greatest opportunities of not only our life time, but many to come. — {x} (@unknowDLT) October 28, 2025 At the same time, volatility is real: earlier this month XRP dropped to roughly $1.20 during a broader market pullback, showing how fast gains can be wiped out when conditions change.

As investors are now increasingly more interested in what comes after the bullish tenth month, these assets could be an ideal opportunity to capitalize on the lingering momentum. Accordingly, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s leading artificial intelligence ( AI ) model, ChatGPT , to identify two sub-$1 cryptocurrencies worth buying in November. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is currently changing hands at around $0.19, up 0.62% on the week, and ChatGPT noted the meme coin enjoys a strong brand recognition, a large community, and previous bull-cycle momentum. DOGE one-week price chart. Source: Finbold What’s more, the model mentioned that if the market rotates further into alt-coins next month, DOGE could be one of the assets better positioned for short-term growth. However, the chatbot argues, Dogecoin’s immediate trajectory will depend on defending support and sustaining buy volume, so it will mostly appeal to high-risk, high-reward investors. Hedera (HBAR) The second pick, Hedera ( HBAR ), was chosen because it supports enterprise-grade use cases via its Hashgraph consensus. Moreover, the price under $1, combined with October’s upward trajectory, suggests further upside, especially if investor attention shifts. Indeed, HBAR is trading at $0.20, almost the same price as DOGE, although its weekly performance has been stronger, pushing the crypto up more than 18%. HBAR seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Furthermore, Hedera is now in the spotlight since Sanary’s HBAR spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) debuted on NASDAQ with $8 million in first-day volume on Tuesday, October 28. Ultimately, HBAR’s short-term success depends on whether ETF-driven institutional inflows can continue to boost the technical picture. ChatGPT picked Dogecoin for its strong community support and brand recognition and chose Hedera due to enterprise adoption and ETF-driven institutional interest. In other words, both tokens offer potential growth for high-risk, high-reward investors navigating the post-“Uptober” market, albeit with slightly different levels of speculation attached to them.

Kiziloz was previously accused of funneling millions of dollars of presale funds through Middle Eastern OTC brokers. ZachXBT argued that Anthony Turner was only acting as the public face of the crypto project. He also claims that BlockDAG’s Value Era narrative is just a cover-up for the firm’s underlying problems. ZachXBT claims BlockDAG’s Value Era narrative is a cover-up BlockDAG Network CEO Antony Turner announced on Wednesday that BDAG’s Value Era will begin on October 30. Turner confirmed that BlockDAG has already conquered the Power Era and dominated the Dominance Era, and it’s now set for the Value Era. One BDAG user called the project a scam, with ZachXBT replying and saying that on-chain shows BlockDAG received amounts below the nine-digit range. The user also revealed that the crypto firm has been trying to get people to buy for a while now, while always saying last chance to buy before listing. 🚨 The VALUE ERA Starts Tomorrow 🚨 A Message From Our CEO, Antony Turner 🚀 ‼️ A New Era is Upon Us ‼️ We’ve conquered the Power Era. We’ve dominated the Dominance Era. Now we enter the most important phase yet: 💎 The VALUE ERA 💎 Tomorrow, BlockDAG makes 3 MAJOR… pic.twitter.com/shJCGERfQZ — BlockDAG Network (@blockdagnetwork) October 28, 2025 ZachXBT has just confirmed that BlockDAG Network has blocked him on X and hid his reply naming the actual founder. He also noted that the company primarily runs ads on its main X account, claiming it targets unsophisticated people on social media. “Stop the lies the griter Gurhan Kiziloz is the real co-founder secretly behind Blockdag who pays people like Antony Turner to be the face of it while transferring away millions in presale funds from unsophisticated retail investors via Middle Eastern OTC brokers.” – ZackXBT . As BDAG’s Value Era begins tomorrow, the firm has revealed that all bonuses will cease, and there will be no more multipliers. BlockDAG also plans to reveal its final tokenomics, which it said are built for long-term strength. It will also announce the end date of its presale on Thursday. BlockDAG’s presale raises over $430 million Cryptopolitan previously reported that BlockDAG has already raised over $433 million, which has drawn attention for its mining-based ecosystem and mobile mining app. The blockchain combines Proof-of-Work and Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies to run its network, offering scalability. PoW and DAG systems also enable high-speed transactions without compromising the security of traditional PoW networks. BlockDAG’s live Awakening Testnet already processes more than 15,000 transactions per second (TPS). The testnet is also compatible with Ethereum’s Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a crucial feature for cross-chain scalability. BDAG confirmed that more than 4,500 developers are actively building dApps and tools on its network. Despite having impressive fundraising initiatives, the firm also faces a significant supply chain challenge and slower retail onboarding. At the time of publication, BDAB had drawn more than 312,000 holders. BlockDAG’s presale has also drawn market attention, selling over 27 billion BDAG coins across 31 batches. The firm stated that users can obtain early access using the TGE code at a rate of $0.0015 per coin.

A significant debate is unfolding regarding the inclusion of crypto retirement funds in personal savings. Recent warnings from prominent Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders highlight potential dangers, suggesting that a move by former President Trump to increase cryptocurrency allocation in retirement portfolios could lead to substantial financial losses for everyday citizens. Why Are Senators Warning About Crypto Retirement Funds? According to reports from Bloomberg, these senators have voiced strong concerns over a potential executive order. They argue that such a directive could expose hard-earned savings to exceptionally volatile financial products. The core of their argument is that while these assets are often packaged as attractive “alternative investments,” they frequently lack the necessary transparency and may feature exaggerated claims of returns. The primary worry revolves around the inherent nature of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional assets, their values can fluctuate wildly, sometimes by significant percentages within short periods. This volatility presents a considerable risk, especially for long-term investments like retirement savings, where stability and predictable growth are paramount. What Are the Perilous Risks for Your Retirement Savings? When considering crypto retirement funds , it’s crucial to understand the unique challenges they pose. The senators’ warnings underscore several key issues that could impact millions of Americans: Extreme Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously unpredictable. A significant portion of your retirement nest egg could diminish rapidly due to sudden market downturns, potentially leaving you with far less than anticipated. Lack of Regulation: Compared to traditional financial markets, the crypto space is less regulated. This can lead to increased exposure to scams, market manipulation, and inadequate investor protections. Transparency Concerns: While blockchain technology is often touted for transparency, the underlying operations and valuations of many crypto assets can be opaque, making it difficult for average investors to assess true risk. Exaggerated Returns: The allure of quick, high returns in crypto can be tempting. However, these often come with equally high risks, and past performance is never a guarantee of future results, especially in such a nascent market. These factors combined create a precarious situation for anyone considering substantial allocation to crypto retirement funds . The goal of retirement planning is typically capital preservation and steady growth, which directly conflicts with the speculative nature of many cryptocurrencies. How Can You Protect Your Future with Crypto Retirement Funds? While the allure of cryptocurrencies is undeniable, especially for those seeking alternative investment avenues, a cautious approach is vital. For individuals managing their retirement portfolios, understanding the potential downsides is just as important as recognizing potential upsides. Here are some actionable insights: Educate Yourself Thoroughly: Before making any investment decisions, particularly concerning volatile assets, dedicate time to understanding how cryptocurrencies work, their market dynamics, and associated risks. Consult Financial Advisors: Seek advice from qualified financial professionals who can offer personalized guidance based on your risk tolerance, financial goals, and retirement timeline. They can help you evaluate if and how crypto retirement funds might fit into a diversified portfolio. Prioritize Diversification: If you choose to invest in crypto, ensure it represents only a small, manageable portion of your overall portfolio. Over-allocating to any single asset class, especially a volatile one, can expose your savings to undue risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and market trends in the cryptocurrency space. The landscape is constantly evolving, and staying informed can help you make timely and informed decisions. The warnings from Senators Warren and Sanders serve as a critical reminder: while innovation in finance is exciting, safeguarding the financial well-being of retirees must remain a top priority. Balancing potential growth with prudent risk management is key to securing a stable retirement. The debate surrounding crypto retirement funds is far from over. The concerns raised by Senators Warren and Sanders highlight the urgent need for careful consideration and robust investor protection. While the cryptocurrency market offers intriguing possibilities, its inherent volatility and regulatory ambiguities present significant challenges for long-term retirement planning. For millions of Americans, protecting hard-earned savings from undue risk is paramount, making informed decisions and a balanced approach essential when navigating the complex world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are the main concerns about including crypto in retirement funds? A1: The primary concerns include extreme market volatility, lack of robust regulation, transparency issues with certain assets, and the potential for exaggerated returns that don’t align with long-term, stable retirement growth. Q2: Who are the senators warning about this plan? A2: Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders have publicly warned about the risks of increasing cryptocurrency allocation in retirement portfolios. Q3: Is it completely unsafe to invest in crypto for retirement? A3: It’s not necessarily “unsafe” if approached with extreme caution and as a very small, diversified portion of a portfolio. However, the high volatility and speculative nature make it a high-risk investment for traditional retirement planning goals, which typically prioritize stability and capital preservation. Q4: What should I do if I’m considering crypto for my retirement? A4: Educate yourself thoroughly, consult with a qualified financial advisor, prioritize broad diversification, and ensure any crypto investment is a small percentage of your overall retirement savings to mitigate significant risk. Q5: How does this differ from traditional retirement investments? A5: Traditional retirement investments like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are generally more regulated, less volatile, and designed for long-term, steady growth with established legal protections, unlike the relatively newer and more speculative cryptocurrency market.

From telegrams to digital remittances, the company has always evolved with technology. Now, it is taking its boldest step yet — moving billions of dollars across borders using blockchain. After years of experimenting with multiple blockchain solutions, including Ripple’s XRP, Western Union has made a decisive move. The payments giant will now use Solana to power its next generation of settlement infrastructure. A New Era for Cross-Border Payments Western Union’s blockchain journey began nearly a decade ago. In 2015, the company ran pilot programs with Ripple Labs , testing the use of XRP for faster international payments. Those trials demonstrated potential efficiency gains but did not progress to a full rollout. Today, Western Union is taking blockchain adoption to the next level. The company is launching USDPT, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, on the Solana network. The token will be issued in partnership with Anchorage Digital Bank, a federally regulated crypto custodian. The goal is clear — to create a faster, cheaper, and more secure alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. WESTERN UNION TESTED XRP FOR A DECADE – BUT WHY DID IT PICK SOLANA? Western Union spent years testing Ripple’s tech, even ran pilots with $XRP for cross-border payments going back to 2015.

He said the company examined all major blockchains before settling on Solana. “For 175 years, we’ve been connecting people with technology, and we have used that technology to move money,” McGranahan said. “This is the next evolution of moving digital assets — the ability to move money seamlessly, cost-effectively, rapidly, everywhere around the world.” McGranahan emphasized that choosing a blockchain partner for institutional use required careful analysis. “If you’re Western Union and you’re already moving $100 billion a year across borders, picking the partner that does exactly that — fast, efficient, stable, and secure — is really important,” he explained. “For an institutional use case like ours, the Solana blockchain was the right choice.” Speed, Cost, and Reliability Were Key Factors Solana’s high throughput and near-zero transaction costs proved decisive. The network can handle thousands of transactions per second without congestion. For Western Union, those attributes aligned perfectly with its global transaction volume. Beyond performance, Solana offers institutional-grade reliability and developer support. These technical advantages made it suitable for Western Union’s planned large-scale rollout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From XRP Tests to Solana Deployment Western Union’s earlier XRP pilots helped shape its understanding of blockchain-based remittances. Those experiments revealed both the promise and the limitations of early blockchain systems. Since then, regulatory clarity around stablecoins and improvements in blockchain scalability have transformed the landscape. Solana, now battle-tested and widely adopted, presented a ready-to-deploy option for global settlement. Industry Impact and the Path Ahead The announcement, highlighted by CryptosRus on X, has sparked strong reactions across the crypto community. Many see Western Union’s shift to Solana as a validation of the network’s growing dominance in real-world finance. This move also marks a turning point for blockchain adoption in legacy finance. Western Union’s integration of stablecoin settlement could inspire other payment companies to follow. McGranahan believes this evolution will redefine global remittances. “We think this will be our next revolution — not just in our history, but in how remittances happen all over the globe,” he said. Western Union’s decision shows that innovation never stops — not even for a 175-year-old company. By choosing Solana, it has positioned itself at the forefront of the blockchain-powered future of global payments.

Misplaced FOMO? According to Santiment, retail traders are increasingly vocal about buying the dip after Tuesday’s modest market pullback. The firm noted that such increased enthusiasm for dip-buying has historically led to further downside pressure rather than a quick rebound. In previous cycles, the most profitable entry points tended to appear when retail sentiment was low and very few expected a recovery. Santiment warned that traders often misjudge market bottoms, and optimism quickly turns to fear once prices continue to slide. True accumulation phases, it added, typically occur only after this change from FOMO to FUD; this is when the market sees stronger rallies. Adding to this cautious tone, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential indicator, which is known for accurately predicting Bitcoin’s recent price swings, has once again flashed a sell signal. Martinez highlighted the indicator’s strong track record over the past few months, which correctly called a 7% correction in July, a 13% drop in August, a 10% rebound in early September, a 15% rally later that month, and a 19% correction in early October. With the tool now signaling another potential sell, the analyst’s observation means that Bitcoin could be gearing up for another short-term downturn if the pattern holds true. Bitcoin’s Fragile Floor Crypto analyst Doctor Profit also delivered a bearish outlook for Bitcoin. In his latest post on X, he warned that while markets widely expect a 25-basis-point rate cut from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the real impact will come from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks. He argued that many misunderstand the current policy shift and added that ending Quantitative Tightening (QT) does not signal the beginning of Quantitative Easing (QE). Instead, liquidity remains tight, banks face funding shortages, and central banks are merely stabilizing a fragile system rather than injecting new money. Doctor Profit believes the Fed will not resume QE unless a major crisis forces it to print again. He pointed to deepening liquidity stress in the repo market and called it worse than the 2019 episode, with overnight funding collapsing and cash availability drying up. Against this backdrop, he remains firmly short on Bitcoin and stocks, expecting euphoria to fade and liquidity conditions to deteriorate further until the next systemic break triggers Fed intervention.

A staggering 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury has been reported, sparking conversations about market dynamics and the evolving landscape of digital finance. This massive injection of stablecoin liquidity often signals significant movements and shifts within the broader crypto ecosystem. What Exactly Does “USDC Minted” Signify? When we talk about USDC minted , it’s crucial to understand what this stablecoin represents. USDC, or USD Coin, is a digital stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This means for every USDC in circulation, there is a corresponding dollar held in reserves, ensuring its stability and reliability in the volatile crypto markets. The act of ‘minting’ USDC essentially means new tokens are being created and put into circulation. This process is managed by Circle, the primary issuer of USDC, in collaboration with regulated financial institutions. When a large amount like 250 million USDC is minted, it indicates that a significant sum of fiat currency has been deposited into the USDC Treasury. This newly created USDC can then be used for various purposes within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, for trading on exchanges, or as a secure bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Essentially, the minting of 250 million USDC minted tokens suggests a substantial increase in demand for this particular stablecoin. This demand can originate from various sources, including institutional investors looking to enter or exit positions, or large traders seeking to capitalize on market opportunities without the direct volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Why the Sudden Influx: Unpacking the Demand for USDC A minting event of this magnitude naturally prompts questions about its underlying causes. Why would someone, or a group of entities, suddenly require 250 million USDC minted and ready for use? Several factors could be at play, each offering a glimpse into the current state of the crypto market. Let’s explore some key possibilities: Increased Institutional Interest: Large financial institutions often use stablecoins as a gateway to the crypto market. A significant minting could signal new institutional capital flowing into the space, perhaps in anticipation of future investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Market Liquidity Needs: Traders and investors might be preparing for significant market moves, requiring stablecoins to quickly enter or exit positions. This could be for arbitrage opportunities, hedging strategies, or simply to hold value during periods of high volatility. DeFi Growth: The decentralized finance ecosystem continues to expand, and USDC is a cornerstone of many DeFi protocols. Increased minting could reflect growing participation in lending, borrowing, or yield farming activities. Exchange Deposits: A large amount of newly minted USDC might be destined for cryptocurrency exchanges, indicating an intention to purchase other digital assets, thereby increasing overall buying pressure. What Impact Does This Massive Minting Have on the Market? The creation of 250 million USDC minted tokens isn’t just a number; it carries potential implications for the broader crypto market. While stablecoins are designed to maintain a steady value, their supply dynamics can offer insights into market sentiment and future trends. Firstly, an increase in stablecoin supply, particularly one as large as 250 million USDC, is often seen as a bullish indicator. It suggests that ‘dry powder’ is accumulating, ready to be deployed into riskier assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. This influx of capital could potentially drive up prices as more funds become available for purchasing other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, some analysts might view it as a sign of caution. Investors could be converting other assets into stablecoins to weather potential market downturns or to simply hold cash on the sidelines. However, given the context of a new mint, the former interpretation often holds more weight — new capital entering the system rather than existing capital exiting. The immediate effect might not be dramatic, but over time, if this minted USDC is indeed used to buy other cryptocurrencies, we could see a positive impact on market capitalization and trading volumes. It reinforces the role of stablecoins as essential conduits for capital movement within the digital asset space. Navigating the Waves: What Should Investors Consider? For those tracking the market, observing events like 250 million USDC minted is a critical part of understanding underlying flows. It’s an insight into the financial mechanics of the crypto world. Investors should consider how such significant stablecoin movements might influence their own strategies. Monitor Market Sentiment: While minting can be bullish, always combine this signal with other technical and fundamental analysis. Look for follow-through in asset prices. Diversify Your Portfolio: Stablecoins play a vital role in diversification, offering a safe haven during volatility. However, don’t let a large minting event sway you into impulsive decisions. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reports from services like Whale Alert and other on-chain analytics platforms to stay updated on major movements. Knowledge is power in this fast-paced environment. The recent report of 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury is a compelling development, underscoring the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. This substantial increase in stablecoin supply highlights robust demand, whether from institutions entering the space, traders seeking liquidity, or growing DeFi activity. While the immediate effects may vary, such events typically signal increased capital readiness and potential for future market movements. Understanding these underlying flows is key to navigating the exciting and ever-evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions about USDC Minting Q1: What does “USDC minted” specifically mean? A1: “USDC minted” means new USD Coin tokens have been created and added to circulation. This usually happens when individuals or institutions deposit fiat currency (like USD) into the USDC Treasury, and in return, an equivalent amount of USDC is issued to them. Q2: Is a large USDC minting event typically a bullish or bearish signal? A2: Generally, a large USDC minted event is considered a bullish signal. It indicates that new capital is entering the crypto ecosystem, often with the intention of purchasing other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which could drive up demand and prices. Q3: Who is responsible for minting USDC? A3: USDC is primarily issued by Circle, in partnership with Coinbase, through the Centre Consortium. They manage the reserves and the minting/redemption process to ensure that each USDC is backed 1:1 by US dollar reserves. Q4: How can I track USDC minting events? A4: You can track USDC minting events through various blockchain analytics platforms and services like Whale Alert, which monitors large transactions and reports on significant stablecoin movements. Q5: Does 250 million USDC minted affect the price of USDC? A5: No, the minting of 250 million USDC minted tokens does not directly affect the price of USDC itself. USDC is a stablecoin designed to remain pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its value is maintained by the reserves backing it, not by supply fluctuations. If you found this insight into the 250 million USDC minted event valuable, consider sharing it with your network!

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech investors alike, understanding the forces driving innovation is crucial. Today, that force is epitomized by Nvidia , which has just achieved a truly astonishing milestone, becoming the first public company to surpass a $5 trillion market cap . This isn’t just a number; it’s a testament to the ongoing AI boom and Nvidia’s central role in powering the next generation of computing. Nvidia’s Historic $5 Trillion Market Cap: A New Benchmark in Tech? The financial world watched in awe as Nvidia’s shares soared, pushing its valuation past the unprecedented $5 trillion mark. This monumental achievement solidifies Nvidia’s position not just as a leader, but as a defining entity in the current technological landscape. Just three months prior, the company had crossed the $4 trillion threshold, showcasing an accelerated growth trajectory that few could have predicted. This rapid ascent underscores the intense investor confidence and the seemingly insatiable demand for its cutting-edge products. What does a $5 trillion market cap truly signify? It means Nvidia is now worth more than the aggregated stock markets of all countries, with the exceptions of the United States, China, and Japan. This places it in an elite tier, reflecting not only its current dominance but also the perceived future potential of its core business. For many, Nvidia is no longer just a chipmaker; it’s the architect of the AI future. Fueling the AI Boom : The Insatiable Demand for Nvidia’s GPUs At the heart of Nvidia’s stratospheric rise are its Graphics Processing Units ( GPUs ). These aren’t just for gaming anymore; they are the workhorses of the artificial intelligence revolution. From training complex large language models (LLMs) to enabling real-time inference in data centers, Nvidia’s GPUs are indispensable. The demand is so high that these powerful chips have become a scarce commodity, strategically channeled into an ever-expanding data center ecosystem, ensuring their value remains elevated. The ongoing AI boom has created an unprecedented need for computational power. Companies across every sector are racing to integrate AI into their operations, products, and services, and Nvidia’s GPUs are the preferred engine for this transformation. This demand isn’t just theoretical; it’s translating into massive revenue and growth for Nvidia, making it the primary beneficiary of this technological paradigm shift. Why are Nvidia GPUs so critical for AI? Parallel Processing Power: GPUs are designed for parallel processing, executing multiple computations simultaneously, which is ideal for the intensive matrix operations required by AI algorithms.

Ecosystem and Innovation: Years of investment in software development and partnerships have created a robust ecosystem that makes Nvidia GPUs the go-to choice for AI developers and researchers. Scarcity and Value: The high demand and limited supply of advanced GPUs contribute to their premium pricing and Nvidia’s strong market position. Key Catalysts Behind Nvidia’s Unprecedented Surge Several significant developments have acted as powerful catalysts, propelling Nvidia to this incredible valuation. These events have not only boosted investor confidence but also underscored the company’s strategic importance in the global tech landscape. On Wednesday, Nvidia shares surged over 5.6% to $212.19, following news that U.S. President Donald Trump expects to discuss the company’s advanced Blackwell chips with Chinese President Xi Jinping. This geopolitical spotlight highlights the critical role of Nvidia’s technology in international relations and economic strategy. Adding to the fervor, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a series of impactful announcements on Tuesday. He projected a staggering $500 billion in AI chip sales, a figure that paints a clear picture of the company’s anticipated future dominance. Furthermore, Huang revealed that Nvidia is building seven new supercomputers for the U.S. government, dedicated to vital areas such as security, energy, and science. These projects will require thousands of Nvidia GPUs , cementing their foundational role in national infrastructure. Another strategic move announced on Tuesday was Nvidia’s $1 billion investment in Nokia. This partnership aims to leverage Nokia’s products to enable communication service providers to launch AI-native 5G-Advanced and 6G networks on Nvidia platforms. This collaboration extends Nvidia’s reach into telecommunications infrastructure, further embedding its technology into the fabric of future connectivity. Beyond these specific announcements, the broader investment landscape has been ripe with optimism.

With the market heating up again, the race is on for the 1000x crypto to buy , a token that could turn peanuts into a fat stack. While giants like Solana and BNB dominate headlines with infrastructure and utility stories, a newcomer named MoonBull is staging a full-bore launch for traders who want to ride the next big meme bull wave. In the wild world of meme coins and crypto mania, MoonBull’s presale (the $MOBU presale) is live and making serious noise. If timing is everything, then this might be the shot many traders have been waiting for. MoonBull: The Presale Bull-Charge for the 1000x Crypto to Buy The term 1000x crypto to buy works best when linked to an entry before the herd catches up, and MoonBull is positioning exactly that. In its current presale stage (Stage 5 at $0.00006584), the presale highlights show significant potential: token holders from Stage 5 could list at $0.00616, implying a 9,256% ROI from the Stage 5 price to listing. The presale tally has already passed $500 K and token holders exceed 1,600, underlining real-world demand. With the presale structured across 23 stages and scarcity baked in, early buyers at Stage 5 lock in tokens at a rock-bottom entry. Consider the scenario: investing $100 buys 1,518,833 $MOBU tokens, with a projected listing value of $9,356. That kind of potential is what the “1000x crypto to buy” phrase was made for. Launch Plan: Fair, Secure, and Built to Reward the Early Bulls MoonBull’s launch is built for fairness and strength. After the final presale stage, liquidity hits DEXs instantly, and every presale token becomes claimable, no vesting, no waiting. To prevent dumps, early sells must match buys for the first hour, keeping price floors rock-solid. With liquidity locked and no insider shortcuts, this launch protects believers and rewards patience. Day one belongs to the community, transparent, secure, and primed for a massive debut run. Solana (SOL) News: SOL Dips 4% This Month Despite Strong Network Activity Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $197.40, down 4.25% over the past month as traders lock in profits following recent highs. The network’s market cap stands at $108.51 billion, down 1.49%, while its 24-hour trading volume of $6.91 billion shows a slight 1.31% increase in market activity. Despite the short-term pullback, Solana’s fundamentals remain strong, with consistent developer engagement and high transaction throughput. However, investor sentiment has cooled as liquidity rotates toward other major altcoins and Bitcoin dominance continues to rise. BNB Price Slides Slightly After 16% Monthly Rally BNB (Binance Coin) is trading at $1,134.17, marking a 16.11% rise over the past month but showing mild weakness today as the broader crypto market consolidates. The token’s market cap is at $156.21 billion, down 0.86%, while 24-hour trading volume has climbed to $3.53 billion, a 21.3% increase, reflecting ongoing trader engagement. The recent dip follows BNB’s strong monthly performance, driven by renewed activity within the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem and growing investor interest in BNB-based staking and DeFi projects. Final Words Solana and BNB are both strong plays: Solana offers smart-contract infrastructure upside, and BNB gives exchange-ecosystem exposure. But if the phrase 1000x crypto to buy truly matters, then MoonBull presents the closest match to that ambition, especially for those who missed earlier meme coin moons and are looking at a high-FOMO entry point. With MoonBull’s presale live and tokenomics built for early-bird reward, the time to act may be now. Secure a spot in the $MOBU presale, and ride while you still can.
