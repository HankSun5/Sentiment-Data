While the world often focuses on the volatility of digital assets and traditional markets, the bedrock of global stability—and by extension, market confidence—lies in geopolitical harmony. It’s in this context that reports suggest former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to initiate crucial Trump Iran talks next week, aiming to prevent further progress in Iran’s nuclear program. This potential diplomatic overture, if it materializes, could redefine a contentious relationship and significantly alter the landscape of the Middle East. Understanding the Stakes: Why are these Iran Nuclear Talks Pivotal? The prospect of renewed dialogue between the United States and Iran under a potential Trump administration is not merely a headline; it’s a potential turning point. The relationship between these two nations has been fraught with tension for decades, particularly concerning Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal , was a landmark agreement designed to curtail Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. However, in 2018, the Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA, reimposing stringent sanctions and leading to a significant escalation of tensions. Since then, Iran has progressively expanded its nuclear activities, raising international alarms. De-escalation of Tensions: Direct talks could offer a pathway to reduce the immediate threat of military confrontation in a volatile region. Non-Proliferation: A successful agreement could put verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program, preventing it from developing nuclear weapons. Regional Stability: Reduced US-Iran tensions could positively impact proxy conflicts and alliances across the Middle East. Economic Implications: Any breakthrough could lead to the easing of sanctions, potentially opening up Iran’s economy and impacting global oil markets. Navigating the Complexities of US Foreign Policy Towards Iran The potential for Trump Iran talks represents a fascinating, if not paradoxical, evolution in US foreign policy . During his previous term, President Trump adopted a ‘maximum pressure’ campaign against Iran, believing that stringent sanctions and diplomatic isolation would force Tehran to capitulate. This approach, while popular with some regional allies and domestic constituencies, did not lead to a new, broader agreement as initially hoped. Instead, it contributed to increased regional instability and Iran’s accelerated nuclear activities. The current reports suggest a potential shift in strategy, hinting at a willingness to engage directly, perhaps acknowledging that isolation alone has not yielded the desired results. A new approach, however, would face immense challenges. Both sides carry deep-seated mistrust, shaped by decades of adversarial interactions, including: The 1979 Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis. Support for opposing sides in regional conflicts. Accusations of state-sponsored terrorism and human rights abuses. The ongoing debate over Iran’s ballistic missile program and regional influence, which were not fully addressed by the JCPOA. Any future negotiations would need to carefully balance these historical grievances with pragmatic pathways forward, ensuring that the terms are verifiable and sustainable for both parties. Will Middle East Stability Benefit from Renewed Diplomacy? The ripple effects of any significant movement in Trump Iran talks would be felt keenly across the entire region. The pursuit of Middle East stability is a goal shared by many, yet the path to achieving it is fraught with conflicting interests. Countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia, long wary of Iran’s regional ambitions and nuclear program, would be keenly observing any new diplomatic efforts. Their concerns about Iran’s influence in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq would likely feature prominently in their reactions to any potential deal. Conversely, a reduction in US-Iran tensions could pave the way for broader regional de-escalation, fostering an environment where diplomatic solutions to other conflicts become more feasible. Consider the potential scenarios: Successful De-escalation: A new, verifiable agreement could reduce the risk of direct conflict, allowing regional actors to focus on economic development and internal challenges. Continued Skepticism: Even with talks, deep mistrust could persist, leading to a cautious or even negative response from regional powers who fear a ‘bad deal’ that legitimizes Iran’s nuclear program or regional influence. Internal Dynamics: Both the US and Iran face internal political pressures that could derail negotiations. Hardliners in both countries may view compromise as weakness, making sustained dialogue difficult. Analyzing the Geopolitical Impact: What Does This Mean for the World? Beyond the immediate region, the geopolitical impact of potential Trump Iran talks extends globally. Major powers like China, Russia, and European nations have their own stakes in the stability of the Middle East and the future of the Iran nuclear deal . China, a major importer of Iranian oil, would welcome any move that stabilizes energy markets and allows for increased trade. Russia, which has its own strategic partnership with Iran, would likely support diplomatic efforts that reduce US unilateralism. European nations, who have consistently advocated for the preservation of the JCPOA, would see renewed talks as an opportunity to revive multilateral diplomacy and prevent nuclear proliferation. This situation highlights the interconnectedness of global affairs. A shift in US-Iran relations could: Influence global oil prices and energy security. Affect the dynamics of international sanctions regimes. Set precedents for how major powers approach non-proliferation challenges. Potentially open new avenues for cooperation or competition among global players. The world watches to see if these talks can bridge profound divides and steer a path towards greater stability in a region vital to global peace and prosperity. What’s Next for the Trump Iran Talks? While the initial report from Solid Intel on X is concise, the implications are vast. As details emerge regarding the scope and nature of these anticipated talks, the international community will be scrutinizing every development. Key questions remain: Who will be at the table? What will be the preconditions, if any? What kind of deal, if any, could realistically emerge from such negotiations? The answers to these questions will not only shape the future of US-Iran relations but also have profound consequences for Middle East stability and the broader geopolitical impact on global affairs. For investors, policymakers, and global citizens alike, staying informed on these developments is crucial. The path to a resolution will undoubtedly be complex, marked by periods of optimism and potential setbacks. However, the mere initiation of dialogue after years of heightened tensions signals a potentially transformative moment in international diplomacy.

Bitcoin is leading the headlines once again, hovering at $105,127.34 after a 3.18% climb in the past 24 hours. That’s massive liquidity flowing through the world’s biggest coin, just weeks after hitting its all-time high of $111,970. Meanwhile, Polygon is trading around $0.26, carrying a $2.71 billion market cap. While it’s down nearly 42.4% year-to-date, Polygon remains one of the most heavily used layer-2 protocols in the ecosystem. But in the background, Qubetics is rapidly stealing the spotlight—thanks to its powerful Web3 infrastructure and a final-stage crypto presale that’s drawing attention for all the right reasons. In the middle of this high-stakes environment comes Qubetics ($TICS), an ambitious project entering the final stage of its public sale. It’s solving real pain points in Web3 and presenting new opportunities in this evolving digital finance space. For those searching for the best crypto ICOs to invest, Qubetics stands out thanks to its cross-chain tools, final phase pricing advantage, and confirmed listing on a top 10 global exchange. The Web3 Power Tool: How Qubetics Helps Real-World Businesses The Qubetics ecosystem is built to do what others couldn’t. At its heart lies the QubeQode framework and the Qubetics IDE, two tools offering true utility for individuals and businesses navigating multi-chain demands. QubeQode empowers small businesses to deploy loyalty tokens across multiple chains in one go. Picture a restaurant chain in North America issuing branded tokens usable across Ethereum, BNB, and Solana without needing separate dev teams. It saves time, money, and risk. Meanwhile, the Qubetics IDE functions like a no-code studio for smart contract development. A financial services startup can now launch its own staking protocol across multiple blockchains without hiring expensive Web3 engineers. Even artists can mint NFTs with dual-chain support using a visual interface. Qubetics isn’t just making development easier, it’s making it possible for those who were previously locked out. This is what makes it one of the best crypto ICOs to invest right now: it actually delivers meaningful tools for the next wave of digital entrepreneurs. Qubetics Presale: Final Stage of One of the Best Crypto ICOs to Invest The Qubetics crypto presale is at its final stage, Stage 37, and it’s getting intense. Priced at $0.3370 per $TICS token, the sale has already raised over $18.1 million, with more than 516 million tokens sold and over 28,200 community members on board. There are only 9 million tokens left before the crypto presale closes and the token lists at $0.40, a 20% ROI at listing for those entering now. But it gets better. Following a significant tokenomics update, Qubetics cut its total supply from over 4 billion down to 1.36 billion, instantly boosting scarcity. The project also shifted a hefty 38.55% of its tokens into the hands of its public sale community—flipping the typical centralized control structure into something user-led and organic. This is why the Qubetics crypto presale is gaining steam among people looking for smart early entries. Here’s a real-world example: If someone puts in $20,000 at the current price of $0.3370, they’ll receive around 59,345 $TICS tokens. At the listing price of $0.40, that investment becomes $23,738. That’s a 20% gain built right into the timeline. Now, if Qubetics hits $5 post-listing—as some early forecasts suggest, that same holding could be worth $296,725. If it pushes toward $10, it reaches $593,450. That’s a strong reason why this crypto presale is turning heads in the final stretch. And the momentum doesn’t stop there. An official listing on a top 10 global exchange has been confirmed. The exact exchange name is currently under NDA, but the public announcement is scheduled in tandem with the platform’s PR rollout. Combined with the upcoming mainnet launch, this makes the Qubetics crypto presale a rare window of opportunity. Exchange Launch at $0.40: Qubetics Eyes Institutional Demand Qubetics will soon be listed on a top-tier global exchange, with the starting price confirmed at $0.40, 20% higher than the current public sale rate. That difference offers immediate growth for final presale buyers ahead of broader market entry. With a lean token supply and ecosystem utility built for real adoption, Qubetics is earning strong forecasts from market analysts, who predict a potential rise to $10–$15 per token post-mainnet. The project’s upcoming listing is more than just a price move, it’s the beginning of a long-anticipated public breakout. Polygon: The Layer-2 Giant with Real Utility Polygon has long been a key scaling solution for Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions via its proof-of-stake mechanism. It has hosted thousands of decentralized applications, enabling real-world use in DeFi, gaming, and enterprise integrations. Trading today at roughly $0.26, its market cap holds at $2.71 billion. However, despite broad adoption and strong infrastructure, Polygon is down 42.4% in 2025—mirroring wider market pressures and skepticism around its upcoming POL token rebranding. Still, its influence can’t be ignored. From powering major DeFi apps to onboarding legacy enterprises like Nike and Disney into Web3, Polygon remains a staple for builders. While its price struggles to recover, it’s clear that many are betting on its technology—not just its token. Yet in a market driven by momentum and scarcity, Qubetics seems to be capturing more of the spotlight this quarter. Bitcoin: Still the Giant, Now Near Peak Levels Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto confidence. Trading at $105,127.34, its current price puts it only 6% below its May 2025 all-time high of $111,970. With a market cap above $2.09 trillion and a massive 24-hour volume of $67 billion, Bitcoin is signaling strength in a market that’s finally waking up. The total circulating supply is nearly maxed out at 19.88 million BTC, with only 1.12 million coins left to mine before it hits its hard cap of 21 million. Bitcoin’s dominance is not just about scarcity—it’s about perception. With countries now adding BTC to their reserves and large financial institutions offering spot ETF exposure, Bitcoin is no longer just a tech rebellion—it’s a mainstream asset. Its recent moves make it clear: the next bull cycle has already begun. Conclusion For those looking at the big picture, each of these assets serves a different role. Bitcoin is the gold standard, solid, scarce, and increasingly institutional. Polygon represents enterprise-grade scaling solutions, though its price action still reflects broader macro unease. Qubetics, however, is in acceleration mode. It’s got real tools solving real problems, with QubeQode and IDE making cross-chain development accessible to everyone from startups to solo creatives. The Qubetics crypto presale is in its last phase, priced at $0.3370, with a confirmed top-tier exchange listing and an expected 20% gain baked in. With only 9 million tokens left and momentum building fast, early adopters are moving quickly to lock in allocations. For those scanning the space for one final entry point before the next surge, it’s time to join this crypto presale.

Crypto analyst Diep Sahn first noticed this in the ECB Eurosystem report on using emerging technologies for settlements. One of the projects that participated in the Eurosystem experiment was Axiology, a DLT securities trading and settlement infrastructure. The startup, founded by a former board member of the Bank of Lithuania, Marius Jurgilas, operates under the EU DLT Pilot regime. According to the report , 60 stakeholders and four central banks participated in the exploratory work across two phases. Through experiments and trials, these projects tested out 48 use cases in eleven categories, ranging from issuance and settlement of bonds to margin calls. Axiology participated in the experiment under Category 1, focusing on the institutional issuance of debt securities and the lifecycle management of such securities, from the issuance to coupon payments to redemption. Axiology leveraging XRP Ledger technology for permissioned DLT The report included a comprehensive explanation of Axiology capabilities and its use cases in the experiment, which shows that the platform was built using the open-source code of XRP Ledger. However, it was designed to be private and permissioned, allowing it to be independent while leveraging XRPL. The report said: “While Axiology benefits from XRP Ledger technology, it operates as an independent system, designed to streamline trading, settlement, and custody of tokenized assets, such as financial securities, with enhanced security and efficiency.” As a private and permissioned network, Axiology reportedly combines trading, accounting, and settlement functions into one infrastructure. This enables instant Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlement capabilities. However, it also operates with more compliance standards and risk management frameworks than public blockchains. For instance, it has to Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, such as verifying investors’ identities and allowing freezing of wallets while its on-chain capabilities are limited to reduce the risks associated with smart contracts. The report also comprehensively explained how Axiology functions in the lifecycle management of a bond, with the platform handling issuance, coupon payments, and redemption upon maturity. Interestingly, XRP Payment plays a crucial role in the processes, with the ECB noting that the wallets involved in transactions use XRP Payment to move funds. However, most of the processes rely on instructions contained in metadata that ensure seamless transactions without the inefficiency of the traditional bond market. Meanwhile, the experiments focused mostly on whether Axiology infrastructure and solutions can be interoperable with Central Bank Money (CeBM) and external settlement platforms. This is essential to identifying how the platform will function in real-world use cases. XRP holders are bullish on the token after the ECB report Many in the XRP community have pointed to the ECB report as a positive sign for the XRP Ledger. Diep Sanh said that this is evidence that XRP is powering the future of finance. Others also shared optimism, noting that while Axiology only uses XRPL technology, it is a vote of confidence for the network and shows its capacity for institutional and permissioned use. XRPL has already planned new features to improve its capacity for enterprise-grade products. However, the positive sentiments in the community have not been enough to lift its price this year. XRP remains down 5.79% year-to-date and has lost 6.49% of its value in the last 30 days, continuing an underperforming year like other major cap altcoins. Still, most XRP investors are holding in profit, with 65.1% of XRP circulating currently held at a profit, according to Santiment data. This puts it among the top three for percentage of circulating supply in profit, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Russian exchange’s Managing Director Vladimir Krekoten said a new BTC derivative instrument launch was “imminent.” Speaking to RBC Investments, Krekoten explained that the product would be a futures contract on a new Bitcoin index. Moscow Exchange: BTC Bullishness Continues He explained that calculations on the index that will become the underlying asset for the contract began on June 10.

It is cash-settled in rubles and tied to the BlackRock-launched iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). IBIT prices (USD) since the start of 2025. (Source: Yahoo Finance) Krekoten suggested that the popularity of the first Bitcoin futures contract offering has inspired the exchange to fast-track the release of more crypto derivative products. He said: “We plan to launch trading in instruments based on cryptoasset indices or ETFs as soon as demand for them from the industry begins to appear. On the other hand, regulators will become more aware of what is permissible and which clients should be allowed to access them. I can say that we are currently working on launching a futures contract on the Bitcoin index. We plan to launch it soon.” Regulatory Approval Still Pending Krekoten added that the exchange’s discussions with management companies were ongoing as the parties await regulatory approval. The executive said the parties were discussing the launch of mutual funds and structured bonds focused on cryptoasset indices. He explained: “We believe that the industry will soon be ready to provide clients with access to structured bonds for cryptoassets. We are technically and legally ready for this.” The executive explained that since the June 4 launch, trading volumes on the BTC futures contract have hit a total of almost 7 billion rubles ($89,455,660).

(Source: RBC Investing/Screenshot) Krekoten said that more than 10,000 investors have already traded with the product, adding: “These are very good indicators considering the instrument has only been on the market for such a short time.” Obviously, the figures are not comparable with the volumes of futures contracts on the Moscow Exchange index. However, this is still a very high figure.” Crypto Investment Growing in Popularity in Russia The Managing Director dismissed claims that the exchange lacks the technical capacity to launch more crypto-related products, concluding: “I think there are no fundamental differences between funds for any underlying asset.

For years, Bitcoin was hailed as an uncorrelated asset, a true safe haven from the volatility of mainstream finance. Yet, recent data tells a different story, one where the Bitcoin correlation with assets like the S&P 500 is reaching levels not seen in years. But here’s the twist: this isn’t necessarily a sign of increased investor appetite for risk. Instead, a deeper look reveals it might be an alarming signal of underlying US dollar weakness and profound shifts in global finance. Understanding the Surprising Bitcoin Correlation For a long time, the narrative around Bitcoin positioned it as ‘digital gold’ – an asset that would hold its value or even appreciate when traditional markets faltered. The idea was that it offered true diversification, acting as a hedge against inflation or economic downturns. However, recent observations, particularly highlighted by RedStone Oracles and cited by Cointelegraph, indicate a significant change in this dynamic. What Does a 0.4 Correlation Mean? The Metric: The 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 recently climbed above 0.4. Historical Context: This figure represents its highest point since 2020, a period marked by unprecedented monetary expansion and market volatility. Interpretation: A correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A value of +1 means two assets move perfectly in the same direction, -1 means they move perfectly in opposite directions, and 0 means no linear relationship. A 0.4 correlation suggests a moderate, but noticeable, tendency for Bitcoin and the S&P 500 to move together. Traditionally, a rising correlation between a ‘risk-on’ asset like Bitcoin and equities might suggest that investors are feeling more confident and are willing to take on more risk across the board. However, the concurrent plummet of the Dollar Index (DXY) to a 12-month low paints a different picture entirely. This simultaneous movement – Bitcoin and stocks up, dollar down – suggests a flight from fiat, not just a surge in speculative enthusiasm. Why is US Dollar Weakness Driving This Trend? The strength of the U.S. dollar has been a cornerstone of global finance for decades. It’s the world’s primary reserve currency, used in most international trade and financial transactions. But cracks are beginning to show, and the recent DXY plunge is a stark indicator of growing concerns. Unpacking the Dollar Index Decline The Dollar Index (DXY) measures the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of six major world currencies. When the DXY falls, it means the dollar is weakening against these currencies. Several factors contribute to this concerning trend: Monetary Policy Concerns: The U.S. Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening cycle, followed by hints of a potential pivot, creates uncertainty. Investors question the long-term impact of high interest rates on economic growth and the sustainability of government debt. Fiscal Discipline Woes: The U.S. national debt continues to climb at an alarming rate, recently surpassing $34 trillion. This escalating debt, coupled with persistent budget deficits, raises red flags for fiscal sustainability. When governments print more money or borrow excessively, it can devalue the currency. Inflationary Pressures: While inflation has cooled from its peak, persistent inflationary pressures erode the purchasing power of the dollar. Investors seek assets that can preserve or grow their wealth in real terms. Geopolitical Shifts: Global geopolitical tensions and the rise of multi-polar economic blocs are prompting nations to reconsider their reliance on the dollar. This erosion of trust in U.S. monetary policy and fiscal discipline is a powerful catalyst. When the world’s most dominant currency shows signs of fragility, investors, both retail and institutional, naturally look for alternatives. The Accelerating Pace of De-dollarization The concept of de-dollarization is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a tangible movement gaining momentum across the globe. This trend refers to countries and entities reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar for international trade, investment, and as a reserve currency. Who is Driving De-dollarization and Why? The shift away from the dollar is being propelled by various players for a multitude of reasons: Geopolitical Risk Mitigation: Countries are increasingly wary of the U.S.’s ability to weaponize the dollar through sanctions. Nations like China, Russia, and even some allies are seeking to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and establish alternative payment systems to reduce their vulnerability. Economic Sovereignty: Many emerging economies desire greater control over their financial systems and wish to reduce exposure to U.S. economic fluctuations and policy decisions. Rise of Alternative Currencies/Blocs: The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), among others, are actively exploring new trade agreements settled in local currencies and even contemplating a new common currency. This directly challenges the dollar’s dominance. Search for Stable Alternatives: As trust in fiat currencies wavers, the appeal of decentralized, scarce assets like Bitcoin grows. It offers a permissionless, censorship-resistant alternative that is not subject to the whims of any single government or central bank. This broader movement underscores a systemic shift. When institutional and sovereign players begin exploring alternatives to fiat-backed holdings, it sends a clear signal: the perceived safety and stability of traditional currencies are being re-evaluated on a global scale. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, presents a compelling proposition as a non-sovereign, digitally scarce asset in this evolving landscape. Investor Hedging: A New Paradigm for Scarcity In an environment where traditional safe havens are looking less secure, investors are recalibrating their strategies. The current macroeconomic trends of persistent inflation, ballooning national debts, and geopolitical instability are forcing a re-evaluation of what constitutes a ‘safe’ asset. This is where the concept of investor hedging takes on new meaning. Why Bitcoin and Stocks as Hedges? Historically, gold has been the go-to hedge against inflation and currency debasement. However, in the digital age, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold’ due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. Similarly, certain equities, particularly those of companies with strong pricing power or essential services, can act as a hedge against inflation, as they can pass on rising costs to consumers. Asset Type Traditional Role New Perspective (Hedge Against Dollar Weakness) Bitcoin Speculative, High Risk Digital Gold, Scarcity-driven asset, Uncorrelated (historically), Non-sovereign store of value U.S. Equities (S&P 500) Growth-oriented, Economic Indicator Real assets, Inflation hedge (for certain sectors/companies), Proxy for economic activity in a weakening currency environment Gold Traditional Safe Haven, Inflation Hedge Continues to be a hedge, but Bitcoin offers a digital alternative with different properties The shift is profound. Investors aren’t necessarily chasing higher returns through increased risk; they are seeking to preserve wealth in a world where the bedrock of global finance – the U.S. dollar – appears increasingly shaky. This strategic pivot towards scarce assets, whether digital or physical, underscores a fundamental concern about the future value of fiat currency. Navigating the New Macroeconomic Trends: What’s Next? The confluence of Bitcoin’s rising correlation with equities and the declining dollar index paints a complex picture of evolving macroeconomic trends . It’s a testament to how deeply intertwined global finance has become and how quickly investor sentiment can shift in response to perceived instability. Key Takeaways for Investors and Observers: Beyond Risk Appetite: Don’t mistake this correlation solely for increased risk-taking. It’s more nuanced, reflecting a strategic move to hedge against currency debasement. The Dollar’s Crossroads: The long-term trajectory of the U.S. dollar will be crucial. Continued fiscal expansion and monetary uncertainty could further accelerate the de-dollarization trend. Bitcoin’s Evolving Role: Bitcoin is maturing beyond a purely speculative asset. Its role as a potential hedge against inflation and a non-sovereign store of value is gaining traction, especially among institutional players. Global Economic Rebalancing: The world economy is in a state of rebalancing. The rise of new economic powers and their desire for financial independence will continue to challenge the existing order. This isn’t just a fleeting market anomaly; it’s a reflection of deeper structural issues. As governments grapple with immense debt burdens and central banks navigate complex monetary policy decisions, the search for truly scarce and resilient assets will only intensify. The rising Bitcoin correlation with equities, viewed through the lens of a weakening dollar, serves as a powerful indicator of these underlying shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Understanding these complex dynamics is one thing; knowing how to act on them is another. For those looking to navigate these turbulent waters, here are some actionable insights: Diversify Beyond Traditional Hedges: While gold remains relevant, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to digital scarce assets like Bitcoin. Research and understand its fundamentals, security, and long-term value proposition. Monitor Currency Markets Closely: Keep an eye on the Dollar Index (DXY) and other major currency pairs. A sustained decline in the dollar could signal continued shifts towards alternative assets. Assess Sovereign Debt and Fiscal Policies: Stay informed about the fiscal health of major economies. High and rising national debt can erode trust in fiat currencies over time. Educate Yourself on De-dollarization: Understand the geopolitical implications of de-dollarization and how it might impact global trade, reserve currencies, and commodity markets. Consider Long-Term Trends: Focus on long-term macroeconomic trends rather than short-term market noise. The shift towards scarce assets is a multi-year phenomenon. This era demands a more sophisticated approach to investment, one that acknowledges the changing nature of money and value in a digitally interconnected world. The signals are clear: the old rules are being rewritten, and adaptability will be key. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Digital Scarcity? The surprising convergence of Bitcoin and stock market movements, set against the backdrop of a weakening U.S. dollar, is more than just a statistical anomaly. It’s a compelling narrative of how global trust is shifting from traditional fiat currencies towards assets perceived as genuinely scarce and independent. RedStone Oracles’ insight, highlighting this as a response to US dollar weakness rather than mere risk appetite, offers a crucial lens through which to view the current financial landscape. This era of rising national debts, persistent inflation, and geopolitical re-alignments is compelling both retail and institutional investors to seek out new forms of wealth preservation. The growing Bitcoin correlation with equities underscores a broader theme of investor hedging against a backdrop of significant macroeconomic trends and an accelerating move towards de-dollarization . As the world re-evaluates its financial anchors, assets like Bitcoin are increasingly seen not just as speculative plays, but as vital components in a diversified portfolio designed to weather the storms of a changing global economy. The future of finance may well be defined by this ongoing search for true scarcity in an increasingly abundant world of fiat currency.

46784809,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72575,1750894230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts XRP $2 as Last Buying Opportunity,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-xrp-2-as-last-buying-opportunity/,"Cryptocurrency analyst DustyBC has made a confident projection regarding the price trajectory of XRP. In a recent social media post, he stated that by December 2025, the broader market will look back at XRP trading below $2 as a significant buying opportunity that was overlooked by many. He encouraged followers to revisit his remarks at the end of the year, suggesting that a major shift in XRP’s valuation may occur within that time frame. $XRP under $2 is incredibly cheap Bookmark this post, look back in 6 months. — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) June 23, 2025 XRP’s Performance and Price Stability Over the past seven months, XRP has maintained a price above the $2 mark despite volatility in the broader crypto market. While skeptics had anticipated a sharp correction following XRP’s earlier surge, the asset has demonstrated notable price resilience. During this period, it has repeatedly recovered from dips, never falling below $1.60 for a sustained period. This price stability has led many investors to reassess the definition of what qualifies as “cheap” for XRP. Historically, XRP was accessible within the $0.40 to $0.60 range just a few years ago. As a result, investors who refrained from buying then are now facing significantly higher entry points. For example, acquiring 100,000 XRP would have cost around $50,000 last year; today, the same quantity is valued at over $200,000. Community Sentiment and Market Outlook The belief that XRP could soon experience a significant price appreciation is shared by a growing segment of the crypto community. According to DustyBC, current prices may represent the lower end of a new long-term trading range. Several users commenting on his post shared this view, speculating that a strong upward move could materialize by the end of the year. Supporters of this outlook also point to previous price patterns. XRP’s last notable breakout began in late 2024 and extended into early 2025, aligning with the timeline DustyBC has outlined. This historical parallel adds weight to the argument that XRP may follow a similar trajectory in the coming months. Varying Price Predictions from Analysts Although DustyBC did not specify a precise target price for XRP, he has previously shared technical charts predicting a potential increase of up to 4,000%, which would bring the token close to $30. That forecast was initially made when XRP traded around $0.51. Since then, the token has reached a peak of $3.40 before undergoing a retracement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other analysts have presented their forecasts. XForceGlobal, a South Korean analyst known for using Elliott Wave theory, expects XRP to rise to between $10 and $20, targeting early 2026 for this price realization. He remains confident in the asset’s potential, despite persistent skepticism in the market. Javon Marks, another analyst, has issued one of the most bullish forecasts, suggesting that XRP could reach $99 within this market cycle. He bases his analysis on the similarities between current price behavior and the coin’s performance during its 2017 rally, where it significantly exceeded prior resistance levels. More conservative projections suggest that XRP could climb to approximately $9 before the end of the year, reflecting a more measured outlook amid varying degrees of market optimism. While projections differ widely, from moderate gains to dramatic increases, the next six months will likely be critical in determining whether current valuations truly reflect the asset’s potential or if, as some believe, XRP remains undervalued at today’s prices.

Canary Capital’s ETF filing is drawing attention because it is one of the first ETFs to combine memecoin assets, with the PENGU meme coin and Pudgy Penguins NFTs. BREAKING: Canary Capital files for $PENGU ETF with CBOE pic.twitter.com/RNgLgctUv0 — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) June 25, 2025 Canary Capital’s filing moves forward According to the filing, the PENGU ETF will focus primarily on PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguin NFTs, and will allocate between 80% to 95% of its assets to PENGU while 5% to 15% go to the NFTs. Smaller portions of SOL and ETH will be held to cover transaction fees and NFT purchases; however, this will only be as needed rather than for investment exposure. Given PENGU was deployed on the Solana network while the Pudgy Penguin NFTs exist on Ethereum, ETH and SOL will be required for auction payments and gas fees. Since the filing was announced, users on X have weighed in with their opinions, with sentiments mostly highlighting the novelty of the idea. It has also not gone unnoticed to many netizens that only a few cryptocurrencies, like BTC, SOL, XRP, and DOGE, have ever reached this stage in the ETF process, underscoring the filing’s importance for Pudgy Penguins’ visibility. However, nothing is certain, and the outcome may not be what is expected. Even with the crypto-friendly Atkins SEC, the regulator still throws the occasional curve ball. Invesco joins the race for a Solana ETF News of Canary Capital’s filing comes as Invesco Ltd and crypto-focused firm Galaxy Digital LP filed for a Solana exchange-traded fund. Subsidiaries of the two companies reportedly filed a registration statement on Wednesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an “ Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF .” If approved, the fund will trade on Cboe BZX under the ticker symbol “QSOL,” according to the statement. Invesco Capital Management LLC was registered as the sponsor, and the Bank of New York Mellon was noted as the administrator. However, Galaxy will be tasked with acquiring the tokens while Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC would be the custodian of the SOL. The filing from Invesco and Galaxy Digital LP joins those from several firms like VanEck, Bitwise and 21Shares that are also vying for a Solana ETF. Many of those proposals were filed over the past year with the expectation that the new SEC administration installed by President Donald Trump would be more open toward the idea of crypto ETFs. However, the SEC has been sluggish, delaying its decision on the various ETFs for various reasons, much to the frustration of the general public.

Imagine a future where you, and only you, hold the keys to your digital self, moving seamlessly across platforms without compromising your privacy or ownership. This is not just a dream; it’s the groundbreaking vision behind Moca Network ‘s latest initiative. Backed by the formidable Animoca Brands, Moca Network is set to revolutionize how we interact with the internet, launching a new Layer-1 blockchain specifically designed for decentralized identity. This move signals a significant leap towards true digital property rights and a more user-centric Web3. What is Moca Network and Its Vision for Web3? At its core, Moca Network is more than just a blockchain project; it’s a strategic arm of Animoca Brands, a global leader in gamification and blockchain, dedicated to building and investing in the open metaverse. Moca Network’s primary mission is to foster a vibrant ecosystem that promotes digital property rights, empowering users with greater control over their data and digital assets. This vision is deeply rooted in the principles of Web3, advocating for an internet where ownership and governance are distributed, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants. Their focus extends beyond just digital collectibles; it delves into the fundamental concept of identity. In the current digital landscape, our personal data is often siloed, forcing us to create new profiles and trust multiple third parties with sensitive information. Moca Network aims to dismantle these silos, offering a unified, self-sovereign identity solution that travels with you, securely and privately, across various applications and platforms. How Does Moca Chain L1 Revolutionize Decentralized Identity? The cornerstone of Moca Network’s ambitious plan is the introduction of Moca Chain L1 , a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain engineered specifically for decentralized digital identity verification. Unlike existing identity solutions that might be built on general-purpose blockchains, Moca Chain is being optimized from the ground up to handle the unique demands of identity management, ensuring scalability, security, and efficiency. The goal is simple yet profound: to give users unprecedented control over their personal data. Imagine a scenario where instead of submitting your driver’s license or passport details to every new service, you can simply provide a cryptographically verified attestation of your age or nationality, without revealing the underlying document. This is the power of decentralized identity facilitated by Moca Chain. Key developments for Moca Chain L1 include: Testnet Launch: Expected in Q3 of the current year, allowing developers and early adopters to experiment with the protocol and provide crucial feedback. Mainnet Rollout: Slated for year-end, signifying the full operational launch of the blockchain, ready for widespread adoption. Native Token (MOCA): The Moca Chain will utilize its native token, MOCA, for essential network functions. This includes staking, which will secure the network and incentivize participation, as well as powering various data-related functions and transactions within the ecosystem. This dedicated L1 approach signifies Moca Network’s commitment to building a robust and scalable infrastructure for the future of identity in Web3. The Strategic Alliance: Animoca Brands and Moca Network The partnership between Animoca Brands and Moca Network is a formidable one, amplifying the potential impact of this decentralized identity initiative. Animoca Brands is renowned for its aggressive push into the open metaverse, NFTs, and blockchain gaming. Their extensive portfolio includes investments in hundreds of Web3 companies and popular titles like The Sandbox, bringing immense experience and a vast ecosystem to the table. Animoca’s broader mission aligns perfectly with Moca Chain’s focus on user data control and digital property rights. For years, Animoca Brands has been a vocal proponent of true digital ownership, where users genuinely own their in-game assets, virtual land, and digital identities. Moca Chain provides a fundamental layer for this vision, ensuring that the identity tied to these digital assets is also user-owned and controlled. As reported by CoinDesk, this synergy is crucial. Animoca’s backing provides not only financial support but also strategic guidance, network effects, and a clear pathway for Moca Chain to integrate with a wide array of existing and future Web3 applications within the Animoca ecosystem. This collaboration could accelerate the adoption of decentralized identity solutions, making them a standard feature of the open metaverse. What Are the Tangible Benefits of Moca Chain’s Approach? The advent of a dedicated L1 for decentralized identity, spearheaded by Moca Network, promises a multitude of benefits for individuals, developers, and the broader Web3 ecosystem: Unprecedented User Control and Privacy: The most significant benefit is the shift in power. Users will gain complete sovereignty over their personal data, deciding what information to share, with whom, and for how long. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and empowers individuals to manage their digital footprint proactively. Enhanced Security: By leveraging blockchain’s cryptographic security and immutability, Moca Chain offers a more secure method for identity verification compared to traditional centralized databases, which are often single points of failure. Seamless Interoperability Across Web3: A unified decentralized identity means users can carry their verified credentials across different dApps, metaverses, and blockchain networks without needing to re-verify or create new profiles repeatedly. This streamlines user experience and fosters a truly interconnected digital world. New Economic Models and Reputation Systems: Decentralized identity can unlock novel opportunities for data monetization (where users choose to share data for compensation) and the development of robust, verifiable reputation systems that are not tied to a single platform. Streamlined Compliance (Selective Disclosure): For businesses and regulated industries, Moca Chain could facilitate ‘selective disclosure,’ allowing users to prove compliance (e.g., being over 18) without revealing their exact birthdate or other sensitive information, thus balancing privacy with regulatory needs. Navigating the Path Forward: Potential Challenges and Opportunities While the promise of decentralized identity is immense, the journey towards widespread adoption for Moca Chain L1 will naturally encounter challenges. One significant hurdle is user education and onboarding. The concept of self-sovereign identity is new to many, and simplifying the user experience will be critical for mass adoption. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks around digital identity are still evolving globally, which could impact implementation strategies. However, these challenges are dwarfed by the immense opportunities. The market for secure, private, and interoperable digital identities is vast and growing. Moca Chain has the potential to become a foundational layer for countless Web3 applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming, social media, and even real-world applications. By empowering users with true ownership of their digital selves, Moca Network is not just building a blockchain; it’s laying the groundwork for a more equitable and trustworthy digital future. Looking Ahead: The Future of Digital Property Rights with Moca Network The launch of Moca Chain L1 marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital property rights . Animoca Brands and Moca Network are not just creating a technical solution; they are championing a philosophical shift towards an internet where individuals are sovereign. This means that your online persona, your digital assets, and your personal data are truly yours, controlled by you, and protected by the immutable power of the blockchain. For developers, Moca Chain offers a robust infrastructure to build applications that prioritize user privacy and ownership. For users, it promises a future where logging in doesn’t mean giving away your data, and moving between digital spaces is as seamless as walking from one room to another in your own home. As the testnet approaches in Q3 and the mainnet by year-end, the world will be watching closely to see how this revolutionary approach to identity reshapes the Web3 landscape. In conclusion, Moca Network’s foray into a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain for decentralized identity is a bold and necessary step towards a more secure, private, and user-controlled digital world. With Animoca Brands’ backing, Moca Chain L1 is poised to become a cornerstone of the open metaverse, truly empowering individuals with their digital property rights and shaping the next era of the internet.

What Does Data Show?,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-btc-about-to-blow-up-to-120k-breakout-what-does-data-show/,"Bitcoin briefly dropped below $100,000 during the 12-day conflict involving Israeli and US strikes on Iran, along with retaliatory attacks on Israel and US bases in Qatar. Markets were shaken until US President Donald Trump confirmed that both Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. This announcement triggered a rebound in global risk sentiment. As investor confidence returned, Bitcoin began a fresh rally, breaking through the $106,000 level on Wednesday. New data suggest that the crypto asset could see a potential surge to $120K amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Beginning of a New Bull Leg? Bitcoin could be poised for a sharp upward move, potentially reaching $120,000, after successfully reclaiming its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). According to CryptoQuant, the 50-day EMA is widely regarded as a critical technical indicator, and often serves as support during corrections in a broader bullish trend. Historically, when Bitcoin dips below this level and quickly regains it, the market tends to respond with a rapid 10-20% surge. This pattern is playing out again: following a brief pullback below the EMA, Bitcoin has closed above it for three consecutive days, which is indicative of a renewed bullish momentum. CryptoQuant explained that this recovery could kickstart a new leg up in the ongoing cycle. However, they caution that external geopolitical factors, particularly developments related to the US, Israel, and Iran, may inject short-term volatility into the market. In such an environment, traders should avoid excessive leverage and maintain a risk-managed approach. While technical indicators currently support a bullish outlook, broader macro and geopolitical uncertainty continue to pose potential headwinds. Despite this, the reclaim of the 50-day EMA remains a significant milestone for Bitcoin, which strengthens the case for a possible rally toward the six-figure mark. Psychological Floor Beyond technical indicators, on-chain metrics also support Bitcoin’s current momentum, especially the behavior of short-term holders. The Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH-RP), which now stands at $98K, continues to act as a key psychological and technical support for Bitcoin. As it edges toward $100K, each uptick reinforces six figures as the new perceived “fair value.” Bitcoin’s spot price is $106.4K, a 7.2% premium over STH-RP, which suggests reduced “froth.” Recent sharp bounces off STH-RP confirm a bullish structure, while long-term holders remain unmoved, with their cost basis at $32K. This veteran supply lock-up limits downside risk. As long as the crypto asset holds above STH-RP, the uptrend of higher lows and higher highs remains intact; a break below would signal a potential correction The post Is Bitcoin’s (BTC) About to Blow Up to $120K Breakout?

This monumental sum is earmarked for a new crypto reserve fund , signaling a powerful convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. This isn’t just another fund; it’s a strategic move to build a substantial war chest of leading digital assets , potentially reshaping the landscape of institutional crypto investment . The Vision Behind the Tether Co-founder’s Bold Move At the heart of this significant development is a figure well-known in the cryptocurrency realm: a co-founder of Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT. While the specific name isn’t publicly detailed in the initial reports, the involvement of such a prominent individual from the stablecoin ecosystem lends immense credibility and deep industry insight to the venture. This Tether co-founder brings a wealth of experience in managing large-scale digital asset operations and understanding market dynamics. Joining forces with this crypto veteran is a former executive from Blackstone, one of the world’s leading investment firms. This partnership is particularly noteworthy as it bridges the often-disparate worlds of decentralized finance and traditional Wall Street. The combination of deep crypto expertise and seasoned institutional finance acumen creates a formidable team, capable of navigating the complexities of both markets. Their collective vision is to establish a robust fund designed not for speculative day trading, but for holding a diversified portfolio of foundational digital assets , aiming for long-term stability and growth within the crypto sphere. The decision to target a $1 billion raise underscores the immense ambition behind this project. It reflects a strong belief in the enduring value and future potential of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. This substantial capital injection could provide significant liquidity and stability to the targeted digital assets, further solidifying their position in the global financial ecosystem. It’s a clear signal that serious capital is increasingly comfortable making substantial bets on the future of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. What is this Crypto Reserve Fund and Why Does it Matter? So, what exactly is a crypto reserve fund , and why is this particular one generating so much buzz? Unlike typical venture capital funds that invest in crypto startups, or hedge funds that engage in active trading strategies, a reserve fund generally aims to hold a basket of assets, often with a focus on stability and long-term accumulation. In this context, the fund is structured to hold a variety of prominent digital assets , including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). The primary purpose of such a fund is multi-faceted: Long-Term Value Accumulation: By holding core digital assets, the fund aims to benefit from the overall growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market over an extended period. Market Stability: A large, well-capitalized reserve fund can contribute to market stability by acting as a significant holder, potentially mitigating some volatility associated with smaller, more speculative trading activities. Institutional Access: It provides a structured and familiar vehicle for traditional institutional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly managing the complexities of private keys, exchanges, and regulatory nuances. Strategic Deployment: While primarily a reserve, such a fund could also be strategically deployed to support specific ecosystem developments, provide liquidity, or even participate in governance of decentralized protocols, depending on its specific mandate. The creation of a $1 billion crypto reserve fund of this magnitude, backed by such influential figures, could set a new benchmark for how large-scale capital interacts with the crypto market. It represents a more mature and measured approach to crypto investment, moving beyond the initial speculative fervor towards a more strategic, long-term perspective. This shift is crucial for attracting broader institutional crypto investment . Understanding SPAC Fundraising : The Vehicle for Innovation The chosen mechanism for raising this significant capital is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), specifically M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp. But what exactly is SPAC fundraising , and why would this high-profile team opt for this particular route? A SPAC, often dubbed a ‘blank check company,’ is a shell corporation listed on a stock exchange with the sole purpose of acquiring a private company, thereby taking it public without going through a traditional Initial Public Offering (IPO). Here’s a breakdown of why SPACs have become a popular fundraising tool, especially in emerging sectors like crypto: Speed to Market: SPACs generally offer a faster path to public listing compared to a traditional IPO, which can be a lengthy and arduous process involving extensive regulatory scrutiny and roadshows. For a rapidly evolving industry like crypto, speed can be a significant advantage. Access to Capital: SPACs can raise substantial amounts of capital from public investors, providing a powerful fundraising mechanism for companies that might not yet be ready for a conventional IPO due to their stage or industry. Experienced Sponsors: SPACs are typically led by experienced management teams (the ‘sponsors’) who bring expertise and credibility. In this case, the involvement of a Tether co-founder and a former Blackstone executive serves as a strong endorsement for potential investors. Flexibility: The terms of a SPAC merger can be more flexible than an IPO, allowing for tailored deals that suit the specific needs of the target company. However, SPAC fundraising also comes with its own set of considerations. These can include potential dilution for early investors, increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the need for careful due diligence. Despite these factors, the choice of a SPAC for this $1 billion crypto reserve fund highlights a strategic decision to leverage a proven, albeit sometimes controversial, method for rapid capital formation and public market access, signaling a serious intent to make a splash in the institutional crypto investment arena. Targeting Key Digital Assets : BTC, ETH, SOL The fund’s strategy focuses on three of the most prominent and influential digital assets : Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This selection is not arbitrary; it reflects a calculated approach to investing in the foundational layers and leading innovations within the blockchain space. Bitcoin (BTC): As the original and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin is widely regarded as ‘digital gold’ and a store of value. Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and robust network security make it a cornerstone asset for any long-term crypto investment strategy. The fund’s inclusion of BTC underscores a belief in its enduring role as a primary reserve asset in the digital economy. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, powering the vast majority of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its vibrant developer ecosystem and ongoing evolution (e.g., the transition to Proof-of-Stake with Ethereum 2.0) position it as a critical infrastructure layer for the future of the internet. Investing in ETH is an investment in the programmable money and decentralized web revolution. Solana (SOL): Solana has emerged as a high-performance blockchain known for its exceptional speed and low transaction costs, making it a strong competitor in the layer-1 blockchain space. Its rapid growth in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming has attracted significant developer and user activity. The inclusion of SOL indicates an interest in scalable, high-throughput blockchain solutions that can support mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. By targeting these specific digital assets , the fund aims to capture value from different facets of the crypto market: the established store of value, the dominant smart contract platform, and a leading high-performance alternative. This diversified yet focused approach is designed to optimize for growth while managing risk, making it an attractive proposition for sophisticated investors looking for substantial institutional crypto investment opportunities. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Investment : A Game Changer? This $1 billion crypto reserve fund is more than just another large investment; it’s a powerful indicator of a seismic shift: the accelerating trend of institutional crypto investment . For years, the crypto market was largely driven by retail investors and early adopters. However, in recent times, traditional financial institutions (TradFi) are increasingly recognizing the legitimacy and potential of digital assets. Several factors are contributing to this surge in institutional interest: Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape is slowly becoming clearer, providing a more predictable environment for large financial entities to operate within. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in various jurisdictions, for example, has opened new avenues for institutional capital. Maturing Infrastructure: The development of robust custody solutions, institutional-grade trading platforms, and sophisticated analytics tools has made it safer and more efficient for institutions to engage with crypto assets. Demand from Clients: A growing number of institutional clients, including pension funds, endowments, and family offices, are expressing interest in gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified portfolio strategy. Macroeconomic Factors: In an era of inflation concerns and geopolitical uncertainty, some institutions view digital assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge or an uncorrelated asset class. The involvement of a Tether co-founder and a former Blackstone executive in this $1 billion SPAC fundraising effort sends a strong signal that top-tier financial talent and capital are now actively building bridges into the crypto space. This influx of institutional capital is critical for the long-term growth and stability of the market. It brings not only significant funding but also professional expertise, governance standards, and a broader network that can help push digital assets further into the mainstream financial system. This development is truly a game changer, legitimizing the asset class and paving the way for unprecedented levels of adoption. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the prospect of a $1 billion crypto reserve fund is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the challenges and the vast opportunities that lie ahead for this ambitious venture and the broader market for digital assets . Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite some progress, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and unpredictable across different jurisdictions. Changes in policy could impact the fund’s operations or the assets it holds. Market Volatility: While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are established, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Significant price swings could impact the fund’s performance and investor confidence. Competition: As institutional crypto investment grows, so too does the competition among various funds and investment vehicles vying for institutional capital. Technological Risks: The underlying blockchain technologies, while robust, are still evolving. Risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities, network attacks, or unforeseen technological shifts could pose challenges. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, negative headlines or market downturns can still impact public and institutional perception of digital assets. Opportunities: Market Maturation: A large, well-managed fund can contribute to the overall maturation and professionalization of the crypto market, attracting more cautious investors. Driving Innovation: The capital and expertise brought by such a fund can indirectly support further innovation within the ecosystems of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, leading to new use cases and increased adoption. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: This initiative serves as a powerful bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, potentially accelerating the integration of blockchain technology into mainstream financial services. Liquidity Provision: A substantial reserve fund can provide significant liquidity to the markets for its target digital assets , benefiting all participants. Setting Standards: The fund’s operational practices and investment strategies could set new benchmarks for responsible and sophisticated institutional crypto investment . The success of this SPAC fundraising effort and the subsequent performance of the crypto reserve fund will undoubtedly be closely watched. It represents a significant test case for large-scale, institutionally-backed ventures in the crypto space, with the potential to unlock immense value and drive the industry forward. Conclusion The news of a Tether co-founder and a former Blackstone executive collaborating to raise $1 billion for a dedicated crypto reserve fund through SPAC fundraising is a landmark event. This ambitious project underscores the growing confidence in digital assets as a legitimate and lucrative asset class, drawing in serious capital and expertise from both the crypto native world and traditional finance. By focusing on foundational assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, this fund is positioning itself at the forefront of the burgeoning trend of institutional crypto investment . While challenges such as regulatory hurdles and market volatility persist, the opportunities for driving market maturity, fostering innovation, and bridging the gap between TradFi and DeFi are immense. This initiative is a clear signal that the future of finance will increasingly incorporate digital assets, moving beyond speculative interest towards strategic, long-term capital allocation. The coming months will reveal the full impact of this bold venture on the global financial landscape.

XRP’s rise remains one of the market’s iconic growth stories—and now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning similar attention. Bitcoin and Solana traders are also closely monitoring Polygon, with all three forming a key part of the smart capital rotation emerging in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE has firmly established itself as one of the year’s most talked-about pre-sale projects, having raised over $10 million and consistently selling out across each phase. The project’s capped 170 billion token supply , HashEx audit , and community-owned structure set it apart from most meme-inspired tokens. Its blend of viral engagement and sound fundamentals—like staking features and VC-free tokenomics—has made it a magnet for traders rotating out of saturated large caps. Analyst sentiment continues to build around the project’s growth trajectory, reinforcing its position as a prime early-stage play. Bitcoin: The Anchor Seeking New Multiples Bitcoin is holding firm above $105,000 , buoyed by institutional flows and long-term investor confidence. Still, many traders are redeploying gains into newer, faster-moving opportunities. For these investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a familiar early-stage profile that aligns with the type of breakout momentum Bitcoin once represented. Solana: Mature Ecosystem, Fresh Opportunities Solana maintains its dominance in NFTs and DeFi infrastructure thanks to an active development community. Yet with its price growth plateauing, many Solana holders are exploring more agile alternatives. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its scarcity appeal and surging engagement, is fast becoming a favored destination for these growth-focused portfolios. Polygon: The Layer-2 Standout Polygon (MATIC) remains a Layer-2 leader with broad utility and a long-term roadmap aimed at scalability. As market competition increases, however, traders seeking sharper near-term moves are branching into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Polygon remains foundational for many, capital is rotating into newer assets with more immediate upside visibility. Conclusion With disciplined execution, transparent governance, and rising market attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious momentum. Bitcoin and Solana traders are keeping Polygon on watch—but for early-stage strength and breakout potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning its place in the spotlight.

What The Wave Count Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-surge-to-130000/,"After a week of volatile price action, Bitcoin has once again returned to familiar territory around the $106,000 price level. However, on-chain data shows that investors are still cautious, with the crypto Fear & Greed Index now in the neutral zone. On the other hand, technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows that its price behavior has completed a significant correction, one that’s paving the way for a major rally to $130,000. Bitcoin’s Wave 2 Correction Might Be Complete According to XForceGlobal, a crypto analyst who posted a detailed Elliott Wave chart on the social platform X, Bitcoin’s recent correction fits neatly within a completed WXY pattern. The second wave, which started following the all-time high of $111,814 on May 22 and formed the corrective structure, has now retraced into the expected Fibonacci range between the 23.6% and 38.2% levels. Notably, the ideal minimum target for this correction move was in the $90,000 region, and Bitcoin fulfilled that condition with the pullback to just under $98,200 over the weekend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The most important thing was in preserving the macro wave structure. Instead of drawing out a deeper pullback into the 0.618 to 0.886 Fibonacci levels, which is often characteristic of bear market retracements, the analysis maintains the idea that this was a wave 2 correction within a larger bullish impulse. This distinction is important. If the WXY correction is indeed complete and wave 2 has concluded, the next logical move in the Elliott Wave sequence is a third wave advance. According to Elliott Wave analysis, the third wave is often the most explosive in terms of price expansion. Its outcome could therefore push the price of Bitcoin to new heights that are significantly higher than its most recent all-time high. Why $130,000 Is A Realistic Target For Bitcoin The analyst’s technical projection on Bitcoin’s 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows an expected wave 3 trajectory extending beyond $111,800, with an expansion arrow reaching up above $130,000. This is the expansion move and is based on a similar projection of Wave 1. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Move Is Over? Higher Lows Chart A Course To $115,482 In the accompanying chart, the analyst marks the key pivot zone between $98,000 and $102,000 as the Wave C termination area. If this zone indeed marks the completion of the second wave, the next movement would require validation through the formation of a clear 1-2 structure within Wave 3. This means that confirmation of the bullish count also depends on the price making a new local high above the current range and then pulling back without breaching the recent lows. If that structure plays out, then the market would likely be in the early stages of a powerful third wave. Bitcoin has already made an 8% price gain after it dropped to a low of $98,200 following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The most significant upward move came on Tuesday, June 24, when reports of a Middle East cease-fire pushed Bitcoin up roughly 4%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,330.

In a new strategy session, Kevin Svenson tells his 83,300 YouTube subscribers that he’s keeping a close watch on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto, excluding the top 10 digital assets and stablecoins. Traders keep an eye on the OTHERS chart to gauge the performance of the altcoin market. According to the crypto strategist, OTHERS appears to be following its 2024 price action, when it went through a corrective period before sparking a parabolic surge toward the end of the year. Svenson predicts that altcoins will stage another explosive rally if Bitcoin and another asset class soar to new record highs. “I’m just showing what’s showing up on the chart. The setup is nearly the same. And this huge run-up when the OTHERS chart went up 140% last time… this happened because Bitcoin and the S&P [500] both broke into a new all-time high at the same time. We saw Bitcoin break a new all-time high recently, but the S&P did not. So if we both get the S&P and Bitcoin to break out to a new all-time high soon, a move like this [November to December 2024] up to $570 billion for OTHERS, the low-cap altcoins, are very likely, in my opinion, that we’re going to get a major pump.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $233.72 billion.

A legislative earthquake is rumbling through the digital asset landscape, specifically targeting stablecoins. At the epicenter of this seismic shift is the U.S. Senate’s recently passed Genius Act , a bill poised to fundamentally redefine how stablecoins operate. For Tether , the undisputed giant in the stablecoin arena with a staggering $156 billion in circulation, this isn’t just another legislative update; it’s a direct challenge to its very operational model. The implications are profound, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented transparency and compliance that could reshape the entire crypto ecosystem. Unpacking the Genius Act : A New Era for Stablecoins The Genius Act , a name that hints at its ambitious scope, is designed to bring stablecoins firmly within the regulatory purview of U.S. authorities. At its core, the bill introduces stringent requirements aimed at safeguarding financial stability and protecting consumers. It’s a clear signal from lawmakers that the wild west days of crypto are drawing to a close, at least for assets intended to maintain a stable value. The primary provisions of this landmark legislation are straightforward yet powerful: Full Asset Backing: Stablecoin issuers will be mandated to back their tokens 1:1 with highly liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, or U.S. Treasury bills. This moves away from the current, often opaque, mixed-asset backing models prevalent in the market. Annual Audits: Issuers will be required to undergo independent, annual audits of their reserves and financial statements. This provision is critical for enhancing transparency and ensuring that stated reserves genuinely exist and are managed appropriately. U.S. Registration: To operate within the U.S. market, stablecoin issuers must register with relevant U.S. financial authorities. This brings them under direct regulatory oversight, similar to traditional financial institutions. The stated goal, as reported by WSJ, is to integrate stablecoins more fully into mainstream financial use, fostering trust and stability. However, the path to compliance won’t be immediate. The legislation includes a grace period – three years under the Senate version and a more aggressive 18 months under the House proposal – offering issuers time to adapt. This disparity in grace periods highlights the ongoing legislative debate and the urgency with which different factions view the need for reform. The Tether Conundrum: Navigating Stricter Backing Rules No stablecoin issuer stands to be more impacted by the Genius Act than Tether (USDT). For years, Tether has been the dominant force in the stablecoin market, powering a vast portion of crypto trading volume. Its sheer size, with $156 billion in circulation, makes it a systemic player. However, Tether’s operational model has long been a subject of scrutiny, primarily due to its partial asset backing and perceived limited financial transparency. Unlike some competitors, Tether’s reserves have historically included a significant portion of commercial paper, corporate bonds, and other less liquid assets, rather than being exclusively backed by cash or cash equivalents. While Tether has made strides in increasing its cash and Treasury bill holdings, the Genius Act’s strict 1:1 full backing requirement will necessitate a fundamental overhaul of its reserve management strategy. Furthermore, its current practice of providing attestations, rather than full, independent audits, falls short of the rigorous auditing standards proposed by the bill. This legislative pressure forces Tether to choose: either dramatically transform its operations to meet U.S. standards, or risk being marginalized in one of the world’s largest and most influential financial markets. The stakes are incredibly high, not just for Tether, but for the entire ecosystem that relies on its liquidity and stability. Revolutionizing Stablecoin Regulation : What Does It Mean? The Genius Act represents a pivotal moment for stablecoin regulation , setting a precedent that could ripple across the globe. This isn’t just about one company; it’s about defining the future of digital money. The push for full backing and transparency aims to prevent scenarios reminiscent of the Terra/Luna collapse, where a stablecoin’s de-pegging sent shockwaves through the entire crypto market. By ensuring that every stablecoin unit is genuinely backed by tangible, easily verifiable assets, the legislation seeks to instill confidence and mitigate systemic risk. Consider the potential shifts: Increased Trust: Users and institutional investors will have greater assurance that their stablecoins are truly stable, fostering wider adoption. Competitive Landscape: Stablecoins that already adhere to stricter backing standards, like USDC, might find themselves in a more favorable position, potentially gaining market share from those forced to adapt. Market Consolidation: Smaller, less compliant stablecoin issuers may struggle to meet the new requirements, leading to market consolidation around larger, more robust players. Enhanced Financial Stability: The integration of stablecoins into the traditional financial system will be smoother and safer, reducing risks of contagion. This regulatory push is a double-edged sword. While it promises greater stability and legitimacy, it also poses significant operational and financial challenges for issuers, potentially stifling innovation for some. The debate will continue to rage over striking the right balance between regulation and fostering growth. Enhancing Crypto Compliance : The Road Ahead for Digital Assets The Genius Act is more than just a stablecoin bill; it’s a significant step towards a comprehensive framework for crypto compliance across the broader digital asset landscape. Lawmakers and regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing cryptocurrencies, driven by concerns over consumer protection, financial stability, anti-money laundering (AML), and illicit financing. This bill signals a maturing approach to digital assets, moving beyond initial skepticism to a phase of structured integration. Key elements of enhanced crypto compliance include: Know Your Customer (KYC) & AML: Stricter requirements for identifying users and monitoring transactions to combat financial crime. Data Reporting: More comprehensive reporting of financial data to regulatory bodies. Operational Resilience: Requirements for robust cybersecurity measures and operational safeguards to protect assets and systems. Consumer Protection: Mandates around disclosures, dispute resolution mechanisms, and safeguarding customer funds. The implications extend beyond stablecoins, setting a precedent for how other types of digital assets might be regulated in the future. Exchanges, DeFi protocols, and even NFT platforms could eventually face similar calls for greater transparency and oversight. The industry must prepare for a future where compliance is not an afterthought but a core operational pillar. Shaping Future Digital Asset Laws : Beyond Stablecoins The passage of the Genius Act is a strong indicator of the evolving landscape of digital asset laws . It underscores a growing consensus among policymakers that digital assets, particularly those designed to function as money, cannot operate outside the existing financial regulatory framework indefinitely. This bill could serve as a blueprint for future legislation addressing other facets of the crypto economy, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to tokenized securities. The U.S. is positioning itself to be a leader in establishing clear rules for the digital economy, aiming to foster innovation within a regulated environment. This approach contrasts with some jurisdictions that have adopted outright bans or highly restrictive measures. The goal is to harness the potential of blockchain technology while mitigating its inherent risks. What might this mean for the future? Clearer Definitions: We might see more precise legal definitions for various types of digital assets (e.g., utility tokens, security tokens, payment tokens). Interoperability with TradFi: Regulations could facilitate greater integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Global Harmonization: As major economies like the U.S. establish frameworks, there could be a push for greater global harmonization of crypto regulations. The Genius Act is not just a reaction to past issues but a proactive step towards building a more stable and trustworthy digital financial system. It signals a maturation of the crypto industry, where innovation will increasingly need to coexist with robust regulatory oversight. Benefits and Challenges of the New Regulatory Landscape This regulatory shift brings both promising benefits and considerable challenges: Benefits: Enhanced Trust and Credibility: Clear rules build confidence for retail investors and attract institutional capital, legitimizing the crypto market. Reduced Systemic Risk: Full backing and audits mitigate the risk of stablecoin de-pegs causing wider market instability. Mainstream Adoption: Regulatory clarity can pave the way for stablecoins to be used more widely in everyday transactions and traditional financial services. Investor Protection: Stronger oversight protects consumers from fraudulent schemes and mismanagement of funds. Challenges: Operational Burden: Compliance with new rules, especially for auditing and reserve management, will be costly and complex for issuers. Innovation Stifling: Overly strict regulations could stifle innovation or push projects to more lenient jurisdictions. Market Shifts: Companies unable or unwilling to comply may exit the U.S. market, potentially impacting liquidity and choice. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S.-based companies might face higher compliance costs compared to international competitors in less regulated environments. What’s Next? Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For stablecoin issuers, the message is clear: adapt or face significant hurdles. Proactive engagement with regulators, strengthening reserve management practices, and investing in robust compliance frameworks will be paramount. For users, this could mean greater security and reliability when using stablecoins, but also potentially fewer options or higher transaction costs if the market consolidates. The legislative process is ongoing, with the House and Senate versions needing reconciliation. However, the intent is clear: stablecoins are moving towards a more regulated future. The industry must prepare for a landscape where transparency, accountability, and consumer protection are not just buzzwords, but legal requirements. A Future Defined by Clarity and Confidence The Genius Act marks an undeniable turning point for stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency industry. While posing an immediate and significant challenge for market leaders like Tether , it also lays the groundwork for a more mature, stable, and trustworthy digital financial system. By demanding full asset backing, rigorous audits, and U.S. registration, the legislation aims to bring much-needed clarity and confidence to a sector often criticized for its opacity. This push for robust stablecoin regulation and enhanced crypto compliance will undoubtedly shape the future of digital asset laws , ensuring that innovation can thrive within a framework of accountability and consumer protection. The journey ahead for stablecoins is one of transformation, promising a future where digital money is not just innovative, but also inherently secure and reliable.

With a criminal trial scheduled for January 2026 in the Southern District Court of New York, the stakes are incredibly high. However, a recent development suggests that the landscape of this monumental case might be on the brink of a significant shift. Reports indicate that the ‘Genius Act,’ a legislative proposal aimed at shaping stablecoin regulation , could profoundly impact the securities fraud charges leveled against Kwon. This potential interplay between a high-profile criminal case and emerging cryptocurrency legislation has the entire digital asset community buzzing with anticipation. Understanding the ‘Genius Act’: A Game-Changer for Stablecoin Regulation ? To truly grasp the potential ramifications for the Do Kwon trial , it’s essential to understand what the ‘Genius Act’ entails. This bill, still making its way through legislative channels, is designed to bring much-needed clarity and oversight to the burgeoning stablecoin market. Its provisions are comprehensive, addressing several critical areas that have been points of contention and concern for regulators globally. Licensing Requirements: The Act proposes mandatory licensing for stablecoin issuers, aiming to ensure that entities handling significant financial operations are properly vetted and authorized. 100% Reserve Backing: A cornerstone of the bill is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to secure 100% of their reserves. This addresses a key vulnerability seen in past stablecoin incidents, aiming to prevent scenarios where a stablecoin loses its peg due to insufficient backing. Annual Audit Requirements: For larger issuers, specifically those with a market capitalization of $50 billion or more, the ‘Genius Act’ mandates annual audits. This provision seeks to enhance transparency and accountability, providing greater assurance to investors and the broader financial system. Regulation on Overseas Issuers: Recognizing the global nature of the crypto market, the bill extends its regulatory reach to overseas issuers, ensuring a more level playing field and preventing regulatory arbitrage. Legal Definitions for Algorithmic Stablecoins: Crucially, the ‘Genius Act’ includes specific legal definitions and application standards for algorithmic stablecoins, such as the ill-fated TerraUSD (UST). This is particularly relevant given the circumstances surrounding the TerraUSD collapse . The very existence of such detailed definitions for algorithmic stablecoins could be a pivotal factor in how existing charges, particularly those related to securities fraud, are interpreted or even altered in a court of law. The High Stakes of the Do Kwon Trial : Charges and Extradition Do Kwon’s journey to a U.S. courtroom has been a long and winding one, marked by international intrigue and significant legal hurdles. He was apprehended in Montenegro in March 2023 on charges of passport forgery. Following his arrest, the United States pursued his extradition, culminating in him being handed over to U.S. authorities. Upon his arrival, Kwon was immediately charged with a staggering nine felonies, reflecting the gravity of the accusations against him. These charges include: Securities fraud Market manipulation Wire fraud Conspiracy to defraud Money laundering Currently held without bail, Kwon faces a formidable legal battle. The securities fraud charge, in particular, is central to the prosecution’s case, asserting that certain assets within the Terraform Labs ecosystem were unregistered securities and that Kwon misled investors about their stability and value. The scheduled trial date of January 2026 provides ample time for legal maneuvers, and the mention of the ‘Genius Act’ by Judge Paul Engelmayer during a pretrial conference highlights a new, unexpected dimension to these proceedings. How the ‘Genius Act’ Could Reshape the Do Kwon Trial The judge’s acknowledgment of the ‘Genius Act’ is not merely a passing comment; it signals a recognition of how evolving legislation can intersect with ongoing criminal cases. Inner City Press reported that Judge Engelmayer explicitly stated his mindfulness of the bill and its potential to impact Do Kwon’s securities fraud charges. But how exactly could a stablecoin bill influence a pre-existing criminal indictment? The primary impact could stem from the Act’s definitions and classifications of digital assets, especially algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUSD (UST). If the ‘Genius Act’ were to be enacted before or during the trial, its legal definitions could potentially: Reclassify Assets: The Act’s precise definitions might clarify whether TerraUSD (UST) or other tokens associated with Terraform Labs fall under the category of a security. If a new law explicitly defines certain assets in a way that contradicts the prosecution’s current classification, it could weaken their argument. Impact Intent: Legal definitions can influence the element of intent. If a defendant can argue that at the time of the alleged offenses, there was no clear legal framework classifying their assets as securities, it could complicate the prosecution’s ability to prove fraudulent intent. Set Precedent: Even if not directly applied retroactively, the legislative intent and new legal standards established by the ‘Genius Act’ could inform judicial interpretation of existing laws in the context of digital assets. This situation presents a complex challenge for both the prosecution and defense. For the prosecution, it means potentially having to adapt their arguments to a changing legal landscape. For the defense, it opens new avenues for challenging the charges, particularly those related to securities fraud, which rely heavily on the classification of the assets involved. The outcome could range from a re-evaluation of specific charges to a fundamental shift in the trial’s focus, making this one of the most intriguing crypto legal challenges to watch. Beyond TerraUSD Collapse : Broader Implications for Crypto The specter of the TerraUSD collapse in May 2022 sent shockwaves through the entire cryptocurrency market, wiping out billions in investor wealth and triggering a cascade of bankruptcies. This catastrophic event served as a stark reminder of the regulatory void in the digital asset space and significantly accelerated calls for comprehensive stablecoin regulation . The ‘Genius Act’ is a direct response to such incidents, aiming to prevent future collapses by imposing stricter controls and transparency requirements. The interaction between this legislative effort and the Do Kwon trial extends beyond just the specifics of his case. It underscores a broader trend: the increasing convergence of traditional legal frameworks with the novel complexities of cryptocurrency. This trial, influenced by potential new laws, could set critical precedents for how digital assets are classified and regulated in the future. It highlights the urgent need for regulatory clarity that balances innovation with investor protection. The crypto industry is at a pivotal juncture, grappling with the aftermath of past failures while striving for mainstream adoption. The outcome of the Do Kwon trial , particularly its interaction with legislative developments like the ‘Genius Act,’ will undoubtedly shape future regulatory approaches and influence how future crypto legal challenges are navigated. It serves as a powerful reminder that the legal and regulatory environment for digital assets is rapidly evolving, demanding constant vigilance and adaptation from all market participants. A Crucial Turning Point for Crypto Justice The upcoming Do Kwon trial is already a landmark case, but the potential influence of the ‘Genius Act’ adds an extraordinary layer of complexity and significance. Judge Engelmayer’s acknowledgment of the bill’s relevance suggests that the legal system is actively grappling with how to apply existing laws to a rapidly evolving technological landscape, especially concerning stablecoin regulation . The outcome of this interplay could redefine the legal classification of digital assets, impacting not just Do Kwon’s fate but also setting a powerful precedent for future crypto legal challenges arising from events like the TerraUSD collapse . As the crypto world watches, this case serves as a crucial barometer for the future of digital asset oversight.

This revelation, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, suggests that the U.S. government might be quietly building a significant reserve of the world’s leading digital asset. If true, this marks a pivotal moment, signaling a profound shift in how the nation views and potentially integrates cryptocurrencies into its broader financial and strategic framework. Understanding the Bitcoin Accumulation Plan: What Does it Mean? The report from Watcher Guru on X was concise yet impactful: a U.S. White House official stated that the government has an “accumulation plan” to purchase Bitcoin. This single sentence has ignited widespread speculation and discussion across financial markets and the crypto community. An “accumulation plan” typically implies a systematic and long-term strategy to acquire assets, rather than a one-off purchase. While details remain scarce and official confirmation is pending, the very notion of the U.S. government engaging in a Bitcoin accumulation plan suggests a significant departure from previous, often cautious, stances on cryptocurrencies. It raises questions about the motivations behind such a strategy and its potential implications for both national policy and the global financial landscape. Is this a move towards a strategic reserve, a hedge against economic instability, or perhaps a proactive step in the evolving digital economy? Why the US Government Bitcoin Interest? Exploring Potential Motivations The idea of the US government Bitcoin holdings might seem counterintuitive to some, given past regulatory scrutiny and skepticism. However, several compelling reasons could underpin such a strategic shift: Strategic Asset Diversification: Just as nations hold gold and foreign currencies as reserves, Bitcoin could be viewed as a modern, digital alternative for diversifying national assets, especially in an era of unprecedented fiat currency printing and inflation concerns. National Security & Seized Assets: Governments often seize cryptocurrencies from illicit activities. Instead of immediately liquidating these assets, a strategic accumulation plan could involve holding them, or even actively purchasing more, for various national interests. Maintaining Global Financial Leadership: As other nations and blocs explore digital currencies and blockchain technology, the U.S. might feel compelled to actively participate in the digital asset space to maintain its competitive edge and influence in the global financial system. Hedge Against Future Economic Shocks: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive asset for some as a hedge against inflation or geopolitical instability, potentially offering a new layer of resilience to national treasuries. The potential for the US government Bitcoin strategy reflects a growing recognition of digital assets as legitimate, and potentially vital, components of a nation’s economic and strategic arsenal. How Will This Impact Crypto Policy US? A confirmed crypto policy US shift towards Bitcoin accumulation would undoubtedly reshape the regulatory environment. For years, the focus has been on consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and taxation. An active accumulation strategy would imply a deeper, more integrated understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies at the highest levels of government. Such a policy could lead to: More Defined Regulatory Frameworks: A clear government stake in Bitcoin might accelerate the development of comprehensive and clearer regulations, providing more certainty for businesses and investors. Increased Legitimacy: Government adoption, even in an accumulation phase, would lend immense credibility to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, potentially encouraging wider institutional and retail adoption. Influence on CBDC Discussions: While the U.S. is exploring a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a Bitcoin accumulation strategy could run in parallel, showcasing a multi-pronged approach to digital finance rather than a singular focus on government-issued digital money. This potential evolution in crypto policy US could transform the nation into a more active participant in the digital asset revolution, rather than primarily a regulator. What Does This Mean for the Broader Digital Asset Strategy? If the White House is indeed planning Bitcoin accumulation, it speaks volumes about a larger, evolving digital asset strategy . This isn’t just about one cryptocurrency; it’s about acknowledging the fundamental shift towards a digitized global economy. Such a move could signify: Broader Acceptance of Digital Assets: A government holding Bitcoin could pave the way for recognizing other digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles or strategic resources. Innovation and Investment Boost: A more favorable governmental stance could attract significant capital and talent into the U.S. crypto sector, fostering innovation in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). Global Competition: As nations like China push their digital currencies and others like El Salvador embrace Bitcoin, the U.S. might be positioning itself to lead, rather than follow, in the race for digital financial supremacy. This proactive digital asset strategy could redefine the U.S.’s role in the future of finance, moving from a cautious observer to a key player in the digital economy. Analyzing the Bitcoin Market Impact: What to Expect? The mere rumor of a U.S. government Bitcoin market impact is enough to send ripples through the crypto space. Should an official confirmation emerge, the implications would be profound: Price Surge Potential: Significant, consistent buying pressure from a sovereign entity like the U.S. government could lead to substantial price appreciation for Bitcoin, given its finite supply. Increased Liquidity: While accumulation might initially reduce circulating supply, the increased institutional interest and market depth spurred by government involvement could ultimately enhance liquidity. Enhanced Legitimacy and Trust: A government endorsement through accumulation would significantly boost Bitcoin’s legitimacy, potentially attracting new classes of investors and reducing perceived risks. Shift in Narrative: Bitcoin could transition further from a speculative asset to a recognized strategic reserve asset, akin to gold, fundamentally altering its market narrative. The potential Bitcoin market impact of such a plan cannot be overstated. It would likely be one of the most significant catalysts in Bitcoin’s history, solidifying its position in the global financial architecture. Challenges and Caveats: A Closer Look While the prospect of a U.S. Bitcoin accumulation plan is exciting, it’s crucial to approach this news with a balanced perspective. Several challenges and caveats need to be considered: Unconfirmed Source: The statement originated from a report by Watcher Guru on X, citing an unnamed White House official. Official confirmation from the White House or Treasury Department is paramount before drawing definitive conclusions. Logistical Hurdles: Acquiring significant amounts of Bitcoin discreetly and securely would present considerable logistical and operational challenges for any government, given Bitcoin’s transparency and market depth. Political Divisiveness: Cryptocurrency remains a politically charged topic. Any official move to accumulate Bitcoin could face significant pushback from various political factions, potentially leading to policy reversals or delays. Security Concerns: Holding vast amounts of a digital asset like Bitcoin necessitates robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or theft, a considerable undertaking for a government entity. Until official statements are made, the news remains speculative, albeit highly impactful. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast For those invested in or interested in the crypto space, this news, whether confirmed or not, highlights several key takeaways: Stay Informed: Monitor official government announcements, reputable financial news outlets, and expert analyses closely. Understand the Macro Picture: Recognize that Bitcoin’s trajectory is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors, geopolitical strategies, and national policies, not just technological developments. Prepare for Volatility: News of this magnitude can lead to significant market fluctuations. Exercise caution and consider your risk tolerance. Long-Term Vision: Such developments underscore the growing institutional and governmental recognition of digital assets, reinforcing a long-term bullish outlook for the sector. Conclusion: A Potential Game-Changer for Bitcoin The report of a U.S. White House official indicating a Bitcoin accumulation plan is more than just a fleeting headline; it represents a potential paradigm shift in global finance and national strategy. While awaiting official confirmation, the mere discussion of such a plan elevates Bitcoin’s status from a niche digital currency to a potential strategic national asset. It signals a future where digital assets play an undeniable role in economic policy, national security, and international relations. Should this plan materialize, it would not only validate Bitcoin’s revolutionary potential but also usher in an unprecedented era of governmental engagement with the decentralized digital economy, marking a truly monumental moment for the crypto world.

Bitcoin’s rise from under a dollar to tens of thousands remains the ultimate benchmark for early-stage investing. Ethereum followed, launching under $1 before peaking near $3,000. These success stories continue to shape how investors evaluate new altcoins — and in 2025, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could follow a similar trajectory. As Ethereum and Bitcoin mature, investors are increasingly looking for the next project that could replicate that kind of asymmetric upside — and the attention is shifting to tokens with strong fundamentals but early positioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Asymmetric Opportunity of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for its rare mix of transparency, structure, and hype. With a fixed 170 billion token supply, fully audited contracts, and a VC-free, community-first model, the project is being embraced by analysts as one of the most promising altcoins of the year . Its ongoing early-stage traction is fueling bold forecasts an ROI seasoned upside by 2025. What’s more, the community has rallied behind a limited-time access bonus: PATRIOTS100X . This entry offer is pushing demand as buyers move quickly to secure a stake before the next update or listing trigger sends waves through the market. Injective Protocol Traders Are Entering Early Injective Protocol (INJ) has been one of 2025’s standout performers, particularly with the news of a potential staked ETF and rising total value locked across its ecosystem. However, seasoned Injective holders — often known for rotating capital at opportune moments — are now exploring early momentum plays. And according to on-chain data, many of them are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE. The move isn’t random. INJ traders have historically favored tokens with strong community energy paired with technical credibility. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s capped supply and live staking feature, it’s checking all the boxes for this savvy investor class. Final Thoughts: Could History Repeat? The stories of Bitcoin and Ethereum were once viewed as once-in-a-lifetime. But analysts now argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE has the same DNA — early-stage access, locked tokenomics, strong community, and a growing staking ecosystem.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Kalshi secured an astounding $185 million in Series C funding, propelling its valuation to an impressive $2 billion. This significant Kalshi Funding round, led by crypto-native venture capital giant Paradigm, with strong participation from industry heavyweights like Sequoia, Multicoin, and Bond Capital, signals a transformative moment for the prediction market landscape and broader financial technology. Kalshi Funding: A Landmark Achievement for Financial Innovation The recent Kalshi Funding announcement is more than just a financial milestone; it is a powerful endorsement of a new paradigm in how we perceive and interact with future events. Reaching a $2 billion valuation underscores investor confidence in Kalshi’s unique, regulated approach to event contracts. This substantial capital infusion positions Kalshi to significantly expand its operations, enhance its platform, and solidify its standing as a leader in the prediction market space. What makes this particular funding round so compelling is not just the sheer amount, but the caliber and diverse nature of the investors, hinting at a strategic bridge between traditional finance and the innovative spirit of the digital asset world. What is a Prediction Market and Why Kalshi Stands Out? At its core, a prediction market is an exchange where participants trade contracts whose payoffs are tied to the outcome of future events. Think of it as a stock market for information and foresight. Instead of trading shares of a company, you’re trading shares of whether a specific event will happen or not. The price of these contracts then reflects the market’s collective probability of that event occurring. While prediction markets have existed in various forms, Kalshi distinguishes itself through its regulatory compliance. Unlike many decentralized or unregulated platforms, Kalshi operates under the direct oversight of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This regulatory clarity is a game-changer, providing a level of legitimacy and security that attracts institutional investors and mainstream users who might otherwise be wary. Kalshi allows users to trade on a vast array of verifiable future events, from economic indicators and political outcomes to weather patterns and technological advancements. This unique position as a regulated entity offering event contracts is a key factor in its rapid ascent and significant valuation. The Power of Event Contracts: Redefining Risk and Opportunity Kalshi’s platform revolves around event contracts, which are binary options that pay out a fixed amount if a specific event occurs and nothing if it does not. These contracts offer a fascinating new way to engage with the future. Here’s how they redefine risk and opportunity: Information Aggregation: Event contracts serve as powerful tools for aggregating dispersed information. The market price of a contract reflects the collective wisdom of all participants, often providing more accurate forecasts than traditional polling or expert opinions. Hedging and Risk Management: Businesses and individuals can use event contracts to hedge against specific risks. For example, a company reliant on a particular commodity price might buy contracts predicting its rise or fall to offset potential losses in their primary business. Speculation and Investment: For investors, event contracts offer a novel avenue for speculation on macro-economic trends, geopolitical events, or industry-specific developments. They provide a direct way to profit from accurate foresight. Transparency and Liquidity: Operating as a regulated exchange, Kalshi ensures transparency in pricing and robust liquidity, allowing users to enter and exit positions efficiently. The applications are vast. Imagine hedging against a sudden interest rate hike, speculating on the success of a new technology, or even gaining insights into consumer sentiment regarding a product launch. Kalshi’s regulated framework opens these possibilities to a wider audience, moving prediction markets from the fringes to a more central role in financial strategy. Understanding the Series C Investment and its Strategic Implications The $185 million Series C Investment is a clear signal that top-tier investors see immense value and growth potential in Kalshi. Let’s look at the key players in this round: Investor Significance / Focus Paradigm A leading crypto-focused venture capital firm; its involvement signifies a strong bridge between traditional finance and Web3 innovation, recognizing Kalshi’s potential to disrupt established markets. Sequoia Capital A renowned, long-standing venture capital firm with a track record of investing in highly successful tech companies (e.g., Apple, Google, PayPal); lends significant mainstream credibility and strategic guidance. Multicoin Capital Another prominent crypto-native investment firm; reinforces the strategic alignment with the future of decentralized and innovative finance, and the potential for these markets to evolve. Bond Capital A growth equity firm founded by legendary analyst Mary Meeker; focuses on innovative companies with significant market potential, highlighting Kalshi’s scalability and broad appeal. The strategic implications of this Series C Investment are profound. The capital will likely be deployed to: Product Development: Expanding the types of event contracts offered and improving the user experience. Market Expansion: Reaching new user demographics and potentially exploring international markets, where regulatory landscapes allow. Regulatory Compliance: Further strengthening its robust compliance framework, which is crucial for long-term growth and institutional adoption. Talent Acquisition: Hiring top-tier engineers, market makers, and legal experts to drive innovation and maintain market leadership. This funding round is not just about money; it’s about validating a new asset class and a new way of interacting with financial markets. The Role of Crypto Venture Capital in Mainstream Finance The participation of firms like Paradigm and Multicoin Capital in a regulated, non-blockchain-native platform like Kalshi highlights a fascinating trend: the increasing influence of crypto venture capital beyond the confines of purely decentralized projects. These firms, known for their foresight in the digital asset space, are now actively investing in companies that bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and the innovative principles often found in Web3. Why would crypto venture capital firms invest in a CFTC-regulated prediction market? The answer lies in the shared ethos of transparency, efficiency, and disintermediation. While Kalshi isn’t built on a blockchain, its mission to create transparent, liquid markets for information aligns perfectly with the goals of many crypto projects. These investments suggest a growing recognition that innovation doesn’t always have to be decentralized to be transformative. Instead, it can leverage existing regulatory frameworks to achieve broader adoption and impact. This trend could lead to a future where crypto-native capital fuels a wider range of fintech innovations, fostering a more interconnected and dynamic financial ecosystem. It demonstrates a maturity in the venture capital landscape, where the best ideas, regardless of their underlying technology, attract the most strategic capital. Kalshi’s Vision: Paving the Way for Future Financial Innovation With this monumental Kalshi Funding, the company is poised to redefine how individuals and institutions approach forecasting and risk. Kalshi’s commitment to regulatory compliance sets a precedent, showing that innovative financial instruments can thrive within established legal frameworks. Their vision extends beyond simple speculation; they aim to create a global marketplace for verifiable outcomes, offering invaluable insights for businesses, policymakers, and researchers. The implications for financial markets are significant. As event contracts become more sophisticated and widely adopted, they could complement or even challenge traditional derivatives markets by offering more direct and transparent ways to trade on specific events. For data scientists and analysts, Kalshi’s markets could become a rich source of real-time, aggregated probabilities, offering a unique lens through which to view future trends. Conclusion: A New Era for Prediction Markets Kalshi’s impressive $185 million Series C Investment and its $2 billion valuation mark a pivotal moment for the prediction market industry. Led by influential crypto venture capital and traditional powerhouses, this funding round validates Kalshi’s regulated approach to event contracts and its potential to revolutionize financial forecasting. By bridging the gap between innovative financial instruments and established regulatory frameworks, Kalshi is not just building a platform; it is shaping the future of how we collectively anticipate and act upon the world’s unfolding events. This is more than just a funding round; it’s a powerful statement about the growing maturity and mainstream acceptance of prediction markets as a legitimate and valuable component of the global financial landscape. The journey ahead for this pioneering prediction market promises to be fascinating, as it continues to unlock new possibilities for information, hedging, and investment.

SoFi, a prominent personal finance company, is making a significant splash in the digital asset space, announcing not only the reintroduction of its SoFi crypto trading services but also an ambitious venture into international money transfers powered by blockchain technology. This isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about reshaping how we think about global finance. For anyone following the evolution of financial services, this move by SoFi signals a powerful convergence of traditional banking and the decentralized future. What’s Driving SoFi’s Crypto Trading Relaunch? SoFi’s decision to re-enter the crypto arena isn’t a whimsical one. It’s a calculated move reflecting a maturing regulatory environment and increasing consumer demand for digital assets. Initially, SoFi users will gain the ability to buy and hold major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). But that’s just the beginning. The company has hinted at an expanded suite of offerings, including exciting possibilities like crypto staking and even crypto-backed borrowing. Imagine using your digital assets not just as an investment, but as collateral for loans – that’s the kind of financial flexibility SoFi aims to unlock. This expansion comes at a time when more traditional financial institutions are exploring or adopting crypto. What makes SoFi’s approach compelling is its existing user base and its integrated financial platform. For many, SoFi is already their go-to for banking, loans, and investments. Adding robust crypto trading directly into this ecosystem creates a seamless experience, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for millions who might be curious about crypto but hesitant to use dedicated crypto exchanges. Revolutionizing Transfers with Blockchain Remittances Beyond simple trading, perhaps the most groundbreaking aspect of SoFi’s announcement is its foray into international remittances using stablecoins and blockchain networks. For years, sending money across borders has been a slow, expensive, and often opaque process. Traditional remittance services typically involve multiple intermediaries, leading to high fees, unfavorable exchange rates, and delays that can stretch for days. SoFi aims to disrupt this model by leveraging the inherent advantages of blockchain technology: Speed: Transactions on blockchain networks can settle in minutes or even seconds, rather than days. Cost-Efficiency: By reducing the number of intermediaries, transaction fees can be significantly lower. Transparency: Blockchain ledgers offer an immutable and verifiable record of transactions. Accessibility: Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer the stability of traditional money with the transfer benefits of crypto. Consider the impact on migrant workers sending money home, or businesses conducting international trade. Faster, cheaper, and more reliable transfers can have a profound positive effect on economies and individual livelihoods. This strategic focus on blockchain remittances positions SoFi at the forefront of financial innovation. How Will Stablecoin Transfers Work? The core of SoFi’s remittance service will rely on stablecoin transfers . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, usually by being pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This eliminates the price fluctuation risk typically associated with crypto, making them ideal for transfers and payments. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it might function: A SoFi user initiates an international transfer, specifying the amount in their local currency. SoFi converts the fiat currency into a stablecoin (e.g., USDC or USDT) on a chosen blockchain network. The stablecoin is quickly sent across the blockchain to the recipient’s designated wallet or a local partner. The recipient can then convert the stablecoin back into their local fiat currency through SoFi’s network or a partner, often with significantly lower fees and faster processing times than traditional methods. This innovative approach could redefine the landscape of global money movement, offering a powerful alternative to legacy systems. Navigating the Regulatory Tides: The Role of OCC Guidance SoFi’s confident stride back into crypto isn’t happening in a vacuum. It follows significant shifts in the regulatory landscape, particularly under the Trump administration, which saw a more open stance towards digital assets. Crucially, new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has played a pivotal role. The OCC guidance has provided much-needed clarity for federally chartered banks and savings associations, explicitly stating that they can engage in certain cryptocurrency-related activities. This includes holding stablecoin reserves, facilitating crypto transactions, and even providing custody services for digital assets. Such guidance from a key banking regulator has legitimized crypto operations for traditional financial institutions, reducing regulatory uncertainty and paving the way for players like SoFi to innovate with greater confidence. This regulatory clarity is a massive boon for the entire crypto ecosystem. It encourages more institutional participation, which in turn can lead to greater liquidity, better infrastructure, and enhanced security for users. SoFi’s move is a direct reflection of this evolving regulatory environment, demonstrating that financial innovation can thrive when clear guidelines are established. The Future is Here: Benefits and Challenges Ahead SoFi’s re-entry into crypto and its push for blockchain remittances heralds a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into everyday financial lives. The benefits are clear: Enhanced User Experience: A single platform for traditional banking, investments, and crypto. Financial Inclusion: Lower-cost remittances can empower individuals in developing nations. Innovation Catalyst: SoFi’s move could inspire other traditional finance players to accelerate their crypto adoption. Global Connectivity: Faster, cheaper international transfers foster greater economic integration. However, challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving globally, and SoFi will need to navigate diverse legal landscapes for its remittance services. Market volatility, while mitigated by stablecoins for transfers, remains a factor for direct crypto holdings. User education will also be key to ensure widespread adoption and understanding of these new financial tools. Comparison: Traditional vs. Blockchain Remittances Feature Traditional Remittances Blockchain Remittances (SoFi) Transaction Speed Typically 1-5 business days Minutes to hours Cost/Fees High, often percentage-based + hidden fees Significantly lower, transparent network fees Transparency Limited tracking, often requires inquiries Publicly verifiable on blockchain ledger Exchange Rates Often marked up, less favorable More competitive, near real-time rates Accessibility Requires bank accounts or physical agents Internet connection and digital wallet/app A Glimpse into SoFi’s Strategic Vision SoFi’s comprehensive strategy indicates a clear vision: to be a one-stop shop for all personal finance needs, bridging the gap between traditional banking and the burgeoning digital economy. By integrating SoFi crypto services and pioneering blockchain remittances, they are not just offering new products; they are building a more connected, efficient, and accessible financial future for their members. This move is a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets and the transformative power of blockchain technology. As regulatory environments continue to mature, we can expect more financial institutions to follow SoFi’s lead, further accelerating the adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance solutions globally. For consumers, this means more choices, lower costs, and greater control over their money.

Just when you thought the dust was settling on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a new contender has stepped into the ring, signaling a monumental shift in how traditional finance views cryptocurrencies. We’re talking about the recent filing by financial giants Invesco and Galaxy Digital for a Solana ETF . This move isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful indicator of Solana’s growing legitimacy and the broader mainstream adoption of digital assets. The Latest Wave: Invesco Galaxy Joins the Solana ETF Race In a significant development that has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, Invesco and Galaxy Digital have officially filed a registration statement (S-1) for the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This pivotal filing was reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart via X, confirming the increasing institutional interest in Solana (SOL). This isn’t an isolated incident; Invesco and Galaxy Digital are now the ninth issuers to apply for a Solana exchange-traded fund, highlighting a clear trend towards diversifying crypto investment vehicles beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, what exactly does an S-1 filing mean? It’s the initial registration form required by the SEC for new securities. Think of it as a formal declaration of intent, outlining the proposed ETF’s structure, objectives, risks, and fees. For investors, the emergence of a Solana ETF from reputable firms like Invesco and Galaxy Digital could simplify access to SOL, removing the complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases and storage. Why Solana? Understanding the Appeal for Digital Assets With so many cryptocurrencies available, why is Solana attracting such significant attention from institutional players? Solana has carved out a unique niche in the blockchain landscape, distinguishing itself with several key features: Blazing Fast Transactions: Solana boasts incredibly high transaction speeds, capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS), far surpassing many legacy blockchains. This speed makes it ideal for high-frequency applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming. Low Transaction Costs: Fees on the Solana network are notoriously low, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike who want to avoid the high gas fees sometimes seen on other networks. Scalability: Solana’s innovative architecture, including its Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, allows it to scale effectively without compromising decentralization or security. This scalability is crucial for supporting a burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Vibrant Ecosystem: Solana has fostered a rapidly growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and Web3 applications, attracting a diverse community of developers and users. These attributes make Solana a compelling candidate for an ETF, offering a gateway to a high-performance blockchain network that is increasingly central to the future of digital assets . Navigating the Path to SEC Approval: Challenges and Prospects The journey for any cryptocurrency ETF to gain SEC approval is often fraught with challenges, and a Solana ETF is no exception. The SEC’s primary concerns revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. While the SEC has historically been cautious, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, and more recently spot Ethereum ETFs, has set a precedent. Key factors the SEC considers include: Market Surveillance Agreements: The ability of exchanges listing the ETF to enter into surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size related to the underlying asset. Liquidity and Price Discovery: Ensuring there’s sufficient liquidity in the underlying asset’s market to prevent manipulation and ensure fair price discovery. Investor Protection: Adequacy of disclosures and safeguards for investors. For Solana, the path to approval will likely hinge on similar criteria. The growing number of applicants, including the notable Invesco Galaxy partnership, suggests increasing confidence that these regulatory hurdles can be overcome. Each new filing adds pressure and provides more data for the SEC to consider, potentially paving the way for a new era of regulated crypto investment products. Unlocking New Frontiers for Crypto Investment The potential approval of a Solana ETF could unlock significant new avenues for crypto investment . For years, investing in cryptocurrencies directly has presented various barriers for traditional investors, including: Custody Concerns: The complexities of securely storing digital assets (e.g., using hardware wallets, managing private keys). Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving and often unclear regulatory landscape for direct crypto holdings. Accessibility: The need to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges, which can be unfamiliar to traditional brokerage account holders. An ETF addresses these concerns by allowing investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements through a regulated investment vehicle traded on traditional stock exchanges. This democratizes access, potentially bringing in a wave of institutional capital and retail investors who prefer the familiar framework of an ETF. This increased accessibility could lead to higher liquidity for SOL, greater price stability, and a more robust market overall. The Broader Impact on Digital Assets and Market Dynamics The pursuit of a Solana ETF is not just about Solana; it’s a powerful testament to the maturing landscape of digital assets . The approval of such an ETF would signify a further embrace of cryptocurrencies by mainstream finance, moving them from the periphery to a more integrated position within diversified investment portfolios. It validates the underlying technology and economic models of these digital currencies. Consider the ripple effect: Increased Legitimacy: Each new regulated product adds a layer of legitimacy to the crypto space, potentially reducing skepticism and attracting more cautious investors. Diversification Opportunities: For investors, a Solana ETF offers a new tool for portfolio diversification, allowing them to gain exposure to a high-growth sector without solely relying on Bitcoin or Ethereum. Innovation Catalyst: Increased institutional interest and capital could spur further innovation within the Solana ecosystem and across the broader Web3 space, as more resources become available for development and adoption. This trend suggests a future where a broader array of digital assets could become available through regulated financial products, fundamentally altering how investors interact with this asset class. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights for Investors While the prospect of a Solana ETF is exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach it with a well-informed perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Updates: The SEC’s decision-making process is critical. Keep an eye on announcements regarding the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF and other filings. Understand the Underlying Asset: Even if you invest via an ETF, it’s vital to understand Solana’s technology, use cases, and market dynamics. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies, even through an ETF, are volatile. Ensure any investment aligns with your overall financial goals and risk appetite. Consider Diversification: An ETF can be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio, but it shouldn’t be your sole exposure to digital assets. The journey from filing to approval can be long, but the mere application by major players like Invesco and Galaxy Digital signals strong confidence in Solana’s future. A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Asset Investment The filing for a Solana ETF by Invesco and Galaxy Digital marks a pivotal moment, not just for Solana, but for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores a growing institutional appetite for digital assets and a progressive shift in how these innovative technologies are being integrated into traditional financial frameworks. As the SEC continues to deliberate on these applications, the financial world watches with anticipation, eager to see how this new wave of regulated products will shape the future of investment. This isn’t merely about adding another ticker symbol to an exchange; it’s about validating an entire asset class, opening doors for unprecedented capital inflow, and accelerating the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. The Invesco Galaxy filing is a powerful testament to Solana’s potential and a clear signal that the era of diversified crypto investment is rapidly unfolding before our eyes.

Traders observed a quick turnaround from levels below $0.72. Active wallets handling WIF jumped by 20%, and daily volume hit over $70 million. All those actions brought the Solana meme coin to within range of the $1.00 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Network Activity Shoots Up Based on reports, the Dogwifhat network saw a jump in trading volume to over $700 million in the past two days. That level of activity is rare for a token ranked 45th by market cap at about $1.75 billion. It now sits behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but outpaces fellow Solana names like FLOKI, PEPE and BONK.

Grassroots campaigns rolled out on social media channels, fueling renewed interest. That momentum helped to maintain volume levels over $70 million a day and continued to keep wallet counts rising. Support at $0.81 held firm when the rally began, giving buyers confidence. Technical Breakout Hints At More Gains Based on chart analysis, WIF broke out of a descending wedge on the 4-hour chart. That pattern formed over the past week before prices cleared the $0.83 level on higher trading volume. The Relative Strength Index sits near 60, below overbought territory, suggesting there’s still room to run. Traders now eye a move to $0.90, the next Fibonacci retracement. A push past $1.00 would be the strongest signal yet. Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities Bitcoin And Solana Link Remains Strong According to market watchers, WIF’s fate is tied to Bitcoin and the wider Solana ecosystem. Maintaining Bitcoin above $105,000 will be crucial for keeping momentum. Any pullback could force WIF back toward support at $0.77 or even the recent floor at $0.71. At the same time, new exchange listings or partnership news could stoke another leg higher. Risk Management Key For Traders According to trading guides, meme coins such as WIF bear large swings. Smart traders are encouraged to place tight stops and control position sizes. A retreat below $0.80 would be a call to exercise caution. In case support fails, prices can test the lower bands once again. But if the coin holds ground, a run at $1.00 could spark fresh buying.

With many believing Bitcoin’s major runs are now less explosive than in past cycles, capital is flowing toward tokens with asymmetrical upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the standout names in this rotation, as large wallets begin accumulating in anticipation of its market debut and growing staking ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Quiet Momentum With Clear Structure Unlike many meme-inspired projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has established a solid foundation that includes: A 170 billion hard token supply cap, limiting dilution A fully audited contract by HashEx No VC control or treasury manipulation Community-first growth and governance What’s especially compelling is the mix of humor-driven branding with institutional-level tokenomics. The project is gaining traction not just on social platforms, but also among traders known for spotting early cycles before the crowd. Additionally, a limited-time promo, PATRIOTS100X , gives new investors added incentive — adding to the urgency already building around this launch. Solana’s Momentum Faces a Saturation Point Solana continues to attract developer activity and remains a powerhouse in NFT and DePIN sectors. However, with its current market cap and recent rallies, many investors believe the room for exponential gains may be narrowing. As a result, traders who once held long positions in SOL are now diversifying into early-phase projects with faster growth velocity — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the strongest options on their radar. XRP Still Faces Legal Uncertainty While XRP’s pending settlement with the SEC could trigger a breakout, uncertainty remains. Investor confidence is cautiously optimistic, with many watching the June 16 court date closely. Still, the risk of delays or unsatisfactory outcomes has made some traders hesitant to hold too much exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, offers a clean slate — no legal baggage, no centralized treasury, and no looming institutional complications — making it attractive to those seeking lower-friction upside. SEI Traders Are Joining the Momentum SEI Network has drawn significant attention for its performance-driven architecture, but even some of its early investors are now exploring new frontiers. With MAGACOIN FINANCE offering early staking, capped supply, and rising social volume, SEI holders are beginning to diversify into what they see as one of the next big viral-capable altcoins. This cross-ecosystem movement is further fueling the project’s visibility. Final Thoughts While Solana continues to build and XRP navigates its legal crossroads, investors from Bitcoin and SEI communities are quietly pivoting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. With smart contract credibility, early staking, and favorable tokenomics, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about early altcoins. If momentum continues, this project could easily become a leader in the next crypto wave.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has just made a groundbreaking move, filing a 19b-4 application for the first-ever NFT ETF directly linked to the iconic Pudgy Penguins collection and its associated PENGU token. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a monumental step that could redefine how we approach crypto investment and bring the vibrant world of non-fungible tokens into the mainstream financial arena. What Does CBOE’s Bold Move Mean for Cryptocurrency ETFs? For those closely watching the evolution of digital finance, the name CBOE carries significant weight. As one of the largest exchange operators globally, CBOE’s involvement lends immense credibility to any financial product it backs. Their filing of a 19b-4 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the crucial first step towards launching an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Essentially, this application is a proposal to change exchange rules to allow the listing and trading of a new product. We’ve seen the impact of Cryptocurrency ETFs with the recent approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which opened the floodgates for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrencies. An NFT ETF takes this concept a step further, applying it to a unique, often illiquid, and highly speculative asset class. This move by CBOE signals a growing comfort and demand from traditional finance for diversified exposure to the crypto ecosystem, moving beyond just foundational cryptocurrencies. Think about it: owning a physical NFT can be complex, involving digital wallets, understanding blockchain networks, and navigating marketplaces. An ETF simplifies this immensely, allowing investors to gain exposure through a regulated, familiar vehicle traded on a traditional stock exchange. This could be a game-changer for accessibility. Unpacking the Appeal of Pudgy Penguins and Digital Asset Investment So, why Pudgy Penguins ? Among the myriad of NFT collections, Pudgy Penguins has emerged as a blue-chip project, renowned for its strong community, distinctive artwork, and successful brand expansion. Launched in 2021, these charming, cartoonish penguin avatars quickly gained popularity, evolving into a lifestyle brand with physical toys, merchandise, and a significant presence in Web3 culture. Their success story is a testament to the power of community and intellectual property in the digital realm. The proposed ETF’s link to Pudgy Penguins NFTs and the PENGU token is particularly interesting. While the exact structure of how the ETF will track these assets is yet to be fully detailed, it likely aims to provide diversified exposure to the collection’s value and perhaps the broader ecosystem built around it. This represents a significant leap in Digital asset investment , moving from direct ownership of individual NFTs to a more aggregated, diversified investment product. For many, the idea of investing in NFTs still feels abstract or too risky. An ETF, however, could democratize access, allowing investors to participate in the potential growth of high-value NFT collections without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or the high entry price of individual rare NFTs. It’s about bridging the gap between niche digital collectibles and mainstream financial portfolios. How Will This NFT ETF Transform Crypto Investment? The potential approval of an NFT ETF could have profound implications for crypto investment . Here are a few key benefits and transformations we might see: Increased Accessibility: Millions of investors who currently shy away from direct crypto or NFT ownership due to perceived complexity or regulatory uncertainty could now gain exposure through their existing brokerage accounts. This dramatically broadens the investor base. Diversification within Digital Assets: An ETF could offer a diversified basket of NFTs, mitigating the risk associated with investing in a single, highly volatile collection. While this specific filing targets Pudgy Penguins, its success could pave the way for ETFs tracking broader NFT indices. Regulatory Clarity and Legitimacy: SEC approval, if granted, would bestow a significant level of legitimacy upon NFTs as an investable asset class. This could encourage more institutional participation and foster greater trust in the digital asset market. Price Discovery and Liquidity: A publicly traded ETF could improve price discovery for the underlying NFTs by creating a new, regulated avenue for valuation and trading. It might also indirectly enhance liquidity for the NFT market by increasing overall demand and interest. Mainstream Adoption: The mere existence of an NFT ETF on a major exchange like CBOE would push NFTs further into the public consciousness, normalizing them as a legitimate component of the financial landscape. This development mirrors the trajectory of Bitcoin ETFs, which, once approved, led to significant capital inflows and increased market maturity. While NFTs present unique challenges, the precedent set by crypto ETFs suggests a similar positive trajectory for institutional adoption and investor confidence. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges for the First NFT ETF While the prospect of an NFT ETF is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant hurdles it faces. The SEC has historically been cautious with novel financial products, especially those tied to highly volatile and less-regulated markets. Here are some of the challenges: Valuation Complexity: Unlike traditional stocks or even cryptocurrencies with relatively straightforward market prices, NFTs are unique and often illiquid. Valuing an entire collection like Pudgy Penguins, let alone individual pieces within it, for daily ETF pricing is a complex task. How will the ETF’s net asset value (NAV) be accurately determined and updated in real-time? Custody and Security: Securing high-value NFTs is paramount. The ETF would need robust, secure custody solutions to protect the underlying digital assets from hacks, theft, or loss. This is a specialized area that traditional custodians are still adapting to. Market Volatility and Liquidity: The NFT market is notoriously volatile and can experience rapid price swings. Furthermore, many NFTs are illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily bought or sold without significantly impacting their price. An ETF needs sufficient liquidity in its underlying assets to manage creations and redemptions effectively. Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously scrutinize the application for investor protection, market manipulation concerns, and the overall structure. The lack of a clear regulatory framework specifically for NFTs adds an extra layer of complexity. Intellectual Property Rights: The ownership and usage rights associated with NFTs are still evolving. An ETF would need clear legal frameworks to ensure it can manage and utilize the underlying IP effectively, especially if the fund aims to generate revenue beyond just price appreciation. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they require innovative solutions and clear communication with regulators. The approval process could be lengthy, and the final product might look different from initial expectations. The Future Landscape of Digital Assets and Beyond If approved, this pioneering NFT ETF could usher in a new era for Digital asset investment . Its success might pave the way for similar funds tracking other blue-chip NFT collections, or even broader NFT market indices. Imagine an ETF that offers exposure to the entire metaverse economy, or funds focused on tokenized real estate, art, or music rights. The possibilities are vast. This move also underscores a broader trend: the convergence of traditional finance and Web3. As blockchain technology matures, we can expect more innovative financial products that bridge these two worlds, making complex digital assets accessible to a wider audience. The future of investment is increasingly digital, and initiatives like CBOE’s NFT ETF are crucial steps in that evolution. It’s not just about investing in JPEGs; it’s about recognizing the underlying technology and the cultural shift that NFTs represent. They are a new form of digital ownership, community building, and brand engagement. An ETF would acknowledge this value proposition within a regulated financial product. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Investors The CBOE’s filing for an NFT ETF tied to Pudgy Penguins is more than just a news item; it’s a landmark event that signifies the maturation of the digital asset space. While the road to approval may be long and fraught with regulatory challenges, this bold step by a major exchange like CBOE signals an undeniable shift towards mainstream acceptance of NFTs as a legitimate investment class. It promises to unlock new avenues for crypto investment , offering unprecedented accessibility and potentially reshaping the landscape of digital asset investment for years to come. Keep a close eye on this development; it could very well be the beginning of a revolutionary chapter in finance.

With increasing AI adoption, Micron, a producer of hardware essential to AI development, is experiencing a surge in demand. Micron raises Q4 predictions Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S.-based manufacturer of computer memory chips, has raised its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue prediction up to $11B. This change was brought on by the surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The new figure significantly exceeded Wall Street’s initial expectations and sent Micron shares climbing in after-hours trading. The Idaho-based company announced on Wednesday that it expects its fourth-quarter revenue to range between $10.4B and $11B. These figures are well above the average analyst estimate of $9.89, according to data compiled by Bloomberg . Investors responded positively to the prediction, and Micron shares gained over 6% in extended trading. This year, the company’s stock has surged by 51% so far, outperforming many peers in the semiconductor sector. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, are projected to come in at around $2.50, which is also more than the estimated $2.03. This increase is due to Micron experiencing growing demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, which are integral to training and operating large-scale AI models. AI demand boosts Micron’s optimism Micron’s latest earnings guidance shows just how important memory technology has become to AI infrastructure and innovation. Companies like cloud providers or chipmakers that build AI systems are relying on more advanced memory components to support the heavy processing requirements of modern AI workloads. Micron’s high-bandwidth memory is used in data centers and servers that run machine learning and generative AI applications. These applications, such as those powering AI chatbots or image generators, require fast data access and vast storage capacity. Micron previously faced tighter profit margins due to an oversupply in some memory segments and weakened demand for consumer electronics, but the shift toward AI has helped the company bounce back from recent struggles. “The growing complexity of AI models requires more advanced memory solutions, and we’re seeing strong interest in our HBM products,” Micron said in its earnings statement Wednesday. Wall Street analysts have stated that Micron is in a strategic position in the current AI industry and has the ability to monetize the growing demand for specialized memory. Although overall PC and smartphone markets remain relatively stagnant, Micron’s diversification into AI, cloud, and data center customers has helped offset these weaknesses. Analysts expect that trajectory to continue as AI development accelerates globally. Micron’s leadership suggested that the interest in AI adoption will likely persist through 2025. However, the company remains cautious about broader macroeconomic risks, including fluctuations in consumer tech spending and potential supply chain disruptions.

Known previously for its robust Bitcoin operations , the company is now setting its sights firmly on the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, aiming to become a dominant force in Ethereum staking and an integral ETH reserve company. This bold move signals not just a change for Bit Digital but potentially a broader trend within the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The Strategic Pivot: Why Bit Digital is Embracing Ethereum Staking The core of Bit Digital’s audacious new direction lies in its commitment to Ethereum staking . This strategic pivot underscores a profound belief in Ethereum’s future, particularly its post-Merge Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. For Bit Digital, embracing Ethereum staking offers several compelling advantages over traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) Bitcoin operations . Yield Generation: Unlike energy-intensive mining, staking involves locking up ETH to support the network’s security and validate transactions, earning consistent rewards (yield) in the process. This can provide a more predictable revenue stream. Environmental Sustainability: Ethereum’s shift to PoS dramatically reduced its energy consumption, aligning with increasing global demands for more sustainable blockchain solutions. This move positions Bit Digital as a more environmentally conscious player in the crypto space. Reduced Operational Overhead: Staking requires significantly less specialized hardware and energy compared to Bitcoin mining, potentially leading to lower capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational costs. Network Participation: By staking ETH, Bit Digital actively participates in securing and decentralizing the Ethereum network, contributing to the ecosystem’s health and future development. Bit Digital has been quietly building its Ethereum presence since 2022, stockpiling and staking ETH. As of the end of March, their foresight is evident in their substantial holdings of 24,434.2 ETH, alongside 417.6 BTC. The company’s future plans include converting its existing Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum, further solidifying its commitment to this new path. Scaling Back Bitcoin Operations: A Changing Landscape for Bitcoin Mining The decision by Bit Digital to scale back its Bitcoin operations is not made lightly and reflects a broader industry re-evaluation. The landscape of Bitcoin mining has evolved significantly, presenting increasing challenges that make a pivot strategically sound for companies like Bit Digital. Traditional Bitcoin mining, while foundational to the crypto industry, is characterized by: High Capital Expenditure: The constant need to upgrade to the latest, most powerful Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners requires significant upfront investment. Intense Energy Consumption: Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism is inherently energy-intensive, leading to high electricity costs and environmental scrutiny. Increasing Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining new blocks increases, making it harder to earn rewards without proportional increases in hash power. Halving Events: Every four years, the reward for mining a Bitcoin block is halved, putting pressure on miners to maintain profitability through efficiency or scale. By divesting from its energy-intensive Bitcoin mining infrastructure, Bit Digital can reallocate resources towards more capital-efficient and potentially more profitable ventures like Ethereum staking . This move highlights a pragmatic approach to navigating the volatile and competitive crypto mining sector. Building a Robust ETH Reserve: A Foundation for Future Growth Beyond just staking, Bit Digital’s ambition to become a significant ETH reserve company speaks volumes about its long-term vision for stability and growth within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Holding a substantial reserve of Ethereum serves multiple strategic purposes: Strategic Asset: Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s the backbone of a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. A large ETH reserve positions Bit Digital to potentially participate in or leverage these growing sectors. Liquidity and Flexibility: A healthy ETH reserve provides the company with significant liquidity, allowing it to respond to market opportunities or navigate potential downturns. Confidence in Ethereum’s Future: Amassing a large ETH reserve demonstrates a strong belief in Ethereum’s continued dominance and potential for price appreciation, reflecting a long-term investment strategy. The company’s plan to convert its existing BTC holdings to ETH further emphasizes its conviction in Ethereum as a foundational digital asset for its future operations and balance sheet. This move creates a more streamlined and focused asset base, reducing exposure to the complexities of managing two distinct mining operations. Implications for the Crypto Mining Shift: What Does This Mean for the Industry? Could Bit Digital ‘s bold move herald a wider crypto mining shift ? This strategic pivot by a Nasdaq-listed firm could serve as a significant precedent for other publicly traded mining companies, signaling a potential broader industry trend towards more sustainable and yield-generating crypto activities. The crypto industry is constantly evolving, and companies that adapt quickly to technological advancements, market demands, and environmental concerns are often the ones that thrive. Bit Digital’s shift highlights: Maturation of the Industry: The focus is moving beyond just raw computational power to more sophisticated financial strategies and participation in network governance. Environmental Pressure: As ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors become more critical for investors, companies are seeking greener alternatives to traditional PoW mining. Diversification of Revenue Streams: Relying solely on mining rewards can be precarious. Staking offers a different, potentially more stable, source of income. While Bitcoin mining will undoubtedly continue to be a vital part of the crypto ecosystem, Bit Digital’s decision underscores a growing recognition of Ethereum’s post-Merge potential and the strategic advantages of staking as a core business model. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts Bit Digital’s strategic shift offers several key takeaways: Observe Industry Trends: Keep an eye on other mining companies. Will they follow Bit Digital’s lead in a similar crypto mining shift ? Understand Staking Rewards: For those interested in passive income from crypto, Ethereum staking presents an attractive option. Research reputable staking services or consider solo staking if you have sufficient ETH. Evaluate Company Strategies: When looking at crypto-related stocks, consider companies that are adapting to market changes and exploring diverse revenue streams beyond just mining. Bit Digital’s proactive approach to building an ETH reserve and focusing on staking could be a model for future success. Long-Term Ethereum Outlook: This move reinforces institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and its role as a programmable blockchain for the future of finance and decentralized applications. A Bold Leap into Ethereum’s Future Bit Digital ‘s strategic reorientation from primary Bitcoin operations to a dedicated Ethereum staking and ETH reserve company marks a significant moment in the digital asset space. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency industry and the willingness of forward-thinking companies to adapt and innovate. By embracing the efficiencies and opportunities presented by Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake mechanism, Bit Digital is not just changing its business model; it’s potentially setting a new standard for sustainability and profitability in the evolving world of crypto. This bold leap positions Bit Digital at the forefront of a new era, demonstrating confidence in Ethereum’s pivotal role in the future of decentralized finance and beyond.

46789960,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=755517,1750900262,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46789960.jpeg,Meta’s transformative use defense tips scales in its favor in AI copyright legal battle,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-scores-legal-win-in-ai-copyright-fight/,"A federal court on Wednesday ruled that Meta Platforms Inc.’s use of millions of copyrighted books, academic papers, and comics to train its Llama artificial intelligence models falls under “fair use”. This marks a significant legal win for tech companies developing generative AI. The lawsuit, filed by a group of writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates and Richard Kadrey, accused the $1.4 trillion social media and AI giant of illicitly using a huge web content catalog without permission. These works were obtained through archives such as LibGen — a shadow library that hosts content without granting publisher rights. However, US District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco sided with Meta, concluding that the authors failed to make the right legal arguments to support their claims. “This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,” Chhabria clarified in his decision. “It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.” Meta’s transformative use defense tips scales in its favor Meta argued that its AI model training was a transformative use — a key tenet of fair use under US copyright law — and that how it acquired the data was irrelevant. The court agreed that the transformative nature of the technology and the plaintiffs’ lack of compelling counterarguments tipped the scales in Meta’s favor. This decision arrives just days after another high-profile win for an AI company: Anthropic, the maker of the Claude language models, secured a favorable ruling after demonstrating that it had trained its models on legally acquired physical books . A federal judge in San Francisco said Anthropic made “fair use” of books by the writers Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson to train its Claude large language model (LLM). Judge William Alsup compared the Anthropic model’s use of books to a “reader aspiring to be a writer” who uses works “not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them” but to “turn a hard corner and create something different”. Alsup added, however, that Anthropic’s copying and storage of more than 7 million pirated books in a central library infringed the authors’ copyrights and was not fair use, although the company later bought “millions” of print books as well. The judge ordered a December trial to determine how much Anthropic owes for the infringement. Alsup noted that the fact that Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it had stolen off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft. Still, it may affect the extent of statutory damages. US copyright law says that wilful copyright infringement can result in damages of up to $150,000 (£110,000) per work. The copyright debate has sparked growing tensions between AI companies and the creative industries, as generative AI models — which power tools like ChatGPT — rely on massive datasets to learn and produce responses. Much of that training data includes copyright-protected material, raising concerns among authors, publishers, and artists over unauthorized use. Ruling signals a turning point in AI copyright battles While the Meta case has been hailed as a victory for Big Tech, Judge Chhabria hinted at what could be more persuasive legal avenues in future cases. He noted that a stronger argument would focus on market dilution — the threat posed to authors by AI-generated content that can saturate markets with machine-created books, music, and art. “People can prompt generative AI models to produce these outputs using a tiny fraction of the time and creativity that would otherwise be required,” he warned. “This could dramatically undermine the incentive for human beings to create things the old-fashioned way.” Meta and legal counsel for the plaintiffs have not yet commented on the ruling. The decision will likely influence the many ongoing lawsuits created by creators against AI firms, as the legal system continues grappling with how copyright law applies in the era of artificial intelligence.

The license allows the firm to offer fully regulated digital asset services across the European Economic Area (EEA). The approval is a major milestone for Kraken, which seeks to ramp up its European presence. The license will enable Kraken to offer services in all 30 EEA member states. MiCA began operating in 2024 and is viewed as the most extensive crypto regulation worldwide. It establishes clear rules for asset issuance, trading platforms, stablecoin issuers, and custodial services. The license allows the crypto exchange to work in a new jurisdiction; more importantly, it is a concrete step toward compliance and long-term success. Kraken intensifies focus on the EU market The MiCA license is on top of Kraken’s robust regulatory footing in Europe. It has had an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license since March 2025 and received a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license in February 2025. These licenses support significant growth opportunities across retail, professional, and institutional client segments, including spot trading, derivatives, and payments. On top of that, the firm is also VASP-registered in multiple EU nations (Ireland, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain). These registrations demonstrate Kraken’s serious commitment to operating in a fully regulated capacity around the country, as is already the case in most states. Kraken has had a strong European presence since 2013. Today, Kraken is one of the most liquid and trustworthy euro markets for trading cryptocurrency. The MiCA license will allow Kraken’s subsidiary Fractal to provide retailers and institutions with a range of crypto services, including spot trading, derivatives, and payments, across a harmonized, continent-wide regime of regulations. “Securing a license from the Central Bank of Ireland, with its long heritage and experience as a rigorous financial regulator, isn’t just about compliance. It’s a powerful signal of Kraken’s commitment to expanding the crypto ecosystem through responsible innovation,” said Arjun Sethi, co-CEO of Kraken. Kraken isn’t the only one that has decided to capitalize on MiCA’s harmonized regulatory framework. Tier one exchanges like Coinbase, OKX, Crypto.com, and Bybit have already applied for or obtained MiCA licenses in the country ahead of the framework going into full effect in 2025. Gemini, the U.S. exchange run by the Winklevoss brothers, is believed to be on the verge of receiving approval via Malta’s regulations, one of the jurisdiction’s best-known stepping stones for fintech licensing. U.S. falls behind on MiCA crypto regulations Kraken’s MiCA win arrives a few days after the exchange moved its home office to Wyoming, a U.S. state that has earned a reputation for crypto-friendly legislation. The move is partly a nod to Wyoming’s friendly stance toward blockchain and a signal that the crypto exchange is hedging its bets on more than one jurisdiction to facilitate its overseas growth. However, the larger regulatory climate in the United States is hazy. Members of Congress are still going back and forth on the specifics of federal digital asset regulations that address markets, stablecoins, and market structure frameworks in standalone bills. Although some states have been friendly to the industry, federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission have been more aggressive. While the U.S. struggles with regulating crypto, Kraken’s MiCA approval could lend it an edge against global competition. It underscores Europe’s leadership in regulating crypto and how much clarity of oversight matters for the future of digital finance.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the Thursday trading day, BTC is changing hands above $107K, according to CoinDesk Market data , and the CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the largest digital assets, is trading just shy of 3000, up 0.7%. Looking back at the week that was, analysts and market observers are looking at what began as a selloff on Middle East tensions, with Israel and Iran trading rocket fire, and a U.S. bombing campaign on Iran's nuclear facilities, turned into a textbook risk-on rally, one that’s lifting crypto, tech stocks, and broader market sentiment alike. “War drums fade, risk appetite roars,” wrote QCP Capital in its June 25 market note, capturing the sudden mood swing after days of escalating headlines. “Traders appeared to have priced in a resolution or simply stopped waiting for one. Instead of flight-to-safety, the move was risk-on in full force.” That shift was visible across asset classes. U.S. equities surged, oil prices retraced to pre-conflict levels, and Coinbase stock jumped 12% on regulatory news. For BTC, the rebound above $107K signals not just relief but renewed momentum, even as investors keep one eye on the macro calendar and the other on global flashpoints. “It’s been a week of sharp swings in crypto,” said Gracie Lin, CEO of OKX Singapore. “Bitcoin dipped below $100,000 earlier in the week when Middle East tensions rattled the markets, but rebounded quickly after news of a ceasefire – now trading just below its all-time high in a sharp reversal.” Lin points to a slew of U.S. economic data, including GDP and unemployment claims, coming later this week as the next catalyst for BTC's movement. “Recent PMI numbers have held steady, but continued weakness in housing is raising questions about the broader economy,” she said. “If Thursday’s GDP or unemployment claims come in weaker than expected, bitcoin could benefit as investors look for hedges against traditional market weakness.” Add to that the quarterly expiration of bitcoin futures and options on June 27, and volatility could return in force. “Another bout of volatility is expected,” Lin said. QCP, meanwhile, is looking beyond the week’s swings, spotlighting the structural forces driving bitcoin’s evolution into a macro asset. From ProCap’s $386 million BTC buy to Coinbase’s regulatory win under MiCA, institutional momentum continues to build. “If this accumulation trend persists,” QCP wrote, “bitcoin may not just rival gold as a macro hedge but potentially in total market capitalisation.” Still, QCP adds a note of caution: “Geopolitics remains an ever-present undercurrent.” While markets have largely shrugged off renewed Israeli strikes, concerns are mounting over NATO–Russia tensions. With Western nations boosting defense budgets and Trump set to attend the NATO summit, the next geopolitical shock may not come from the Middle East. For now, bitcoin is riding the wave of risk-on enthusiasm. But beneath the surface, the battle between volatility and conviction, war drums and buying sprees, continues to define the market. Korean Crypto Investors Favor Community Over Capital, Analyst Explains For overseas crypto projects, getting listed on a Korean exchange like Upbit or Bithumb is seen as a golden ticket, an instant liquidity injection, and a validation milestone. But that mindset might be part of the problem, Bradley Park, an analyst with Seoul-based DNTV Research, explained in a recent interview with CoinDesk. At Korea Blockchain Week last year, Park kept hearing the same question from foreign teams: “ How do we get listed on a Korean exchange?” Korean exchanges have deep liquidity pools, and traders in the country are known for their euphoric rallies. “Honestly, many of them are approaching it the wrong way,” Park told CoinDesk. “Instead of starting with listing applications, maybe the better question is: How can we genuinely connect with the Korean community?” Park’s thesis is simple: in Korea’s Web3 market, community isn’t a checkbox. It’s the core. Listings are often a result, not a goal, and the key signal for exchanges is genuine grassroots activity. Take NEWT, for instance . In the lead-up to its token generation event, Korean degens lit up platforms like Kaito with homegrown content, discussions, and speculation. “This grassroots excitement translated directly into momentum,” said Park. “Both Upbit and Bithumb listed NEWT on the same day . That wasn’t a coincidence. It was the result of weeks of organic community buildup.” But Park cautions against seeing NEWT as a flawless blueprint. “It’s not a perfect model, but it does show how even a basic level of respect toward the Korean community can translate into visible outcomes,” he said. “That said, the subsequent price drop and fading short-term excitement left the project with another challenge: keeping the spark alive is just as difficult as igniting it in the first place.” Another example: Edward Park, a well-known Korean influencer and early Pudgy Penguins holder, posted about NEWT in Korean, garnering over 50,000 views. While that might not seem like a lot, it's the quality of the engagement that matters, argues Bradley Park. He attributes the single post to catalyzing a wave of engagement with other key stakeholders in Korea's crypto sphere because of Edward Park's trust. Projects that treat Korean users like exit liquidity rather than stakeholders tend to be punished. Park points to the case of ZORA , where Korean users showed strong early participation but soured on the project after a perceived unfair airdrop. “Interest in future Base ecosystem projects declined. They failed to go viral in Korea because users felt they weren’t valued.” Localization matters too, especially the language. Park contrasts two projects: COOKIE , which suffered from poorly translated, low-quality content created by outsiders, and KAITO , which invested in Korean-speaking staff and dedicated native-language campaigns and subsequently pumped after its Upbit listing. The lesson? If your go-to-market strategy starts with “get listed, dump tokens,” don’t expect Korean users to play along. “Even if your goal is to exit through a Korean exchange,” Park said, “then at the very least, respect the Korean users, encourage their participation, and acknowledge their contributions.” Token listings driven by the community are possible, but they’re fragile. “A listing strategy focused purely on short-term liquidity will always have its limits,” Park said. “Without a plan to build lasting trust, even the most explosive momentum will eventually burn out.” Because in Korea, authenticity isn’t a vibe. It’s the price of admission. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin rose 1.46% to $107,600 as a ceasefire and $514M in institutional buying fueled a rebound from sub-$100K, with strong support at $107K and the CD20 index up 1.4%. ETH: Ethereum rose 1.42% to $2,425.53, rebounding from recent lows as a Middle East ceasefire and continued whale accumulation boosted market sentiment and helped defend key $2,400 support, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Gold: Gold edged up to $3,340.90 and silver to $35.79 as markets digested the Israel-Iran ceasefire and lingering global tensions, with Trade Nation’s David Morrison warning that unresolved U.S.-China trade issues still pose risks. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday as investors weighed the Israel-Iran ceasefire, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.4%. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were flat Wednesday with the S&P 500 near record highs, but analysts warned that geopolitics or black swan events could halt the rally.

The 33-year-old three-term Assemblymember and democratic socialist plans to raise taxes on high earners, slap levies on trades and dividends, and tighten rules that investors say keep their deals fast. Veteran hedge fund founder Philippe Laffont warned live on Squawk Box that the result could start another rush of wealthy residents toward low-tax Florida and Texas. “Some people are going to, for sure, go,” Philippe said after former governor Andrew Cuomo conceded, adding that Cuomo might still run as an independent. Since the pandemic, many firms and crypto whales already relocated; with President Donald Trump back in the White House, the trek south could speed up. Investors warn of flight Zohran’s proposals land opposite Wall Street’s wish list. He supports a state wealth tax and higher marginal rates, ideas that persuade Pershing Square boss Bill Ackman to call himself “a bit depressed” while he scouts a fresh candidate. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers posted that he felt “profoundly alarmed” by the nomination because the candidate “advocated Trotskyite economic policies” and refused to reject the “globalize the intifada” slogan. Stocks mirrored the mood. Shares in New York-focused lender Flagstar fell nearly four percent, while office landlords SL Green Realty slipped more than six percent and Vornado Realty Trust tumbled almost seven percent on the day Zohran celebrated. Market desks blamed fear of upcoming revenue hits if City Hall freezes rent hikes and demands bigger checks from business profits. Markets price in rent control moves Universal rent control sits at the heart of Zohran’s housing pitch. The mayor appoints members to the board that governs rent-regulated apartments, and roughly one million units stand to see a pause on increases if his allies take those seats. Only about twenty thousand apartments remain under the older, stricter rent-control rules, yet landlords fear the broader cap could crush cash flow. Macro analyst Jim Bianco called the trajectory “suicide by mayor” in a late-night X post. Partnership for New York City president Kathryn Wylde told CNBC that “terror is the feeling” across corporate suites, though she still hopes Governor Kathy Hochul can steer the city away from disaster by blocking fresh taxes. Up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, precinct tallies show more than seventy percent of voters backed Cuomo, highlighting the rift between capital and ballot boxes. Wall Street has seen this script before. In 2013, Bill de Blasio’s victory sounded similar alarms, but face-to-face talks cooled tempers before policies rolled out. Philippe believes New York’s resilience may repeat that history, saying, “We had Mayor DeBlasio for eight years. New York is really strong. I’m hopeful the same will happen.” Business desks, crypto chat rooms, and traders on every exchange will find out soon enough whether Zohran delivers the jolt or the calm. Either way, tax accountants are bracing now. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The Treasury labeled the firms as “primary money laundering concerns ,” a designation that enables it to impose strict restrictions on their access to the US financial system. The sanctions mark the first time the Treasury’s financial crimes unit has exercised new powers granted under recently enacted anti-fentanyl legislation. The move comes amid a broader crackdown on opioid trafficking, as former President Donald Trump intensifies his campaign focus on combating the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. Alvaro Vértiz asserts that the US will stop at nothing to stop fentanyl trafficking The three companies, according to the Treasury, had played a long-standing and central role in laundering millions of dollars for Mexican cartels and facilitating payments to secure precursor chemicals for the production of fentanyl. Concerning this, Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender highlighted that they have taken steps to stop the financial institutions based in Mexico from working with US financial institutions. The sanctions were the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s first actions to be carried out under the FEND Off Fentanyl Act. The bill was signed into law last year and provides the agency with new authorities to go after opioid smuggling. Fentanyl, a cheap synthetic painkiller, has driven the opioid epidemic in the United States over the last decade and is the most common cause of overdose deaths. The news comes as Trump has been ramping up a US assault on drug trafficking from Mexico in a challenge to left-wing President Claudia Sheinbaum. The founder of Vector Casa de Bolsa is Alfonso Romo, who for two years managed the office of Sheinbaum’s mentor and predecessor, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Meanwhile, there are no allegations of wrongdoing on Romo’s part or that of the former president. Alvaro Vértiz, who leads Latin America at the Washington-based advisory firm DGA Group, commented on the topic of discussion. According to Vértiz, this seriously damages the trust in the Mexican financial system. He also mentioned that the US is ready to do anything necessary to fight fentanyl trafficking, and there will be no exceptions. Mexico’s financial firms vow to adhere to oversight regulations strictly All three institutions — two banks and a brokerage — are small but prominent players in Mexico’s financial sector , which manage $7 billion, $4 billion, and $11 billion, respectively. Following the Treasury’s claims, CIBanco and Intercam conducted business with or offered services to the now-dominant Jalisco New Generation cartel. For Vector, it assisted a Sinaloa cartel mule to launder US dollars 2 million from the US to Mexico. Several senior industry executives have reacted to the news. According to them, this will force Mexico’s financial institutions to strictly adhere to “know your customer” and anti-money laundering oversight. It is worth noting that Sheinbaum has won some praise from US officials for prioritizing greater co-operation on security, with her security minister increasing arrests, seizures, and extraditions. Despite this, in response to this news, Mexico’s finance ministry said it had not been provided proof of the accusations. The ministry stated that if they received clear evidence showing illegal actions by these three financial institutions, they would take strong legal action. However, at that moment, they did not have any such information. The wider US-Mexico relationship has been rocky as Trump imposed a 25% tariff on a broader range of goods, and the administration has raised the possibility of unilateral military action against drug cartels. Trump issued an executive order designating six cartels as terrorist organisations in his first weeks in office, and he sent a former Army Green Beret to be his ambassador in Mexico City. CIBanco and Intercam did not respond to requests for comment. In the statement, Vector said it categorically denies any claim against its integrity, and that the transactions were with legitimate companies.

Trading at just $0.03, MUTM has emerged as a standout among new utility coins, driven by rapid presale growth and strong investor appetite for fundamentally-backed altcoins amid broader market volatility. At present, Mutuum Finance has sold out over 40% of phase 5 of its presale. The project has already received more than 11.1 million and has drawn close to 12,400 investors. What’s drawing attention is more than price, Mutuum’s dual lending protocol, dynamic interest structure, and buyback-driven tokenomics have it poised as a serious coin in the next crypto. As capital rotates into presale-phase projects and investors seek what crypto to invest in before June ends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will hit $1.50 soon after launch, especially as Shiba Inu and other majors enter short-term consolidation zones. Mutuum Finance Reinventing DeFi Lending, a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance is set to establish a new standard in decentralized finance and introduce the next-generation lending protocol to offer the best of both worlds, combining the Profits of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Within the P2C system, lending pool and interest rate auto-update to reflect the current market trends through the intervention of automated smart contracts. This will offer a stable and predictable set of returns to lenders and consistent set of terms to borrowers, which is sorely lacking in DeFi lending. The P2P model, on the contrary, eliminates middlemen, which enables borrowers and lenders to access each other. The model is particularly beneficial in handling highly volatile assets and it gives its users more flexibility, control and risk management that suits their needs. Combining two effective solutions, Mutuum Finance offers an incomparable balance of efficiency, decentralization, and flexibility and will become a leader of the DeFi market in the future. Presale Phase 5 Accelerates Mutuum Finance presale is currently at Phase 5 and the momentum is gaining pace rapidly. Having over 12,400 investors who have joined already, and with almost 11.1 million already raised, the project is demonstrating that it is not just another DeFi experiment. Smart investors can’t miss a chance to purchase Mutuum Finance tokens with a price of just $0.03, which are set to increase and be $0.06 at launch, leading to a 2x yield on investments in the early phase. Mutuum Finance is designing an Ethereum-based fully collateralized USD stablecoin to complement its ecosystem even more. The asset is stable in volatile markets unlike algorithmic stablecoins that are vulnerable to depegging in volatile markets environments; therefore, making it a stable medium of exchange and store value institutionally and retail-wise. Over $11.1 million raised and a fast-growing base of 12,400+ investors signal that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is no longer flying under the radar. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) eyes modest gains, Mutuum Finance is gunning for a potential breakout to $1.50, powered by a fundamentally strong DeFi use case, CertiK-audited smart contracts, and an innovative dual lending model. Currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, early investors are positioned for a 2x return at launch, with much higher upside projected as broader market momentum returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a high-conviction altcoin for early movers this cycle.

Investors Closely Watch Aptos,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-fueled-by-ethereum-and-bitcoin-momentum-investors-closely-watch-aptos/,"Ethereum Is Rebounding on Strong Institutional Signals Ethereum is entering June with renewed optimism after surviving heavy selling pressure. It’s now trading near critical levels around $2,500–$2,600, with traders watching for a move back toward $2,800. Institutional appetite remains a key support: SharpLink Gaming recently became the largest public ETH holder, securing over 176,000 ETH and staking the majority. This confidence is bolstered by Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade and a surge in cash-margined futures interest, both pointing toward long-term bullish activity. These signals are prompting Ethereum whales to look at new, undervalued assets with potential — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is landing on their radar. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Gaining Speed from the Momentum of Giants While MAGACOIN FINANCE is not a Bitcoin or Ethereum competitor, it is increasingly benefitting from the flows of investors who originally built their portfolios around those giants. The fixed 170 billion token supply and fully audited smart contract have established MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare project with both meme appeal and strong tokenomics. But it’s the activation of staking — already live and seeing notable uptake — that has turned speculative interest into strategic accumulation. With investors locking in tokens for yield, not just short-term flips, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a new phase of market awareness. This isn’t just another presale token. It’s becoming a magnet for traders looking for long-term upside — and doing so just as capital rotates out of slow-moving assets. A temporary early entry promo — PATRIOTS100X — remains active, offering new buyers a boost before the next pricing phase. It’s another reason traders are rushing to establish a position before wider listings and coverage emerge. Bitcoin Shows Stability, Drawing Eyes to Emerging Plays Bitcoin’s volatility has cooled recently, but the asset remains a key benchmark for crypto sentiment. With ETFs in play and miners adjusting post-halving, the network remains strong, and traders are comfortable holding. However, for those looking to go beyond steady growth, attention is shifting toward smaller tokens with asymmetric upside. Veteran Bitcoin investors are selectively deploying capital into promising new opportunities — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few gaining consistent traction in these portfolios. Aptos Investors Monitor Strategic Shifts Aptos has maintained strong user engagement and ranks high in active address activity. While price catalysts have been limited in recent weeks, the community remains active, and developers continue to build within its ecosystem. But as new opportunities present themselves in more hyped and rapidly moving projects, many in the Aptos space are beginning to shift their attention to potential early-stage breakouts. That’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showing up in Aptos circles — as a possible next move for those seeking action and long-term rewards. Final Thoughts Ethereum and Bitcoin are setting the tone, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight for those hunting breakout potential. With key features already deployed and early whale activity rising, investors are positioning now. Aptos holders, altcoin traders, and smart money players are watching closely as this altcoin evolves from underdog to contender.

TIAA Wealth Management said in its midyear report that Trump’s trade policy could still shift “frequently,” warning about the “elevated uncertainty” surrounding whether new tariffs will be added or the old ones will be enforced again. They pointed out that even a few product-specific tariffs could push the total tariff rate over 10% of imports. They also noted Trump has enough legal power to bring back tariffs through other channels, and that court rulings, including possibly the Supreme Court, may not stop him. The real danger, they added, is that the damage to companies and consumers might not have even started showing up fully yet. Powell links tariffs to inflation risk Inflation is directly tied to all this. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, testified to Congress this week, saying the central bank is closely monitoring how tariffs could lead to price increases. “The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level,” Powell said. He wasn’t guessing. He was warning. Another major factor for inflation is oil. The Iran-Israel conflict and rising tension with the US has made oil prices unstable over the last few weeks. That’s not just about supply and demand. If Iran decides to block the Strait of Hormuz, which carries nearly 20% of the world’s crude oil, it could send energy prices through the roof. This all ties back to the Fed’s interest rate decision. Powell’s team is balancing inflation threats against whether to cut or hold rates. Meanwhile, Congress is debating a tax-and-spending bill. If spending stays high and the Fed keeps rates where they are, both the stock and Treasury markets could face a sell-off. That’s not just a theory. A new Natixis survey, published Wednesday, said bond market turmoil is now the top fear among the firm’s investment managers. JPMorgan flags recession risk The economy itself is no longer a solid safety net. The US housing market is already showing weakness. If that spreads to other industries, investors could face a much broader slowdown. JPMorgan’s research team put the odds of a recession at 40% in its latest forecast for the rest of the year. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, a strategist at the bank, wrote that if the global outlook gets worse and risk assets start falling, the US could underperform. He explained that the US market is at “the epicenter of the growth shock” due to its current valuations, but also mentioned the large weight of less-cyclical tech stocks could help limit losses. That’s not comfort. That’s just math. Despite all this, Wall Street’s still hoping things don’t blow up. As long as nothing gets worse, the 500 might stay up. But that’s a big if. One mistake, one escalation, and the whole thing unravels. Investors have taken positions assuming only moderate outcomes. The risk is if something completely unplanned throws everything off. Tavis McCourt, strategist at Raymond James, put it bluntly in a note to clients: “There are only two consensus opinions in the world of equity investors that I speak with. One, the [US dollar] will continue to weaken, the second is yields are going higher. We all know what the pain trade would be, and [it] will be interesting if this weekend’s events pressure this consensus.” That pain trade? A reversal of both bets. If the dollar strengthens or yields drop, everyone’s on the wrong side. That’s not a crack in the market. That’s a trapdoor.

In a mid-year economic outlook released Wednesday, the bank said there is a 40% chance of a recession in the second half of 2025. JPMorgan said that the U.S. GDP was projected to rise just 1.3% in 2025, down from a prior 2% projection. The new forecast comes as fears increase that protectionist trade measures, including broad new tariffs announced in April, will raise prices while slowing business activity. “The stagflationary impulse from higher tariffs has been the impetus for our lowered GDP growth outlook for this year,” it said. “We still view recession risks as elevated.” Stagflation, which was last seen during the economic crises of the 1970s, is an unusual and troubling turn of events. It happens when inflation remains elevated even as economic growth slows and unemployment rises in a toxic economic mix that can be hard to address using conventional policy tools. Trade shock raises concerns over recession The warning comes as financial markets react to the tariff announcements by the Trump administration, which are intended to protect U.S. industries but could also push up costs for American consumers and businesses. Markets had already repriced sharply in April when the deal announcement sent U.S. Treasury yields surging. JPMorgan explains that 2-year Treasury yields are up 3.8% while 10-year yields are near 4.3%. Yet despite the twists and turns, JPMorgan sees some relief coming by year-end, narrowing its target to 3.5% for two-year Treasuries and 4.35% for the 10-year. Still, the bank also cautioned that the term premium, or the extra yield investors demand to hold longer-dated bonds, could rise by 40 to 50 basis points amid mounting concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability and reduced appetite from foreign buyers, the Federal Reserve, and commercial banks. JPMorgan is more cautious, even though some investors still bet the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates later this year. The bank thinks that because of “sticky inflation,” tariffs are a factor in keeping it high; there probably won’t be any cuts from the Fed until December, only a start to a 100-basis-point pace-cutting cycle stretched out until the spring of 2026. If the economy cools off more than expected, the Fed may have to be more aggressive, but for now, JPMorgan is bracing for a more gradual recalibration. U.S. dollar falls as global growth picks up JPMorgan also offered a bearish take on the dollar, arguing that it will suffer as foreign economies perform better than the United States, supported by growth-friendly policies abroad. On the other hand, the U.S. is considered to be heading toward protectionism and possibly isolationist measures, which could weigh on domestic expansion . The bank says that divergence should put foreign currencies, particularly in emerging markets, on an upward trajectory while reducing foreign demand for U.S. assets like Treasury bonds. A major worry cited is the sheer magnitude of the U.S. debt market, which could be more difficult to support as key purchasers, including China, Japan, and global banks, began to pull back. But not all the news is bad. JPMorgan is still bullish on U.S. stocks, arguing that robust consumer spending, strong tech sector earnings, and investor demand could push stocks higher. The bank thinks that barring a big geopolitical letdown or policy disappointment, tech and AI-driven growth will support equity markets.

Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade improved scalability and boosted validator performance, while institutional interest remains strong due to ETF backing. Despite this, ETH’s price remains locked in a consolidation zone, creating impatience among some investors. XRP, meanwhile, is holding firm around a narrow price band, with legal clarity finally within reach. The SEC lawsuit is nearing resolution, and optimism is growing around a potential XRP ETF approval. Yet despite these developments, XRP’s price action remains unpredictable. This uncertainty has spurred many traders to explore alternatives—Polkadot and MAGACOIN FINANCE are now at the top of that list. Polkadot’s Technology Draws Fresh Capital Polkadot is gaining renewed traction due to its Elastic Scaling upgrade, which aims to dramatically improve the network’s throughput. As this scaling framework goes live, traders are speculating on a potential price breakout. Polkadot remains a leader in the Web3 interoperability movement, and staking activity is on the rise. Analysts see price targets between $8 and $10 by year’s end, depending on broader altcoin market recovery. Still, many investors are not just rotating into Polkadot—they’re looking for a newer, more explosive play. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the equation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Momentum Is Accelerating MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most watched tokens in 2025. What started as a community-driven initiative is now transforming into a serious altcoin contender. Traders rotating out of long-held majors are fueling its rise, and a number of key features are creating a perfect setup for acceleration: Locked Token Supply: With 170 billion tokens capped, long-term dilution is off the table. Staking Activated: Investors can now earn passive rewards, boosting long-term holding behavior. HashEx Audit Completed: Security and transparency concerns are resolved, adding institutional confidence. Full Community Control: No VC overrides, no hidden allocations—just grassroots growth. These structural advantages, combined with rapidly growing attention across crypto forums and Telegram channels, have sparked strong early demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not only holding investor attention—it’s redefining early-phase momentum. Analysts Are Watching Closely Market strategists have noted that smart money is rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE not because of hype—but because of structure. Its clean tokenomics, active staking inflows, and rising wallet concentration are all early indicators of a maturing asset. Analysts forecast it could mirror early Solana growth patterns, especially as listings come into play. Final Thoughts As Ethereum consolidates and XRP waits for its legal finish line, Polkadot has emerged as a strong technology-backed option. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched for a different reason—undervalued positioning and structural clarity. Veteran traders are beginning to recognize its potential to outpace other altcoins in 2025.

After briefly dropping to a local low of $2,177 over the weekend, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has climbed back above $2,400. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,412, though it still reflects a 2.9% loss over the past week and a 2.4% dip over the last two weeks. Amid this price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst has assessed Ethereum’s interaction with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a commonly used trend indicator, and came up with an outlook on where the asset is likely headed. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month Ethereum Key Resistance Levels and Historical Price Patterns According to a recent post by CryptoQuant contributor İbrahim COŞAR, Ethereum is approaching a pivotal moment that could define its next price trajectory. The analyst believes that a decisive break above the 50-day EMA could propel ETH to the $2,800 level, with a further push toward $4,000 if resistance levels are breached. In his analysis, İbrahim COŞAR emphasizes that Ethereum must close consistently above the $2,500–$2,600 range to confirm a breakout. Past data suggests that ETH has previously moved sharply after breaking out of similar consolidation zones. Specifically, in an earlier phase, Ethereum oscillated between $2,100 and $2,800 before moving strongly to $4,000. A similar move could unfold if ETH can surpass the $2,800 resistance in the current market cycle. COŞAR also noted that Ethereum’s 50-week EMA remains a longer-term resistance barrier. A breach of this technical ceiling, combined with strong daily closes above short-term resistance levels, could indicate the beginning of a more aggressive upward trend. However, the analyst advised caution, pointing out that macroeconomic and geopolitical events, particularly those involving the US, Israel, and Iran, could trigger market volatility. He recommended avoiding excessive leverage during such periods. Additional Technical Perspectives Point to Further Gains Javon Marks, another crypto market analyst, presented a more aggressive outlook for Ethereum. In a recent post, Marks observed that Ethereum has broken above a descending trend line, which historically aligns with upward price continuation. He projected that Ethereum could see an 81% gain to reach a target price of $4,811.71. Furthermore, if momentum builds, an additional rally could extend gains by another 77%, pushing prices toward $8,557.68. These projections are not guaranteed, but they highlight growing optimism in Ethereum’s market structure, especially among traders who base strategies on technical chart formations.

The threat came just hours after NATO leaders agreed to major defense spending increases that Trump had pushed hard for. But Spain publicly refused to meet the target, insisting it could fulfill its obligations without crossing that 5% line. “I think their decision is very terrible,” Trump said. “We’re negotiating with Spain on a trade deal. We’re going to make them pay twice as much.” The statement, reported by Reuters, raised eyebrows because Spain, like other EU members, doesn’t make individual trade deals with the U.S.. Those negotiations are handled by the European Commission, representing all 27 member states. That means if Trump wants to carry out this punishment, he’d need to insert that language into a broader agreement with the entire European Union—something that would likely face major opposition. Trump jokes about ‘daddy’ nickname, defends himself at NATO Instead of focusing on Spain’s refusal, Trump spent a chunk of the summit praising his own impact on the alliance. “They said, ‘You did it, sir, you did it,’” Trump said. “Well, I don’t know if I did it, but I think I did.” He said this while smiling, clearly enjoying the attention from fellow leaders. When asked about NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte calling him “daddy,” Trump said it was “very affectionately.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, standing behind him, tried not to laugh. This summit was calmer than the ones Trump attended during his first term. Back then, meetings were tense, with European leaders uncertain about his loyalty to NATO’s collective defense clause. But on Wednesday, Trump said he no longer believed the alliance was a scam. “I left here differently,” he said. “I left here saying that these people really love their countries. It’s not a rip off, and we’re here to help them protect their country.” Still, not everyone was pleased with how things unfolded. French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking after the summit, called out Trump’s trade threats. “We cannot, among allies, say that we must spend more…and wage a trade war,” Macron said . He added, “It is very important that we can return to what should be the rule within a group of allies…a true trade peace.” Macron was also the only leader to criticize Trump over his decision to hit Iran last week. Trump says Iran attack was like Hiroshima, meets with Zelenskyy At the press conference, Trump also talked about the U.S. military strikes on Iran, calling them “very, very successful—total obliteration.” He said media outlets like CNN and The New York Times had “demeaned” U.S. troops with their coverage. He added that intelligence reports backed the attack’s effectiveness. “We think we hit ‘em so hard and so fast, they didn’t get to move,” Trump said. “We destroyed the nuclear. It’s blown up…to kingdom come.” He even compared the strikes to the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. “That ended the war, too. This ended a war in a different way, but it was so devastating,” Trump said. He claimed that bunker-buster bombs were used and insisted this cleared a path to peace in the Middle East. Before stepping onstage, Trump held a private meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which lasted nearly an hour. He described Zelenskyy as “very nice” and commended Ukraine’s fight. When asked if he’d approve more defense aid, Trump replied, “We’ll see what happens.” A Ukrainian journalist told him her husband was in the military. Trump responded directly, saying, “Vladimir Putin really has to end that war.” At the very end, Trump was asked why he believed the latest ceasefire between Iran and Israel would hold. “They’re both tired, exhausted,” he said. “They were both satisfied to go home and get out.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Donald Trump|NATO|Spain,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-26 02:07:58

Traders responded immediately in Asia as the US currency dropped against all its major peers. The news came after Trump said he’s unhappy with how current Fed Chair Jerome Powell has handled interest rates, believing he’s been too slow to cut them. Source: Bloomberg Trump is now considering making an announcement as early as September or October, while Powell’s term doesn’t end until May 2026. According to the Journal , the names being floated inside the White House include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, and Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council. Both men have had previous ties to Trump’s circle, and the idea of naming a successor so early is already shaking investor confidence. Trump told reporters Wednesday he’s currently considering “three or four” potential replacements. He’s openly criticized Powell’s recent decision to keep interest rates on hold, saying it’s keeping government borrowing costs high and hurting growth. Earlier this month, he said new names would be coming “very soon.” White House sends mixed signals Rodrigo Catril, strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, said Trump’s possible early announcement could “amp up the pressure” on Powell long before his term ends. “We could have a shadow Fed chair before May next year,” Catril said, adding that this kind of political pressure could push the dollar lower in coming weeks. When asked about Trump’s intentions, the White House responded by saying the Fed should focus on growth-oriented monetary policy. Powell, for his part, insisted politics wouldn’t influence the Fed’s choices. “If we make a mistake here, people will pay…the cost for a long time,” Powell told lawmakers during a Senate hearing. He added that rate cuts are still possible later this year, but said the Fed would take a “careful approach.” On the timeline, Larry Bessent, current Treasury Secretary, previously said interviews for the next chair wouldn’t begin until September. But that schedule might not hold. The Fed’s independence has been guarded since the 1970s, when President Nixon pressured the central bank for lower rates ahead of his reelection. That led to disastrous inflation that took years to fix. Trump eyes Warsh, Bessent, and Malpass for top role Trump has had Warsh on his radar for a while. He spoke with him earlier this year about possibly replacing Powell before his term ends. Warsh was also interviewed by Trump last fall for the Treasury job. At a closed-door event in Boston this month, Warsh told a group of finance professionals, “I wouldn’t be shocked if the president made a nomination sooner than would be customary, just to…try to make a lame duck lamer or something like that.” Still, there are concerns. Some of Trump’s aides worry Warsh could be a maverick. He’s long been seen as a policy hawk, more focused on fighting inflation than boosting employment. When asked about that label in Boston, Warsh said, “My fatal flaw is I say what I believe. If the president wants someone who is weak, I don’t think I’m going to get the job.” He also took a shot at zero interest rates: “When things are free, when rates are zero, that leads to very bad economic outcomes.” Warsh also praised Kazuo Ueda, head of the Bank of Japan, saying he’s “the most talented central banker on the planet right now.” Then there’s Hassett, who’s reportedly told people he’s not interested in taking the job. That makes room for Bessent. Despite saying he’s committed to his current position, people familiar with both him and Trump say Bessent hasn’t ruled it out. Speaking before Congress earlier this month, Bessent said, “I’m happy to do what President Trump wants me to do.” That loyalty matters—Trump barely knew Powell when he picked him in 2018 and now sees that decision as a mistake. He’s determined not to repeat it. Trump has also been talking to aides about David Malpass, who ran the World Bank during his first term. Malpass has recently supported rate cuts and criticized the Fed’s internal models in a Journal op-ed. Those views line up with Trump’s. But in recent private dinners and lunches, Trump reportedly raised doubts over Malpass’s TV appeal, suggesting his appearance might not suit the role.

Qubetics Presale Enters Final Stage with Strong Tokenomics and Community Growth In Stage 37, Qubetics’ presale offers $TICS tokens at $0.3370, just below the confirmed listing price of $0.40. Over $18.1 million has been raised, with 516+ million tokens already distributed to a growing base of 28,200+ holders. The presale is nearing completion, with only 10 million tokens left fueling urgency among buyers. The team recently overhauled tokenomics, cutting the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion and increasing the public allocation to 38.55%. These changes enhance decentralization and long-term sustainability. Participants entering at this stage are locking in immediate upside while positioning themselves for deeper market involvement and governance access. Confirmed Qubetics Exchange Listing Ignites Bullish Outlook for Early Backers Qubetics has secured a confirmed listing on a top-7 centralized exchange, opening the door to global investor access, fiat onboarding, and institutional-grade liquidity. The expected launch price of $0.40 signals a potential 20% immediate return for crypto presale participants. As token velocity and visibility increase, so will opportunities for volume growth across Qubetics-powered dApps. With strong fundamentals, audit clearance from CertiK, and a $30,000 bug bounty program reinforcing transparency, Qubetics is a strategic Layer 1 poised for a breakout. Investors looking for the best coins to join now should keep Qubetics in their watchlist. Chainlink Gains Developer Momentum Despite Trading Below ATH Chainlink (LINK), once the king of oracle integrations, is slowly regaining market attention in 2025 after announcing new partnerships and ecosystem expansions. While the token currently trades at 74.54% below its all-time high of $52.70, it remains 8,953.83% up from its all-time low, a sign of its historic and sustained growth potential. As the market tilts toward real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is being adopted by major institutions to bridge data securely across chains. In March 2025, Chainlink confirmed multiple integrations with traditional financial players, including a pilot with a global bank for real-time FX data feeds using Chainlink oracles. This development has prompted bullish sentiment, particularly among institutional DeFi platforms that rely on trust-minimized data inputs. Developers are also beginning to favor Chainlink’s modularity, citing reduced latency and improved network uptime. LINK has been consolidating around $15–$18 for the past quarter, which analysts consider a potential accumulation zone. Given its continued focus on decentralized data delivery and expanding enterprise presence, Chainlink remains one of the top-rated crypto tokens in the utility segment. If momentum holds and the macro market stays bullish, LINK is poised to revisit key resistance zones as new use cases take hold. Tron Surges as TRX Becomes Utility Layer for USDT and Stablecoin Transfers Tron (TRX) has long been known for its high-throughput blockchain and dominance in USDT transaction volume. In 2025, it is doubling down on that lead by launching a zero-fee stablecoin remittance pilot across Southeast Asia. Today, TRX is trading at $0.2745, with a 0.88% 24-hour gain and growing liquidity across centralized and decentralized exchanges. Tron’s ecosystem has quietly grown to include thousands of smart contracts, and its TVL has increased by over 18% since January. Much of this growth comes from expanding use cases in DeFi, particularly around permissionless lending, staking, and NFT issuance. TRON DAO has also announced a $50 million fund to support ecosystem dApps focused on remittance, gaming, and low-latency trading. While TRX has often flown under the radar compared to flashier tokens, its stable performance and focus on financial utility make it a consistent performer. With its partnerships in government pilot programs and increasing usage in borderless payments, Tron continues to show why it belongs among the top-rated crypto assets in the current cycle. Conclusion: Qubetics, Chainlink, and Tron Stand Out Amid Market Acceleration As Bitcoin smashes past the $106,000 milestone, the eyes of the crypto world are turning toward high-conviction altcoins with a clear purpose and strong execution. Qubetics leads this wave with a real utility stack, a confirmed listing, and deflationary tokenomics; Chainlink follows with institutional-grade infrastructure and powerful developer tooling; and Tron provides borderless financial rails for the stablecoin economy. All three represent a class of top rated crypto projects that aren’t just speculatively priced but grounded in solving actual problems. As altcoin season heats up, these tokens are not just worth watching; they may be among the top-rated crypto. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other Layer 1s? Qubetics integrates multichain interoperability, low-code tooling, and enterprise-grade compliance features, all in a single stack, making it suitable for large-scale use and real-world finance. When will Qubetics be listed on an exchange? Qubetics is confirmed for listing on a top-7 centralized exchange at a starting price of $0.40, following its Stage 37 presale, which was priced at $0.3370. Is Chainlink still a good buy below its all-time high? Yes. Chainlink’s utility in decentralized data and growing enterprise integrations make it a resilient, long-term option, even below ATH pricing. What is TRON being used for in 2025? TRON is expanding its use in stablecoin remittances, DeFi lending, and permissionless asset transfers, particularly in regions underserved by traditional banking. Which is the best crypto for short- and long-term growth? Qubetics, Chainlink, and TRON offer strong use cases, but Qubetics’ mix of utility, scarcity, and upcoming exchange listing gives it a decisive short-term advantage. Summary As Bitcoin exceeds $106,000, the spotlight turns to the altcoin market, where utility-first projects capture investor interest. Qubetics ($TICS) leads the charge with a modular interoperability framework, low-code deployment tools, and a confirmed listing on a top-7 exchange, making it one of the top rated crypto opportunities today. Chainlink (LINK), despite trading below its ATH, continues to dominate decentralized data services with new institutional pilots, while TRON (TRX) enhances its stablecoin remittance infrastructure across emerging markets. Each coin serves a distinct role in the next wave of Web3 evolution: Qubetics in development infrastructure, Chainlink in oracles and DeFi, and Tron in low-fee digital finance. All are poised for continued growth in 2025.

Market participants are closely watching as the SEC and Ripple move toward a possible settlement, with a joint motion filed to finalize penalties. This development has energized investor sentiment, with analysts forecasting that XRP could retest the $3.00–$4.00 range if regulatory clarity is achieved. A spot ETF approval—looking increasingly likely—could also bring institutional momentum into play. Still, some traders believe the most explosive growth might already be behind XRP, prompting them to seek earlier-stage alternatives. Bitcoin Traders Turn to NEAR for Ecosystem Expansion Bitcoin’s recent consolidation has given traders room to explore altcoins with strong development traction. NEAR Protocol is one such asset drawing attention. Its focus on user-friendly Web3 tools and scaling through sharding has positioned it as a high-potential platform. Developer activity remains strong, and integrations across decentralized apps have expanded. However, despite its technical strengths, NEAR’s price movement has remained relatively subdued. This has led many traders to hedge their exposure with projects offering a clearer path to near-term upside—namely MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Early Positioning Is What Traders Want MAGACOIN FINANC E is becoming one of the most compelling opportunities of 2025. For traders who missed early entries into Ethereum, Solana, or XRP, this token is offering a rare second chance. Its appeal stems not from speculation alone, but from a solid framework that checks the boxes seasoned investors look for. Fixed Token Supply: Capped at 170 billion, removing dilution concerns. Audited by HashEx: Ensuring smart contract security and investor trust. Promo Bonus Active: The limited-time PATRIOTS100X offer provides early investors a major boost. This mix of transparency, community focus, and passive rewards has made MAGACOIN FINANCE a strong alternative for those reallocating from large caps. Traders don’t need a massive stake to see big potential. Even modest buys are being treated as strategic positioning ahead of its listing event. Market Dynamics Are Shifting Crypto is in transition. As large caps face macro-driven pressure, altcoins with clear structures and early momentum are rising. Analysts are watching wallet growth and on-chain staking behavior for MAGACOIN FINANCE—both of which are pointing upward. It’s a signal that investor confidence is growing organically, not through hype, but through consistent strategic entry. Final Thoughts XRP continues to show resilience, and NEAR’s tech remains promising—but MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for one key reason: asymmetric upside. A small investment today may produce returns that rival some of crypto’s biggest gainers, especially as listings and wider adoption unfold in the months ahead.

According to Bloomberg, Jeff has already talked to President Trump twice this month, and Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp met with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in mid-June. In those meetings, Jeff and his space company pushed hard for more government contracts, using Elon’s public fall from grace as their opening. The timing couldn’t have been better for Jeff. Earlier in June, Elon tore into Trump-backed legislation on X and even suggested starting a new political party. Days later, Trump pulled his support for Elon’s NASA nominee, Jared Isaacman, and warned publicly that Elon’s companies might lose their government deals. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump posted. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Jeff offers Trump what Elon can’t Elon used to be deep inside Trump’s circle. He helped with transition picks, ran a $250 million super PAC to support Trump’s re-election, and was behind Isaacman’s nomination to lead NASA. That’s gone now. The breakup cleared the way for Jeff, who’s wasted no time getting close. Trump, who wants a crewed mission to the moon during his term, brought that up with Jeff in recent calls, Bloomberg reported. Blue Origin is aiming to land a cargo ship on the moon this year. That’s a strong pitch, but there’s still a problem: SpaceX is way ahead. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket made it to orbit for the first time in January, but a second flight planned for spring never happened. The next shot is in mid-August. Meanwhile, SpaceX is expected to hit 170 launches in 2025. Most of those are for its satellite arm, Starlink, but many are also tied to government missions. In April, the U.S. Space Force awarded SpaceX $5.9 billion for 28 upcoming launches. United Launch Alliance got less for 19. Blue Origin only landed $2.4 billion for seven. Elon’s rockets are proven and fast. Jeff’ rockets are still trying to catch up. Limp has been pressing Blue Origin to speed things up and compete harder. The company is also aiming at several major future government contracts, including Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile-defense plan and upcoming Mars programs NASA has been asked to pursue. Jeff repairs relationship with the White House Jeff wasn’t always this close to Trump, as you may know. During Trump’s first term, the president accused Jeff of using the Washington Post to attack his presidency and even launched an investigation into Amazon’s Postal Service contracts, saying the company’s discounts were hurting the system. Trump also called Amazon a monopoly. But that tension is fading. Jeff built connections with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. He also backed the Washington Post’s decision not to endorse any candidate, blocking a planned editorial that would’ve supported Vice President Kamala Harris. That move didn’t go unnoticed. Trump has privately praised Jeff for stopping the endorsement, according to people close to him. Jeff also brought cash. Amazon paid $40 million, nearly three times the next highest offer, for a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump. Over 70% of that money is going directly to her, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. And Amazon gave $1 million to Trump’s 2025 inauguration, where Jeff and his fiancée Lauren Sánchez were seated right behind the president. Jeff even invited Trump to his wedding in Venice this weekend. Trump isn’t expected to attend, but the invitation itself was part of the charm offensive. Jeff is doing what Elon can’t right now: keep Trump happy, feed his space ambitions, do as he says, and avoid drama. Whether that’s enough to push Blue Origin ahead of SpaceX in the government contract race is still unclear. But for now, the billionaire who once clashed with Trump is back in the room, and Elon is out.

However, Lightchain AI is climbing for a different, more compelling reason: organic momentum. With $20.9 million raised in its presale and tokens priced steadily at $0.007, Lightchain AI is gaining traction through consistent buyer interest and genuine community support. Unlike the headline-driven spikes of XRP, Lightchain AI’s growth reflects real engagement and confidence in its intelligent blockchain infrastructure. This steady, grassroots momentum is harder to ignore, positioning Lightchain AI as a serious contender in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP Gains Short-Term Boost From Continuous Media Coverage XRP rallied in the past few days, boosted short-term by a surge in media coverage and regulatory developments favoring the token. However, the fact the CEO has appeared on nationally broadcast television in the form of FOX News is giving credibility to Ripple, drawing the attention of AM TV watchers and investors. This media glare comes in the wake of Ripple’s legal win, with the SEC drawing from its appeal after coming to concede that XRP is in fact not a security. In case you missed it- all these have contributed to market sentiment, with XRP trading at $2.29, a 0.43% drop in the past day. Some analysts feel that media exposure can cause short-term price movement, but long-term value will come from wider usage on the technology and regulatory development will be pivotal. Lightchain AI Advances Through Community-Driven Market Activity Lightchain AI is advancing through consistent, community-driven market activity as buyers and builders align around its long-term vision. Unlike short-lived trends, Lightchain’s growth is anchored in its infrastructure and governance design. Through full governance integration, token holders can vote on proposals, protocol upgrades, and development directions—placing decision-making power directly in the hands of the community. Gas optimization ensures that AI tasks are executed efficiently, with dynamic fees based on task complexity, improving scalability and accessibility. Crucially, the original 5% team allocation has been fully reallocated to fund development, grants, and ecosystem incentives—signaling a builder-first approach that resonates with serious participants. As momentum builds, Lightchain AI is proving that transparent, utility-backed projects can thrive through decentralized, community-led growth. Hype Comes and Goes—Belief Is Driving Lightchain AI Forward In a world of shifting market trends, Lightchain AI stands out by building on trust, innovation, and a clear vision for the future.

Following a sharp breakdown below its long-standing consolidation range, ETH found support near the $2,100 level and has since surged 15% from Sunday’s low. The move comes amid improving market sentiment after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran helped ease geopolitical tensions, while broader macroeconomic conditions remain in flux. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply This recent bounce has placed Ethereum back into a critical technical zone, where bulls are once again attempting to reclaim control. After spending much of May and June in a sideways range, ETH is showing signs of renewed strength, fueling optimism that the next decisive move could be to the upside. Top analyst Mister Crypto shared a bullish technical outlook, highlighting that Ethereum is getting ready for a breakout. According to his view, the current price structure and momentum suggest ETH may be preparing to challenge previous resistance levels and enter a new phase of expansion. With on-chain activity starting to pick up and broader market confidence slowly returning, Ethereum could be positioning itself as the key altcoin to lead a potential rally in the coming weeks. Ethereum Reclaims Strength Ethereum has surged more than 15% from Sunday’s lows, recovering from sharp losses triggered by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran sent a wave of relief through global markets, with ETH leading the charge among major altcoins. After briefly losing key support levels, bulls are regaining momentum as Ethereum reclaims price levels last seen before the breakdown. This rebound marks a crucial moment for ETH, as it tests the strength of current market sentiment. While macroeconomic uncertainty continues—driven by growing fears of a U.S. recession, rising bond yields, and a cautious Federal Reserve—Ethereum appears to be consolidating for a potential breakout. The broader crypto market remains on edge, with altcoins underperforming Bitcoin, and many investors watching Ethereum closely as the likely catalyst for the long-awaited altseason. According to Mister Crypto, Ethereum is now preparing for a breakout above the $2,800 resistance. This level represents a major psychological and structural barrier, and a decisive move beyond it could redefine ETH’s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Volume is returning, and on-chain data shows rising confidence from long-term holders, signaling a potential shift in trend. If bulls succeed in pushing ETH past this zone, it could trigger renewed interest across the altcoin market and usher in a wave of fresh capital. As Ethereum flirts with this breakout level, its price action in the coming days may very well set the tone for the next phase of the crypto cycle.

The 8-hour chart shows a clean V-shaped recovery, with bulls pushing the price through the 200 SMA ($2,326), reclaiming short-term control. Volume surged on the way up, confirming strong buying interest during the bounce. However, ETH now faces a test near the $2,450–$2,500 zone, where the 50 and 100 SMAs converge. These moving averages, currently acting as resistance, previously played a key role during Ethereum’s consolidation in early June. A successful breakout above this range would open the door to a retest of the $2,700–$2,800 levels, as suggested by top analysts like Mister Crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction For now, price action remains in a neutral consolidation range with a slight bullish tilt. If Ethereum holds above the 200 SMA while building support above $2,400, the bullish case strengthens. However, failure to break above $2,500 could trigger another pullback toward the $2,300 level. The next few sessions will be crucial to determine whether ETH continues its breakout attempt or enters another phase of sideways consolidation amid broader market uncertainty.

Nasdaq-listed SharpLink recently acquired over $460 million in ETH, staking 95% of its holdings—a move that emphasizes long-term conviction. Meanwhile, the Pectra upgrade has enhanced scalability, and open interest in Ethereum futures hit new highs, signaling continued trader engagement. These developments hint at Ethereum’s potential to move past $2,800–$3,000, yet some early-stage investors are starting to shift capital to assets with more explosive upside—like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as the Wild Card of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for the same reasons early Bitcoin once did—scarcity, clarity, and unwavering community focus. But unlike Bitcoin, which was once seen as a risk, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a matured crypto landscape with higher expectations and a clearer investor profile. At the core of its appeal is a fixed 170 billion token supply, meaning no dilution or inflation threats. The project is 100% community-owned with zero VC overrides and was recently audited by HashEx, adding a layer of security that most early-stage coins can’t offer. A major bonus offer, PATRIOTS100X , is now active and delivering a compelling incentive for new buyers to enter early. This is especially important for those who missed the early Bitcoin window and now want to get in before another asset takes off. Polkadot Sees Scalability Gains as Traders Take Notice Polkadot is also gaining traction, buoyed by its Elastic Scaling upgrade and steady expansion in Web3 infrastructure. The token recently climbed above key resistance zones and is testing the $3.00 barrier. Long-term projections remain positive, especially with increased parachain activity and enhanced staking yields on the horizon. While Polkadot’s progress is notable, many investors believe the biggest gains will come from earlier-phase projects with defined tokenomics and clear momentum. Strategic Buyers Are Positioning Early Analysts tracking wallet distribution and on-chain trends have flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as a clear accumulation play. Key indicators—rising staking deposits, minimal outbound transfers, and growing wallet diversity—are all signs of a token moving from speculative to strategic territory. Veteran traders aren’t just watching—they’re quietly buying. The story here isn’t hype. It’s setup. MAGACOIN FINANCE is exhibiting the same early behaviors seen in historic bull runs. This is why many believe it could mirror Bitcoin’s rise—not in narrative, but in outcome. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s institutional momentum and Polkadot’s tech-focused growth make both strong contenders. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched for something bigger— its potential to become the unexpected leader of 2025 . As more seasoned traders recognize the structural setup, they’re stepping in quietly, before the broader market catches on.

Speaking at the Permissionless crypto conference in New York on Wednesday, June 25, Folkman also announced the launch of the new World Liberty Financial App. Folkman anticipates USD1 becoming the biggest stablecoin by market cap Crypto treasury firms have become popular since the success of Strategy, the company Michael Saylor leads. The firm has over $60 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and a market capitalization surging to over $100 billion. Folkman noted that several companies admire Michael Saylor and his accomplishments. This is particularly true of his strategy and his promotion of companies keeping their crypto reserves. Goodfood Market Corp., Semler Scientific Inc ., and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. are some companies that have revealed plans or started their own efforts to hold cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, companies are changing the Strategy Playbook by using alternative tokens instead of Bitcoin when implementing their plans. For instance, Upexi raised $100 million to purchase the Solana token last week to keep in its treasury, while Sharplink Inc. holds $425 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether. Folkman also weighed on the future potential of World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin, valued at approximately $2.1 billion. Notably, the largest stablecoin is USDT, from Tether, which has about $156.8 billion in circulation. Based on Folkman’s speculations, they have tackled the challenges that a company will encounter, and now it is just a matter of time before USD1 becomes the biggest stablecoin by market cap. He further anticipated that everyone would come to this conclusion when they witness several developments in the upcoming months. With the Genesis Act , one of the main US stablecoin laws, set to pass into law, digital dollar-pegged assets have become even more attractive to investors. Fintech firms adopt the growing trend of launching stablecoins Apart from public companies showing interest in stablecoins, fintech firms have adopted this trend and aim to follow World Liberty Financial’s lead in launching stablecoins. Fiserv announced that it plans to release a stablecoin, amid increasing interest in the token from US companies as the cryptos move toward the mainstream. The announcement followed the US Senate passing a milestone stablecoin bill that analysts said could represent a turning point in the crypto oversight debate and a breakthrough for a sector stuck in regulatory limbo for years. The fintech company said its stablecoin, FIUSD, will be embedded into its existing banking and payments platform by the end of the year. The company added that FIUSD will use stablecoin infrastructure delivered from Paxos and Circle Internet. Shares of Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin by market value, were up 15%, and Fiserv and PayPal were up 2.3% and 1.7% respectively. Stablecoins are tied to currencies such as the US dollar and are meant to maintain a consistent value from reserves held. Once a niche corner of crypto, they have become popular for their ability to protect from price swings. Fintech companies and traditional banks use stablecoins more frequently to make cross-border payments easier, speed up transactions, and expand access to digital finance. Analysts at TD Cowen mentioned that they view the launch as a sign of Fiserv’s skill in quickly innovating and utilizing its central role between banks and merchants to connect old and new payment systems.

The price is trading above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

The price is now stuck near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,115 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,480 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,600 resistance. An upside break above the $2,600 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,550 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,440 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $2,390 zone. A clear move below the $2,390 support might push the price toward the $2,310 support.

The popular altcoin has now broken above the $2.20 mark and is just 42% away from its previous all-time high (ATH) of $3.84. The question now is: can XRP keep up this pace, or a pullback is coming? XRP Bounces Strong From Key Support After a period of sluggish price action, XRP recently staged a strong rebound from its critical support zone between $1.92 and $1.95. This move was fueled by improving sentiment across the broader crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin and Ethereum turning bullish in the short term. The $2.19 to $2.20 range acted as a stubborn resistance level in recent sessions. Now that XRP has punched through this zone, it’s likely to flip into a new support area, giving bulls a solid platform to aim for higher targets. Next Key Target: $2.30 to $2.35 The next crucial resistance lies between $2.30 and $2.35. If XRP can clear this hurdle, it opens up the path to revisit May’s high around $2.66, and move closer to the $3 mark in the coming weeks. Despite this promising breakout, XRP’s broader trend on the daily chart still shows a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, a classic sign of an ongoing bearish trend. To truly confirm a shift back to a bullish structure, XRP would need to consistently post higher highs, starting with a decisive move above the $2.35 resistance. Short-Term Outlook: Bullish, But Watch the Levels The recent rally from the June 22nd low has already shown a promising three-wave structure to the upside. While this is encouraging, analysts warn that one more dip remains a possibility, especially if the price fails to hold above the $2.08 support zone. A clean five-wave impulsive move, which would typically signal a stronger, more sustainable uptrend, is what experts are hoping to see next. If that happens, XRP could quickly push towards $2.29 to $2.32.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 03:15:22

This intervention puts pressure on what’s been one of the most profitable carry trades globally. Traders have been borrowing cheap Hong Kong dollars, flipping them into US dollars, and pocketing the difference. That trade just got harder. To stop the drop, the HKMA sold HK$9.4 billion, about $1.2 billion, from its reserves to buy back local currency. This tightens up the cash flowing in the banking system and pushes up interbank lending rates. Since early May, those rates had been scraping near zero. That cheap money fueled carry trades, but now it’s about to get expensive. HKMA pushes back after second straight month of currency pressure This is not the first time they’ve stepped in. The last intervention happened just last month, when the Hong Kong dollar got too strong. Back then, the HKMA had to do the opposite—dump local currency onto the market. That pumped liquidity into the system, sending lending rates even lower. The result? A cheaper Hong Kong dollar, an even wider rate gap with the US, and a golden month for traders. But now, the HKMA is reversing that. They’re pulling liquidity out to lift borrowing costs and make shorting the Hong Kong dollar painful. This will lower the city’s aggregate balance, basically a cash measure banks watch like hawks, to HK$164 billion, according to the authority. That balance had swelled when they last intervened. Now it’s getting cut down. Source: Bloomberg The last time the HKMA had to prop up the local currency this way was May 2023, and it’s no coincidence. The US dollar has been weaker lately, putting unwanted pressure on the peg. The carry trade, driven by the rate gap, made Hong Kong’s currency too appealing to bet against. The gap between one-month US and Hong Kong interest rates hit 3.4% this week, making the trade extremely juicy for global players. Volatility triggers talk, but peg remains firm This sudden back-and-forth has made people nervous about the peg’s future. The Hong Kong dollar’s drop in May 2025 was the steepest since the peg began in 1983, and that’s got some wondering how much longer this system will hold. But there’s no sign of it breaking anytime soon. The currency recovered slightly after the latest action, moving up to HK$7.8492 per US dollar during Thursday morning trading in Asia. The HKMA wants to keep it in the HK$7.75-HK$7.85 band. It’s a rigid system, but one that’s worked for decades—until volatility kicked in hard this year. Back in May, the HKMA had injected a large amount of cash into the financial system when the Hong Kong dollar appreciated too fast. That helped cool things down, but also sent lending costs plunging. Traders used the moment to borrow low and convert to US dollars, feeding the carry trade even more. That’s what made the current reversal necessary. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said earlier this month that the peg isn’t going anywhere. Speaking to local media in early June, John made it clear: “Hong Kong will maintain its currency’s peg to the US dollar as it is a key success factor.” His comments were aimed at calming speculation around alternative systems. But with markets pushing the currency to both ends of its band in just two months, staying the course might require more firepower, and more interventions like this. Still, the city’s got muscle. As of May, Hong Kong holds $431 billion in foreign currency reserves. That’s enough to keep defending the peg, even if the carry trade keeps pulling in big money from abroad. For now, the HKMA has made its move, traders are recalculating, and the Hong Kong dollar is back inside its cage. How long it stays there is another story.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a primary beneficiary, raising over $10 million in its presale and drawing comparisons to early-stage successes like Shiba Inu. This migration is driven by regulatory uncertainties around XRP and Bitcoin’s slowing momentum, pushing traders toward high-upside opportunities. Why Investors Are Rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE ROI Potential: Analysts project returns of 50x–100x, citing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s capped supply (170 billion tokens), HashEx-audited contracts, and community-driven model. For instance, a $100 investment could yield $6,360 at its $0.007 listing price and up to $909,000 if it reaches $1. Structural Advantages: Unlike VeChain, which targets enterprise solutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines meme virality with deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Market Timing: Bitcoin’s consolidation above $105,000 and XRP’s regulatory baggage have accelerated capital reallocation. On-chain data shows “smart money” accumulation in MAGACOIN FINANCE, signaling bullish sentiment. VeChain’s Rally: A Benchmark for MAGACOIN FINANCE? VeChain (VET) surged to a two-year high of $0.726 in late 2024, fueled by enterprise adoption and Bitcoin’s bull run. However, it now faces resistance at $0.03, with recent pullbacks risking its inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Predictions suggest modest 2025 growth to $0.085, constrained by its $120B market cap and regulatory headwinds. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s low entry point ($0.000266 presale) and political branding could amplify its rally potential. Like VeChain in 2021—which saw a 150% surge—MAGACOIN FINANCE leverages scarcity and hype but with greater retail accessibility. Will the Rotation Trigger a VeChain-Like Surge? Similar Catalysts: VeChain’s 2024 rally was partly driven by Bitcoin’s momentum, mirroring MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current tailwinds from crypto’s “altcoin season”. Diverging Fundamentals: VeChain focuses on supply-chain utility, while MAGACOIN FINANCE prioritizes viral growth and staking APY. The latter’s 5000%+ ROI forecasts dwarf VeChain’s 203% projected 2025 return. Risks: VeChain battles resistance and sell-off pressures, whereas MAGACOIN FINANCE’s success hinges on post-listing demand and meme sustainability. Analyst Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE: Targeted for 2000%–5000% gains in 2025, potentially turning $500 into $10,000. VeChain: Conservative $0.085–$0.12 targets by 2025, with longer-term $1–$2 projections by 2040. Conclusion The rotation from XRP and Bitcoin into MAGACOIN FINANCE could indeed ignite a rally reminiscent of VeChain’s 2021 breakout, but with higher upside potential. While VeChain offers steady enterprise-driven growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum, scarcity model, and political narrative position it for explosive, albeit riskier, gains. For investors seeking asymmetric opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a calculated bet on 2025’s altcoin cycle.

This move could allow potential homebuyers to use crypto holdings as reserves when applying for a loan—without needing to convert those digital assets into U.S. dollars. FHFA Director William J. Pulte issued the directive via letter on Wednesday, asking both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore how digital currencies might be treated as part of single-family mortgage loan assessments. The letter calls on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to “prepare a proposal for consideration of cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessments, without conversion of said cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars.” Historic Shift in Mortgage Criteria This order marks a significant departure from traditional mortgage qualification standards, where crypto assets have typically been excluded unless liquidated into fiat currency. The FHFA has overseen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since the 2008 financial crisis, when both entities were placed under federal conservatorship. Since then, the two have provided vital liquidity and stability in the housing market by purchasing loans from lenders, allowing banks to issue more credit. By considering crypto as part of a borrower’s financial profile, the FHFA aims to modernize underwriting practices in line with broader digital asset adoption. Aligning with Pro-Crypto Policy Goals In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Pulte emphasized that this decision was made “after significant studying” and aligns with former President Donald Trump’s ambition to establish the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world.” The directive also includes a condition: only cryptocurrencies that are “evidenced and stored on a U.S.-regulated centralized exchange subject to all applicable laws” will be eligible for consideration. This restriction is designed to ensure compliance and reduce risks associated with unregulated crypto markets. Broader Acceptance of Crypto in Finance The FHFA’s order reflects a broader trend of digital assets becoming more integrated into mainstream financial practices in the United States. Recent reports from Cointelegraph note that JPMorgan plans to allow select wealth management clients to use crypto-backed products, such as Bitcoin ETFs, as collateral for financing. In another development, Circle’s USDC stablecoin will soon be eligible collateral for futures trading, through a collaboration between Coinbase Derivatives and Nodal Clear. Crypto-backed mortgage lending, though still niche, has already begun to emerge. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin holders are using digital assets to secure real estate loans without selling their crypto. “Bitcoin holders have used their digital assets as collateral to purchase real estate,” he said. As digital finance continues to evolve, this latest FHFA move signals a shift in how traditional financial institutions might assess and interact with cryptocurrencies going forward.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-26 03:41:50

Link , trading within a $13.02 – $13.51 range after a 13% surge following the partnership announcement, faces resistance at the 20-day EMA of $13.31 amid mixed technical signals. Source: Cryptonews The market cap reached $8.86 billion , with 24-hour volume declining 35.56% to $446.66 million as profit-taking emerged post-announcement. The following analysis was conducted using ChatGPT’s o3 AI model. It synthesized 40 real-time technical indicators, institutional adoption metrics, Oracle network growth data, and partnership developments to assess LINK’s 90-day price trajectory. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Consolidation After Partnership-Driven Rally Chainlink’s current price of $13.05 reflects a -2.76% daily decline from an opening price of $13.42 , establishing a narrow trading range between $13.51 (high) and $13.02 (low), a 3.8% intraday spread indicating moderate volatility after yesterday’s explosive 13% surge. Despite recent partnership-driven momentum, the RSI at 46.81 remains in neutral territory, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure. This reading indicates room for movement in either direction without extreme overbought or oversold conditions that typically signal reversal points. Source: TradingView MACD indicators present mixed signals with the MACD line at 0.03 slightly above zero, suggesting mild bullish momentum, while the signal line at -0.43 and negative histogram at -0.52 indicate weakening momentum. This divergence often precedes consolidation phases or trend changes. Moving averages create a tiered resistance structure across timeframes. The 20-day EMA at $13.31 sits just 2% above the current price, representing the most accessible resistance target. The 50-day EMA at $13.99 requires 7.2% appreciation, while the 100-day and 200-day EMAs at $14.66 and $15.38 represent 12.3% and 17.9% overhead resistance, respectively. Source: TradingView The proximity to the 20-day EMA suggests that LINK remains in a short-term consolidation phase, with the ability to test higher resistance levels if partnership momentum is sustained quickly. Volume analysis shows moderate activity at 2.19 million LINK traded daily, representing normal participation levels. ATR readings at 11.30 indicate moderate volatility, with current low volatility components suggesting compressed trading ranges that often precede directional breakouts when catalyzed by fundamental developments. Historical Price Context: Oracle Network Pioneer Seeks New Highs Chainlink’s 2025 performance reflects the maturation of decentralized Oracle infrastructure, with price action testing multi-year resistance levels. LINK, trading between $10 – $27 throughout the first half of 2025, has established critical support around $12.50 – $13.00 , where institutional accumulation historically occurs. The current price represents a 75.25% decline from the May 2021 all-time high of $52.88 , though maintaining extraordinary gains of 10,260% from the September 2017 all-time low of $0.1263 . This historical context highlights both the significant correction from peak levels and the transformative long-term appreciation potential. Source: TradingView Recent technical analysis identified a hammer pattern formation that triggered a 15% bounce from weekly lows near $10.95 , demonstrating strong buying interest at lower levels. This recovery established current support structures and confirmed whale accumulation patterns observed throughout 2025. The broader trading range between $10.50 and $18.00 defines LINK’s major technical corridor. Current positioning in the lower-middle portion provides attractive risk-reward dynamics for both tactical and strategic investors. Support & Resistance: Critical Levels Define Partnership-Driven Momentum Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $13.02 , backed by the psychological $13.00 level where buying interest historically materializes. The key support zone extends from $12.50 to $13.00 , representing major technical levels and institutional accumulation areas. Major support lies within the $11.50 – $12.00 range, corresponding to recent whale accumulation zones and historical base-building periods. The strong support level spans $10.00 – $10.50 , representing the historical base where significant institutional interest emerges. Resistance begins immediately at the 20-day EMA at $13.31 , followed by the key resistance at the 50-day EMA of $13.99 . Breaking this level would signal potential trend reversal and open pathways toward the major resistance zone of $14.50 – $15.50 . Source: TradingView The strong resistance zone spans $18.00 – $20.00 , representing previous range highs and significant supply levels that would require sustained institutional adoption momentum to overcome. Breaking above $15.50 would likely trigger momentum expansion toward these higher targets. Current consolidation between $13.00 and $13.50 creates a defined trading range within which directional momentum could emerge rapidly once triggered by continued partnership developments or broader market catalysts. Revolutionary Partnership: 3.5 Billion Users Gain Direct On-Chain Access Mastercard and Chainlink announced a groundbreaking partnership on June 24, 2025, enabling over 3.5 billion cardholders worldwide to purchase cryptocurrencies directly on-chain through secure fiat-to-crypto conversion. This breakthrough is powered by Chainlink’s secure interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s trusted global payments network. @chainlink announces historic @Mastercard partnership enabling 3 billion+ cardholders to buy cryptocurrency onchain through seamless fiat-to-crypto conversion eliminating complex barriers. #Chainlink #Mastercard #Crypto https://t.co/SSrILSQ5Tf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 The initiative launches through Swapper Finance , which leverages Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure to facilitate secure communication between off-chain financial systems and on-chain smart contracts. Users can use Mastercard credit or debit cards to buy tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, with crypto deposited directly into their wallets. Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of Blockchain & Digital Assets at Mastercard, emphasized the partnership’s significance: “This is what crypto looks like when it’s ready for the real world. In coming together with Chainlink, we’re at the start of a very exciting journey to truly revolutionize the way we use cards for on-chain finance.” The partnership integrates multiple infrastructure providers, including ZeroHash for compliance and custody, Shift4 Payments for processing, Swapper Finance for user experience, and XSwap for decentralized exchange functionality, all of which utilize the Uniswap protocol. Market Metrics: Fundamental Strength Despite Technical Consolidation Chainlink maintains a market capitalization of $8.97 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $394.95 million , representing a volume-to-market cap ratio of 4.4% . The fully diluted valuation reaches $13.24 billion based on the maximum supply of 1 billion LINK tokens. The circulating supply stands at 678.1 million LINK, representing 67.8% of the maximum supply. The remaining tokens are allocated to ecosystem development and node operator incentives. Source: CoinMarketCap This controlled supply mechanism provides predictable inflation dynamics, supporting long-term value appreciation. Despite recent consolidation pressure, market dominance remains stable at approximately 0.3% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, maintaining LINK’s position among the top 20 digital assets. The 75.25% decline from all-time highs contrasts with the 10,260% gain from all-time lows, highlighting both correction depth and long-term potential. Volume analysis shows a 35.56% decline in daily trading activity following the initial partnership announcement surge, indicating normal profit-taking behavior after significant news-driven appreciation. This consolidation pattern often precedes sustained momentum if fundamental developments continue. Oracle Network Dominance: Infrastructure Layer Driving Adoption Chainlink operates the world’s largest decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to access off-chain data and computation securely. The network has facilitated tens of trillions in transaction value across DeFi, banking, tokenized real-world assets, and cross-chain applications. Major financial institutions, including Swift, Euroclear, Fidelity International, UBS, and ANZ, utilize Chainlink infrastructure for critical operations. Top DeFi protocols, including Aave, GMX, and Lido, depend on Chainlink oracles for secure price feeds and automated execution. Recent network expansion highlights 14 new integrations of 5 Chainlink services across 10 different blockchain platforms, demonstrating versatility and growing adoption across multiple ecosystems. This expansion supports the fundamental thesis that oracle infrastructure becomes increasingly critical as blockchain adoption scales. Mastercard, live for real value.

This scenario requires continued institutional adoption, positive user adoption metrics, and broader crypto market recovery. Source: TradingView Key catalysts include additional major payment processor partnerships, increased on-chain transaction volume through Swapper Finance , and successful navigation of regulatory requirements. Daily volume would need expansion above 3 million LINK to support sustained upward momentum. For full bull case realization, resistance levels at $13.99 , $15.38 , and $18.00 would need sequential clearing with volume confirmation. ChatGPT’s bullish scenario envisions potential appreciation to $25 based on technical pattern completion. Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case – 45% Probability) LINK may continue trading within the $12.50 – $15.50 range pending broader market direction and partnership implementation progress. The 20-day EMA at $13.31 provides near-term resistance while $12.50 support offers downside protection. Source: TradingView This scenario requires steady institutional adoption progress, moderate oracle network growth, and stable broader crypto market conditions. Volume would likely remain around current levels without significant expansion or contraction. Risk management involves monitoring daily closes above $13.50 for bullish momentum confirmation or below $12.50 for bearish breakdown signals toward deeper support levels. Technical Breakdown (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Failure to hold $12.50 support could trigger selling toward $10.50 – $11.50 historical support levels. This scenario would require partnership implementation delays, broader crypto market weakness, or unexpected competitive pressures. Source: TradingView A breakdown below $12.50 with volume expansion would signal a potential deeper correction toward major support zones. Strong support at $10.00 – $10.50 would likely attract renewed institutional interest. Recovery would depend on successful partnership progress, Oracle network adoption metrics, or broader market stabilization, which would provide fundamental support for price recovery. LINK Price Forecast: Infrastructure Layer Meets Mainstream Adoption Chainlink’s current position reflects a unique convergence of technical consolidation, revolutionary partnership announcements, and established oracle network dominance. The 40-signal analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized infrastructure. The Mastercard partnership represents a paradigm shift that could drive mainstream cryptocurrency adoption through trusted payment rails. Enabling 3.5 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain eliminates traditional barriers and gives Chainlink unprecedented utility demonstration. Technical indicators suggest consolidation after partnership-driven momentum, with mixed signals indicating potential for both continuation and reversal. Current price levels near $13.05 offer attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to Oracle infrastructure and institutional adoption themes. Critical Levels to Monitor Support defense at $12.50 – $13.00 remains crucial for maintaining bullish structure potential, while resistance clearing above $13.99 could indicate momentum expansion toward partnership-driven targets. Daily closes above the 20-day EMA at $13.31 would confirm short-term consolidation completion. Over the next 90 days, investors should monitor Mastercard partnership implementation metrics, additional institutional partnership announcements, Oracle network adoption growth, and broader DeFi market sentiment.

This will allow lawmakers more time to solve the problem before funds run dry. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress to act before the August recess , warning that court decisions on Trump-era tariffs could accelerate the projected X-date. Treasury extends emergency actions to avoid hitting the debt limit Bessent extended the period when the government can use “special accounting measures” to stay under the legal debt limit. The move allows the Treasury Department to temporarily shift funds between federal accounts and pause investments in certain government programs. Moreover, it enables the delay in issuing new debt as it extends the so-called “debt issuance suspension period” through July 24, 2025. Bessent sent a formal letter addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson and other key congressional leaders before the previous suspension period’s expiration on June 27. This will help the government continue making payments without exceeding its borrowing authority . Bessent also repeated his warning in May and urged Congress to act quickly to raise or suspend the debt ceiling before lawmakers leave town for their scheduled August recess. He said these special measures do not solve the underlying problem, despite providing temporary relief. He also said the Treasury will shake investor confidence and damage the US government’s credit rating if it eventually exhausts its ability to pay the government’s bills on time. Bessent’s letter now puts more pressure on Republican leaders in both the House and Senate, who have been trying to finalize a massive tax and spending package but have failed due to internal disagreements over funding priorities. The Treasury may soon find itself without the tools to manage government payments. This could push the US closer to a financial crisis if these lawmakers don’t pass the package or delay action on the debt ceiling. The longer lawmakers delay, the higher the risk that markets will react with volatility and the harder it may become to calm public and investor fears. Tariff court battles could change the debt ceiling deadline Bessent told reporters that the outcome of legal battles surrounding tariffs imposed during the Trump administration could affect the “X-date”. This is because these tariffs have become a significant source of short-term federal revenue. They generated an unprecedented $23 billion in customs duties to boost the Treasury’s cash reserves when the federal government operates under strict borrowing limits and relies on temporary accounting measures to stay solvent. However, a recent US Court of International Trade ruling determined that some of Trump’s tariffs exceeded presidential authority and lacked a valid legal basis. The Treasury may be forced to halt the collection of certain tariffs altogether. Thus, the government could also be required to issue refunds for duties it has already collected. These court decisions can affect the government’s cash position and ability to delay a debt limit breach using internal workarounds. The ripple effects could be a loss of incoming revenue and an actual outflow of funds at a time when every dollar counts. A sudden drop in this revenue due to court-ordered changes could bring the X date closer by weeks and leave Congress with far less time to act than current projections suggest. Treasury signals it will scrap revenge tax as global tax talks advance Meanwhile, the US Treasury Department hints that it may soon abolish the controversial “revenge tax,” as the international tax talks led by the OECD finally appear to be making real headway. Michael Faulkender, the deputy Treasury secretary, said that a global agreement could make a US proposal called Section 899 , which is its provision against countries with a digital tax, unnecessary. Section 899 is an addition to the Trump administration and is widely viewed as retaliatory. It would levy tax penalties on companies and investors in countries the US believes discriminate against American technology giants, like Google, Apple, and Amazon, with digital services taxes. Several US allies, such as Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, have adopted some of these taxes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This report systematically reviews technological advancements in institutional applications and credit mechanisms, delving into the policy-driven surge of institutional DeFi as regulatory tailwinds in the U.S. ease constraints on digital assets. A new DeFi summer is emerging, not for retail investors, but for institutions. Central to this shift, HTX has recently doubled down its focus on the DeFi sector. Following the listing of SPK (Spark), the flagship part of MakerDAO’s Endgame roadmap, HTX continues to offer users access to high-yield DeFi opportunities while connecting institutional capital and on-chain liquidity. HTX Stands at the DeFi’s Forefront HTX is ramping up its DeFi expansion as institutional adoption gains pace. Recent trading data highlights a renewed enthusiasm in the DeFi market. Over the past week, UNI (Uniswap, an Ethereum-based DEX) surged by 31% while RAY (Raydium, a Solana-based DEX) jumped 39%. Lending protocols like AAVE and SNX (Synthetix) gained 13% and oracle leader LINK (Chainlink) added 10%. Notably, real world assets (RWA) token ONDO experienced significant interest, driven by capital inflows from the U.S.. HTX has also made strategic moves into emerging ecosystems. Post-listing, Sui-based tokens like BLUE and CUTES demonstrated strong performance, underscoring HTX’s ability to identify high-potential assets in nascent DeFi ecosystems. Regulatory Relaxation: Paving the Way for Institutional Entry According to HTX Research, two key developments in 2025 catalyzed the institutional wave for DeFi: the repeal of SAB 121 and the advancement of the GENIUS Act. These policies provide a solid foundation for traditional financial institutions to legally issue stablecoins and participate in on-chain finance. Against this backdrop, Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald partnered with DeFi lending platform Maple Finance to execute the first on-chain Bitcoin loan transaction. The bank deposited its acquired BTC into Maple and earned an annualized yield of 4–6%. Symbolically, Cantor Fitzgerald’s helmsman is none other than U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, signaling growing confidence in DeFi’s institutional future and a future of “on-chain mainstream finance”. On-Chain Credit Rises Along with Institutional DeFi Institutional-grade applications in DeFi are rapidly taking shape. Maple Finance’s TVL has surpassed $2 billion and continues to grow. Moreover, MakerDAO’s Spark protocol allocated $50 million directly to Maple, building on-chain lending products that generate a stable yield of 10-17%. This establishes a multi-step credit loop that mirrors the complexity and yield sophistication of traditional finance. HTX Research identifies a wave of technical and structural upgrades transforming DeFi into an institutional-grade financial layer: ● Sybil Resistance and On-Chain Trust : Projects like 3Jane form a decentralized credit rating system combining ZK and FICO scores to offer non-collateralized USDC loans to small- and medium-sized institutions. ● Structured Debt Instruments (CLOs) : Currently, several DeFi protocols, such as Maple, are developing on-chain collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), issuing different classes of debt securities—senior and junior—to meet investors’ varied risk preferences and offering greater liquidity and transparency through smart contracts. ● Credit Default Swaps (CDS) : Aave’s Umbrella module and Opium’s CDS products reduce counterparty default risk in DeFi through automatic execution and tradable agreements. ● Delegated Lending and Restaking Insurance : Maple’s “pool delegate + sub-leading” model expands the coverage and layering of lending services. SyrupUSDC boosts capital efficiency through a “restaking + insurance pool” design. The Future of DeFi: High-Dimensional AMMs and Modular Stablecoins With institutions now actively engaging with DeFi, the infrastructure must evolve. Platforms like Uniswap V3 and Curve , though dominant, often face challenges in multi-asset environments. To address this, Paradigm has recently proposed the Orbital AMM , which leverages spherical and toroidal invariants in high-dimensional space to enable single-pool, multi-assets trading, significantly reducing slippage and maximizing capital efficiency. Meanwhile, Spark, now surpassing $5.9 billion TVL, is fast becoming the heart of MakerDAO’s Endgame strategy. It’s building an on-chain yield and stablecoin engine through partnerships with Maple, EigenLayer, and others.

Fresh on-chain data suggests that the short-term holder (STH) floor for BTC has been steadily rising toward the $100,000 level. Bitcoin STH Floor Approaching $100,000 According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor unchained, Bitcoin’s STH Realized Price has been making its slow grind up toward the psychologically important $100,000 level. Notably, the analyst had earlier dubbed this metric as the “fault line” to watch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the STH Realized Price represents the average price at which all Bitcoin held for less than 155 days was acquired. It acts as both a key psychological and technical support level. When the market price stays above it, STH are in profit and more confident, whereas if it falls below, fear and selling pressure often increase. Currently, the STH Realized Price hovers around $98,000. The analyst notes that each $500 rise in the STH Realized Price effectively resets the “new buyers’ comfort floor.” As this metric nears six figures, the mental stop-loss for newer investors also moves upward. The following chart illustrates two recent instances where BTC bounced sharply after touching the blue STH Realized Price line. This price action suggests a bullish structure, where selling pressure diminishes as soon as BTC revisits its average cost basis. Meanwhile, the premium – the difference between BTC’s spot price and STH Realized Price – currently hovers around 7.2%. A shrinking premium, typically under 10%, has historically signalled reduced market froth and often preceded the next leg up once open interest began to rebuild. On the long-term side, the long-term holder (LTH) Realized Price remains largely unchanged at $32,000, roughly one-third of the STH Realized Price. The analyst observes that these long-term coins are likely held in cold storage, indicating “strong hands” with little incentive to sell. They concluded: The blue line is climbing relentlessly; as long as BTC lives above it, the prevailing tide is still higher-lows, higher-highs. Lose it on a daily close, and we get our first real gut-check since April – otherwise the bull engine is merely cooling its cylinders. Experts Predict New High For BTC As BTC’s STH Realized Price continues to surge higher – resulting in a higher floor price for the digital asset – several crypto experts seem to agree that the cryptocurrency may soon reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months.

By improving validator limits and increasing scalability, Ethereum is setting the foundation for broader ecosystem growth. But instead of reigniting a price rally, this technical shift has left Ethereum consolidating around the $2,500–$2,600 zone — prompting traders to look elsewhere for higher upside. While Ethereum remains essential to the smart contract space, the momentum has shifted toward lower-cap opportunities with cleaner setups. One name leading that pivot is MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP’s Regulatory Milestone Drives Confidence Meanwhile, XRP is riding a separate wave of transformation. With the long-running SEC case nearing resolution and an XRP ETF approval potentially on the horizon, market sentiment is turning sharply bullish. XRP recently bounced off support in the $2.20 range and is flirting with breakouts toward $2.80–$3.00. On-chain data shows increased institutional accumulation and a dramatic spike in payment volume, which supports Ripple’s ambitions to capture a greater share of global remittances. Still, many XRP holders are hedging or complementing their positions with newer assets — and MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught that attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the Strategic Choice for 2025 While Ethereum, XRP, and SEI each offer compelling narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming the most watched altcoin among early-stage traders. What sets it apart isn’t hype — it’s mechanics. The 170 billion token supply is permanently capped, which immediately sets a boundary for dilution and long-term value. Traders are also seeing disciplined on-chain behavior: wallet growth is strong, transfers are stable, and staking activity shows investors are willing to hold — not just flip. More importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has done something few meme-origin projects manage: it’s won trust. With a full audit from HashEx, zero VC interference, and real traction in staking adoption, it’s positioning itself as a rare early-entry token with staying power. Investors who act now can also access a limited-time 100% bonus, increasing token allocation and enhancing early ROI potential. This has led to accelerated accumulation — and analysts say the setup could mirror early cycles of other explosive performers like Shiba Inu and Solana. SEI Gains Momentum as Layer 1 Activity Builds SEI, the performance-focused Layer 1 blockchain, has started to attract retail and developer interest again following a string of upgrades and DeFi partnerships. Its speed and low latency appeal to applications requiring fast execution, and recent price movements suggest early bullish sentiment. SEI is carving out its own niche in the competitive L1 space, but it still faces significant headwinds from better-known chains like Solana and Avalanche. As such, SEI is being seen as a speculative pick — with many traders rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early accumulation signals a more asymmetric bet. Final Thoughts As Ethereum stabilizes after its upgrade, traders are broadening their altcoin exposure. XRP’s regulatory progress and SEI’s technical promise are creating optimism, but the clearest early-stage opportunity may be MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its capped supply, staking momentum, and strategic on-chain growth, it’s becoming the kind of asset that seasoned traders position for before the wave hits.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has officially ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two of America’s biggest government-backed mortgage companies, to start recognizing cryptocurrency as an asset when people apply for home loans. On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), FHFA Director Bill Pulte announced this decision. He explained that after careful study, and in line with President Trump’s goal to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must now prepare their businesses to accept cryptocurrency as part of mortgage applications. After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump’s vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. SO ORDERED pic.twitter.com/Tg9ReJQXC3 — Pulte (@pulte) June 25, 2025 In simple terms, this means that if you own crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP, it could be counted as part of your assets when applying for a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Why This Matters This is important because it marks the first time U.S. government-supported mortgage firms have officially recognized crypto as a financial asset. Until now, crypto was often seen as too risky or too new for traditional financial products like home loans. Now, with this new rule, it could open the door for millions of crypto holders in the U.S. to use their digital assets to qualify for mortgages. It’s another clear sign that crypto is becoming more mainstream and accepted by big institutions. What’s Next? This move will likely push private banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo to follow suit. If government-backed firms are doing it, the private sector won’t want to be left behind. This could lead to new crypto-related financial products, loans, and services in the near future. There’s also talk of banks launching their own stablecoins and expanding crypto services like trading and custody for their customers.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 04:03:51

The update was shared by WLF co-founder Zak Folkman on June 25 in a Blockworks interview during the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, as reported by Reuters. The audit, which is expected to be completed in a few days, will provide details on the reserves backing USD1, which has grown to a $2.2 billion market cap since launch in March. The stablecoin is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries. It runs Ethereum ( ETH ), BNB Chain ( BNB ), and TRON ( TRX ), with BitGo acting as the custodian. Folkman said WLF will begin publishing monthly reserve reports going forward. WLF is also preparing to roll out a mobile app designed to make using crypto simpler for everyday investors. “We’re going to have very transparent auditing from a financial level,” Folkman said. You might also like: Alchemy Pay integrates World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin He also hinted that WLFI, the platform’s non-tradable governance token, could soon become tradable. “If you pay attention over the next couple of weeks, I think everyone’s going to be very, very happy,” he added. WLFI currently allows holders to vote on protocol changes but is not listed on exchanges. Although WLFI and USD1 have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for Trump’s family business , they have also come under fire from lawmakers and critics. The timing of Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures has been questioned by ethics watchdogs, particularly as his administration rolls back regulatory oversight in the industry. The Trump family allegedly pocketed over $130 million after reducing their ownership of WLF from 60% to 40% in June, a move that reportedly brought in a total of about $190 million. Despite the criticism, adoption continues. The stablecoin has been gaining traction among institutional users. USD1 was used in a $2 billion investment in Binance by MGX, a UAE-based firm in March. Earlier in June, a $4 million USD1 airdrop reached over 85,000 wallets, boosting awareness and confidence in the stablecoin’s infrastructure. Thanks to new tools, growing demand, and an expanding user base, WLF appears to be establishing USD1 as a major player in the stablecoin market.

In the last 24 hours, its price has jumped over 19% to $0.63, with trading volume soaring 153% to $285.65 million. The coin has also climbed to the 1 spot on the trending crypto list. According to analyst Kim H. Wong , this surge is an important milestone for Pi Coin, especially with Pi2Day just three days away. The event is expected to bring updates on the project’s progress, ecosystem growth, and AI integration. If Pi breaks above the $0.65 resistance, it could quickly rise to the $0.80 to $1 range. With its all-time high at $3 and a recent low of $0.40, Pi Coin still has room to move higher. Analyst Joe Swanson added that this breakout is happening exactly as he expected, and it might be the beginning of a longer rally, one that could gain even more strength as Pi2Day 2025 approaches. Technicals Show Bullish Signs for Short-term Pi Network’s charts show a neutral trend overall, but there are signs of short-term strength. Short-term moving averages (10, 20, and 30-day) are mostly showing buy signals, pointing to a possible upward move. However, the longer-term averages (50 and 100-day) are still flashing sell signs, so the long-term trend remains weak for now. What To Expect On Pi2Day? The rally comes as excitement builds around a possible GenAI announcement on June 28. The Core Team is also expected to reveal major ecosystem updates. Whale activity is also driving the price as one wallet has bought over $173M worth of Pi, likely a big institutional player. The community is waiting for the launch of KYC Sync, making it easier for users to link their ID between the Pi App and Browser. This move pushes millions closer to full Mainnet migration. Will A Correction Follow Next? However, some analysts warn that Pi’s recent rally could be short-lived. While hype and technical momentum are driving the surge, a correction may be on the horizon. Additionally, over 268 million PI tokens are set to unlock in July, the biggest release until 2027, which could put downward pressure on the price. Dr. Altcoin recently shared that the recent Israel-Iran ceasefire is a positive signal for Pi.

Further, Coinbase will serve as the fund’s custodian, and Bank of New York Mellon as the administrator.

Early this month, the regulator requested spot SOL ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June and clarify procedures for in-kind redemptions. Invesco ETF Filing – A Clear Tailwind for Solana Per the S-1 registration statement, Invesco has proposed the planned ETF to directly hold Solana, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. The fund will be traded under the ticker symbol QSOL. The recent flurry of filings to track the price of Solana, the sixth-largest crypto by market cap, sets off a wave of optimism across the sector that saw Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals and BTC’s new highs in the recent past. Additionally, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart predicted that there is a 95% odds of Solana and other altcoin ETF approvals this year. “Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected,” he said in May , adding that the approvals are “more likely” to be in early Q4, 2025. Growing Solana Activity on CME Signals Imminent ETF Launch Per a recent report, Solana activity on CME had hit record highs, signalling strong institutional positioning.

Franklin Templeton’s application is currently under review by the SEC. The commission has opened a public comment period, as part of the review, to allow people to submit feedback. Analysts, on the other hand, have grown bullish on SOL, as its price action reflects ETF optimism. According to a trader Cipher X, “Solana ETFs approval chances are 80% by July.” The pseudonymous trader expects a repricing to follow and projects that SOL could deliver a monthly move of 40% to 50% following the ETF catalyst. $SOL is at a very crucial support level right now. If the $138-$140 level holds, SOL could rally towards $190-$200 by July. In case the support level didn't hold, I'm placing some bids at $130.

On the geopolitical front, US officials expected to meet Iranian counterparts next week and the ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to be holding for now.

The market is now betting on a convergence of two trends: dovish Fed commentary and retail’s accelerating rotation into digital assets, traders say. “Crypto will continue its bullish trend,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “Institutional purchases are picking up, and Jerome Powell’s comments hinting at rate cuts have flipped investor sentiment quickly.” Powell this week said rate adjustments remain on the table, contingent on successful trade deals and softening inflation, words that markets took as code for a late-2025 pivot. At press time, bitcoin was trading over $107,800, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Ether ETH is holding at $2,480 with a 1.8% gain. Solana’s SOL SOL, dogecoin DOGE, XRP XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB showed gains under 1%, but could be next to move if BTC and ETH prices further recover. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich said that the overall market capitalization had previously dipped below its 200-day moving average and rebounded sharply, “confirming that level as new support.” Bitcoin also reclaimed its 50-day average, signaling that momentum may accelerate if sentiment holds, he noted, adding that BTC remains about 5% below its recent highs and is lagging behind traditional tech benchmarks, such as the Nasdaq 100, which has just hit fresh all-time highs. “If crypto-related equities maintain this pace, they may soon catch up with traditional finance,” he said. Meanwhile, underlying demand is strengthening. eToro data shows U.S. retail investors are increasing crypto exposure amid a weakening dollar and rising global uncertainty, with 58% reportedly rebalancing their portfolios to favor digital assets.

Donald Trump’s Shortlist Just Dropped appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tensions between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are heating up again. With Powell’s term set to end in May 2026, Trump is reportedly thinking about announcing a replacement much earlier. According to Wall Street Journal journalist Nick Timiraos , Trump is frustrated with how slowly the Fed is cutting interest rates. However, naming someone too early could backfire, as that person might face more public pressure and be less likely to get the job in the end. Who is the Next FED Chair? SCOOP: As President Trump remains furious at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he has started deliberating to make his choice of chair and announce it to the world months before Powell's term ends. On the rise in his considerations for Fed Chair are loyalists but with their own… — Brian Schwartz (@schwartzbWSJ) June 25, 2025 While Trump hasn’t officially named his pick, he said during a NATO summit press conference that he’s narrowed it down to “three or four people.” Among the top contenders are known Trump loyalists: Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, Chris Waller, and David Malpass. Additionally, Scott Bessent is being pushed as a strong candidate. These candidates are seen as more likely to support Trump’s push for faster rate cuts and stronger economic growth. [post_titles_links postid=”474867″] Can Trump Fire Jerome Powell ? Even though Trump has hinted at firing Powell, it’s not that simple. A recent Supreme Court ruling confirmed that the Fed operates differently from other government agencies, which means Powell’s job is more secure. During his first term, Trump also thought about removing Powell but backed off after markets reacted badly. This time, he’s been more open, even posting online that he “might change [his] mind” about firing him. A Battle Over FED Interest Rates The disagreement between Trump and Powell mainly revolves around interest rates and inflation. Trump wants the Fed to cut rates to help the economy grow, but Powell is holding firm, saying Trump’s tariff plans could drive up prices. With only 11 months left in Powell’s term, the decision on who leads the Fed next could have a big impact on the U.S. economy, especially if Trump returns to the White House. In short, Trump wants change at the top of the Fed, but legal limits, market reactions, and careful timing could make that tricky.

Trump wants faster interest rate cuts for economic growth, while Powell prioritizes stable prices, citing concerns that Trump’s tariffs could fuel inflation.

This week, asset manager Invesco became the ninth firm to file for a spot Solana ETF, aiming to track the cryptocurrency’s market performance alongside several major competitors. At the same time, analysts and investors are pointing to Solana’s expanding potential beyond speculative use cases, with growing support for its role in the long-term development of tokenized capital markets. Invesco Joins Race for Solana ETFs, Paving Way for a Possible Altcoin ETF Summer Asset manager Invesco has filed for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) in partnership with Galaxy Digital. The filing makes Invesco the ninth contender seeking regulatory approval to launch a spot Solana ETF, reflecting a growing appetite to expand crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF would directly hold SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, which currently ranks as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trading at approximately $145.81. The filing outlines that the ETF aims to mirror the spot price of Solana and would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker “QSOL.” With the explosive success of spot Bitcoin ETFs following their long-awaited launch in early 2024 — and a more modest reception for Ethereum ETFs later that year — asset managers are now probing the market’s appetite for altcoin-based funds. Solana, known for its high-speed and low-cost blockchain network, has emerged as the leading candidate for this next wave of ETF innovation. Joining heavyweights like VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares, Invesco’s entry into the fray signals growing institutional confidence in Solana's long-term value proposition. These firms are all betting that the demand for Solana exposure — especially via regulated and accessible investment vehicles — is substantial enough to warrant SEC approval. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve Solana ETF applications as early as July, well ahead of the final decision deadline of Oct. 10. Seyffart’s analysis, backed by Bloomberg senior ETF strategist Eric Balchunas, assigns a 90% probability to approval, suggesting that momentum behind these filings is rapidly gaining traction. “Get ready for a potential altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way,” Balchunas noted. Coinbase Custody and Staking Provisions A notable feature of the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF is its custodial and staking structure. The fund will use Coinbase Custody to securely hold its underlying SOL assets. Furthermore, the filing reveals that the ETF may occasionally stake a portion of its assets through “trusted staking providers.” Staking — locking up tokens to help secure the network in exchange for yield — has become an increasingly popular strategy among crypto investors seeking passive returns. The ETF would receive additional SOL tokens as staking rewards, which the filing states could be treated as taxable income to the trust. This staking provision aligns with similar updates made by competing Solana ETF applicants earlier this month. By integrating staking, these ETFs aim to enhance yield potential for investors, a move that could make them more attractive relative to traditional crypto funds. The wave of Solana ETF filings comes at a time of renewed optimism in the US crypto sector. The Trump administration has signaled its intent to reduce regulatory barriers for digital assets, a shift that has already catalyzed billions of dollars in institutional Bitcoin investment and sent prices to new all-time highs. This deregulatory stance appears to have emboldened asset managers to move forward with ETF products that just months ago seemed politically and legally infeasible. The push for Solana ETFs mirrors the aggressive expansion of crypto integration into traditional finance, as public companies continue to raise capital for long-term digital asset holdings. Race to the Finish: Who Will Win the SOL ETF Game? The simultaneous nature of the nine filings suggests that, if approved, all Solana ETFs will launch concurrently — likely to avoid giving any single firm a first-mover advantage. The list of current bidders now includes: Invesco & Galaxy Digital Grayscale VanEck Bitwise Fidelity Franklin Templeton 21Shares Canary Capital While all of these issuers — except Canary — have already launched spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, Canary has stood out for its aggressive push to introduce ETFs tracking a broader range of altcoins. Whether the SEC will greenlight all applications remains to be seen, but analysts believe concurrent approval is the most probable scenario. A greenlight from regulators could mark a watershed moment not only for Solana but for altcoins more broadly. It would also validate Solana's increasing prominence in the decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT), and Layer 1 blockchain sectors — areas where it has increasingly challenged Ethereum’s dominance. For institutional and retail investors alike, a regulated Solana ETF offers a safer, more convenient way to gain exposure without navigating the complexities of self-custody or crypto exchanges. If this wave of ETF approvals materializes, the summer of 2025 may be remembered as the beginning of the “Altcoin ETF Era,” with Solana leading the charge. Solana Dips Slightly After Session Highs as Syncracy Capital’s Watkins Renews Long-Term Bullish Outlook Solana’s native token, SOL, saw a minor pullback on Tuesday — after briefly touching $147.73 earlier in the session. The dip came amid heightened trading volume and renewed commentary from Syncracy Capital Co-Founder Ryan Watkins, whose latest remarks are reinforcing bullish narratives around Solana’s role in the future of the crypto economy. The session’s high and subsequent retracement illustrate a common pattern among top-performing crypto assets that are seeing both institutional interest and macro-level validation. In Solana’s case, those tailwinds appear to be growing stronger despite near-term price softness. Watkins: Solana to Lead the “Tokenization of Everything” The latest momentum in market discussion came after Ryan Watkins revisited his bold May forecast, which positioned the competition between Solana and Hyperliquid as the defining contest in the next phase of the blockchain economy. In a new post on X (formerly Twitter) published June 25, Watkins asserted that Solana now appears poised to lead the “tokenization of everything” — a phrase increasingly associated with the digitization of real-world assets, financial instruments, and equities on permissionless blockchains. Watkins’s thesis contrasts Solana’s future with that of Hyperliquid, another high-performance chain, which he sees dominating the perpetual futures space. His bifurcated vision underscores two key narratives gaining traction in the broader digital asset landscape: the migration of capital markets onto public blockchains and the institutional appetite for decentralized derivatives. Back in May, Watkins speculated that the winner of the Solana-Hyperliquid race could eventually mature into a platform worth between $100 billion and $500 billion, depending on how successfully it absorbs market share from both traditional finance and competing Layer-1 networks. This bold projection now carries added weight given recent developments: record-breaking CME Futures volume for SOL and the sustained influx of institutional investors seeking exposure to alternative Layer-1 blockchains. Watkins’s remarks are seen as a reinforcement of the narrative that Solana is no longer just a high-speed alternative to Ethereum, but a core player in a future financial system increasingly governed by decentralized protocols. CME Futures Volume Signals Institutional Momentum Perhaps most telling of Solana’s increasing institutional legitimacy is the record futures activity on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The open interest in SOL futures recently hit a high of 1.75 million contracts, reflecting a significant uptick in participation from sophisticated investors and hedge funds. This level of volume places SOL alongside Ethereum and Bitcoin as one of the few cryptocurrencies with strong, sustained institutional engagement. Market observers have noted that this surge in futures trading activity is likely to underpin price stability and may even lead to further price discovery, especially if coupled with a favorable macro environment and supportive regulatory developments. Despite the brief cooldown from session highs, technical indicators remain favorable for Solana . The $144–$145 zone is holding as short-term support, while bulls continue eyeing the $148 to $150 range as the next major resistance band. Traders are also watching for a breakout past the psychological $150 level, which could confirm a broader bullish continuation pattern that’s been forming since early June. Solana’s Position in the Tokenization Race Solana’s efficient transaction processing, low fees, and growing developer ecosystem make it an ideal candidate for powering large-scale tokenization of assets. From stablecoins to real-world assets like stocks and real estate, multiple projects are already experimenting with bringing financial instruments onchain using Solana’s infrastructure. This is further bolstered by the growing interest from traditional financial institutions and asset managers. With major players like Franklin Templeton already issuing tokenized funds on Solana and a possible Solana ETF approval on the horizon, the network’s institutional footprint is expected to expand significantly.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-26 05:30:00

Speaking at the Permissionless conference hosted by Blockworks in Brooklyn, Folkman reportedly said the audit, completed by an independent accounting firm, will be published soon . The move comes as the firm tries to bolster trust in its financial infrastructure while facing intense political scrutiny. Folkman also teased the possibility of future changes to the platform’s governance token, WLFI, which currently cannot be traded. “I don’t want to give away too much, but if you pay attention over the next couple of weeks, I think everyone is going to be very, very happy,” he told the audience when asked about potential token liquidity. @zakfolkman —co-founder of @worldlibertyfi is talking about $WLFI “Yeah, so, first things first.

The token grants holders voting rights on network proposals and roadmap decisions, but not ownership stakes. Earlier this month, public disclosures revealed that Trump personally received $57.35m from WLFI token sales and still holds 15.75b tokens in the venture. The project has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and ethics watchdogs, who argue it raises serious concerns over conflicts of interest. They point to the timing, as Trump has supported deregulatory measures in crypto while benefiting financially from the sector. In January, the Trump Organization said the former president’s business interests are managed through a trust overseen by his children. WLF Bets on Simplicity to Drive Mainstream Adoption Folkman said the company’s upcoming app is aimed at making digital assets more accessible to mainstream users. The platform will integrate stablecoin payments and wallet functionality. It is designed with a simple interface to encourage wider adoption. Meanwhile, World Liberty’s rapid fundraising, fueled by token sales and strong brand visibility, has made it a significant player. This rise comes during a politically sensitive year for the crypto sector. However, questions persist. Observers are unsure how much transparency and oversight the firm is prepared to accept.

This is a major shift in federal housing finance and aligns with President Donald Trump’s vision of positioning the US as a leader in crypto innovation. Only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges will be considered to ensure compliance. On the other hand, the UK is tightening restrictions. Barclays announced a ban on crypto purchases via its credit cards, due to consumer protection concerns. On the legislative front, Senator Cynthia Lummis is very optimistic that two key crypto bills — the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts — could pass by year-end. Overall, these developments shed some light on growing divergence in regulatory approaches between the US and UK during a time of global institutional adoption of digital assets. FHFA Backs Crypto for Home Loans The US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for recognizing cryptocurrency as a form of asset in mortgage loan risk assessments. In a letter that was issued Wednesday, FHFA director William J. Pulte instructed the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore incorporating crypto holdings into risk assessments for single-family mortgage loans without requiring conversion of those assets into US dollars. This is a big shift in federal housing policy, as digital assets have typically not been factored into traditional mortgage evaluations unless liquidated into fiat currency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under federal conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, and are key players in the US housing finance system. Their ability to purchase mortgages from lenders has long helped maintain liquidity and stability in the housing market. Pulte explained that the move comes after extensive study and aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of positioning the US as a global hub for crypto innovation. Importantly, Pulte’s letter specifies that only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges and subject to relevant laws should be considered. This cautious approach ensures regulatory compliance while acknowledging the growing role of crypto in the financial ecosystem. The decision was made amid broader trends indicating increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate collateral. JPMorgan , for instance, is preparing to let some of its wealth management clients use crypto-based financial products like Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for financing. Additionally, Coinbase Derivatives and clearinghouse Nodal Clear are planning to make Circle’s USDC stablecoin eligible as collateral for futures trading beginning next year. While crypto-backed mortgages are still a niche offering, their use is expanding. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, said that many crypto investors have successfully leveraged Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase property without having to sell their holdings. Barclays Blocks Crypto Credit Card Purchases While US financial institutions might be opening up to crypto, Barclays, one of the United Kingdom’s leading banks, will begin blocking cryptocurrency transactions made through its Barclaycard credit cards starting Friday. This is due to the inherent risks tied to digital assets. The bank stated that the move is driven by concerns over the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulatory protections for consumers. According to a notice on its website, Barclays stated that falling crypto prices could leave customers in unmanageable debt, especially given that crypto assets are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something goes wrong. A notice of Barclays website Barclays allowed crypto purchases via its credit cards since at least 2018, giving customers access to crypto markets through major exchanges. Their latest announcement is a huge reversal in policy from a bank that services over five million credit card accounts in the UK. The ban comes during a time of broader debate in the UK over whether additional restrictions should be imposed on using credit to purchase cryptocurrencies. On May 2, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a discussion paper seeking feedback on whether these kinds of transactions should face tighter controls. The Payments Association, a London-based group representing the payments industry, responded critically to the FCA’s suggestion by arguing that it unfairly likens crypto investments to gambling. They pointed out that consumers should have the autonomy to make informed financial decisions within existing credit limits. The Payments Association also mentioned that credit card restrictions already exist for high-risk investments, including crypto. In some cases, banks even block cash purchases of crypto, making credit cards a last resort for some users. However, buying digital assets with a credit card can come at a steep cost. Bankrate reports that many credit card issuers categorize these transactions as cash advances, which often result in higher fees and interest rates. GENIUS and CLARITY Acts Gain Momentum Part of the reason why the US is warming up to crypto could be its recent regulatory progress. In fact, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis said she expects Congress to pass two major crypto bills related to stablecoins and digital asset market structure by the end of 2025. At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Lummis shared some details about the ongoing progress of the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in the House of Representatives and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in the Senate. While she hopes the legislation will pass before the end of this calendar year, she stated she would be “extremely disappointed” if they were not passed by 2026. Lummis chairs the Senate Banking Committee’s digital asset subcommittee, and acknowledged the political difficulty of securing bipartisan support for crypto bills. At a hearing on Tuesday, she pointed out concerns that legislation might benefit individuals with connections to the current administration. She believes it is very important to ensure both sides of the aisle feel involved in the process to avoid partisan resistance. While some Democrats have supported crypto-related legislation, including the GENIUS Act — which passed the Senate with 68 votes, 18 from Democrats — others are still a bit hesitant . Their concerns center around President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the crypto sector, including his issuance of meme coins, his ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and political donations from digital asset industry executives. The path to passage in the House is still uncertain. Lummis’s timeline contrasts with that of Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, He predicted in May that the GENIUS Act could be ready before the congressional recess in August. Trump is also ready to sign the bill without amendments if it passes swiftly through the House. However, with Republicans holding only a slim majority, both the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts will need at least some Democratic support to move forward.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-26 05:32:01

The launch, which took place during a live demonstration with Tawasul Transport, featured the first official ride paid for using AE Coin, signaling the country’s intention to integrate blockchain technology into everyday services. While the pilot program currently supports AE Coin, it has sparked significant interest in the potential for other digital assets to be included, particularly XRP. Known for its fast transaction speeds and institutional use cases, XRP has already gained considerable traction in the UAE through Ripple’s expanding presence. Crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) highlighted the development online, pointing to XRP’s growing footprint in the region and voicing the broader community’s hope that XRP could soon be used for such public-facing transactions.

It recently became the first blockchain-based payments provider to receive regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This milestone has positioned Ripple favorably for future integrations within the region’s evolving financial and service infrastructure. While XRP is not currently included in the Abu Dhabi taxi payment system, Ripple’s momentum suggests that expansion into this space is plausible. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s technology is already being adopted within the UAE government frameworks. The Dubai Land Department has integrated XRP for tokenized land deed transfers , signaling early confidence in the asset’s utility for secure, real-time settlement of high-value transactions. Additionally, Webus International, a Chinese AI-driven transport firm, announced plans to build a $300 million XRP reserve fund , aimed at supporting digital innovation in global mobility sectors, including luxury transport. Strategic Fit for Urban Innovation The adoption of crypto payments for taxis comes at a time when the UAE is accelerating efforts to modernize transportation and shift toward a digital economy. The initiative is part of a broader strategy aimed at enhancing sustainability, reducing cash dependency, and embracing emerging technologies across public services. XRP is becoming a dominant asset in Asia , and although AE Coin was the first to be used in the taxi pilot, the move lays foundational groundwork for broader crypto adoption. Given Ripple’s growing regulatory acceptance and practical deployments across the UAE, XRP remains a likely candidate for future inclusion in transportation-related payment systems.

Key Takeaways: SoFi has reentered the crypto market with trading, remittances, and future DeFi tools. The platform plans to offer stablecoins, staking, and asset-backed borrowing to users. Regulatory shifts in the U.S. have opened the path for SoFi’s renewed crypto strategy. The US-based online banking platform announced Wednesday that it is reintroducing crypto trading and launching blockchain-based international remittances as part of a broader expansion into digital assets. SoFi users will soon be able to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies through their accounts, with future plans to offer stablecoin products, crypto-backed loans, and staking features. SoFi Plans Asset-Backed Borrowing and Expanded Payment Options The company said it aims to create a more comprehensive digital finance experience by expanding payment options and introducing asset-backed borrowing. CEO Anthony Noto said SoFi is “very excited” to leverage blockchain technology across its operations. The planned remittance service will convert fiat to crypto, transmit funds over blockchain rails, and reconvert them into local fiat on the receiving end. “This is just day one,” Noto said, hinting at long-term plans involving crypto, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to improve financial accessibility and cost-efficiency. SoFi’s crypto reboot coincides with projections of rapid industry growth, with the fintech blockchain market expected to reach $49 billion by 2030, up from $3.4 billion in 2024, according to Insider. The firm’s Galileo platform will support third-party crypto infrastructure, including wallets and custody services, positioning SoFi as a serious contender in the expanding digital finance ecosystem. Very excited about the innovation we can drive via blockchain and crypto across our businesses. @Sofi ‘s planned new international payments (frequently called remittances) will convert fiat to crypto, transmit via blockchain, and convert to local fiat.

However, recent shifts in Washington, such as advancing stablecoin legislation and the Federal Reserve’s rollback of “reputational risk” assessments, have opened the door for traditional banks to work more closely with crypto firms. Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) have climbed roughly 12% over the past week, reflecting renewed investor interest in its pivot back to crypto-enabled services. Venture Capital Backing For Crypto Payment Services on the Rise Earlier this year, crypto payment firm RedotPay closed a $40 million Series A funding round , led by Lightspeed with key investments from HSG, Galaxy Ventures, and other prominent investors including DST Global Partners, Accel, and Vertex Ventures. RedotPay’s funding round came shortly after crypto payments firm Mesh raised $82 million in a Series B funding round to expand its blockchain-based settlement network globally. The round was led by Paradigm, with participation from ConsenSys, QuantumLight, Yolo Investments, Evolution VC, Hike Ventures, Opportuna, and AltaIR Capital. Notably, most of the investment was settled using PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, highlighting the growing role of stablecoins in financial transactions. Venture capital firms are increasingly backing projects focused on stablecoin services and financial infrastructure. The sector’s potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions.

Despite a slight dip in the past day, interest in ADA is picking up again driven by rising trading activity and positive ecosystem developments. Coinbase Launches cbADA on Base In a latest update, Coinbase has launched cbADA, a wrapped version of Cardano’s ADA token on the Ethereum Layer 2 chain, Base. This allows Cardano users to tap into a wider range of DeFi protocols. This move is part of Coinbase’s broader push to unify liquidity across blockchains, after its earlier launches like cbETH and the recent cbLTC for Litecoin. Backed 1:1 by ADA held in Coinbase custody, cbADA comes with full proof-of-reserves for transparency. This move could boost ADA’s presence across DeFi platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Aerodrome. cbADA and cbLTC are now live on @base . cbADA and cbLTC are ERC-20 tokens backed 1:1 by ADA and LTC held in custody by Coinbase. Here’s what you need to know ↓ pic.twitter.com/iEUMPOrZYi — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) June 25, 2025 On-Chain and Derivatives Activity Surge ADA’s fundamentals are also showing strength. Its trading volume is close to $600 million, while open interest in Cardano futures jumped to 1.2 billion ADA. The Midnight Glacier airdrop has also sparked fresh interest in Cardano, with over 200,000 mentions on X in a week. Currently, ADA is holding strong near $0.57, with solid support at $0.51. While it may revisit $0.51, it could present a prime buying opportunity for long term holders. Analyst Sees $2 ADA in Sight According to analyst Dan Gambardello , Cardano is setting up for a major move, with $2 as the next big target. It is following a familiar path from the last bull cycle. If history repeats, a quick rally from around $0.59 to $2 could happen in weeks or a few months. Although a dip to $0.30–$0.40 is still possible but that would be normal before a breakout. He believes this cycle is even stronger than the last, with lower interest rates, rising adoption, and pro-crypto regulation. Technical Indicators Remain Cautious Technical indicators show a cautious picture for ADA. Most moving averages are flashing sell signals. The RSI sits at 36.32, close to oversold levels, which shows that a bounce may come soon. ADA is still down 65% from its all-time high of $3.09, and investors are watching closely for either a recovery or another dip. Over the past few days, ADA has attempted to push higher but is facing resistance around the $0.58 level. Buyers will need to step up for ADA to continue its rebound. A clean move above $0.60–$0.62 could open the door for further upside.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|LTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 05:54:44

Key Takeaways: A7A5 processed $9.3B through Grinex, mostly from just 124 wallets. Elliptic and Global Ledger suggest Grinex may be Garantex’s unofficial successor. Analysts question A7A5’s adoption amid concentrated flows and political ties. According to the Financial Times , the bulk of these transactions originated from just 124 wallets, raising questions about the nature of the token’s usage. In March, Global Ledger alleged that operators of the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex have moved liquidity and customer funds to Grinex, which it described as the platform’s “full-fledged successor.” Elliptic Flags A7A5 Transfers as Likely Internal Fund Movements Analysts from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic told the paper that many of the transfers followed “rigid fixed patterns,” hinting at internal fund movement rather than organic adoption. While Grinex has denied direct links to Garantex, evidence suggests the platform may have absorbed some of its clientele. “Garantex users with outstanding balances at the time it was shut down could have these balances credited to new accounts set up on Grinex,” said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson. Garantex was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury and hit with a $27 million USDT freeze by Tether earlier this year. Currently, A7A5 is listed only on Uniswap and has a market cap of $151 million, with roughly 12 million tokens in circulation. Compliance alert: #Garantex founders launch a new platform 1/ Following Garantex’s shutdown and #Tether freezing its wallets, the founders have launched Grinex. Here’s what we’ve uncovered pic.twitter.com/m28einnisn — Global Ledger Alerts (@GlobalLedger) March 19, 2025 It is traded not only against the Russian ruble but also against major stablecoins like USDT and even U.S. dollars, according to Grinex’s Telegram channel. The company behind A7A5 claims the token is fully backed 1:1 by ruble reserves held at Promsvyazbank, a Moscow-based bank under Western sanctions due to its role in Russia’s military financing. Despite its controversial rise, A7A5 has attracted approximately 24,000 holders, based on data from Etherscan and Tronscan. However, analysts remain skeptical of its broader adoption, noting the concentrated transaction activity and opaque origins of many flows. Adding to the intrigue is A7A5’s alleged political connection. The Centre for Information Resilience has reported links between the stablecoin and Ilan Shor, a Moldovan businessman and sanctioned political figure convicted of fraud. Although A7A5 claims to have severed ties with the Shor-related A7 project in May, Shor was seen promoting the stablecoin at Russia’s St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June. Archetyp Market Shut Down in Europol Raid In June, Europol dismantled one of the dark web’s longest-running marketplaces , Archetyp Market, following coordinated raids across six countries. In a similar incident, the US law enforcement seized crypto linked to BidenCash , the infamous dark web marketplace, accused of selling over 15 million stolen credit cards and personal data. The international operation took down around 145 darknet and traditional internet domains associated with the marketplace. Additionally, the DOJ recently seized over $24 million in cryptocurrency from a Russian national accused of developing and operating the Qakbot malware.

Chainlink Has Seen Its Total Holder Count Reach A New High In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Total Amount of Holders metric for Chainlink. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the LINK network that are carrying some non-zero balance. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the value of the metric has changed during the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Total Amount of Holders observed an inflection point earlier this year and has since been climbing up at a notable rate. This suggests that new non-empty wallets are popping up on the network. This kind of trend can arise due to a number of reasons. Fresh investors coming into the space or old ones who sold before making a return naturally contribute to an increase in the indicator. Another factor could be existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes. In general, all of these could be assumed to be occurring simultaneously to a degree whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, the recent uptrend in the metric could indicate that some net adoption (that is, the influx of new investors) has steadily been taking place for Chainlink. Over the past month, 7,903 new non-zero balance addresses have joined the chain, bringing the Total Amount of Holders to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 769,380. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of another indicator: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This metric basically compares how the value held by the BTC investors (the market cap) compares against the value put in by them (the realized cap). In other words, the indicator tells us about the profit-loss balance of the holders. Here, the version of the MVRV Ratio that’s relevant is the 365-day version, capturing the situation of the investors who bought their coins within the past year. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-year MVRV Ratio of Chainlink is currently sitting at a negative 17.3%, an indication that these traders are, on average, holding a loss of 17.3%. Generally, however, investors being underwater isn’t actually a bad thing for the cryptocurrency. This is because holders in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling. As such, Santiment notes that the trend in the 365-day MVRV Ratio could suggest the asset’s “long-term investing timeframe is in an opportunity zone.” LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $13.15, up more than 2% in the last seven days.

Announced in a June 25 blog post, the license allows the exchange to scale its regulated services across all 30 European Economic Area (EEA) member states. With this authorization, Kraken can offer a broader range of fully regulated products, including trading, derivatives, and payments solutions, building on its existing Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registrations in several key European markets, such as France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1937944560165908926?s=46 The MiCA greenlight follows Kraken’s acquisition of a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license through its Cyprus-regulated entity in February. Kraken Co-CEO Arjun Sethi celebrated the latest milestone, highlighting that it reflects the exchange’s broader efforts to meet regulatory standards across Europe. “Securing a license from the Central Bank of Ireland, with its long heritage and experience as a rigorous financial regulator, isn’t just about compliance. It’s a powerful signal of Kraken’s commitment to expanding the crypto ecosystem through responsible innovation,” he said in the statement.

According to a June 26 filing , Invesco and Galaxy’s proposed fund will offer direct exposure to Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the proposed Solana fund would hold the asset directly under a commodity trust structure. The fund would trade under the ticker symbol “QSOL” on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Coinbase Custody set to act as custodian for the underlying Solana assets. The ETF may also stake a portion of its SOL holdings to earn additional token rewards, which would be treated as income to the trust. Wednesday’s submission is a Form S-1 registration statement, which informs the commission of the intent to launch a new security. However, before the ETF can be listed, Invesco and Galaxy must also file a Form 19b-4, which proposes a rule change and initiates the formal review process. The SEC will then determine whether the product meets regulatory standards under the Securities Exchange Act.

Other applicants that have filed for Solana ETFs, including VanEck, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Fidelity, are already awaiting SEC review as momentum builds around altcoin ETFs. So far, the SEC has delayed decisions on several Solana ETF applications and has since requested updates from issuers, but has not ruled out eventual approval. The final decision deadline on many of these filings falls in October. However, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have speculated the SEC may act on Solana ETF applications as early as July, with a 90% likelihood of approval. As of now, altcoin ETFs remain unapproved in the United States, with current spot approvals limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the existence of CME-listed Solana futures and growing institutional interest in the asset have strengthened the case for a spot product.

Pivotal Regulatory Catalyst: The potential passage of “GENIUS Act” could solidify USDC's market-leading position as a regulated digital dollar. High Valuation Sets Up a Risk: With hype pushing its ultra-high Price-to-Book multiple, a quick correction is a high risk. Discernible Headwinds: Material risks to the business are potential downturns in interest rates, intense competition with other stablecoins (essentially Tether's USDT), and considerable potential selling pressure.

Get published, earn money, and unlock exclusive SA Premium access. Click here to find out more » Our overall view of Circle Internet Group, Inc. (CRCL) is neutral with cautious optimism, balancing recent favorable market events with inbuilt uncertainties. The stock's strong trend at present is likely to persist for some time, with optimism in market sentiment for stablecoin usage. However, one should be cautious that there are strong and tangible risks associated with the stock, so far, necessitating caution. Investors should therefore closely watch US stablecoin regulation evolution and Federal Reserve policy before assuming a buy position at current levels to make informed choices. 2025Q1 Financial Performance Highlights Circle registered high financial growth in Q1 2025, registering a growth of almost 60% year-over-year in revenues, purely on account of interest income accrued on its USCoin USD (USDC-USD) reserves. While a huge decline was registered in net profit margin, both adjusted EBITDA and absolute net income registered positive growth, giving a healthy indication of high operational efficiency excluding non-cash and financing expenses. Financial Metric Mar 2025 ((USD)) Y/Y Change Reserve Income 557.9M 55.13% Total Revenue 578.6M 58.47% Distribution Costs 347.6M 68.15% Operating Expense 137.9M 30.12% Adjusted EBITDA 122.4M 60.55% Net Income 64.8M 33.21% Net Profit Margin 11.20% -15.94% Company Business and Revenue Model Stablecoin (USDC & EURC) The engine behind this stellar first-line performance is the stablecoin business of Circle. It earns interest on the massive stockpiles of money and government securities that collateralize each USDC issued. In the first quarter of 2025, this interest income made up more than 96% of revenues. Accordingly, the company's profitability is exceptionally interest-rate sensitive. These revenues are determined primarily by two dynamic factors: Interest Rates : If the U.S. Federal Reserve increases or decreases rates, the yield on Circle's reserves is directly impacted, affecting revenues. USDC in Circulation : A greater quantity of USDC in the market requires a greater reserve fund, thus generating a greater quantity of interest income. The company understands that forecasting its performance in the future is not easy, describing the interaction of user behavior with interest rates as ""complex, highly uncertain, and unproven"". For example, at higher rates, will investors redeem their USDC to put money into a traditional high-interest savings account? Or will investors hold their USDC because it is convenient to use to make digital payables and trades? To make a direct comparison to rate change impacts, Circle also simulated a fictional scenario with a stable USDC circulatory volume of 2025 at the IPO prospectus . With this foundation, a 1% (100bps) rise or fall of the interest rate would mean a $441 million boost or loss of reserve income. source : IPO prospectus Strategic Entry to Tokenized Money Market Funds Most stablecoins, including USDC, don't pay interest. TMMFs, by contrast, are a relatively new financial product that tokenizes the traditional money market funds. These funds invest in the safe and liquid assets like banks deposits and U.S. Treasuries to keep the net asset value (NAV) stable. While stablecoins do not pay interest, TMMFs do pay interest to the token holders. In the current high interest rate environment, the option to invest in TMMFs or other yield-bearing digital assets has become increasingly attractive relative to holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, especially for those planning to hold these assets for an extended period of time. Moreover, TMMFs are increasingly being accepted as collateral for margin trading. For instance, CFTC market advisory committee approved the recommendations to adopt DLT and tokenized assets as collateral for margin, indicating growing acceptance. Therefore, TMMFs become more readily accessible and widely integrated on blockchains as a form of collateral in margin trading. To capitalize on these emerging market trends and diversify its revenues, Circle is positioning itself to strategically enter Tokenized Money Market Funds (TMMFs). In an effort to accelerate this plan, Circle acquired Hashnote Holdings LLC on January 21, 2025, to include the USYC tokenized fund in its portfolio. USYC was one of the largest onchain TMMFs on March 31, 2025, with approximately $663.7 million under management. Circle wants to onboard USYC into its network to enable eligible non-U.S. customers to switch seamlessly from non-yield-bearing stablecoins like USDC to the yield-bearing USYC. That also poses a challenge to USDC. With TMMFs increasingly becoming popular as a type of collateral used in trading, a movement to TMMFs is likely to negatively impact the competitiveness and adoption of USDC as a collateral used in margin trading. Future Growth Drivers Circle's future growth is underpinned by several key opportunities: Regulatory Clarity Rapid expansions in stablecoins pose threats to the safeguard of the consumers, market stability and even its viability for the illicit activities like the money laundering. GENIUS Act, an acronym for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, is an important proposed legislation to govern payment stablecoins in the United States. The GENIUS Act attempts to resolve such problems by enacting an extensive federal regime of regulation and seeking a middle ground between innovation and safety. GENIUS Act has various intricate provisions to accomplish its goals, such as full reserve support, monthly reviews, as well as anti-money laundering requirements. Senate passed the GENIUS Act on June 18, 2025, by a vote of 68-30. The bill still faces hurdles in the Republican-controlled House, but its passage through the Senate is a turning point. The possible signing into law of the ""GENIUS Act"" would witness a federal framework governing stablecoins, to the possible advantage of an issuer such as Circle that is focused on compliance. Ecosystem Expansion Cooperative relations with payment behemoths such as Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, Worldpay, and MoneyGram are essential to bringing USDC into global trade and reaching mainstream adoption. Market Leadership According to the report published by Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets , the current stablecoin market is just 1% of the U.S. M2 money supply and 1% of international currency trades. It is likely to reach 10% of such markets with the increasing legitimacy of the sector, and Circle is well positioned to capture a substantial portion of this growth. Significant Risks to Consider Despite such heartening prompts, prospective investors have to offset some considerable risks: Valuation Concerns Based on the IPO prospectus, post-IPO net tangible book value per share was $7. At the close price of $222.65 (June 24), this translates to a high 31.8 Price-to-Book (P/B) multiple. Such massive premium is fueled based on market hype about stablecoin usage, a thesis that is most likely to see significant reversion. source : IPO prospectus Macroeconomic Headwinds Circle's business is highly sensitive to U.S. rates. A Federal Reserve pivot to a cycle of rate cuts would directly harm the company's core source of revenues. Intense Competition The company is also under constant pressure to compete with market capitalization leading Tether (USDT) and other emerging stablecoins. Post-IPO Selling Pressure Up to the second trading day after Circle's public release of its June 30, 2025, quarterly results, about 1.4 million Class A shares will be released from lock-up restrictions. These shares belong to non-selling stockholders of employees and Section 16 officers at the IPO, and represent 15% of their holdings. The rest lock-up agreements of majority of other insiders (directors, executive officers, selling stockholders, and major shareholders) also expire on the earlier of: 1) The second trading day after the public release of Circle's September 30, 2025, quarterly results. Or 2) 180 days after the IPO prospectus date. These announcements are likely to lead to a sizable increase in the amount of shares available to be sold on the market, and thus have a bearing on the stock price. Conclusion: A Persuasive Thesis Qualified with Circumspection The overall view of Circle is Neutral with Cautious Optimism. Circle Internet Group has a distinct investment thesis, offering a direct exposure to the digital asset economy's underlying infrastructure through a very profitable business model. With its compliance-driven outlook, the company is better positioned to achieve long-term success, provided a clear framework is established at the U.S. level. However, the ""Neutral"" recommendation is driven by tangible and sizable risks. Exceptionally high valuation depends on flawless execution and a continuing benign macroeconomic environment. Both risks of sensitivity to the interest rate, stiff competition, and imminent share unlock align to produce considerable downside volatility. Investors should therefore pay incredibly close attention to stablecoin regulation and Federal Reserve policy prior to considering a purchase at the current levels of discussed valuation.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-26 06:11:32

This makes it the first decentralized data collection app available directly through the wallet, representing a milestone for artificial intelligence development and blockchain interoperability. A decentralized solution to better AI training OORT’s pitch is simple: training better AI starts with better data. The company says centralized collection methods aren’t cutting it, they’re expensive, slow to scale, and often miss out on diverse or high-quality input. DataHub flips the model: anyone can contribute useful data and earn rewards in Tehter ( USDT ). It’s already catching on. OORT says it has over 300,000 registered users, with 80,000+ logging in daily.

Many now believe it could even surpass Shiba Inu in market cap by 2026. But while Pepe’s climb is grabbing attention, a new player called Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the real story especially with its token presale heating up and a platform built to solve real-world problems that meme coins never address. Let’s get into the details surrounding the PEPE and SHIB rivalry and why RTX is worth keeping an eye on. Pepe surges amid bullish sentiment, eyes Shiba Inu flip by 2026 PEPE price analysis. Source: Crypto.news Pepe recently surged to $0.000010, its highest level since February, climbing 65% from its yearly low. Trading volume exploded by 140% to $1.2 billion overtaking meme coins like Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Floki. This rise came as investor sentiment turned bullish, with Bitcoin crossing $100,000 and the overall crypto market shifting into “greed” mode. Adding to the momentum, Pepe’s futures open interest hit $475 million its highest since January while fewer tokens on exchanges hint that holders aren’t selling. Analysts see bullish patterns like a falling wedge and double-bottom, suggesting a rally to $0.00001545 is possible, with some even eyeing a Shiba Inu flip by 2026. Shiba Inu rebounds as whales scoop up over 10 trillion tokens Following a weekend of global tension that wiped out $250 billion from the crypto market, Shiba Inu dropped nearly 9% before bouncing back with a 9.18% gain on June 23. This recovery was fueled by whales who bought 10.4 trillion tokens worth $114 million in just 24 hours. This marked their largest daily buy since January, lifting their total holdings from 182.47 trillion to 192.87 trillion. SHIB 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite mixed whale behavior, with some large holders selling, the increased long positions and exchange reserves show renewed confidence in SHIB’s future. As shown in the daily charts, Shiba Inu is 19.06% down for the month, however, 88% of the community sentiment is bullish, suggesting many investors believe the meme coin could rally again soon. How Remittix makes crypto spendable, convertible and investable Remittix is designed not just as a token, but as a full remittance and payment ecosystem that bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance. One standout feature is its fiat gateway integration. This lets users convert crypto into local currencies and withdraw directly into bank accounts, making crypto spending in real life finally practical especially in underserved regions. The RTX token i tself is more than just a digital coin. It has actual utility. Holders benefit from lower fees, quicker transaction times, and premium features within the ecosystem. This kind of integration adds real value to the token beyond just price speculation. A strong example of how all these features connect: imagine a freelance graphic designer in Ghana working with a U.S.-based client. With Remittix, the client pays in USDT, the funds are converted instantly to Ghanaian cedis and the money lands in the designer’s bank account within hours far cheaper and faster than any traditional service. Analysts forecast RTX could soar 348% to $0.35 by 2026 As for the presale, Remittix has already raised over $15.8 million, with more than 546 million tokens sold. At the current price of $0.0781, early investors are racing to buy before the next price jump to $0.0811 a projected 3.8% increase. Analysts predict RTX could easily hit $0.35 by early 2026, a 348% rise from current levels, with some even suggesting a long-term potential of $1.20 a staggering 1,437% increase.

Multi-year support being found at the one-year moving average, and not too far extended from that average.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Lastly, he says Bitcoin’s recent sideways price action, including a temporary dip into the $90,000 level, is likely due to geopolitical concerns. “BTC continued consolidation.

Details regarding the airdrop mechanism and distribution will be released once trading begins. Other major exchanges such as Bitget, Gate.io, MEXC, and KuCoin will also begin trading for CESS at 10:00 UTC today. Since the CESS Network’s mainnet has not yet launched, per the latest tokenomics documentation, the token is initially being issued on the BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20 standard). A mainnet launch is expected in the coming months, after which the BEP-20 CESS tokens will be swappable 1:1 for native tokens through an official cross-chain bridge or token migration mechanism supported by the CESS team.

CESS serves as the native utility token within the CESS ecosystem, used for paying storage fees, staking by node operators, rewarding verifiers, and participating in decentralized governance. In December 2023, CESS raised $8 million in a Series A funding round led by DWF Labs, HTX Ventures, Web3 Foundation, and Infinity Ventures Crypto, with participation from other strategic backers. The capital was reportedly used to expand core infrastructure, support mainnet readiness, and scale adoption among AI and decentralized data platforms.

But as hype fades and real utility takes center stage, newer contenders like Ondo Finance, Kaspa and the new Pay-Fi network, Remittix are emerging as smarter bets for those chasing life-changing returns. Unlike Dogecoin, which leans heavily on internet memes, or Pi Network, still stuck in a vague phase of development, Remittix offers a working product, real-world use cases, and powerful tokenomics that position it as a serious candidate for 1000%+ growth. Let’s learn more about Remittix and why its token along with Ondo and KAS are so promising. Ondo Finance Launches Alliance to Expand Access to Tokenized Securities Ondo Finance has announced a major step forward in making real-world assets like stocks and ETFs easier to access through blockchain technology. On June 17, the company launched the Global Markets Alliance, teaming up with major crypto players such as Solana Foundation, Fireblocks, Trust Wallet, and others. The announcement comes as Ondo prepares to launch its Global Markets platform, which will allow users outside the U.S. to directly access American securities through crypto apps and wallets. ONDO 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite a 17.25% price drop this month, 86% of voters remain bullish. This shows that investor confidence in Ondo Finance’s long-term vision stays strong. Kaspa Surges as GHOSTDAG Boosts Speed, Security, and Market Momentum Kaspa has made a name for itself with its recently launched GHOSTDAG protocol, a faster and more scalable alternative to traditional blockchains. Unlike older systems, Kaspa’s GHOSTDAG protocol maintains strong Proof-of-Work security while drastically reducing wait times. Now processing over 3 blocks per second, Kaspa is the fastest PoW Layer 1, with OKX Wallet integration expanding its global reach. KAS 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Following this tech-driven momentum, Kaspa’s native token KAS is showing signs of revival after weeks of decline. It surged nearly 15%, closing above its 9-day moving average for the first time since early June. Traders are watching closely to see if it can break above the $0.077 resistance level, which could open the door to $0.080 or higher. Remittix revolutionizes remittance with speed, simplicity, and low fees Remittix is already making waves in the remittance and cross-border payments space by blending the speed of crypto with the reach of traditional banking. It’s built for users who want the flexibility of blockchain but with the familiar experience of apps like PayPal or CashApp. One of the standout features is its impressively low transaction fees. Unlike the high charges tied to services like Western Union or PayPal, Remittix ensures that users keep more of their funds, whether they’re sending $50 or $5,000. A small business paying remote freelancers overseas, for example, would find this particularly cost-effective. Speed is also a major strength. Traditional international transfers often take two to five business days. With Remittix, most transactions are processed within 24 hours—sometimes much faster. This rapid delivery builds trust among users who rely on timely transfers, such as expatriates sending money home. Remittix presale gains momentum with 1,000% growth potential on the horizon While Dogecoin and Pi Network continue to trend online, Remittix is becoming impossible to ignore in the conversation about the best sub-$1 cryptos to buy now. Currently in presale, Remittix offers RTX tokens at just $0.0781. The platform has already raised over $15.8 million and sold more than 546 million tokens. Analysts speculate that RTX could reach $0.50 within the next few months—a 540% increase from its current value. Some even project a long-term target of $1.00 if adoption grows, marking over 1,180% in potential gains.

While Bitcoin continues to lead the way, altcoins are setting up for some interesting moves too. Bitcoin at Key Resistance: Breakout or Pullback? As of now, Bitcoin is testing an important resistance zone between $109,000 and $111,000. While the fundamentals like stock market stability, a steady volatility index, and a growing Coinbase Bitcoin premium are looking positive, analysts are divided on whether Bitcoin can break above this level in the short term. While there’s strong bullish momentum right now, the volume isn’t quite high enough for a confirmed breakout. If Bitcoin gets rejected at this resistance, it could see a pullback before any new highs. Ethereum and XRP: Lagging Behind, But Watching Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) and XRP haven’t kept up with Bitcoin’s recent surge. Ethereum especially looks weak, still stuck below its key resistance level and struggling to attract volume. XRP, too, is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s moves and may need a pullback before any serious rally. Altcoins: Calm Before the Storm? Altcoins in general have stabilized but remain at risky levels. A short-term pullback in altcoins is likely before a possible bounce and more sustained upside. The open interest in altcoins remains high, keeping things volatile, but if Bitcoin can hold its ground, altcoins might follow suit soon. However, crypto trader JRNY Crypto is positive about what’s coming next. According to him, Bitcoin reaching $125,000 could kick off a mini altcoin season. If it crosses $150,000, a bigger rally might follow, and if Bitcoin pushes above $180,000, the market could enter a massive, parabolic altcoin season.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 07:09:23

These assets are fully backed by ADA and LTC locked in Coinbase custody, minted and burned on demand at a one-to-one ratio, with regular proof-of-reserves to back up the claims. Data shows over 11,300 wrapped LTC and 2.9 million wrapped ADA have already been minted on Base and are actively circulating. Coinbase has previously issued versions of bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, XRP XRP, and dogecoin (DOGE on Base, creating one of the most comprehensive cross-chain ecosystems in layer 2. Wrapped tokens solve the interoperability puzzle. ADA and LTC are native to other blockchains and cannot be directly used on Ethereum or dependent layer 2s, such as Base. However, using wrapped tokens allows holders and users to interact in onchain activities like yield farming, liquidity pools, trading, and lending — all without selling their original tokens. Base's total value locked (TVL) is just over $3 billion as of Thursday, and ecosystem projects may offer liquidity mining incentives for these newer assets to capture value (and make fees in the process).

The final requirement? Profitability. Thanks to a recent accounting rule change, Bitcoin could be the catalyst that gets them there. With 592,345 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $63.7 billion, MicroStrategy is on track to post one of its most profitable quarters—but only if Bitcoin stays above $95,240 by June 30. What’s Holding MicroStrategy Back? To qualify for the S&P 500, a company must meet these criteria: Be based in the U.S. Have a large market capitalization Maintain adequate share float and trading volume Post positive earnings over the past four quarters MicroStrategy satisfies the first three. However, under previous accounting rules, it had to record unrealized Bitcoin losses—even without selling. These losses kept its earnings negative. According to a post by Bitcoin advocate Alex on X , this was the main obstacle preventing S&P 500 inclusion. Why June 30 Is a Pivotal Date A new accounting rule now allows companies to include fair-value gains from Bitcoin in quarterly earnings. This means if Bitcoin remains above $95,240, MicroStrategy’s profits for Q2 could turn sharply positive—meeting the final S&P 500 requirement. Analyst Jeff Walton points out that such a price level would erase previous losses and unlock S&P eligibility. Current BTC price: $107,753 Q2 performance: +29.2% Probability of Bitcoin holding above $95,240: 91% What Happens If MicroStrategy Is Added? If MicroStrategy joins the S&P 500, every major index fund will be required to include MSTR in their holdings. This creates indirect exposure to Bitcoin across the entire U.S. index ecosystem. Alex notes this could bring a new level of mainstream legitimacy and adoption for Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin Investors Should Watch This Closely MicroStrategy’s potential S&P 500 inclusion could: Accelerate institutional interest in Bitcoin Increase demand for BTC-backed stocks Further cement Bitcoin’s place in traditional finance As June 30 approaches, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s price. If it holds above the $95,240 threshold, MicroStrategy may finally enter the S&P 500, bringing Bitcoin with it.

The rally has now entered a critical red supply zone between $108,000 and $110,000, where historical rejections have often triggered consolidation phases. Price is pausing just below this resistance, and several indicators hint at an imminent inflection. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) From a multi-timeframe perspective, Bitcoin price action has flipped bullish after a breakout from the descending channel seen on the daily and 4-hour charts. The current rally originated from a liquidity sweep near $98,000, forming a bullish order block and reclaiming the broken structure. BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Price is now testing the same region that caused the last rejection near $108,000. The 1D chart shows this area aligning with the upper trendline projection, where BTC reversed in early June.

One month later, the data supports that decision. According to CME’s official update on X, over 24,600 contracts have already been traded, totaling more than $542.8 million in notional volume. Notably, nearly half of that activity came from outside the United States. This international demand shows the broad appeal of XRP. CME described XRP as “one of the most watched crypto assets,” emphasizing its role in a rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. These futures contracts provide exposure to XRP price movements without requiring direct asset custody. This gives more room for accessible risk management and portfolio diversification. The interest in these products shows that investors are eager to engage with XRP. Since launching on May 19, XRP and Micro XRP futures have shown demand across institutional and retail participants, highlighting interest in regulated tools to access one of the most watched crypto assets.

This immediate traction signaled strong interest from a mix of ETF issuers, institutional players, and retail traders. According to CME, open interest in the contracts has climbed steadily, with $70.5 million currently held in active positions. The trend illustrates continued engagement rather than a brief spike in interest. A trading activity chart included in CME’s breakdown shows a clear upward trajectory in volume, XRP equivalents, and open interest throughout the first month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Moves and Ledger Growth Support Outlook The trading performance of XRP futures aligns with broader developments around the asset. In its 2025 XRP outlook, CME notes that the XRP Ledger has seen increased usage, along with growth in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. A key driver behind this growth is Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road , which CME called a strategic move to strengthen XRP’s role in institutional finance. Notably, Hidden Road cleared the first block trade on CME after the XRP futures launch, and the acquisition is expected to support cross-margining between traditional and digital assets. CME also highlighted the launch of RLUSD, as it boosts transaction liquidity, enhances adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and aids XRP’s goal of becoming a global reserve asset . XRP is set to see broader institutional adoption as Ripple’s innovations drive real-world use, and CME’s data signals accelerating demand for regulated XRP exposure.

My career began in the IT sector, where I worked for multiple global technology firms and managed projects across diverse regulatory and cultural landscapes.

What’s the Dubai advantage? CoinW at an event in Dubai A: Dubai is often called the “crypto capital of the world.” The UAE’s progressive, transparent, and business-friendly regulatory framework sets it apart from other countries.

It is driven by the principles of integrity, data-driven analysis, and long-term value creation. We don’t chase hype or market trends. Instead, we rely on our proprietary SCORE model developed by CoinW Research.

According to analysts, the current altcoin winter may continue for a while due to various factors. One of these reasons is that most of the market continues to ignore altcoins, with focus primarily on Bitcoin (BTC). The data shows that while most of the market dipped following the US strikes on Iran, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered quite well, and is now above $103,000, after briefly falling below $100,000. Another reason has been the flood of meme coins into the crypto space. For instance, the pump.fun meme coin platform has created over 6 million meme coins, which has left many newbies confused about which meme coin to purchase. Amid these market conditions, investors are looking into tokens at the bargain-basement pricing, which have real utility and massive upside. One of the main candidates that meets all these conditions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, the presale for MUTM tokens is doing well and promises to be one of the biggest gainers of 2025 when it goes live. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where it has raised over $11.2 million so far from around 12,450 buyers. At the current price of $0.03, it represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This trend will continue until the final listing price of $0.06. As such, buyers in phase 5 are getting their tokens at a generous 50% discount. Not wanting to miss out on massive gains, investors have bought 50% of the tokens, barely a week after they launched. Another factor pushing the presale forward is the positive forecasts by analysts. According to the analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4,500% once they go live. Based on this forecast, a $1,800 investment in the presale at the current price could grow to $81,000. On any scale, that is a massive return that is getting rarer to find in the crypto market. Best of all, the value of MUTM tokens is expected to continue growing, thanks to the design of the protocol. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to offer stable, long-term returns for its holders. One of the ways in which the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to support the long-term value of MUTM tokens is via a buyback and distribution program. In this program, they will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market, which will be distributed to stakers on the platform. These purchases will support the long-term growth of the tokens, helping to attract even more buyers. As a result, it will create a sustainable process of upward growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders on the protocol, they deposit funds, which they can use to earn an annual percentage yield (APY). The yield rate in a pool is determined by the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it pushes up the interest rate, which causes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it incentivizes new lenders to join in to benefit from the higher yields. The result is a cycle of liquidity growth and growing user participation that ensures the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Additionally, the design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency. To put it into perspective, if a lender were to deposit $5,000 worth of AVAX in a pool, and the utilization rises, that could push the yield to 20%. An APY of 20% means that the owner would receive $1,000 worth of AVAX on their deposit. That is a convenient means to earn passive income with the least amount of effort possible. To protect lenders on the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) requires that all loans be overcollateralized. It ensures that all borrowers deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of their deposit. That ensures that if there is rapid price movement that lowers the value of the collateral, liquidators have a buffer in which they can step in and purchase the collateral at a discount. As a result, the protocol is stabilized, while lenders get their full amount back. Conclusion The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is what happens when ingenuity meets determination. By creating real-world utility, it ensures that the value of MUTM tokens will continue to grow over time. The current 50% discount on the tokens in the ongoing presale presents a lucrative opportunity to secure massive gains amid turmoil in the rest of the market. Do not miss this gem of a token that could deliver 45x gains.

Here’s How Crypto Is Entering the Real Estate Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, many investors wonder how useful their crypto is in daily life. In a big development, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency took a bold step by allowing cryptocurrencies to be counted as assets in mortgage applications. Crypto Now Counts for Home Loans! This new rule means crypto holdings can now help people qualify for loans. It’s a positive move for crypto users and a sign that digital assets are becoming a regular part of the financial system. From rising prices to new rules that recognize digital assets, XRP is stepping out of the trading charts. How much XRP would you need to purchase a home in the United States? Let us explore the details as ChatGPT reveals the answer. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.19. The median price for a typical home in the U.S. is approximately $420,000, though this can vary by state, city, and property type. If one were to pay the full cost of the home using XRP, one would need about 192,000 XRP. This is calculated by dividing the home price of $420,000 by the XRP price at $2.19. This amount would cover a typical home purchase in an average market without a mortgage or loan. How Much XRP for a Down Payment? A 20% down payment on a median-priced home would require approximately 38,400 XRP at the current market rate. In high-value real estate markets such as San Francisco or New York City, where property prices often exceed $1 million, the total XRP required for a full purchase could cross 450,000. These figures clearly show how the number of tokens required rise with the property’s value. Also, XRP’s price is highly volatile, so the number of tokens needed may shift over time. At the current price of $2.19, purchasing a median-priced home in the U.S. would take approximately 190,000 to 200,000 XRP. A Larger Shift Globally This shift is part of a larger trend. Japan’s Open House Group now accepts XRP for real estate purchases. Buyers can use XRP to purchase properties in cities like Tokyo and Osaka. The company, already supporting Bitcoin and Ethereum, recently expanded its crypto payment options to include XRP, SOL, and DOGE. Dubai is also using XRP Ledger to Tokenize Real Estate. These moves reflect a growing global trend of using XRP for real-world payments.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 07:44:45

He stated that her ruling could redefine the legal status of digital assets in the United States. This interpretation quickly circulated across social media, fueling speculation about a landmark ruling. However, attorney Bill Morgan, widely respected for his analysis of the case, corrected Squire’s assessment of the lawsuit’s current status. Morgan clarified that the upcoming decision will not reshape the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Instead, it pertains specifically to the joint motion recently filed by both Ripple and the SEC, focusing on remedies rather than the underlying legal status of XRP or digital assets in general. This is incorrect. The decision on the joint motion filed last week will be an indicative ruling on whether there are exceptional circumstances to warrant the Court reducing the penalty and dissolving the injunction.

This process does not revisit or alter the core legal questions settled in the summary judgment issued in July 2023 . Morgan attached a screenshot from this ruling, which stated that “the Parties here do not seek to vacate, amend, or modify the Summary Judgment Order.” It further adds that the order will “remain untouched and will continue to bind the parties under the principles of claim and issue preclusion.” This means that the court’s landmark determination, which found that XRP sales on secondary markets did not constitute securities transactions, remains intact and unaffected by the current proceedings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Scope of the Current Proceedings The distinction is crucial. While some observers, including Squire, frame the forthcoming ruling as one that could redefine the status of digital assets nationwide, Morgan stressed that this is inaccurate. The decision is procedural and limited in scope, dealing exclusively with whether Ripple’s penalty should be adjusted and whether the injunction initially sought by the SEC should be dissolved. After the court denied the first joint motion , Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, explained that XRP’s status remains intact , and the remedy the parties are seeking will not modify any part of that ruling. Despite the excitement generated by recent commentary, the Ripple vs SEC case is not about to deliver a new ruling on the status of crypto assets. Instead, the court’s focus is firmly on resolving remaining issues, including lowering Ripple’s penalty and removing the permanent injunction preventing institutional sales.

The acquisition pushed its total holdings to 12,345 BTC, secured at an average price of $98,303 per coin. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy With this latest addition , Metaplanet has now surpassed Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC, to become the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as it continued with its aggressive accumulation strategy. Announcing the latest milestone, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich tweeted , “1, 2, 3, 4, 5… liftoff. We just climbed past Tesla on the BTC leaderboard. Bolder. Faster. Harder. Elon Musk – meet you on Mars.” The move comes shortly after the firm raised ¥74.9 billion (approximately $515 million), a significant funding round aimed primarily at expanding its Bitcoin treasury. The capital raise was facilitated through the exercise of 540,000 stock-acquisition rights by Metaplanet’s primary backer, EVO Fund, which resulted in the issuance of 54 million new shares. This represents nearly a third of the company’s 20th warrant series, with a significant number of rights still unconverted. The purchase also aligns with Metaplanet’s broader goal to acquire 1% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million coins. This ambition would place it among the most committed corporate adopters of the world’s leading asset. Metaplanet’s $5.4B “555 Million Plan” Earlier this year, the company unveiled its “555 Million Plan,” wherein it proposed the issuance of 555 million new shares to raise roughly $5.4 billion for future bitcoin purchases. That plan represents a 92% dilution of existing shares and is part of a larger roadmap to amass 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Looking further ahead, Metaplanet has outlined targets of reaching 100,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. This scale of accumulation is matched only by the business intelligence company Strategy, which is currently the top corporate holder with over 592,300 BTC. Data from BitcoinTreasuries revealed that Marathon Digital Holdings stands second in line with 49,179 BTC, followed by Riot Platforms with 19,225 BTC, and CleanSpark with 12,502 BTC, respectively.

At the same time, the euro held near a three-and-a-half-year high. The overall mood in the markets improved after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran appeared to hold, easing fears of oil supply disruptions and lifting market sentiment. Still, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific stocks was up only slightly, while Tokyo’s Nikkei climbed 1.6 percent to reach a four-month peak. At the same time, South Korea’s Kospi dipped by 1.07 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was also down by 0.3% while the CSI 300 remained mostly steady. Dollar hit fresh 3.5 year lows on the Euro Pressure on the U.S. dollar intensified after media reports suggested Trump might announce a proposed replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell by September or October. That speculation drove the euro up to $1.6837, its strongest level since November 2021. The Swiss franc also firmed to a ten-year high, and the Japanese yen was up 0.3 percent to 144.815 per dollar. Trump has been criticizing Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively and has even hinted at firing him, moves that have rattled investor confidence in U.S. assets and raised questions about the Fed’s independence. The U.S. dollar index lied at its weakest since March 2022, down roughly 10 percent so far this year as investors, worried by Trump’s tariff threats and their possible impact on economic growth, seek alternatives. At the same time, Gold edged up on Thursday due to the weakening dollar . Spot gold increased by 0.1 percent to $3,336.02 per ounce by 06:40 GMT. US Gold futures increased by 0.2 percent to $3,349.30. It was expected of gold, as the bullion continues to do well during uncertain periods. Oil prices edged up while US stocks made mixed moves In energy markets, Brent crude futures nudged up 0.8 percent to $68.21 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up by 0.9 percent to $65.48, as traders continued to digest the impact of the Middle East tensions on supply. Equity futures also ticked higher early on Thursday. S&P 500 futures rose 0.12 percent, and Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.17 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was up 38 points, or 0.09 percent. This followed Wednesday’s session in which the S&P 500 closed flat, the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3 percent, and the Dow fell by 0.25 percent (106.59 points). Despite those mixed moves, all three indexes remain on track for weekly gains, and the S&P 500 sits less than 1 percent below record high in February.

46809250,https://coinpedia.org/?p=474995,1750924398,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,FactCheck: Is Jack Dorsey Satoshi Nakamoto?,https://coinpedia.org/news/factcheck-is-jack-dorsey-satoshi-nakamoto/,"The post FactCheck: Is Jack Dorsey Satoshi Nakamoto? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A viral theory circulating online claims that Jack Dorsey — the former CEO of Twitter and founder of Block (formerly Square) — might be the creator of Bitcoin , Satoshi Nakamoto.The theory, brought back into the spotlight by crypto trader James Wynn , is full of odd coincidences and symbols that make some people believe Jack Dorsey could be the hidden creator of Bitcoin. Claim Jack Dorsey is Satoshi Nakamoto Verdict False Fact-Check by Coinpedia Our research found no credible or verifiable evidence to support this claim. The theory is built on coincidences and online speculation, not facts. Who Made This Claim? The theory recently went viral after crypto trader James Wynn posted a thread suggesting Dorsey could be Satoshi. Matthew Sigel (former Head of Digital Asset Research at VanEck) and Seán Murray also hinted at similar ideas in the past. Coinpedia’s Key Findings and Counter-Evidence 1. Coincidental Timelines and Symbolism Are Not Proof The viral post highlights Dorsey’s 2003 bio mentioning crypto, pseudonyms, and “4 AM hack” sessions, which are said to match timestamps in Bitcoin’s code. However, Coinpedia points out these are circumstantial and not unique to Dorsey. The supposed sailor’s saying in the original Bitcoin code is cited as a nod to Dorsey’s sailing background, but this is speculative and not a direct link. 2. No Concrete Technical or Blockchain Evidence Claims about a Bitcoin address labeled “jD2m” being tied to Dorsey’s San Francisco location are unsubstantiated. There is no verifiable blockchain or cryptographic evidence connecting Dorsey to Satoshi’s wallets or code commits. Coinpedia notes that while Dorsey is a vocal Bitcoin supporter and has worn Satoshi-themed shirts, advocacy does not equate to authorship. 3. Public Behavior and Communication Style Differ Dorsey’s communication style and public persona are well-documented and differ significantly from Satoshi’s writing style in emails and forum posts . Dorsey has publicly supported Bitcoin projects and spoken openly about his involvement, while Satoshi remained anonymous and distanced from all publicity. 4. Time Constraints and Professional Commitments Coinpedia and other researchers highlight that Dorsey was deeply involved in running Twitter (now x) and later Square during the years Satoshi was most active. The enormous time and technical commitment required to create and launch Bitcoin would have been nearly impossible to conceal alongside Dorsey’s public roles. 5. No Cryptographic Proof or Wallet Movement There is no evidence that Dorsey controls any of Satoshi’s original Bitcoin wallets . The early coins attributed to Satoshi have never been moved, and no one has demonstrated the ability to sign a message with Satoshi’s private keys. 6. Community and Expert Skepticism Coinpedia references skepticism from leading crypto researchers, such as Jameson Lopp and BitMEX Research, who argue that the theory relies on unreliable patterns and speculative links, not on hard facts. BitMEX Research, for example, challenges claims about the “Patoshi pattern” and the ability to pinpoint Satoshi’s mining activity or identity based on block timing and forum sign-up dates. Summary Table: Coinpedia’s Evidence Against the Theory Claim Made by Theory Coinpedia’s Counter-Evidence Dorsey’s bio and habits match Satoshi Coincidental, not unique; many cypherpunks had similar interests. “jD2m” address links Dorsey to Satoshi No verifiable blockchain evidence; speculative at best. Satoshi’s actions align with Dorsey’s timeline Dorsey’s public commitments at Twitter/Square make this implausible. Symbolic gestures (shirts, books) Advocacy ≠ authorship; no direct proof. Satoshi’s communication style is like Dorsey’s Writing styles are significantly different. No denial from Dorsey Dorsey has denied being Satoshi in interviews; playful answers are not proof . No cryptographic evidence No access to Satoshi’s wallets or ability to sign messages Conclusion Coinpedia’s research, along with input from blockchain experts, finds no concrete or technical evidence linking Jack Dorsey to Satoshi Nakamoto. The claims are based on coincidences, symbolism, and speculative connections that do not withstand scrutiny. Without cryptographic proof or blockchain evidence, the theory remains just that—a viral internet rumor, not fact.

Currently trading robustly around $107,900 , Bitcoin stands on the cusp of, or has recently breached, its all-time high (ATH) at $111,970 last May 22, 2025. Bitcoin is expected to reach new ATH at $120,000 before June ends. This formidable performance is not just a triumph for Bitcoin holders but is widely regarded as the ultimate catalyst for the eagerly anticipated ""altcoin season""—a period where alternative cryptocurrencies are poised for explosive, often 100x, gains. Investors are keenly observing these dynamics, seeking to strategically position themselves for the next wave of exponential growth in the digital asset landscape. Bitcoin's Historic Rise: Paving the Way for Market Expansion Bitcoin's recent price action has cemented its role as the undisputed leader of the crypto market. Its ability to reclaim and test ATH levels signifies immense market strength and renewed institutional confidence. The achievement of a Bitcoin all-time high draws significant global attention, pulling new capital into the ecosystem and bolstering overall market sentiment. Analysts are already making bold predictions, with some technical indicators pointing towards a swift ascent to $110,000, and potentially even $120,000 following a confirmed breakout from key resistance ranges. More ambitious forecasts suggest targets reaching $135,000-$140,000, or even $150,000 by late August, and significantly higher by year-end. This upward trajectory for Bitcoin is crucial; it establishes a stable foundation and historically precedes a rotation of funds into altcoins as investors seek higher percentage gains. On his viral tweet , Crypto Influencer, Crypto Beast, is expecting surge to other tokens aside from Bitcoin. Decoding the Dynamics of an Altcoin Surge Altcoin Market Cap: $1,291,255,594,413 The concept of an ""altcoin season"" is well-established in crypto cycles. It typically occurs after Bitcoin has experienced a significant rally, consolidating its gains or moving sideways. This period often sees Bitcoin dominance—its market share relative to the total crypto market —begin to decline, as savvy investors reallocate profits from Bitcoin into more volatile, yet high-potential, altcoins. Key indicators signaling the onset of an altcoin season include a rising Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) ratio, a surge in the overall altcoin market capitalization, increased trading volumes across various altcoins, and a general shift in market sentiment towards higher risk appetite. While current data may show Bitcoin dominance remaining high or the Altcoin Season Index still low, historical patterns suggest these periods of Bitcoin's strength often precede a significant altcoin run in the latter half of the year, driven by factors like increasing stablecoin liquidity and an overall bullish macro environment.

Currently positioned around $107,900 , and with prospects to reach or even exceed $120,000 soon, Bitcoin’s performance is a key indicator of market sentiment and potential liquidity influx into the altcoin markets. The recent breakthrough not only enhances Bitcoin's stature but also serves to attract fresh capital, creating a fertile ground for altcoins to flourish. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""altcoin season,"" a phase when smaller cap coins might see exponential growth. The market’s dynamics hint at an upcoming altcoin season, much anticipated by the trading community. Characteristics of an Impending Altcoin Surge Following Bitcoin’s lead, the entire crypto market often gets a speculative boost. As seen currently, a new all-time high has been set by Bitcoin, which historically signals a shift of focus to altcoins. Investors typically start to diversify their investments to leverage potential higher returns from altcoins, which are deemed to have a higher growth potential in shorter time frames. Detailed market analyses indicate that key metrics such as the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio and total crypto market cap growth are favorable. Increased trading volumes and a general buzz around altcoins further validate this shift. This transition often coincides with Bitcoin consolidating its gains, paving the way for the much-discussed altcoin season.

But experts are expecting Remittix (RTX), a trailblazing token that falls into this category of coins, to hit a whopping $3 – way before crypto bigwig Cardano (ADA) does. This article reveals the reasons fueling this extremely bullish sentiment. Why are analysts bullish about Remittix? By creating a peer-to-peer electronic payment network, Bitcoin revolutionized how we perceive and transfer value. Remittix builds on this transformative technology by eliminating more middlemen and delivering a useful solution for end users. It empowers its users to make crypto-fiat transactions without FX charges. To be more specific, Remittix’s PayFi protocol allows anyone to send crypto, right from their wallets, to recipients who get fiat in their traditional bank accounts. It mimics Ripple’s cross-border efficiency but appeals to both retail and institutional users. This makes it potentially a top crypto coin, even though it is yet to hit the limelight. The rationale behind RTX hitting $3 is simple. If Ripple could rally as strongly as it did even though it had legal troubles and doesn’t appeal to retail users, how much more would Remittix perform? It has no issues with the government and appeals to a broader audience. Even more, it is still in its infancy, unknown to many but is steadily growing in stature and value. Remittix has appreciated by over 500% already, with its presale fetching more than $15.8 million from investors. The token is currently priced around $0.0811, which is a sweet spot for anyone looking to make serious profits. Cardano keeps on struggling Cardano is one of the OG crypto projects. It is almost as old as Bitcoin and has methodically developed its network to be the sprawling ecosystem that it currently is. But despite its elevated status, Cardano price has underperformed and has hardly fetched investors tangible gains. This is in spite of the accelerated rollout of the Leios upgrade , a foundational overhaul of Cardano’s Ouroboros consensus protocol that is designed to boost transaction throughput to “tens of thousands per second. Source: CoinMarketCap Cardano is down by over 20% on the monthly scene, with ADA trading below $0.6. The coin continues to fluctuate below the $1 mark, and remains stubbornly range-bound, frustrating holders looking to make robust profits in 2025. Cardano price prediction: Can ADA break $3 ceiling? Cardano’s inability to climb above the $3 threshold has become a defining feature of its disappointing history. Since peaking at $3.10 in Q4 2021, ADA has consistently failed to revisit or surpass this psychological barrier. This is despite multiple crypto market bull runs and market-wide rallies and it casts a long shadow over its future price trajectories. Source: TradingView Presently, the Cardano price is testing a multi-touch demand zone marked by strong historical reactions. The 50/200 MA convergence suggests long-term resistance around $1 remains intact. However, the Stochastic RSI shows oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term reversal. If Cardano price moves above $0.67 and approaches $0.8, there’s a chance ADA could breach $1. However, the possibility of a $3 ADA remains as slim as ever. Don’t miss out on Remittix Remittix is well-positioned to hit $3 before ADA breaks this price ceiling. It’s got a really strong momentum, packs a revolutionary potential, and remains extremely affordable for the average investor. Smart money is flowing towards Remittix, and it’s only a matter of time before others get wind of it.

Accordingly, the exchange announced that cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC and cbXRP, which are bridged versions of Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple (XRP) coins to the Base network, will be released soon. The exchange has now announced that this announcement has been implemented for ADA and LTC after DOGE and XRP. Accordingly, Coinbase announced that it has launched two new wrapping tokens called cbADA and cbLTC on the Layer 2 Ethereum network Base. Both tokens are backed 1:1 by ADA and LTC, which are under the custody of Coinbase. The exchange said the aim of the launch of the new tokens is to enable cross-chain usage of Cardano and Litecoin within Base’s DeFi ecosystem. These tokens allow users to trade, lend, and provide liquidity on DeFi platforms that Cardano and Litecoin do not natively support. Coinbase also announced the launch of cbXRP and cbDOGE in early June. cbADA and cbLTC are now live on @base . cbADA and cbLTC are ERC-20 tokens backed 1:1 by ADA and LTC held in custody by Coinbase.

This is the agency’s first enforcement action under the state’s 2023 Digital Financial Assets Law. The settlement also includes $51,700 in restitution to a senior citizen who fell victim to fraud. Similar incidents prompted global concern. In Australia, police uncovered widespread abuse of crypto ATMs in romance scams, with one widow losing close to $282,000. Authorities found many supposed criminals were actually victims being manipulated. Meanwhile, Spokane, Washington became the first city in the state to ban crypto ATMs entirely due to rising fraud, particularly in low-income areas. Regulators across the globe are now cracking down on cryptocurrency ATMs. Coinme Agrees to Pay $300K Fine Seattle-based cryptocurrency ATM operator Coinme agreed to pay a $300,000 penalty to California regulators for violating state laws governing digital financial assets. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) stated that Coinme breached transaction limits by allowing crypto ATM users to exceed the state’s $1,000 per-day cap per customer. The company also failed to include mandatory disclosures on receipts provided at its kiosks, which are located in grocery and convenience stores throughout California. This enforcement is the DFPI’s first action under the Digital Financial Assets Law , which came into effect in 2023. The legislation was designed to address consumer protection concerns related to crypto kiosks, especially as scams involving these machines have become increasingly common. As part of the consent order, Coinme will also pay $51,700 in restitution to an elderly customer who said they were scammed. Coinme crypto ATM DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni explained that the penalty serves as a warning to other digital asset operators that the state is very serious about enforcing compliance to protect consumers. The rise in crypto ATM-related scams has become a growing concern for regulators, as criminals often trick victims into purchasing digital assets at kiosks and sending them directly to fraudsters' wallets. The FBI reported close to 11,000 complaints related to these kinds of scams in 2024 alone, totaling over $246 million in losses. This was a 31% increase from the previous year, and seniors over 60 made up the majority of victims. Crypto ATM complaints for 2024 (Source: FBI ) Similar concerns are emerging globally. In Australia, federal police recently reached out to over 90 people as part of a crackdown on the misuse of crypto ATMs, including those affected by ”pig butchering” scams. In Texas, a sheriff physically dismantled a crypto ATM after a local family reportedly lost $25,000 in a scam. Crypto ATM Scam Targets Elderly in Australia After the Australian federal police contacted people as part of its ongoing crackdown on the criminal use of cryptocurrency ATMs, one case stood out. A 77-year-old widow lost 433,000 Australian dollars, or approximately $281,947, in an elaborate online dating scam. According to Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, the woman was misled for over two years by a man posing as a Belgian national, who encouraged her to invest in Bitcoin using forged investment returns. The victim was completely unaware of the deception until police arrived at her door. She eventually became proficient at operating Bitcoin ATMs, and spent months transferring her entire life savings. Media release from AUSTRAC The scammer guided her through the process step by step, starting with cash withdrawals from traditional ATMs and feeding the funds into crypto kiosks. At one point, she carried as much as 20,000 Australian dollars in cash to complete a single transaction. She described the process as taking “half a day’s work” and recounted the emotional toll of confessing the loss of her life savings to her daughter. Another woman in her 70s also fell victim to a fake investment firm and lost over 200,000 Australian dollars. Police actions under the crackdown focused on the highest-risk users of crypto ATMs. Of the 21 people that were singled out for investigation, many turned out to be victims rather than perpetrators. This shed some light on the growing trend of ordinary citizens being exploited through promises of love, job offers, or high-return investments. Only one person has been charged so far with property laundering, while four others received formal cautions for allegedly using crypto to purchase drugs or acting as intermediaries for criminals. Some suspected mules were also revealed to be victims, who were unknowingly helping cybercriminals or attempting to recover their own stolen money. (Source: CoinATMRadar ) In response to the rising number of these incidents, AUSTRAC introduced new rules and transaction limits for crypto ATM operators on June 3 to help mitigate scams. The agency made crypto regulation a top priority for 2025. AFP Commander Graeme Marshall stressed that people should be wary of anyone promising quick profits or creating a sense of urgency, particularly if contact is made online and the person has never been met in real life. He warned the public not to make any payments via cryptocurrency if instructed by a supposed business or government agency. According to Australia’s national cybercrime reporting system, ReportCyber , there were 150 reports of scams involving crypto ATMs from January of 2024 to January of 2025, which resulted in more than 3.1 million Australian dollars in losses. Spokane Bans Crypto ATMs Spokane, Washington became the first city in the state to ban cryptocurrency ATMs . This happened after a unanimous vote by the City Council in response to the rise in scams targeting local residents. The ordinance was proposed by Council member Paul Dillon , and it aims to protect vulnerable people from fraud involving virtual currency kiosks, which he described as a favored tool of scammers. The new measure prohibits the installation of future crypto ATMs and mandates the removal of existing machines, many of which are located in low-income neighborhoods and high-traffic locations like grocery and convenience stores. Ordinance to ban crypto ATMs (Source: Spokane City Council ) The ordinance referred to a concerning increase in scam activity linked to these kiosks, and pointed out that victims often lose thousands of dollars. Within 60 days, crypto ATM operators are required to remove their machines or face civil penalties and potential revocation of business licenses. The City Council also plans to monitor and report on the effectiveness of the ban by tracking changes in reported crimes involving crypto kiosks. Local law enforcement supported the move, with police detective Tim Schwering sharing cases where funds deposited into these ATMs ended up in foreign jurisdictions like China, North Korea, and Russia. Schwering explained that scammers often impersonate law enforcement or tax officials to coerce victims into converting their money into crypto to avoid fictitious legal consequences. Once the money is transferred into cryptocurrency, it becomes nearly impossible to recover.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-26 08:17:16

Key Takeaways: Resupply lost $9.5 million after an attacker manipulated the price of cvcrvUSD to borrow reUSD cheaply. The exploit exploited faulty price logic in the CurveLend contract used by ResupplyPair. Resupply paused the affected contract and is investigating the breach, with a full post-mortem pending. The attack targeted cvcrvUSD, a wrapped version of Curve USD (crvUSD) staked on Convex Finance. By sending donations to the cvcrvUSD vault, the attacker inflated the token’s share price. This inflated price was then used as collateral to borrow Resupply’s native stablecoin, reUSD, at a highly favorable exchange rate. Resupply Exploit Linked to Manipulated Price Feed in CurveLend Contract The Resupply smart contract involved, ResupplyPair (CurveLend: crvUSD/wstUSR), used the manipulated cvcrvUSD price in its calculations. Once the attacker borrowed the reUSD, the manipulated exchange rate collapsed, triggering a major devaluation of the protocol’s reserves. Analysts at Blocksec noted that the attacker primarily drained funds from the wstUSR market by exploiting the flawed price logic in the borrowing function. The stolen reUSD was then swiftly converted into other crypto assets on external markets. “As a result, the attacker borrowed massive reUSD with just 1 wei of cvcrvUSD as collateral, bypassing the insolvency check,” Blocksec wrote on X. Resupply acknowledged the breach in a statement and confirmed that the compromised contract has been paused. The team is investigating the incident and has not yet confirmed any recovery plans. “A full post-mortem will be shared as soon as a complete analysis of the situation has been conducted,” the team wrote.

The attacker used social engineering, inserted malware via a trojanized Rust crate, and maintained undetected access to engineering systems for over three weeks. The breach culminated in the UniBTC protocol being exploited shortly after Fuzzland discussed a security vulnerability. Notably, in the first three months of 2025, the crypto ecosystem lost a whopping $1,635,933,800 across 39 incidents, according to the blockchain security platform Immunefi . Most of that was the result of only two hacks of two centralized exchanges. Phemex suffered a $69.1 million loss in January, while Bybit lost $1.46 billion in February. Subsequently, the total number of losses in the first quarter marks a 4.7x increase compared to Q1 2024 . At that time, hackers and fraudsters stole $348,251,217. Notably, experts assume that the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group is behind the two largest attacks. They stole $1.52 billion, or 94% of total losses.

SEC Member Explains!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-gets-green-light-for-bitcoin-feature-that-it-never-wanted-before-sec-member-explains/,"As is known, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. While approving them, it pressured them to include only cash refunds and rejected the in-kind refund option in spot ETF applications. However, BlackRock has applied for in-kind repayments for its ISHARES Bitcoin ET at the beginning of 2025. At this point, companies including BlackRock have been asking the SEC for months to allow in-kind investments and repurchases specifically for Bitcoin ETFs. At this point, if tax-advantaged refunds in kind are accepted, it will be positive for the cryptocurrency market. Because these features can be made without selling cryptocurrencies, they reduce the selling pressure in the market. While this development is eagerly awaited, SEC Republican member Hester Peirce said that the in-kind refunds that the SEC has been delaying on Bitcoin ETFs are imminent. Speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Hester Peirce said that in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto ETFs are on the horizon and will definitely come. Peirce said that the SEC's stance on Bitcoin ETFs is inadequate, noting that in-kind investment and refund application files are currently under review by the SEC. “The SEC really mismanaged the spot Bitcoin ETF. Additionally, the same investment and redemption applications for the spot Bitcoin ETF are going through the review process before the SEC. So I think that will definitely be approved at some point. It's a guess, but we're seeing a lot of interest in these features.” The SEC under US President Donald Trump has adopted a friendlier approach to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies compared to the SEC under Joe Biden. Since the Trump administration, ETF applications have not been limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with many top firms filing with the SEC for altcoins ranging from XRP to Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE). While the market expects altcoin ETFs to be approved in 2025, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas say the SEC has a 90% or higher probability of approving most altcoin ETF applications. *This is not investment advice.

However, the sellers have also been defending the mark vigorously and have so far prevented any upside, but will they prevail? Bitcoin Double Taps $108K As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, the primary cryptocurrency tapped the important level at $108,000 on multiple separate occasions in the past 24 hours, but fell short each time. At the time of this writing, the price is trading at around $107,500, and it’s interesting to see if the bulls will be able to break above. Source: TradingView This is clearly becoming an important level to watch, as both buyers and sellers are committing serious resources here. If the buyers are able to keep going, this could consume the seller-side liquidity at around $108K and pave the way for a move upwards. Of course, the opposite is also not out of the picture. However, it’s also important to note that the cryptocurrency managed to successfully reclaim its 50-day exponentioal moving average, which, according to many analysts, is widely regarded as a critical technical indicator that’s oftentimes used as support during corrections in a broader bullish trend. Reclaiming this level is historically followed by bullish continuation, so let’s see if it plays out again. Altcoins Paint a Mixed Picture The wide majority of altcoins are thrading in the red in the past 24 hours, with a few certain exceptions that are mostly trading at the same price they were before that, failing to chart any considerable increases. As you can see in the heatmap below, Bitcoin Cash is one of the best performers and it’s up by almost 4% on the day. That said, many of the large-cap cryptocurrencies such as HYPE, ADA, DOGE, SUI, HBAR, DOT, and others, are down between 2% and 5% for the same period.

The Japanese economy is going through a period of persistent low interest rates and limited investment opportunities. As a result, BTC treasury holdings in Japan now exceed $85 billion. Favorable laws in Japan are making this shift possible, turning Japan into a global leader when it comes to corporate crypto holdings. Amid the growing adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) in Japan, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has recently begun to attract global attention. It is especially so amongst whales in Asia and other regions of the world, who feel that gains from Bitcoin (BTC) may be limited. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its focus on utility, has become an attractive option for them. Noticing this trend, analysts have upped their forecasts for MUTM tokens, and they now forecast gains of 33x or higher when the tokens go live. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the fifth phase of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. So far, over $11.2 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,450 unique buyers. A major reason for this high participation rate is that tokens in the current phase are going for a huge 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. Driven by the massive opportunity for growth, investors have bought 50% of the tokens in phase 5, less than a month after they launched. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That will also reduce the guaranteed ROI based on the listing price from 100% to 71.43%. No one wants to miss this massive opportunity, and investors are taking every exit opportunity to pour capital into the presale. With analysts forecasting gains of 33x when the tokens go live, a $1,400 investment in the presale right now could grow to over $46,000. This represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make life-changing gains in the crypto market. Do not be left out. Best of all, since there is no upper limit on how much you can invest in the presale, this could represent an opportunity to secure your retirement from the crypto investment world. A major driver of the presale is the fact that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is CertiK audited. With a Token Scan Score of 95 on CertiK, this has boosted trust in the project, leading to the current pace of the presale. The presale momentum is expected to carry on after launch, driven by the massive utility of the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the platform, they can deposit their assets into the protocol for a chance to earn an annual percentage yield (APY). The rate at which they earn interest in the protocol’s pools is based on the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it increases the interest rate, which causes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it attracts more lenders who deposit liquidity into the pools to enjoy the rising yields. Consequently, the entire process leads to higher liquidity in the pools, which stabilizes the ecosystem in the long term. Additionally, it ensures optimal capital efficiency, giving lenders and borrowers the best possible market rates. For lenders, this massive opportunity for passive income will prove quite attractive. For instance, a user can deposit $10,000 worth of BNB in a pool. Since BNB is in high demand, it could push the APY in that pool up to 15% as borrowers take loans. For the lenders, that could mean that they earn $1,500 worth of BNB a year on their deposit. Best of all, they do not need to actively trade, which can be stressful, for both newbie and experienced traders. Another benefit of Mutuum Finance is that it will ensure users of the protocol have a means to easily track their earnings in the protocol via mtTokens. These tokens will represent the value of the original deposit plus any interest accrued. For instance, when they make a deposit of BNB in a pool, lenders will receive mtBNB tokens in return. The mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, which means they can be traded on secondary exchanges where the standard is accepted. Additionally, the team will encourage the creation of pools on DEXs, which pair with mtTokens. That will provide lenders with avenues to trade on the open market, even as they continue to make passive income in the protocol. Conclusion With a massive discount in the ongoing presale, coupled with the perfect design of the protocol, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale presents a rare opportunity for massive gains in the crypto sector. Do not let this massive opportunity for returns of 33x or higher slip through your fingers.

The recent developments in the AI copyright battle between industry giants Getty Images and Stability AI offer a compelling case study, shedding light on the intricate challenges and uncertainties facing generative AI companies and content creators alike. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology and intellectual property, this ongoing saga provides crucial insights into how digital assets, whether code or imagery, are being protected and leveraged in the age of intelligent machines. Understanding the Evolving Landscape of AI Copyright The legal skirmish between Getty Images, a global leader in visual content, and Stability AI, the startup behind the popular Stable Diffusion AI image generator, has been one of the most closely watched cases in the realm of artificial intelligence. It specifically concerns the use of copyrighted material for training AI models and the originality of their outputs. On Wednesday, a significant turn occurred at London’s High Court when Getty Images opted to drop its primary claims of direct copyright infringement against Stability AI. These claims centered on two core allegations: Training Infringement: Getty initially alleged that Stability AI utilized millions of copyrighted images from Getty’s extensive library to train its AI model without obtaining the necessary permissions or licenses. This claim struck at the heart of how AI models are built, raising questions about whether the ingestion of copyrighted data for ‘learning’ constitutes infringement. Output Infringement: The second primary claim asserted that the images generated by Stable Diffusion were not merely inspired but were substantially similar to Getty’s copyrighted content. Furthermore, Getty pointed out that some of these AI-generated works even bore its proprietary watermarks, suggesting a direct link to the original source material. This strategic withdrawal, as explained by legal experts such as Ben Maling, a partner at law firm EIP, likely stems from the inherent difficulties in proving these specific types of infringement within the UK legal framework. Maling suggested that Getty may have struggled to establish a sufficient connection between the alleged infringing training acts and the UK jurisdiction for copyright law to apply effectively. Similarly, proving output infringement proved challenging, as Getty likely failed to establish that what the models reproduced reflected a ‘substantial part’ of the original copyrighted images, a high bar in copyright law. Getty’s lawyers themselves framed the move as a strategic recalibration, allowing them to focus resources on what they believe are stronger, more winnable allegations. This development underscores the complex nature of proving direct copyright infringement when dealing with AI models that ‘learn’ from vast datasets rather than directly copying, highlighting the ‘gray areas’ that define the future of content ownership in the generative AI era. What Remains for the Getty Images Lawsuit ? Unpacking the Continuing Legal Battle While the initial claims have been dropped, the legal battle is far from over. Getty Images is still pursuing other significant allegations against Stability AI in the UK, as well as a separate, substantial lawsuit in the United States. The remaining claims in the UK focus on two critical areas: Secondary Infringement: This is a particularly impactful claim, as it argues that the AI models themselves might infringe copyright law. If successful, it could mean that merely using these models within the UK could constitute importing ‘infringing articles,’ even if the initial training occurred outside the UK. This claim holds wide-ranging implications for generative AI companies operating globally, as it could compel them to reconsider their operational models and the distribution of their AI products. As Ben Maling noted, “Secondary infringement is the one with widest relevance to genAI companies training outside of the UK, namely via the models themselves potentially being ‘infringing articles’ that are subsequently imported into the UK.” Trademark Infringement: Getty alleges that Stability AI’s models reproduced Getty’s distinctive watermarks, leading to potential trademark infringement and ‘passing off’ – implying that consumers might mistakenly associate the AI-generated content with Getty Images. This claim targets the brand reputation and commercial identity of Getty. Stability AI, however, remains confident that these claims will fail, asserting that consumers do not interpret the appearance of watermarks on AI-generated images as a commercial message or endorsement from Stability AI itself. Across the Atlantic, the stakes are even higher. Getty’s U.S. division filed a separate lawsuit in February 2023, escalating the legal pressure by alleging that Stability AI used as many as 12 million copyrighted images without permission. In this case, Getty is seeking damages for 11,383 specific works at an astonishing $150,000 per infringement, potentially totaling a staggering $1.7 billion. This massive figure highlights the financial magnitude and potential industry-shaping consequences of these legal disputes, emphasizing the profound economic implications for both content creators and AI developers. The Broader Implications for Generative AI and the Creative Industries The legal challenges faced by Stability AI are not isolated incidents; they are part of a larger, global conversation about the ethical and legal boundaries of generative AI. The core issue revolves around how AI systems ‘learn’ from vast datasets, often containing copyrighted material, and whether this learning process constitutes infringement. Just a day before Getty’s decision, a U.S. judge sided with Anthropic in a similar dispute regarding the use of books for AI training without author permission, indicating a nuanced and evolving judicial understanding of these issues. This suggests that courts are grappling with the specific mechanisms of AI training and output, rather than applying blanket rules. This landscape is further complicated by other ongoing cases that reflect the growing concerns of artists and creators. Stability AI, alongside fellow prominent AI image generators Midjourney and DeviantArt, is also facing a class-action complaint from a group of visual artists who allege widespread copyright infringement. These cases collectively highlight the urgent need for clearer legal guidelines, industry-wide standards, and potentially new licensing frameworks for AI development and deployment. The lack of established precedents means each case contributes to shaping future policy and practice. Interestingly, Getty Images itself has entered the generative AI space, underscoring the transformative potential of this technology even for those engaged in legal battles over its use. The company offers its own AI tool that leverages models trained exclusively on Getty’s vast iStock stock photography and video libraries. This proprietary tool allows users to generate new licensable images and artwork, providing a licensed and controlled environment for AI content creation. This dual role as both a plaintiff in copyright lawsuits and a developer in the generative AI market adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing discussions about fair use, licensing, and the future of creative industries. It demonstrates a recognition that while legal boundaries are being tested, the technology itself holds immense promise. Navigating AI Legal Challenges : A Glimpse into the Future of Intellectual Property The legal proceedings involving Getty Images and Stability AI are more than just a corporate dispute; they are a critical bellwether for the future of intellectual property in the age of artificial intelligence. The outcomes of these cases will undoubtedly set powerful precedents that could reshape how AI models are trained, how AI-generated content is regulated, and how creators are compensated for their invaluable contributions. This ongoing legal saga forces us to confront fundamental questions about creativity, ownership, and the very definition of ‘original work’ in an era where machines can generate art. Consider the following critical questions emerging from these challenges, which will dictate the trajectory of AI innovation: Data Licensing Paradigms: Will AI developers be universally required to license vast datasets for training, or will existing fair use doctrines expand to accommodate AI learning processes, perhaps under specific conditions? The answer will significantly impact the cost and accessibility of AI model development. Attribution and Royalties: How can original creators be properly attributed and fairly compensated when their work contributes, even indirectly, to AI models that generate new content? This is a crucial question for the sustainability of creative professions. Jurisdictional Hurdles and Global Harmonization: How will fragmented international laws adapt to the borderless nature of AI model training and deployment? Achieving some level of global legal harmonization may become essential for predictable AI development. Defining ‘Transformative Use’: When does an AI model’s use of copyrighted material become ‘transformative’ enough to fall under fair use, and when does it remain derivative? The courts are currently defining these nuanced boundaries. These questions underscore the profound impact that current legal battles will have on the innovation trajectory of generative AI and the broader digital economy. Companies, artists, and legal experts are all grappling with these complex issues, striving to find a delicate balance that fosters technological advancement while robustly protecting creative rights and ensuring fair compensation for intellectual labor. The precedents set here will resonate for decades. Stability AI ‘s Stance and the Road Ahead for Innovation Throughout these complex legal proceedings, Stability AI has maintained a resolute stance, expressing confidence in its defense against the remaining claims. A spokesperson for Stability AI conveyed their satisfaction, stating they were “pleased to see Getty’s decision to drop multiple claims after the conclusion of the testimony,” signaling their belief that the remaining claims, particularly trademark and passing off, will also prove unsuccessful. Their argument hinges on the idea that consumers do not interpret the appearance of watermarks on AI-generated content as an endorsement or commercial message directly from Stability AI itself, but rather as artifacts from the training data. The road ahead for both Getty Images and Stability AI, as well as the broader generative AI industry, is paved with significant legal uncertainty. The outcomes of the remaining UK claims, particularly the secondary infringement argument, and the substantial U.S. lawsuit, will be pivotal. These decisions will not only determine significant financial liabilities for the parties involved but will also establish critical legal interpretations that will guide future AI development, content creation, and intellectual property rights globally. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, stakeholders across technology, art, and law will be watching closely, understanding that these rulings will shape the future contours of the AI revolution and its impact on human creativity and innovation. The decision by Getty Images to narrow its UK lawsuit against Stability AI marks a significant, albeit not conclusive, moment in the ongoing debate over AI and copyright. It vividly highlights the inherent complexities of applying traditional intellectual property laws to the novel and transformative capabilities of generative AI. While some primary claims have been dropped, the core questions surrounding AI training data, the originality of AI-generated output, and the very nature of digital creation remain hotly contested and far from settled. The ultimate resolutions of these high-stakes legal battles will undoubtedly shape the future of creativity, commerce, and innovation in the AI era, setting crucial precedents for how content is used, valued, and protected in our increasingly intelligent world. This legal journey is a testament to the profound challenges and opportunities presented by AI, demanding careful consideration and forward-thinking solutions from all involved.

Amid the multi-billion-dollar industry’s troubles, newcomer Block3 is offering a fundamentally different model for how games are created, distributed, and monetised. Block3 introduces the first AI-powered gaming engine capable of converting simple text prompts into fully playable, immersive game worlds within seconds. By removing traditional barriers, the platform aims to democratise game development and unlock unprecedented creative potential. Central to the ecosystem is the BL3 token, which provides investors with liquid exposure to the growing intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming—a market projected to reach $665 billion. At the core of Block3’s technology is Trinity, a generative gaming engine trained via a decentralised network. Contributors to Trinity’s development are incentivised through blockchain-based rewards, reinforcing the community-driven nature of the platform. The project’s native token, BL3, is set to begin its presale on July 1. How does it all work? To see an idea come to life in seconds—that’s the promise of Block3’s Trinity model, operating at a scale previously unseen in gaming. Users simply enter a text prompt, much like using ChatGPT. But instead of receiving a static response, they get a fully functional video game—featuring expansive environments, complex NPCs, and any feature the imagination can conjure. As with all AI systems, output quality depends heavily on input volume. Block3 addresses this through a blockchain-powered incentive model. Using the BL3 token, it encourages contributions from across the gaming community—submissions such as 3D assets, gameplay clips, and custom maps, all of which help train Trinity. These data inputs are stored on-chain, ensuring full transparency, verifiable provenance, and fair compensation. This approach also tackles a growing issue in AI development: the shrinking availability of quality public datasets. In contrast to closed systems developed by firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, Block3’s open training model invites broader participation and scrutiny. Importantly, training the AI isn’t the only way to earn BL3. Every user-generated game can be hosted within the Block3 ecosystem, building an expansive, living library of interactive experiences. Creators earn BL3 tokens based on engagement, with top-performing games generating real income. In-game purchases offer yet another monetisation channel, making the platform both creator-centric and financially self-sustaining. The token behind it all The BL3 token functions as the central utility asset within the Block3 ecosystem, facilitating key activities such as creation fees, in-game asset trading, and revenue sharing. For investors, BL3 provides a liquid and scalable entry point into the convergence of artificial intelligence and gaming—two rapidly expanding sectors. For retail users, it represents one of the first opportunities to gain tokenised exposure to the foundational layers of game development, monetisation, and distribution. Value in the Block3 ecosystem is designed to accrue across multiple channels, including creation fees, royalties, and marketplace transactions. By aggregating these flows into a single asset, BL3 serves as a broad-based instrument tied to the future of AI-generated gaming, offering an index-like exposure to the emerging sector of synthetic entertainment. The token presale is set to run for three months, with prices scheduled to rise at regular intervals. This tiered pricing model is structured to reward early participation, enabling buyers to secure tokens at lower valuations ahead of BL3’s expected exchange listing in the fourth quarter.

Per local media , the suspects allegedly used a foreign payment gateway service to facilitate illegal foreign exchange transactions. The group operated unregistered crypto exchanges that offered overseas remittance services. They accepted funds from local users, converted them into crypto, and transferred them abroad using foreign platforms. Over time, they bypassed legal channels and collected millions in hidden fees while evading regulation. Authorities confiscated the assets during a raid that also led to the arrest of three individuals and the indictment of two crypto exchange firms. The group reportedly handled hundreds of billions of won over a six-year period while operating without registration. According to the Busan District Prosecutors’ Office, the scheme generated approximately 25.7 billion won (around $18.9 million) in fees, with a total transaction volume reaching 943.4 billion won, or roughly $694.5 million. Authorities allege the group breached both the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act and the Electronic Financial Transactions Act through unlicensed crypto dealings. Illicit proceeds were funneled into offshore gambling sites, with much of the money moved using Nettel Pay, a foreign electronic payment service often linked to online betting and high-risk forex trading platforms, and not approved for use in South Korea. Authorities tracked wallet addresses and accounts tied to the suspects and successfully seized 12.4 billion won ($9.1 million) in assets held under borrowed names. Ethereum worth 4.4 billion won ($3.2 million), believed to have been hidden in personal wallets, was also recovered. Five more suspects linked to the scheme are currently under investigation. South Korea probes crypto exchanges This crackdown unfolds as South Korea steps up its overhaul of the crypto exchange landscape, with regulators digging into the operations of local platforms. Earlier this month, regulators opened a formal investigation into trading fee structures at major platforms including Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone. Led by the FSC, the probe is assessing whether current commission rates place an undue burden on locals and how they compare to global benchmarks. The FSC had previously introduced a 0.6% supervision fee on crypto exchanges’ operating revenue to strengthen regulatory oversight. Regulators have also stepped up enforcement against offshore platforms like BitMEX and KuCoin for operating without local registration. Exchanges found to be in violation now face criminal charges and the threat of ISP-level access restrictions. President Lee Jae-myung has placed crypto reform high on his policy agenda, promising tighter oversight, lower fees, and greater investor protections. One of his administration’s first major steps was the introduction of the Digital Asset Basic Act —an all-encompassing proposal that outlines licensing rules for on-chain-backed stablecoins, mandatory reporting for digital asset activity, and a unified framework to govern virtual asset service providers. The roadmap also charts a path toward legalising cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds by late 2025, with the FSC laying the groundwork through new frameworks on fund structuring, custody, pricing, and investor guardrails. To ensure accountability, the roadmap outlines harsher penalties for misconduct, including permanent bans and steep fines for individuals and entities violating crypto-related laws. A dedicated presidential committee is expected to guide the implementation of these reforms and coordinate with financial regulators to modernize the country’s digital asset ecosystem.

The complaint, made by Dallas-based plaintiff Michael Zidell, accuses the banking giant of aiding and abetting fraud after scammers allegedly stole $20 million from him through a “pig butchering” scheme. According to court documents filed on June 24, Zidell was approached in January 2023 by a person named Carolyn Parker via Facebook. Parker claimed to be a businesswoman based in California, and made contact with the victim through phone calls and video chats on the WeChat messaging platform. Zidell said the relationship seemed friendly at the start, but he grew fond of Parker romantically over the following weeks. Dozens of wire transfers and a $300 million Phantom balance In February 2023, Parker supposedly told Zidell about her investments in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), insisting that she had made millions in profits through a trading platform called OpenrarityPro. Per Zidell, the scammer presented the website to him as “one of the largest NFT trading platforms in the world.” He propounded that the personal relationship and Parker’s “falsified” investment success was enough reason for him to invest in the NFT venture she recommended. Zidell began making wire transfers to multiple bank accounts listed on OpenrarityPro. When he questioned the need to send funds to different accounts, he was told that due to high customer traffic, the platform relied on several banks to handle deposits. He accepted the explanation and, over several months, sent 43 wire transfers totaling over $20 million. Of that amount, nearly $4 million reportedly went to accounts held at Citibank. Among the beneficiaries was a company named Guju Inc., which per court records, received 12 wire transfers through Citibank. The lawsuit blames Citibank for failing to detect numerous red flags, including unusually large and round-numbered transactions, and that these suspicious activities should have started a compliance review under the bank’s regulatory obligations. By March 2023, Zidell believed his investments had grown exponentially. The court filings put in record that the OpenrarityPro website showed an account balance of over $300 million. When he attempted to withdraw some of his funds, the site demanded a “risk deposit” to unlock the assets. Zidell complied and sent the additional funds, but was then asked to pay more fees to process the withdrawal. No funds were ever returned. Sudden disappearance of the trading platform In late April 2023, the OpenrarityPro website was inaccessible. Zidell realized he had been defrauded and deemed the whole incident as a case of a “rug pull,” a term used in crypto to describe exit scams. Zidell then reported the case to the Dallas Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The lawsuit dictates Citibank is responsible for enabling the scam by failing to act on obvious “red flags.” It also states the bank should have investigated the accounts receiving Zidell’s transfers, given the pattern of large transactions to multiple trusts and individuals. The complaint also stated that Citibank breached its legal mandate to monitor suspicious activities and failed to implement adequate security protocols. “ Citibank failed to detect clearly suspicious transactions and failed to monitor the accounts even though large, round sums were transferred in and out of the accounts from trusts and other individuals in a suspicious manner, ” Zidell’s attorneys wrote.

The technical chart shows resistance around $0.66, while on-chain fundamentals remain mixed. With the July token unlock looming and the highly anticipated Pi2Day event approaching on June 28, traders are weighing short-term volatility against long-term potential. If the core team delivers on key promises—such as mainnet expansion, AI integration, and smoother KYC—PI could reclaim bullish momentum in the coming weeks. What Just Happened with Pi’s Price? Lately, Pi Network’s price experienced a sudden spike earlier this week, marking local highs at $0.66. This was when market sentiment turned bullish as global tensions eased, triggering a smooth rebound in the Bitcoin price. On the other hand, the excitement around the Pi2Day also intensified, which is looked at as the network’s mid-year milestone event that could deliver updates on AI features, KYC tools, and broader ecosystem upgrades. Many traders who bought the dip under $0.55 saw the rally as a chance to lock in quick gains. Meanwhile, the experienced investors were cautious of the upcoming token unlock in July, where 274 million Pi could enter circulation. That could potentially flood the market—unless there’s a strong demand boost from Pi2Day announcements or growing dApp adoption on the open mainnet. Pi Price Forecast: Cautious Optimism Ever since the launch, the PI has been facing immense upward pressure. Although the bulls tried hard to push the prices higher, they soon experienced immense exhaustion. As a result, the price plunged as the selling pressure surged. The token is undergoing a similar price action now, which suggests the price may encounter a 15% pullback to reach the support if it fails to defend $0.5. The recent rejection from the resistance suggests the buyers are not completely in control, as the volume remains below the average levels. Besides, the volume has been plunging since its inception, which remains the main concern at the moment, indicating a drop in the investor’s confidence and interest. On the other hand, CMF plunges before surpassing the previous highs, and the Ichimoku cloud diverges before undergoing a bullish crossover. The chart patterns and the technical indicators suggest the continuation of a descending trend, which may reach $0.5 in a short while. If the bulls manage to trigger a rebound, a breakout from the wedge could follow; otherwise, a drop to the support at $0.47 is imminent. Pi2Day could be a game changer or a missed opportunity. If the event delivers solid progress and timelines, expect renewed upward momentum; the Pi price could rise above $0.7 which may further push to the pivotal resistance at $1.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 09:41:37

A newly surfaced document suggests that Ripple was conceived as far back as 2004 — years before Bitcoin was introduced. Ripple Predates Bitcoin? The document, shared by XRP community figure SMOQE, entails a 2014 email exchange between prominent industry insiders, notably tech journalist Reutzel Bailey. Bailey suggested that Ripple’s origin dates back to 2004, four years before Satoshi Nakamoto put out the Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2008, sparking questions about the true origins of the digital finance revolution. 2014 E-mails confirm: “Ripple is older than Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/9c8cOF4065 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 24, 2025 According to Bailey, Ryan Fugger first conceived the idea behind Ripple in 2004, creating a platform called RipplePay. This platform sought to facilitate peer-to-peer value transfer without relying on legacy banking rails. Chris Larsen, now Ripple’s Executive Chairman, later advanced the project. Bailey claims that Larsen took advantage of the growing hype around Bitcoin to steer Ripple in a cryptocurrency direction, despite the project’s original focus not being on a public crypto. In the email exchange, Jeffrey Cliff rubbished claims that Ripple was launched as a “copycat math-based currency” riding Bitcoin’s popularity. He stressed that “Ripple predates Bitcoin.” XRP Ledger Emerges In 2012 The timelines imply that Ripple’s concept emerged in 2004, while its cross-border payments cryptocurrency XRP was introduced in 2012, four years after Bitcoin’s public debut. This means that while Ripple might be technically older than Bitcoin, BTC is still the world’s first cryptocurrency, launched by Satoshi four years before XRP. Developers Jed McCaleb , Arthur Britto , and David Schwartz started creating the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2011. They aimed to create a more efficient system than Bitcoin, addressing its limitations, particularly its reliance on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. McCaleb convinced Fugger to transform RipplePay into a crypto network, leading to the creation of NewCoin in 2012, which was later renamed OpenCoin and then simply Ripple. The XRPL creators allocated 80 billion XRP to Ripple, with McCaleb personally receiving 9.5 billion XRP. After he departed from Ripple to create Stellar, McCaleb agreed to liquidate his XRP holdings gradually, with the last stash sold in 2022.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-26 09:44:58

For those deeply invested in the principles of decentralization, data ownership, and transparent governance—much like the cryptocurrency community—the news from Creative Commons resonates powerfully. This pioneering nonprofit, renowned for championing open access to creative works, is now stepping up to tackle one of the most pressing issues of our time: the responsible use of AI data . Their latest initiative, CC signals , aims to forge a path towards a sustainable and equitable future for AI, ensuring that the hunger for data doesn’t inadvertently destroy the very openness that fuels innovation. Why is Ethical AI Data Use Crucial Now? The explosion of AI technologies has created an insatiable demand for vast quantities of data to train sophisticated models. While this data is the lifeblood of AI, its unchecked extraction poses a significant threat. Many online entities, from individual creators to large corporations, are grappling with how their content is being used, often without clear consent or compensation, for AI training. This widespread, unmanaged data scraping could lead to a future where websites are walled off, content is hidden behind paywalls, and the collaborative spirit of the internet erodes. Consider the current landscape: Uncontrolled Scraping: AI models indiscriminately gather data, often disregarding existing terms of service or implicit wishes of content creators. Erosion of Openness: As a defensive measure, content providers might restrict access, thereby fragmenting the internet and limiting the “commons” of shared knowledge. Legal Ambiguity: The legal frameworks surrounding AI training data are still evolving, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes over intellectual property and fair use. This challenge highlights a critical need for a framework that respects creators’ rights while enabling the progress of AI. Without a clear mechanism for data licensing , we risk stifling innovation through legal battles or, conversely, undermining the very principles of open access that have defined the internet’s success. Introducing CC Signals: A Framework for an Open AI Ecosystem Recognizing this looming crisis, Creative Commons has unveiled CC signals , a groundbreaking project designed to provide a legal and technical solution for dataset sharing. The core idea is to empower dataset holders—the creators and custodians of online content—to clearly articulate how their data can or cannot be reused by machines for purposes like AI model training. This initiative isn’t about shutting down AI; it’s about building a reciprocal relationship between data providers and AI developers. Anna Tumadóttir, CEO of Creative Commons, eloquently summarized the vision: “ CC signals are designed to sustain the commons in the age of AI. Just as the CC licenses helped build the open web, we believe CC signals will help shape an Open AI Ecosystem grounded in reciprocity.” Unlike blunt instruments like robots.txt files or technical deterrents, CC signals proposes a nuanced approach. It’s a set of tools that offer a spectrum of legal enforceability, all underpinned by a strong ethical foundation. This echoes the success of the existing CC licenses, which have facilitated the open sharing of billions of creative works online by providing clear, standardized permissions. How Does CC Signals Aim to Facilitate Responsible Data Licensing? The project envisions a future where: Clear Permissions: Dataset holders can explicitly state the terms under which their data can be used for AI training, similar to how CC licenses specify reuse for human consumption. Ethical Weight: Beyond mere legal enforceability, the framework emphasizes an ethical understanding of data usage, encouraging responsible AI development. Standardization: By providing a common language and set of tools, CC signals aims to reduce ambiguity and streamline the process of obtaining and granting permissions. Balance: It seeks to strike a delicate balance between the need for vast datasets to advance AI and the imperative to protect creators’ rights and maintain an open digital environment. This approach offers a proactive solution, moving beyond reactive measures like blocking scrapers or charging for access, towards a collaborative model where data can be shared intentionally and responsibly. Industry’s Current Scramble: Why CC Signals Offers a Better Path for AI Data? The urgency for a solution like CC signals is underscored by the current scramble among major online platforms to adapt their policies regarding AI data usage. Companies are struggling to define their stance, often leading to confusion and public backlash. Here are a few notable examples: Platform Approach to AI Data Use Implications X (formerly Twitter) Initially allowed AI training on public data, then reversed course. Highlights policy instability and public concern over data exploitation. Reddit Using robots.txt to restrict AI bots from scraping data for training. A technical block, but doesn’t offer a legal framework for intentional sharing. Cloudflare Exploring solutions like charging AI bots for scraping or tools for confusing them. Focuses on deterrence and monetization, not collaborative data sharing. Open Source Developers Built tools to slow down and waste resources of non-compliant AI crawlers. Reactive, resource-intensive, and adversarial rather than cooperative. These examples illustrate a reactive, often adversarial, landscape. Platforms are either trying to block access entirely, monetize it, or simply create friction for AI trainers. While understandable from a protective standpoint, these methods do not foster an Open AI Ecosystem . CC signals , in contrast, offers a framework for consent and collaboration, providing a structured way for data to be shared, rather than simply taken or defended against. Shaping an Open AI Ecosystem: The Future Vision The vision behind CC signals extends beyond merely preventing misuse; it’s about actively fostering an environment where innovation thrives on shared resources, built on trust and reciprocity. Just as the original Creative Commons licenses democratized access to creative works, this new framework aims to do the same for the foundational datasets powering AI. It acknowledges that for AI to reach its full potential, it needs vast, diverse, and ethically sourced data, and that this data should come from a thriving “commons” rather than a series of isolated, protected silos. The project is still in its early stages, with initial designs available on the Creative Commons website and GitHub. The organization is committed to an open development process, actively seeking public feedback through various channels, including upcoming town halls. An alpha launch is tentatively planned for November 2025, marking a significant step towards real-world implementation. For anyone concerned about the future of the internet, digital rights, and the ethical trajectory of AI, CC signals represents a beacon of hope. It’s an invitation to participate in shaping a future where technological advancement and human values can coexist and flourish. Conclusion: A Crucial Step for Digital Rights and AI Development The launch of CC signals by Creative Commons marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse around artificial intelligence and digital rights. By offering a robust, ethically-driven framework for data licensing , it addresses the urgent need for clarity and consent in how AI data is collected and used for training. This initiative promises to be a game-changer, fostering an environment where creators retain control, innovation can thrive responsibly, and the dream of an truly Open AI Ecosystem can become a reality. It’s a testament to the power of thoughtful, collaborative solutions in navigating the complex ethical and technical challenges of the AI era, ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared broadly and equitably, without sacrificing the open principles of the internet.

This decision follows a routine evaluation by Binance, which checks projects for development activity, transparency, trading volume, and, increasingly, how well they hold up under regulatory scrutiny. The news, which came during Asia’s trading hours, triggered a sharp sell-off, with traders rushing to exit their positions. What This Means for Altcoin Holders Starting July 4 at 06:00 AM UTC, users will no longer be able to trade ALPHA, BSW, KMD, LEVER, and LTO on Binance. Open orders will be cancelled, and any leftover tokens will be returned to users’ spot wallets. Until then, traders still have time to shift their holdings, either by moving to other exchanges or storing tokens in private wallets. For users involved in derivatives or flexible earn products tied to these tokens, the impact will depend on the specific trading pairs, but most associated services will also be discontinued. This announcement has sparked concern in the affected token communities, many of which now face the challenge of moving trading activity elsewhere. For investors, it’s a moment to reassess positions and decide whether to hold or exit these projects entirely. Shortly after the announcement, all 5 tokens saw a mixed reaction. Many of them suffered losses, while some of them remained green. How Binance Made Its Decision Behind the scenes, Binance is tightening its listing standards to better align with global regulations and investor safety. The exchange now evaluates tokens using a more detailed framework, considering things like team engagement, technical progress, liquidity, network security, and ethical practices. Any major red flags, like team changes or sudden supply increases, can trigger a review and potential delisting. [post_titles_links postid=”473108″] By doing this, Binance is signaling that weak or non-transparent projects will no longer be tolerated. This approach not only protects users but also pushes the industry toward higher standards. And with regulators around the world watching closely, Binance’s updated rules are likely to influence how other major exchanges manage their listings too. Important Dates and What Users Need to Do Binance users should close any open trades involving the soon-to-be delisted tokens before July 4, 2025, and consider moving their assets to other available trading pairs. Since deposits for these tokens may be suspended without much notice, it’s important to stay updated through Binance’s official announcements. The exchange also confirmed it will keep refining its listing and delisting standards going forward.

Still, beyond the mid-range, Bitget’s liquidity tapers off.

Bitget also leads in SOL liquidity, controlling 32% of the share at the 0.6% liquidity range. According to CEO Gracy Chen, Bitget has been working actively to partner with institutional liquidity providers. “Today, institutions drive 80% of our spot volume, futures activity from professional firms has doubled, and 80% of top quant funds trade on Bitget. Liquidity is infrastructure — and we’re building it where the market needs it most,” Gracy Chen, Bitget CEO. Finally, the CoinGecko report notes that liquidity is healthy across all major exchanges, particularly in realistic trading ranges. This indicates a healthy state of the crypto market as it continues to mature and attract more institutional players.

46815180,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72538,1750932005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin (BTC) Holds at $104K After UK Jobs Drop — Micro Cap DeFi Token at $0.03 Gears for 20× Relist Move,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-holds-at-104k-after-uk-jobs-drop-micro-cap/,"After a disappointing UK labor report raised new concerns about the pace of economic recovery, global markets have shifted into observation mode. Central banks are signaling a temporary pause as policymakers assess long-term inflation risks against weaker job growth. Bitcoin (BTC) has remained steady near $104,000, indicating a broader appetite for digital assets as macro turbulence grows. But while BTC holds the spotlight, a lesser-known DeFi token priced at just $0.03 is building momentum for a much larger breakout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol currently in presale, is capturing growing attention from early-stage investors preparing for a shift in liquidity flows. With over $11.2 million raised so far and more than 12,450 unique holders already participating, this micro-cap project is entering a pivotal phase. The presale’s fifth round is already 50% sold out—and once it concludes, the price will climb, eliminating the current discounted entry. For those searching for the next 20× play, the window is open now—but not for long. A Presale Blueprint Geared for Massive Post-Launch Multiples What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its structured approach to both capital raising and utility buildout. Unlike speculative tokens that push out flashy promises, Mutuum has laid out a development timeline grounded in progressive technical delivery, including Layer-2 scalability, overcollateralized borrowing, and dual lending formats. Each presale phase has been carefully designed to scale both investment inflow and token price, starting at $0.01 and culminating at $0.06 by the final round. Those entering at today’s $0.03 level stand to gain a minimum 2x at listing price alone—excluding the compounding upside once the platform goes live and capital utilization takes off. Based on comparable DeFi growth paths, a 20x return is well within reach. The protocol has also undergone an extensive smart contract audit by CertiK, achieving a 75.56 Skynet Score and an 95.00 token scan rating—metrics that demonstrate serious attention to infrastructure quality. Meanwhile, investor trust continues to build as community milestones are achieved: a growing online presence, over 10K followers on social channels, and a $100,000 giveaway targeting long-term believers, where ten users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t waiting for macro conditions to improve—it’s positioning itself as the protocol of choice for yield hunters looking for full autonomy. Deposits are made through smart contracts that issue mtTokens, which reflect not just your principal but also real-time earnings. These mtTokens can be sold, staked, or even reused as collateral for other DeFi positions—allowing users to remain active while earning passive income. Built for Real Yield in a Slow Market With stablecoin transfers exceeding $717 billion in Q2 2025, it’s clear that investors are already repositioning into decentralized environments in search of predictable income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a decentralized stablecoin that stays anchored to $1, minted only when users borrow against solid collateral like ETH. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin is burned to regulate supply. This system works alongside a governance-driven interest model that adjusts borrowing costs to help maintain price stability. When demand is too high and price rises above $1, borrowing rates will drop. When it falls below peg, rates will be increased—supported by built-in arbitrage opportunities that keep equilibrium in place. Users will also be able to participate in Mutuum’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools, where they’ll earn adaptive yield from real-time borrowing activity. As demand increases, so does the interest paid to depositors. Unlike staking programs that rely on inflation, this yield is fully backed by borrower fees. For more active participants, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will unlock custom lending terms, allowing customized rates on popular tokens like BTC, ETH, or even smaller-cap coins that centralized platforms ignore. The passive dividend mechanism will further strengthen demand for the MUTM token itself. A portion of protocol revenue will be used to buy MUTM on the open market, which is then redistributed to stakers in designated contracts. This buyback structure adds persistent upward pressure to the token’s value while rewarding long-term contributors. All of this will be backed by Layer-2 technology for faster, cheaper transactions, and governed entirely on-chain. Once the current presale ends, the platform will move toward beta testing, with the listing of the MUTM token and the activation of mtToken claiming set to align with that launch window. Early holders will not just have price advantage—they’ll enter with an ownership stake in the protocol’s growth.

According to Bloomberg, WLFI announced plans to publish its stablecoin audit and launch a new app. Speaking at the Permissionless Conference in Brooklyn, New York, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zak Folkman noted that the WLFI token has received significant interest from public companies looking to use it as a treasury asset. At this point, Zak Folkman said the team is working to make WLFI transferable and listable. Folkman also noted that they plan to publish the first audit of their stablecoin USD1 in the coming days. ” You asked us to make WLFI transferable, and we heard you. The team is working behind the scenes to make it happen. Big news coming soon. Our governance token WLFI may soon be available for trading. We have also completed an accounting audit for the USD1 stablecoin and will be making it public soon.” Currently, WLFI is locked in users’ wallets. It grants voting rights to platform participants but is not traded in the market and is not traded on exchanges and cannot be bought or sold. However, Folkman's statement sparked speculation that the WLFI, which grants voting rights to its members, could be listed. WLFI, which has a total supply of 100 billion, has raised $550 million through public sales of more than 25 billion tokens in two fundraising rounds. *This is not investment advice.

For those navigating the world of cryptocurrency, understanding these pivotal moments in tech is crucial, as they often foreshadow shifts in data governance, privacy, and the very infrastructure of decentralized systems. From the moment Sam Altman stepped onto the stage at a packed San Francisco venue, it was clear this was no ordinary interview. What unfolded was a direct confrontation over the contentious OpenAI lawsuit with The New York Times, highlighting tensions that could redefine the future of digital content and user data. Why is Sam Altman So Adamant About the New York Times Lawsuit? The live recording of the ‘Hard Fork’ podcast, typically a platform for tech discourse, quickly transformed into a public battleground. Sam Altman , alongside COO Brad Lightcap, made an unexpected early entrance, immediately seizing the narrative. His opening gambit was a direct challenge to the New York Times, asking podcasters Kevin Roose and Casey Newton, ‘Are you going to talk about where you sue us because you don’t like user privacy?’ This bold move immediately redirected the conversation to the heart of the matter: The New York Times’ allegations that OpenAI and Microsoft improperly used its articles to train large language models. Altman was particularly irked by a recent development in the lawsuit, where The New York Times’ lawyers requested OpenAI to retain consumer ChatGPT and API customer data. This demand, even for private conversations or deleted logs, struck a nerve with the OpenAI chief, underscoring his strong stance on user privacy. What’s at Stake in the AI Copyright Battle? The core of the dispute revolves around AI copyright . Publishers argue that AI models, trained on their copyrighted works, could devalue or even replace their content, threatening their economic viability. This isn’t an isolated incident; multiple publishers have filed lawsuits against major AI developers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta for similar reasons. However, the legal tide may be shifting. A significant development occurred recently when OpenAI’s competitor, Anthropic, secured a partial victory in its own legal battle. A federal judge ruled that Anthropic’s use of books for training its AI models was permissible under certain circumstances. This ruling could set a crucial precedent, potentially emboldening other tech companies and altering the landscape of future AI copyright disputes, including the ongoing OpenAI lawsuit . How is ChatGPT Privacy Redefining User Rights? A particularly contentious point raised by Sam Altman was the New York Times’ demand for OpenAI to retain consumer ChatGPT and API customer data, even for users engaging in private mode or those who have requested data deletion. Altman articulated OpenAI’s strong stance on user privacy, stating, ‘The New York Times… is taking a position that we should have to preserve our users’ logs even if they’re chatting in private mode, even if they’ve asked us to delete them.’ This highlights a critical tension: the need for data for legal discovery versus the user’s right to privacy, especially in a world increasingly reliant on AI interactions. OpenAI asserts it takes steps to prevent harmful interactions and directs users to professional services, but acknowledges the difficulty in reaching users in ‘a fragile enough mental place’ with warnings. The ongoing debate around ChatGPT privacy underscores the complex ethical and legal challenges facing AI developers and users alike. What Are the Broader Challenges Facing the AI Industry? Beyond the legal skirmishes, OpenAI faces intense pressure from within the broader AI industry . Competition is fierce, with giants like Meta actively trying to poach OpenAI’s top talent, reportedly offering lucrative $100 million compensation packages. When asked about Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s true belief in superintelligent AI, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap quipped, ‘I think [Zuckerberg] believes he is superintelligent,’ underscoring the cutthroat nature of the talent war. Furthermore, OpenAI’s crucial partnership with Microsoft, once a major accelerant, is reportedly experiencing ‘points of tension’ as both ambitious companies increasingly compete in enterprise software and other domains. These internal and external pressures illustrate that OpenAI’s leadership is constantly navigating a complex web of legal challenges, competitive threats, and strategic partnerships, all while attempting to safely deploy highly intelligent AI systems at scale. The future direction of the AI industry will heavily depend on how these powerful entities manage their rivalries and collaborations. A Pivotal Moment for AI’s Future The dramatic encounter between Sam Altman and The New York Times journalists was more than just a public spat; it was a microcosm of the profound challenges and transformations sweeping across the AI industry . From the intricate legal battles over AI copyright and the critical importance of ChatGPT privacy to the relentless pursuit of talent and market dominance, OpenAI, under the leadership of Sam Altman , is at the epicenter of a defining era. The outcomes of the ongoing OpenAI lawsuit and similar legal challenges will undoubtedly set precedents for how AI models are trained, how user data is handled, and ultimately, how the relationship between technology and content creation evolves. As AI continues its rapid ascent, these foundational debates will shape not only its commercial trajectory but also its ethical framework and societal impact.

46815111,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=778238,1750932028,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46815111.jpeg,"XRP Bulls On Alert—’This Trendline Is Everything,’ Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-this-trendline-is-everything-analyst/,"XRP spent the past forty-eight hours coiling into a textbook inflection zone, and the 15-minute chart published by independent analyst Casi makes it hard to miss where the battle lines now stand. Price is hovering at $2.18, clinging to a steeply rising trendline that has underpinned every impulsive thrust since the local swing low near the 0.618 retracement at $1.9824 on 23 June. That trendline intersects a horizontal shelf of former resistance-turned-support at the 1.618 extension measured from the same base move, labelled on the chart at $2.186. The confluence forms the geometric “apex of consolidation” Casi has been highlighting on X. XRP Price At Breaking Point “This trendline is everything right now,” Casi wrote. “We just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation… that’s the most critical level on the chart, short-term.” The most recent corrective pullback already tagged the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the advance, exactly at $2.145, before bulls forced a reaction. As long as candles continue to close above that retracement—effectively the floor of the micro-range—Casi argues that the underlying market structure remains constructive. A decisive break beneath $2.145, by contrast, would represent both a loss of the diagonal trendline and a surrender of the consolidation base, signalling short-term weakness and, in his words, “opening the door to a deeper flush.” Related Reading: XRP Pullback Nearly Complete—Next Stop: $8 To $12, Says Analyst Overhead, XRP must still reckon with layered resistance. The first ceiling sits at $2.20, but the level called out as “the next big test” is the thicker pink band at $2.25. That mark capped price repeatedly during yesterday’s U.S. session and coincides with a prior 1.272 extension of the late-May corrective leg. “If we can flip that level, we’ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test,” Casi noted, “and from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically!” If price can reclaim $2.25 on expanding volume and then retest it as support, the chart leaves an unobstructed lane toward the 2.618 extension at $2.296—effectively $2.30—and, by projection, the $2.69 Fibonacci target that would complete the measured-move roadmap Casi is tracking. Related Reading: XRP To $30 Beyond 2026? Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch Momentum, however, is not yet offering a clean green light. The lower pane shows a 14-period RSI capped by its own descending trendline that has compressed every rally since 24 June. With the oscillator printing 46.24 (signal) versus 43.59 (base line) at the time of the screenshot, the gauge is climbing but still mid-range. A marginal higher high in price paired with a lower high in RSI would etch a textbook bearish divergence—an outcome Casi told one follower he is “expecting to set up” if XRP pierces $2.25 before consolidating anew. “I think this next high will form a bearish div,” he added. “The RSI is telling me it’s about to set that up.” In short, the token is balanced on a knife-edge: the bull case hinges on the integrity of the $2.145–$2.186 support complex and a breakout through $2.25, while the bear case rests on trendline failure and an RSI divergence confirming upside exhaustion. With liquidity thinning into the weekend, the resolution of this narrow consolidation could shape the next wave—whether that proves to be the ignition of a larger third impulse or the start of a deeper corrective detour. As Casi put it, “This is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.19.

A wallet tagged as “Kewh32” placed a major limit order to offload 275,672 $TRUMP tokens worth $2.49 million. OFFICIAL TRUMP price is already down by 30% over the last 30 days. All this quiet offloading is unfolding just as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) officially went to bat for Trump’s proposed Truth Social ETF. It was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to greenlight a new rule allowing it to list. If approved, the ETF would launch within 90 days and mark a huge leap in Trump’s push into crypto finance. Trump meme whale dumps millions According to the data shared by Lookonchain, the whale who dumped $2.49 million worth of TRUMP tokens had already sold 100k TRUMPs (approx. worth $1 million) just 15 days ago. It still holds over 369,000 TRUMP, worth another $3.3 million. The whale is peeling off positions like it’s pre-election tax season. This gets even worse for the token as around the same time, the Trump Meme Team pulled liquidity. They removed 4.4 million USDC and 347,438 TRUMP tokens (approx. worth $3.12 million). Then comes the next move, they bridged the USDC to Ethereum and dropped $TRUMP into a fresh new wallet. It is being considered as a little wallet cleaning, but maybe it is a stealthy exit. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) to a new wallet. https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiA https://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 TRUMP price is on a decline lately, it is down by almost 40% in the last 60 days, while it dropped marginally over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, TRUMP is still up by 645% on the year to date (YTD) basis, trading at an average price of $9 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume stood at $268 million. Its partner token, Official Melania Meme, has also witnessed a heavy dump since the launch. MELANIA price is now down by 98% from its all time high of $13.73. It is trading at an average price of $0.213 at press time. Trump plans $2.5B Bitcoin bet via Truth Social As the crypto market recovers, Trump Media has already proposed both a combined Bitcoin-and-Ethereum ETF and a standalone Bitcoin ETF. It has even teased a $2.5 billion fundraise to make Truth Social one of the largest Bitcoin holders on the planet. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs are still soaking up billions, and Trump’s play could turn DJT into a meme stock and a crypto giant in one MAGA-powered shot. But here’s the kicker, DJT is 52% owned by a Trump trust. This suggests that if these ETFs go live and if that meme coin liquidity mysteriously returns, Donald Trump could end up riding a Bitcoin-fueled redemption arc that’s equal parts ETF and meme magic. The global digital assets market surged marginally on Thursday, holding the $3.31 trillion cap. Bitcoin price rallied to hit $108k from below the $100k mark over the last 7 days.

Stablecoin volume on Ethereum is projected to grow 15x by 2030, driving significant fee (gas) revenue and supporting long-term price appreciation. Current on-chain metrics, including MVRV, indicate Ethereum is undervalued with substantial upside potential as network activity increases. I recommend long-term investment in Ethereum, either directly or via ETFs like ETHA, to capitalize on institutional adoption and DeFi leadership. Introduction Since my first update on Ethereum back in April of this year (buy recommendation), the asset has appreciated 52.82% compared to 12.89% for the S&P 500 YTD. Today, we will analyse the asset again from the perspective of stablecoin activity as a catalyst for value and price appreciation. On 4 February 2025, the GENIUS bill (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act of 2025) was presented to the US Senate. Basically, this law establishes a federal framework for action and best practices for ‘Payment Stablecoins’ assets. It requires stablecoin issuers to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, with the corresponding implementation of KYC procedures and transaction monitoring through the Travel Rule. The aim of this is to leverage blockchain technology at the transactional and transparency level to improve transaction efficiency and settlements, avoid surprises in collateral quality, and protect the end user. With this regulation, the cryptographic system has been provided with the ideal conditions for mass adoption based on trust and the entry of traditional financial players (see Visa , Mastercard , or JPMorgan ). In today's article, we will analyse Ethereum's asset from the perspective of stablecoin flow as a massive catalyst of value and compare it with other networks of the same type. Analysis - On - Chain With the GENIUS law currently in place, and also previously, the volume of tokenised money (stablecoins) has grown significantly to reach approximately USD 250 billion. With the approval of this law, it is estimated that between now and 2030 there will be exponential growth in the volume of stablecoins, multiplying the current amounts by 15 to reach USD 4 trillion in tokenised money. As we can see in the image below, the Ethereum network dominates the market in terms of this activity, far surpassing its main competitors (Tron, Binance, and Solana). This data is very important in terms of investment thesis, as the existence of a higher volume generates higher fees (revenue) for the protocol itself. With this and the network's configuration in terms of burning supply through L2 fees, conditions are often created for a sustained price increase. Node Analytica Secondly, we now turn to the volume of stablecoins flowing through the Ethereum network. As we can see in the graph, the current volume reaches 100 billion dollars on a weekly basis. This volume is mainly dominated by the USDT, USDC and DAI protocols. The companies that own these protocols, Tether, Circle and MakerDAO, collateralise liquid assets such as treasury bills or cash & equivalents with which they back their own stablecoins. As mentioned above, with the approval of the GENIUS Act, we will gradually begin to see players from the traditional financial industry entering this market. We can also see in the graph that, in recent times, the volume of stablecoins has grown significantly on the Ethereum network, rising from 70 billion USD to 100 billion. Among other things, this has led to a price increase, but not enough in my opinion, which is why I believe the asset is undervalued, although we will discuss this in detail in the last part of the article. Node Analytica The following image shows the amount of gas (revenue) generated by the different sectors operating within the Ethereum network. Readers should not be alarmed by the shape of the graph and the gas levels generated during 2022, as this was typical of the network when it operated under the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. Current levels are actually normal. The information in this graph is crucial to our bullish thesis because greater gas generation by the different sectors leads to greater use of the network, ultimately resulting in greater utility, transactionality, and speed in the token that models the Ethereum economy. Node Analytica In this graph, we isolate the ‘Stablecoins’ sector and calculate the cumulative sum of Gas contributed to the Ethereum protocol throughout history to see how important the sector has been and to look at its growth potential. As we can see, the ‘Stablecoins’ sector has generated fees for the protocol of more than USD 1.4 billion over time and continues to trend upwards. If the scenario for 2030 mentioned above were to come to pass and the volume of stablecoins grew by 1,500%, this would translate into an increase in the same magnitude in the Gas generated by this sector and, therefore, a massive increase in the price of the asset. I firmly believe that we are facing unprecedented growth in Ethereum, which, accompanied by the flow of institutional capital already flowing into it, makes this asset a unique investment opportunity. Node Analytica Finally, we look at Ethereum's MVRV metric, which compares market value to realised value. It is currently around 0.4, a level that in previous cycles has coincided with moments of undervaluation. When the Market Value Realised Value has reached values between 1.5 and 2, Ethereum has marked local highs around USD 4,000 before entering an overbought zone from a technical point of view. Furthermore, if we look at the price ranges based on this ratio, the highs in this cycle are projected to be between USD 4,800 and USD 6,400. With the current price close to USD 2,500, the upside potential remains very significant, especially if activity on the network accelerates thanks to the volume of stablecoins operating on the network. This leads us to an important consideration: is the market underestimating the potential for commission income (gas) on Ethereum? A higher volume of stablecoins translates into more transactions, more fees, and a strengthening of the asset's role as a driver of the decentralised finance sector. This dual momentum—network usage fees and leadership in DeFi—could lead us to reconsider the fair value of ETH in the coming quarters. CryptoQuant Conclusion In conclusion, and to wrap up this article, I recommend investing in Ethereum for the long term, either by purchasing the asset itself on secure exchanges such as Coinbase or by investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) promoted by BlackRock. If you choose to gain exposure to the asset through the ETF, you will not incur the risks associated with custody, although you will pay a slightly higher commission than if you purchase it directly on a centralised exchange.",ETH-USD|ETH|ETHE|ETHT|ETHA,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-26 10:03:15

John Deaton Says It’s Decentralized,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-doesnt-control-xrp-john-deaton-says-its-decentralized/,"The post Ripple Doesn’t Control XRP? John Deaton Says It’s Decentralized appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the United States moves forward with clearer cryptocurrency regulations , one of the most debated topics — Is XRP centralized? — is finally finding resolution. Many critics have long argued that Ripple’s control over a large portion of XRP supply makes it centralized. But recent legal outcomes and technical facts prove otherwise. Why People Think XRP Is Centralized The confusion largely stems from Ripple holding around 40% of the total XRP supply. This has led many to believe Ripple controls the network. But this is a misunderstanding of how XRP works. On June 26, prominent crypto attorney John E. Deaton addressed this on X (formerly Twitter), stating: “75K XRP holders from 143 countries around the globe is pretty darn decentralized to me. People often conflate the token of the network with the network itself.” He clarified that owning a large number of tokens doesn’t equal controlling the protocol. Ripple’s Legal Win Clarifies XRP’s Status The debate around XRP’s centralization intensified due to the SEC lawsuit that began in 2020, accusing Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After nearly five years of legal proceedings, the case officially concluded on May 8, 2025 , with Ripple winning a favorable outcome and paying only a reduced penalty. Importantly, the court confirmed that XRP is not a security when traded in secondary markets, reinforcing its status as a decentralized digital asset. This decision provided legal clarity and boosted investor confidence. Why XRP Is Technically Decentralized Beyond legal clarity and community ownership, several technical aspects of the XRP Ledger support its decentralized nature: 1. Independent Validators The XRP Ledger runs on a consensus model with over 150 independent validators . Ripple controls only one validator , meaning it cannot force changes or manipulate the network. 2. No Centralized Mining XRP doesn’t use proof-of-work like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This avoids control by mining pools and ensures equal participation from validators. 3. 80% Consensus Required for Changes Any update to the XRP Ledger must gain 80% validator approval for two consecutive weeks. This strict requirement makes unilateral control by Ripple impossible. [post_titles_links postid=”475091″] Ripple CEO: Utility Over Ideology Even Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple , recently argued that decentralization shouldn’t be the only benchmark. He emphasized that what matters is the utility, transparency, and security of the network — not just ideology. While Ripple does hold a significant amount of XRP, it has no control over the XRP Ledger’s rules or validation process. That power lies with a diverse and global community. Final Thought The long-standing debate over XRP’s centralization is finally settling, thanks to facts, legal clarity, and growing global participation. With 75,000 XRP holders across 143 countries, over 150 validators, and a network that demands consensus for change, XRP is proving itself to be a decentralized asset at its core.Ripple may be the face of XRP, but it is not the hand behind the curtain.

The U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHHA) has issued a new directive that allows Americans to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to qualify for a mortgage, without converting their crypto into dollars. This step could bring digital assets into the heart of the $20 trillion U.S. mortgage market, signaling a big moment for crypto’s role in everyday finance. Good news for the 55 million Americans who own crypto. @NatCryptoAssoc https://t.co/zUG8hWP1wk — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin Just Got Closer to the American Dream Under Director Bill Pulte, the FHFA has instructed mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to integrate cryptocurrency payments into mortgage eligibility assessments. This directive positions Bitcoin as a credible form of collateral in mainstream finance, a sentiment echoed by MicroStrategy cofounder Michael Saylor, who called it a “defining moment” for institutional adoption. “Future generations will remember this as the moment Bitcoin entered the American dream,” Saylor declared in a recent X post . Analyst Eric Coleman stated that this action might allow younger Americans, who are frequently excluded from the housing market will now secure their first mortgages through crypto assets. New Hope for First-Time Homebuyers Analyst Eric Coleman said the change could help younger Americans, especially those struggling to break into the housing market, use their crypto holdings to qualify for home loans. Treating Bitcoin as a reserve asset within the U.S. housing system may finally give digital-native investors a path toward owning property, something that’s long been out of reach for many. But Not Everyone’s Celebrating Despite the excitement, some experts are urging caution. Crypto remains a volatile asset class, and critics warn this move could carry risks similar to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Others in the Bitcoin community have raised concerns around self-custody. To qualify for a mortgage, crypto assets may need to be held on centralized platforms like Coinbase. This raises questions about privacy, ownership, and the trade-offs between regulation and decentralization. Ripple and the Bigger Picture As Ripple and other blockchain companies push for more crypto-friendly regulations, the FHFA directive marks a clear step forward. It blends traditional housing finance with digital innovation in a way that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Is this the moment crypto truly goes mainstream?

He credited Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the trailblazer that led many corporations that previously never touched crypto to consider holding digital assets in their balance sheet and as part of their corporate reserves. As opposed to only holding fiat, more companies across the globe have been accumulating Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major tokens as a hedge against inflation. Folkman claimed that companies are also eyeing World Liberty Financial’s token as a potential addition to their corporate reserves. “There has been a lot of interest from several public vehicles who want to use WLFI to be held in their treasuries as well,” said Folkman as quoted by Bloomberg.

New on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that miner revenue has dropped to just $34 million a day, the lowest since April. It’s the weakest miners have seen in more than a year – and one of the worst stretches since July 2022. “Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year,” CryptoQuant said in a post on X . For an industry that runs on thin margins and constant pressure, that’s a big red flag. What’s Behind the Crash? Two key factors are behind this sharp drop in miner income. First, Bitcoin’s transaction fees have fallen by 50%, cutting into what miners earn on top of block rewards. Second, Bitcoin’s price itself has dropped around 15%, which directly impacts miner revenue. When both fees and price take a hit, miners feel it fast. That’s exactly what we’re seeing now and it’s pushing profits close to their lowest point in two years. Margins are tight, rewards are down, and the pressure is building. If this continues, some miners may be forced to scale down or shut off rigs until things improve. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Whales Aren’t Moving the Same Way While miners are struggling, Bitcoin’s biggest holders, the whales, are showing mixed signals. According to Glassnode, there’s no clear pattern among whale wallets right now. Smaller whales, those holding 1 to 10 BTC, are redistributing their coins, possibly locking in profits or shifting strategies. But larger wallets holding 10 to 100 BTC are accumulating instead. That contrast is important. Bigger whales buying usually signals confidence and that might explain why Bitcoin is trying to break above $108,000, a level it’s been testing recently. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score supports this, rising from 0.25 to 0.57 – showing a noticeable uptick in accumulation by these mid-sized whale wallets. As $BTC attempts to reclaim $108K, the Accumulation Trend Score shows no unified cohort behavior. 1–10 #BTC wallets continue distributing, while 10–100 $BTC are net accumulators. Others show mixed signals, though the overall score has rebounded from 0.25 to 0.57 pic.twitter.com/qAivkvziK3 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 26, 2025 So, Where Does This Leave the Market? Right now, the market’s split. Miners are under pressure, but whales are stepping in. If Bitcoin can hold above $108K, it could ease some of the stress on miners and validate the recent accumulation. But if the price drops further, things could get worse before they get better. Either way, this is a moment to watch closely. The choices miners and whales make now could set the tone for what’s next in this cycle.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 10:08:17

Sounds intriguing, right? Now, imagine that same currency is a ruble-backed stablecoin , originating from a nation like Kyrgyzstan, and suddenly, those billions spark significant concerns about global financial integrity. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s the reality of the A7A5 stablecoin , and its rapid ascent is drawing the attention of financial watchdogs worldwide, raising critical questions about its potential role in circumventing international sanctions. What is the A7A5 Stablecoin and Why the Massive Discrepancy? At its core, the A7A5 stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value, pegged to the Russian Ruble. Like other stablecoins, it aims to offer the benefits of blockchain technology – speed, transparency (to a degree), and lower transaction costs – while mitigating the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies. However, the numbers surrounding A7A5 are anything but typical. Despite having a reported market capitalization of just $156 million, this digital asset has facilitated an astonishing $9.3 billion in transactions over a four-month period. This immense disparity between market cap and transaction volume is a glaring red flag. Why is this discrepancy so concerning? Velocity of Funds: Such a high transaction volume relative to market cap suggests an extremely rapid movement of funds. Money is flowing in, being used, and flowing out almost immediately, rather than being held within the stablecoin’s ecosystem for extended periods. Lack of Transparency: While blockchain transactions are pseudonymous, the sheer scale hints at concentrated activity rather than broad, organic adoption. This raises questions about who is moving these vast sums and for what purpose. Potential for Illicit Use: The speed and volume make it an attractive tool for those looking to move large amounts of money quickly and discreetly, potentially outside the purview of traditional financial systems. Reports, notably from BeInCrypto, indicate that the reserves backing A7A5 are held in a Russian state-owned bank. This connection immediately amplifies the existing concerns, especially given the current geopolitical climate and the extensive financial sanctions imposed on Russia. Unpacking the Billions: The Sanctions Evasion Hypothesis The most pressing concern surrounding the A7A5 stablecoin is its potential use in sanctions evasion . With many Russian entities and individuals facing stringent financial restrictions from the international community, finding alternative channels for transactions has become a priority for them. Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins that offer a peg to fiat currencies, present a tempting avenue. How could A7A5 facilitate sanctions evasion? Consider the following: Mechanism Explanation Relevance to A7A5 Off-Ramp/On-Ramp Services Converting traditional fiat currency into crypto and back again, often through less regulated exchanges. Reports link A7A5’s volume to Russian exchanges, suggesting it’s being used as a bridge for funds. Trade Finance Alternatives Using stablecoins to settle international trade, bypassing traditional banking channels that enforce sanctions. Could enable Russian businesses to continue international transactions. Asset Hiding/Transfer Moving wealth across borders discreetly, making it harder for authorities to trace and freeze assets. The high velocity of funds through A7A5 points to rapid transfers rather than long-term holding. The connection to Russian exchanges and a Russian state-owned bank for reserves strengthens the hypothesis that A7A5 might be serving as a crucial financial conduit for sanctioned entities. This not only undermines the effectiveness of international sanctions but also poses a significant threat to global financial stability and security. Is Kyrgyzstan a New Frontier for Kyrgyzstan Crypto Operations? The emergence of A7A5 from Kyrgyzstan brings the nation’s role in the broader Kyrgyzstan crypto landscape into sharp focus. While Kyrgyzstan has shown some openness to blockchain technology, its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains relatively nascent compared to more established financial hubs. This less stringent environment can inadvertently create fertile ground for operations that seek to exploit regulatory gaps. Why Kyrgyzstan? Geographic Proximity: Its proximity to Russia and other Central Asian states makes it a logical nexus for cross-border financial flows in the region. Developing Regulatory Landscape: A less mature regulatory environment might offer more flexibility, or even loopholes, for crypto operations that might face stricter scrutiny elsewhere. Economic Incentives: The potential for economic benefits from facilitating digital asset flows could also play a role in a developing economy. The sheer scale of A7A5’s activity suggests that it’s not merely a small-scale experiment but a significant operation. This places Kyrgyzstan under increased international scrutiny, urging its authorities to address these concerns proactively to prevent their financial system from being perceived as a haven for illicit activities. The Urgent Call for Robust Crypto Regulation The A7A5 saga underscores a critical, ongoing debate: the pressing need for comprehensive and internationally coordinated crypto regulation . As digital assets become increasingly integrated into the global financial system, the risks associated with their misuse – from money laundering to sanctions evasion – become more pronounced. Key Challenges in Crypto Regulation: Borderless Nature: Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making it difficult for individual nations to enforce regulations effectively without international cooperation. Anonymity/Pseudonymity: While transactions are recorded on a public ledger, identifying the real-world identities behind addresses remains a significant hurdle. Rapid Innovation: The crypto space evolves quickly, often outpacing the ability of regulators to understand and legislate new technologies. Varying National Approaches: Different countries adopt diverse regulatory stances, creating opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The case of A7A5 serves as a stark reminder that gaps in regulation can be exploited, potentially undermining geopolitical stability and the integrity of the traditional financial system. It reinforces the argument for global standards, robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, and greater transparency in stablecoin operations. What Are the Broader Implications? The implications of a stablecoin like A7A5 operating under such suspicious circumstances are far-reaching: Erosion of Sanctions Effectiveness: If digital assets can consistently bypass sanctions, the very tool designed to exert economic pressure loses its efficacy. Increased Geopolitical Tensions: The perception of nations facilitating sanctions evasion through crypto can strain international relations. Reputational Damage for Crypto: Such incidents fuel negative narratives around cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to harsher, less nuanced regulatory responses that could stifle legitimate innovation. Financial System Instability: Unregulated large-scale flows can introduce systemic risks, making it harder to track and manage global financial health. This situation demands a vigilant response from regulators, financial institutions, and the crypto community itself. The future of digital finance hinges on its ability to operate transparently and responsibly, adhering to international norms and laws. Actionable Insights for a Safer Crypto Ecosystem For individuals and institutions alike, understanding the risks posed by entities like A7A5 is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: For Regulators and Governments: Enhance Monitoring: Implement advanced analytics to detect unusual transaction patterns in stablecoins, particularly those linked to high-risk jurisdictions. Foster International Cooperation: Share intelligence and coordinate regulatory responses across borders to close loopholes. Develop Clear Stablecoin Frameworks: Mandate robust reserve audits, transparency requirements, and stringent AML/KYC protocols for all stablecoin issuers. For Crypto Users and Businesses: Due Diligence: Research the stablecoins you use. Understand their backing, issuer, and regulatory compliance. Be Wary of High-Volume, Low-Transparency Assets: If a stablecoin shows massive transaction volume with a disproportionately low market cap, or if its backing is opaque, exercise extreme caution. Advocate for Responsible Innovation: Support projects and platforms that prioritize compliance and transparency. A Wake-Up Call for the Digital Age The story of the A7A5 stablecoin serves as a potent reminder of the dual nature of innovation. While cryptocurrencies offer immense potential for financial inclusion and efficiency, they also present new challenges that demand vigilance and robust governance. The staggering transaction volume, coupled with the explicit links to Russian entities and the ruble, paints a concerning picture of potential sanctions evasion . This situation is a critical test for the global financial community and for the evolving landscape of crypto regulation . It highlights the urgent need for international collaboration to ensure that digital assets are tools for progress, not for illicit activities that undermine global stability.

The exploit targeted cvcrvUSD, a wrapped version of Curve DAO’s ( CRV ) crvUSD token staked through Convex Finance. Analysts say the attacker manipulated the share price of cvcrvUSD by sending small donations, which artificially inflated its value. Because Resupply’s exchange rate formula relied on this inflated price, the system became vulnerable. You might also like: Hacken bridge exploited for $250k HAI token following private key leak The attacker then used Resupply’s smart contract to borrow 10 million reUSD, the platform’s native stablecoin, with just one wei of cvcrvUSD as collateral. The borrowed reUSD was quickly swapped into other assets on external markets, resulting in a net loss of nearly $9.5 million. Additional investigation revealed that the attacker exploited an empty ERC4626 wrapper that was serving as a price oracle in the CurveLend pair of the protocol. This allowed the price of cvcrvUSD to spike using just two crvUSD, bypassing the usual collateral requirements. This incident adds to a growing trend of price manipulation attacks in 2025. Similar exploits have recently affected protocols such as Meta Pool and the GMX/MIM Spell ecosystem, which were both compromised due to oracle vulnerabilities and low-liquidity token manipulation. Weak pricing mechanisms and flash loans remain common tools for attackers, who continue to target DeFi systems with thin trading volumes despite passing contract security audits. Resupply has not yet confirmed whether user funds will be reimbursed or if recovery efforts are underway.

Partly because of the tremendous success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: $IBIT: iShares Bitcoin Trust, $70.6B Assets Under Management (AUM) $FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, $20.4B AUM $GBTC: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, $19.6B AUM $ETHA: iShares Ethereum Trust, $3.9B AUM $ETHE: Grayscale Ethereum Trust, $2.8B AUM It’s no surprise that more players are ready to enter the game, particularly as the realms of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) move ever-closer together. Only $BTC and $ETH currently have single-asset crypto ETFs, but the pile of pending filings includes everything from $XRP to $SOL to the first-ever NFT ETF, with Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU). And with single-asset crypto ETFs rolling along, institutions aren’t waiting around for the SEC. They’ve already started to move towards multi-asset ETFs. Converting Existing Funds to Multi-Asset ETFs One of the holdups so far has been that the SEC lacks a clear set of rules around crypto ETFs, even after the $BTC and $ETH approvals went ahead. The question now is, will the SEC hold approvals until they draw up new rules? Or will they approve first and develop the rule set as they go? There is some time pressure at work here. Grayscale wants to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to an ETF, and the deadline for that is July 2. That fund already holds a number of crypto assets, including $XRP, $SOL, and $ADA. If the conversion is approved, look for others to follow. Investment managers from Bitwise to Hasdex have plans to convert other funds to multi-asset ETFs that include cryptos. The funds sit at the top of the financial and investment world, and every one that gets approved boosts Solana’s long-term outlook just slightly. But much, much farther down, there’s another reason to be excited for Solana. The frenetic, fast-paced world of Solana meme coin trading just got a tool that could bring much-needed clarity and make finding those 10x or 100x opportunities much easier. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – One Bot to Rule Them All for Meme Coin Trading on Telegram What do you need to find and trade memes on Telegram? You need: Lightning-fast transactions and swaps Automated sniping, to get in and out at the right time Protection from rug pulls, honeypots, and front-running trades Thankfully, traders now have Snorter Bot , the meme coin-styled trading bot designed specifically for trading low-cap Solana memes on Telegram.

In a major announcement on Wednesday, the company revealed it is rolling out crypto trading services and launching blockchain-based international remittances. The move marks a significant pivot for the firm, which had exited the crypto industry in November 2023 due to regulatory limitations tied to its bank charter. Customers will now be able to buy, sell, and hold various cryptocurrencies directly within their SoFi accounts. The company is also introducing on-chain remittance services, allowing users to convert fiat into crypto, transfer it over the blockchain, and reconvert it into local fiat currencies—streamlining cross-border payments. These new services are part of SoFi’s broader push into crypto finance, with plans to support stablecoin offerings and crypto-backed borrowing in the near future. SoFi CEO Sees Long-Term Potential in Blockchain and AI SoFi CEO Anthony Noto expressed strong enthusiasm about the firm’s renewed focus on digital assets. “This is just day one. We can make financial systems faster, safer, more accessible, and lower cost for our members,” he added . The announcement also included plans for staking features and expanded payment options, underscoring SoFi’s aim to become a one-stop-shop for modern financial services. Its Galileo platform, a core part of the company’s infrastructure, will additionally support third-party crypto services such as wallets and custody solutions—allowing SoFi to cater to both consumers and fintech developers in the digital asset ecosystem. SoFi’s timing aligns with bullish industry projections, with Insider forecasting that the fintech blockchain market could grow from $3.4 billion in 2024 to $49 billion by 2030. This potential surge provides fertile ground for SoFi to scale its crypto operations. Regulatory Climate Now More Favorable SoFi’s earlier withdrawal from crypto was a condition of securing a bank charter in 2023. However, recent regulatory shifts have opened the door for its return. With the Federal Reserve easing constraints like “reputational risk” and stablecoin legislation advancing in Congress , the environment now appears more accommodating. In response to the news and broader optimism, SoFi’s stock (SOFI) has risen approximately 12% over the past week.

After three years of steady development, the MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) is finally seeing mainstream adoption. Over 90% of nodes now validate MWEB blocks, and more than 150,000 LTC, about $12 million, has been locked into this confidential ledger. Wallets like Cake and Electrum LTC now support MWEB, offering privacy with efficiency, and making Litecoin more practical as a medium of exchange rather than just a legacy network. Qubetics , however, is currently leading market attention for all the right reasons. With a confirmed listing on one of the top 10 centralized exchanges and only few million tokens remaining, Qubetics offers one of the clearest entry points in today’s market. More than a liquidity event, this listing marks a strategic milestone, opening doors to institutional onboarding, cross-chain interoperability, and retail adoption. With demand surging, this project is being recognized as one of the best altcoins to invest in now for utility-driven growth and early-stage positioning. Meanwhile, Cronos has been trading near key support at $0.084, following a 5% weekly dip. Despite the correction, attention is shifting toward July’s anticipated network upgrade. This upgrade will introduce sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transactions, dramatically improving dApp performance and developer accessibility. With bullish patterns forming and technical momentum building, Cronos could become one of the best altcoins to invest in now as the second half of 2025 unfolds. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions with Real-World Utility Qubetics delivers a solution that legacy projects have failed to resolve: seamless, low-cost cross-border transactions. The network enables businesses, freelancers, and individuals to bypass slow settlement systems and costly intermediaries. Through its native protocol, users can send and receive digital value across jurisdictions, with near-zero delays and stable on-chain execution. Its interoperability-first architecture ensures that enterprises are not locked into a single chain. By offering a decentralized financial network with global compliance potential, Qubetics aligns with future-facing blockchain models. This level of real-world usability is what continues to drive traction, and why many rank Qubetics among the best altcoins to invest in now. Stage 37 Presale and Tokenomics Overhaul Strengthen Fundamentals Qubetics has officially entered Stage 37, the final phase of its crypto presale . At $0.3370 per $TICS token, and with a confirmed listing at $0.40, current participants are guaranteed a 20% value boost on listing day. So far, over $18.1 million has been raised, more than 516 million tokens sold, and over 28,200 unique holders have joined the ecosystem. In addition, the protocol underwent a tokenomics transformation earlier this quarter. The total supply has been reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, while the public allocation increased to 38.55%. This creates a more sustainable economic model, enhances scarcity, and supports community-led governance. Analysts closely monitoring token distribution and early performance have consistently ranked Qubetics among the best altcoins to invest in now based on presale fundamentals. Exchange Debut Imminent: Final Chance to Join Before Market Exposure Qubetics is now set for listing on one of the world’s top 10 centralized exchanges. The confirmed listing price of $0.40 ensures a 20% gain from the current presale entry of $0.3370. With fewer than 10 million tokens remaining, access is narrowing quickly. The listing represents a strategic shift into broader access, bringing in institutional market makers, enabling liquidity scaling, and triggering new deployments of Qubetics-powered applications. The network is now preparing for expanded developer activity, retail traction, and full market participation heading into Q3 and Q4 2025. At this trajectory, a $2,500 entry at the $0.3370 rate could grow into a $37,500 to $75,000 opportunity over time. With security validated through a CertiK audit scoring above 80%, Qubetics is entering the market with one of the most battle-tested rollouts seen in this cycle. These are the elements placing Qubetics at the top of many rankings for the best altcoins to invest in now. Litecoin: Privacy and Fungibility Driving New Demand Litecoin’s MWEB feature is drawing renewed attention as adoption metrics continue to grow. Enabled in 2022 and now validated by over 90% of miners and nodes, MWEB offers confidential transactions with native CoinJoin and stealth address integration. More than 150,000 LTC has been locked into the private extension layer, proving the demand for scalable privacy. What makes MWEB stand out is its optional design. Unlike Monero or Zcash, where privacy is either default or heavy on-chain, Litecoin provides a lightweight alternative. Wallet support is increasing, and analysts believe that the rising pool size will only enhance privacy further by obscuring flows. With low transaction costs and faster confirmations, Litecoin is becoming a practical digital medium of exchange once again. This renewed functionality places it back on the radar of serious buyers considering the best altcoins to invest in now. Cronos: Under-the-Radar Contender with July Upgrade Potential Cronos has quietly established a foothold within the DeFi and GameFi sectors. Backed by Crypto.com, the chain enables seamless app deployment and fast transaction finality. While its recent 5% decline may seem like a setback, the bigger story is the forthcoming July upgrade. Set to deliver sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transaction speeds, this upgrade is designed to supercharge Cronos’ performance. For developers, this means lower fees and improved on-chain responsiveness. For market participants, it points to growing network activity and better infrastructure performance. With CRO trading at around $0.084, analysts consider this a crucial support zone. If this level holds and the upgrade delivers, Cronos could reenter the spotlight and gain ground in rankings of the best altcoins to invest in now. Final Thoughts As market conditions begin shifting in favor of high-utility assets, several projects are rising to the top. Litecoin is proving that privacy can be optional and scalable. Cronos is building toward a high-performance future with its July upgrade. But Qubetics, with its confirmed CEX launch and presale momentum, is dominating attention. Only less than 10 million tokens remain at the $0.3370 price point. The listing at $0.40 locks in a rare 20% return from day one, positioning it as one of the most compelling entries in today’s digital asset market. Once public access begins, the value proposition shifts. Those seeking the best altcoins to invest in now are acting quickly. Between usability, tokenomics, security, and a strategic exchange debut, Qubetics delivers a full-stack value case unmatched in current presale offerings. Secure allocation now while the door is still open. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the best altcoin to invest in now with guaranteed listing ROI? Qubetics is offering a 20% ROI with a confirmed CEX listing at $0.40, making it a top pick for short-term value. How does Qubetics stand out from other crypto presales? Its real-world use case in cross-border transactions, tight tokenomics, and audited security give it strong market positioning. Why is Litecoin gaining traction again? Litecoin’s optional privacy layer via MWEB is seeing rapid adoption, boosting utility without sacrificing speed or cost-efficiency. Is Cronos still a viable altcoin despite recent dips? Yes. Cronos is preparing for a major July upgrade that could deliver sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transactions. How many Qubetics tokens are left in the presale? Fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens remain at the $0.3370 price before the confirmed exchange listing. Summary: This article identifies the best altcoins to invest in now, spotlighting Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cronos. Qubetics leads with a confirmed listing on a top 10 exchange at $0.40, offering a 20% return for current participants in its final presale phase. With under 10 million tokens left and over $18.1 million raised, it’s regarded as one of the top crypto presale opportunities of 2025. Litecoin gains momentum as its MWEB privacy layer surpasses 150,000 LTC locked, enabling scalable and optional privacy for everyday transactions. Cronos, meanwhile, is holding key support at $0.084 and preparing for a major July upgrade to enable sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transactions. Together, these altcoins offer strong fundamentals, utility-driven growth, and timely entry points, making them standout picks for strategic backers seeking value now.

According to the press release , the penalty marks the first enforcement action under the law, which took effect in 2023 to enhance oversight of digital asset companies. Coinme operates a network of cryptocurrency kiosks, also known as crypto ATMs, at various retail locations across California. These machines allow customers to buy and sell digital assets using cash or debit cards. However, according to DFPI, Coinme broke the rules by allowing transactions that exceeded the daily limit of $1,000 per customer, a clear breach of DFAL provisions. In addition to exceeding transaction limits, the DFPI found that Coinme failed to provide required transaction disclosures on customer receipts, another violation of the state’s digital finance regulations. California Regulators Send a Clear Message About Crypto ATM Under a consent order, Coinme agreed to pay the $300,000 fine, which includes $51,700 in restitution to an elderly California resident who was exploited in a crypto scam facilitated through one of the company’s kiosks. The company must also implement operational changes to ensure compliance and prevent future violations. DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni emphasized that the enforcement action aims to set a precedent. “This enforcement action should send a strong message to kiosk operators that California means business when it requires digital asset companies to follow the rules that help prevent scammers from taking advantage of unsuspecting Californians,” said Mohseni. The DFAL was specifically designed to address growing fraud involving crypto kiosks, which have become a tool for scammers targeting vulnerable groups, especially older adults. Victims are often tricked into transferring funds directly into scammers’ digital wallets via these machines. Meanwhile, this is not the first time the state will go after crypto service providers. In May, the California DFPI and Department of Justice teamed up to fight crypto fraud, shutting down 26 scam websites with the help of a widely used Crypto Scam Tracker tool. Based on consumer complaints, the tool has helped uncover $4.6 million in losses linked to fraudulent schemes. California regulators received 2,668 complaints from residents through its ‘Crypto Scam Tracker’ tool, that led to identify 7 new scam schemes. #CryptoScam #CryptoFraud #CaliforniaDFPI https://t.co/GEhyLAXURy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 11, 2025 In 2023, Californians lost around $1.2 billion to crypto scams, according to the FBI. Notably, the DFPI received 2,668 complaints, leading to the discovery of seven new fraud cases. California Crypto Regulations and Licenses Take Shape California is moving closer to embracing cryptocurrency in public finance with the unanimous passage of Assembly Bill 1180. Approved by the State Assembly on June 2, the bill authorizes the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to launch a pilot program allowing state agencies to accept digital assets for fee payments. California Assembly unanimously approves crypto payments bill. AB-1180 now heads to the Senate. #crypto #California https://t.co/HCk96E5CxN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Introduced by Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, the bill also mandates that DFPI submit a detailed report by January 1, 2028, evaluating crypto transaction volumes, regulatory challenges, and recommendations. The program will sunset on July 1, 2031. In addition, AB-1180 establishes the Digital Financial Assets Law, requiring businesses to obtain a DFPI license by July 1, 2025, to operate in the crypto space. It also sets rules for consumer protection and stablecoin use. While the bill doesn’t mandate crypto adoption, it empowers DFPI to explore secure, efficient digital payment systems, positioning California as a potential leader in public-sector crypto integration.

Amid this speculation, hostilities in the Middle East escalated, which put further pressure on the crypto market. Most of the value was in Bitcoin contracts, which accounted for $3.5 billion, while Ethereum options were worth around $565 billion. The put-to-call ratio for BTC was 1.0, which suggested a neutral stance; meanwhile, ETH had a ratio of 0.69, which suggests a rise in bullish expectations. Crypto markets remain in a cautious mood amid fears that conflict in the Middle East could escalate, causing global economic problems. Despite the challenges, BTC has recovered to over $100k after briefly falling below the level over the weekend. While all of this is going on, investors are looking for opportunities for growth elsewhere, and one of their best options so far has been the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. Based on the current performance of the presale, MUTM tokens could be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. There are various factors driving the current performance, which include the project’s focus on utility. Additionally, the protocol’s design that ensures continuous growth has been pivotal to helping drive up participation in the presale. Details OF The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over $11.2 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,450 buyers. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The token price has attracted massive attention from the crypto market, which has led to 50% of the tokens set aside for phase sold less than a month after they went live. One of the main reasons for this fast pace is that tokens in the current phase are going for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. Analysts are extremely confident about the future of MUTM tokens, and they forecast the price could go up by 31x when the tokens go live. Based on this massive upside forecast, a $1,700 purchase in the presale now could grow to over $52,000. Coupled with the massive discount available right now, this is one opportunity that you do not want to miss. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design A major reason for the high interest in MUTM tokens is the design of the protocol. It is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in exchange for an annual percentage yield (APY) that is dictated by the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool and take loans, the utilization rate rises, which thus increases the interest rate. The rising interest rate prompts borrowers to repay loans in the pool, which incentivizes more lenders to deposit liquidity in a pool to benefit from the higher yields. Over time, this will boost the total liquidity in the pool, which will ensure a stable ecosystem. At the same time, this design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency on its own. By offering a system where the market forces set the optimal market rates, it could attract more users, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the biggest DeFi ecosystems by user numbers. A good example of how this system works is when a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDT into a pool. If the APY rises to 17% due to high utilization, the depositor stands to make $1,700 a year. That is a massive income that requires no trading expertise or complex trading strategies. On top of that, users of the protocol enjoy massive protection in the form of overcollateralization. That simply means that borrowers must deposit collateral worth more than the value of the loan they plan to take. The overcollateralization level varies based on the exact type of asset they use as collateral. For more volatile assets, more conservative overcollateralization is required due to the possibility of a sudden market movement. The requirement creates a buffer in which liquidators can act to stabilize the ecosystem. When a loan position falls below the liquidation threshold, a liquidation event is triggered, allowing the liquidators to purchase the collateral at a discount. This discount ensures that liquidators have a monetary incentive to act for the benefit of the protocol’s health. It can be increased as needed to incentivize liquidators to act faster to protect the solvency of the ecosystem. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect entry point to position yourself for the upcoming altcoin rally. With a generous 50% discount on the MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale, this is the best opportunity you have to make life-changing returns in the crypto sector.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. attracted over $547 million in inflows on Wednesday, extending their winning streak to 12 consecutive days, a bullish signal backed by institutional demand. But it’s not just ETF data fueling the rally. Crypto Gets Major Boost from U.S. Housing Policy In a landmark move, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to recognize crypto assets when evaluating mortgage eligibility. This unprecedented step toward mainstream crypto adoption is being hailed as a long-term bullish catalyst for the industry. Technical Setup Signals Bitcoin Breakout Technically, Bitcoin is showing a strong V-shaped recovery, with its price hovering near $107,383, a key resistance level. A breakout above this zone could flip the market structure and pave the way to a new all-time high (ATH). According to crypto analyst Ran Neuner, Bitcoin’s next ATH may arrive in just 42 days, driven by a steady upward climb rather than a sudden spike. He emphasizes that the recent global ceasefire has given financial markets the breathing room they needed, and Bitcoin is leading the charge. “The rally won’t be a single big green candle. It’s already happening gradually,” Neuner stated. Jerome Powell’s Testimony Fuels the Bull Case Another bullish driver? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent testimony. Powell noted that the Fed might have already begun rate cuts if not for inflation risks stemming from Trump’s proposed tariffs. Still, Powell confirmed that the Fed is on track for three interest rate cuts this year in July, September, and December. Lower rates often boost risk-on assets like Bitcoin, making this a critical green light for investors. Dollar Weakens, Wall Street Cheers Following Powell’s remarks, the U.S. dollar began to slide, another bullish signal for Bitcoin. Wall Street responded swiftly: the NASDAQ hit a new ATH, and the S&P 500 is on the verge of confirming a golden cross — a highly regarded bullish technical pattern. Interestingly, historical data shows that Bitcoin tends to hit a new ATH around 41 days after the S&P 500 does. That correlation is now catching the eye of analysts who view this as a signal that Bitcoin’s next major breakout is already in motion. Altcoin Season? Not So Fast While Bitcoin looks poised for liftoff, most altcoins may not follow — at least not right away.According to Neuner, the altcoin rally will be selective, favoring tokens backed by institutional interest.

The Setup To Pay Attention To,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-massive-crash/,"Following the Dogecoin price crash, there have been some interesting developments on the altcoin’s chart that could point to what direction it is headed in next. Multiple formations have suggested that the meme coin continues to lean bullish even through the negative market sentiment. However, there is still a risk of collapse that could erode the bullish sentiment and put the bears in charge once again. Falling Wedge Pattern Says Dogecoin Price Is Bullish After the crash below the $0.15 support, the Dogecoin price has now completed the formation of a falling wedge pattern , crypto analyst MyCryptoParadise revealed. Historically, a falling wedge pattern appearing on a chart is bullish for any asset, and Dogecoin is no different in this regard. Not only did the falling wedge pattern appear, but it did so right after a Change of Character formation, something that shows buyers are coming back to the table, according to the crypto analyst. Other bullish formations include the RSI flashing a hidden bullish divergence. The MACD is also showing a bullish divergence, and all of these have culminated in perhaps one of the most bullish trends in recent times for the meme coin’s price. Looking at the Dogecoin price movement over the last few days, this looks to be the case as some important support levels have been reclaimed. The price crash has also taken out lower liquidity levels in what the analyst calls a classic inducement grab. This has left only higher liquidity levels open. Therefore, if the buying continues, it will only lend strength to the already bullish formations and drive higher prices. As the bullish factors line up, the likelihood of the Dogecoin price moving up grows higher. The analyst explains that as long as Dogecoin is able to successfully print a bullish candlestick pattern here, then there is a strong risk-to-reward ratio of betting on a move up. On the flip side of this, though, is the possibility that the altcoin does not play out into the bullish scenario . The bearish scenario here would be if bulls are unable to hold support above $0.14 and the price ends up breaking down. In the case of another 15% crash where the price falls below $0.15, the analyst explains that the bullish thesis would be invalidated. “If the price breaksdown and closes candle below this key support, the bullish scenario becomes invalid, and it’s better to wait for a more favorable structure to develop,” MyCryptoParadise explained.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-26 11:30:33

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for market sentiment, has recently climbed to a significant 74, firmly placing the cryptocurrency market in the ‘Greed’ zone. This eight-point jump from the previous day, as of June 26, signals a notable shift in investor psychology. But what does this rising tide of optimism truly mean for your investments, and how should you navigate these increasingly confident waters? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Pulse Check on Market Sentiment At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It’s a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 100, where: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly concerned, often leading to selling pressure. 25-49: Fear – Uncertainty and anxiety prevail, but not to extreme levels. 50-74: Greed – A growing sense of optimism and a willingness to buy. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often signaling a potential market top as assets become overvalued. Why is this index so crucial? Because emotions often drive investment decisions, especially in volatile markets like crypto. By aggregating various data points, the index attempts to give a more objective view of collective market sentiment , helping investors avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. What Does a Score of 74 in the ‘Greed’ Zone Imply for the Cryptocurrency Market? A score of 74 is a clear indicator that optimism is running high. Investors are feeling confident, and there’s a strong appetite for buying. While this might sound universally positive, seasoned crypto enthusiasts know that periods of ‘Greed’ can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects strong momentum and potential for further price appreciation as more capital flows into the cryptocurrency market . On the other hand, extreme greed can sometimes precede market corrections, as assets become overbought and ripe for profit-taking. Historically, legendary investors like Warren Buffett have advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This contrarian approach suggests that times of widespread greed might be opportune moments for caution, perhaps even for trimming positions, rather than blindly chasing pumps. It’s about recognizing when the crowd might be getting ahead of itself. Dissecting the Drivers: The Six Pillars of the Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of six distinct factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market sentiment. Understanding these components is key to grasping the index’s movements: 1. Volatility (25% Weighting) What it measures: This component analyzes the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High volatility often indicates a fearful market (big price drops) or an extremely greedy one (rapid pumps). Stable, lower volatility might suggest calm before a storm or a period of consolidation. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25% Weighting) What it measures: It looks at the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing them with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High buying volumes in a rising market indicate strong positive momentum and increasing greed. Conversely, high selling volumes suggest fear. 3. Social Media (15% Weighting) What it measures: This factor analyzes social media trends, specifically tracking hashtags and mentions related to cryptocurrencies, their volume, and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). What it means for sentiment: A surge in positive social media mentions, particularly on platforms like Twitter (X), often correlates with rising excitement and greed. It’s a direct gauge of the public’s chatter. 4. Surveys (15% Weighting – Currently Paused) What it measures: Historically, this component gathered data from weekly polls, asking thousands of people about their perception of the crypto market. What it means for sentiment: Although currently paused, surveys offer a direct insight into investor confidence. Their reintroduction could provide another valuable layer of sentiment data. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10% Weighting) What it measures: This refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. What it means for sentiment: A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors flock to the perceived safety and stability of Bitcoin during uncertain times. A falling dominance, on the other hand, suggests that investors are moving into altcoins, which typically happens during periods of higher risk appetite and greed (often called ‘altcoin season’). 6. Google Trends (10% Weighting) What it measures: It analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. What it means for sentiment: A sudden increase in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often signals fear, while a surge in general terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “crypto investment” can indicate growing public interest and potential greed. Here’s a quick overview of the index’s components: Factor Weighting Impact on Index (General) Volatility 25% High volatility can indicate fear or extreme greed. Market Momentum/Volume 25% High buying volume = Greed; High selling volume = Fear. Social Media 15% Positive sentiment = Greed; Negative sentiment = Fear. Surveys (Paused) 15% Direct investor opinion. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Rising dominance = Fear; Falling dominance = Greed (altcoin season). Google Trends 10% Search interest for buying = Greed; Panic searches = Fear. The Pivotal Role of Bitcoin in Shaping Market Sentiment It’s no secret that Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. Its price movements and overall health significantly influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Given its dominant market capitalization and its status as the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the general mood of investors. When Bitcoin is rallying, optimism tends to spread across altcoins, pushing the index higher into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a sharp correction in Bitcoin’s price can quickly send the index plummeting into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, as investors become risk-averse. This strong correlation highlights why keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s fundamentals and technical analysis, alongside the sentiment index, is crucial for any comprehensive investment strategy . A rising Bitcoin price, coupled with high social media engagement and trading volume, directly contributes to the current ‘Greed’ reading of 74. Crafting Your Investment Strategy in a ‘Greedy’ Market So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashing ‘Greed’, how should you adjust your investment strategy ? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution: While it’s tempting to jump into a rising market, remember that ‘Greed’ often precedes corrections. Consider taking some profits if you’re holding significant gains, especially on assets that have seen parabolic increases. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Use this period to re-evaluate your portfolio. Are you over-allocated to risky assets? Perhaps it’s time to rebalance towards a more diversified mix, or even increase your stablecoin holdings. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): The higher the index, the stronger the FOMO. Don’t let emotional impulses drive your decisions. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan and risk tolerance. Research Thoroughly: Even in a bull market, not all projects are created equal. Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects that still have room to grow, rather than chasing speculative pumps. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital. If you’re entering new positions or holding existing ones, setting appropriate stop-loss orders can help mitigate potential losses if the market suddenly reverses. Look for Contrarian Opportunities: While most assets might be overvalued, there could still be gems that haven’t caught the market’s attention yet, or assets that are temporarily undervalued despite the overall optimism. Challenges and Limitations of Relying Solely on Sentiment While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects current sentiment, which is often a reaction to past price movements. It doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Not a Trading Signal: It should not be used as a standalone buy or sell signal. A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does ‘Fear’ guarantee a bounce. Market Manipulation: Large institutional players or ‘whales’ can sometimes influence market sentiment, making the index less reliable for predicting short-term movements. Context is Key: The meaning of a particular score can vary depending on the broader macroeconomic environment, regulatory news, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster with Prudence The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 is a significant indicator of robust optimism within the cryptocurrency market. It reflects a period where confidence is high, and the appetite for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , is strong. While this environment presents exciting opportunities, it also calls for heightened awareness and a disciplined investment strategy . By understanding the factors that drive this index and combining its insights with thorough fundamental and technical analysis, investors can make more informed decisions, mitigate risks, and potentially capitalize on the market’s emotional ebb and flow.

What could it mean for crypto security? Using a quantum annealer from D‑Wave, a team of researchers at Shanghai University managed to factor a 22‑bit key using a novel method that translates the task into a form the quantum machine can handle, according to a report by Earth.com. RSA, which stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, is a public-key cryptosystem that is commonly used for secure data transmission. Systems that use the encryption system include online bank accounts, web browsers, email providers, messaging services, VPNs, and cloud services. Although 22-bit is still a small number compared to the larger 2,048‑bit keys or even 3072-bit used in real-world encryption, the breakthrough is significant because it proved that quantum computing can reach beyond the previous 19-bit record. By tweaking model parameters, the researchers raised success rates and showed how their approach could scale more bits in the future. This means that in the future, with more computational resources per bit, the unbreakable RSA could be decrypted. As a result, many institutions like NIST and the White House are already rolling out quantum-safe standards and urging agencies and companies to switch to post-quantum cryptography, warning of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. You might also like: Cisco Talos: New North Korean threat ‘PylangGhost’ targets crypto workers through fake job sites Does cryptocurrency use RSA encryption? Though RSA is widely used in many aspects of our digital systems, most modern cryptocurrencies do not use the encryption for signing transactions or wallet security. Instead, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) rely heavily on Elliptic Curve Cryptography or ECC, including Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ECDSA and the later model EdDSA in newer projects. Although this is the case, the crypto space does make use of the encryption model in other areas that are just as crucial to security. For instance, certain crypto exchanges, custody services and payment platforms may still use RSA encryption for SSL/TLS infrastructure. Additionally, some cold storage systems or older crypto projects and old wallets containing sensitive information may still rely on RSA for internal key storage or back-up encryption. The same applies for encrypted data archives and back-ups at crypto custodians or blockchain companies. You might also like: Chinese researchers claim 48-bit encryption cracked with quantum computing Why the RSA quantum breakthrough matters for ECC? Although the experiment applies to RSA, this does not mean that ECC is untouchable. Both RSA and ECC are vulnerable to quantum attacks via Shor’s algorithm. Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently factor large numbers and solve discrete logarithm problems. The algorithm poses a significant threat to the security of many modern cryptographic systems. While this does not directly pose a threat to current more advanced crypto systems, it indicates that quantum progress not just a theoretical concept anymore. The deeper issue is that if quantum hardware can scale factoring algorithms, then the decryption of ECC is not far behind. A powerful enough quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could bypass ECC by forging blockchain transactions, breaking encrypted communication between wallets and nodes, as well as gain access to private keys from public BTC or ETH wallets. In the meantime, crypto projects should stay alert and prevent security breaches by performing audits on vulnerable areas such as TLS certificates, API encryption, VPNs and off-chain key management.

This Trump-backed crypto project is reportedly drawing considerable attention from public companies looking to diversify their treasury holdings with digital assets. The news, first reported by Bloomberg and affirmed by WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman at the prestigious Permissionless conference in New York, signals a potentially groundbreaking shift in how traditional businesses view and utilize cryptocurrencies. What is the Buzz Around This Trump-Backed Crypto Initiative? The concept of a cryptocurrency project explicitly linked to a prominent political family like the Trumps immediately ignites curiosity and debate. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) aims to leverage this unique association to build a robust ecosystem around its native token. According to Zak Folkman, the co-founder, the project is designed to offer a new avenue for financial empowerment and digital asset utilization. The Trump family’s involvement, while not fully detailed in its scope, provides an undeniable spotlight, potentially attracting a demographic not typically immersed in the crypto space, alongside traditional institutional investors. The core proposition of WLFI appears to revolve around providing a stable, reliable digital asset that can serve various financial functions, including acting as a treasury reserve. This ambition places WLFI in a unique position, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, with a distinct political flavor that sets it apart from other crypto ventures. The project’s narrative suggests a focus on liberty and financial freedom, themes that resonate strongly with its political affiliations. Why are Public Firms Eyeing the WLFI Token for Treasury? The interest from public companies in using the WLFI token as a treasury asset is a significant development. For years, corporate treasuries have primarily relied on traditional assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and money market funds. However, with inflation concerns and the search for higher yields, companies are increasingly exploring alternative assets. Bitcoin, pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, has shown the viability of digital assets for treasury management. The appeal of WLFI for these firms could stem from several factors: Diversification: Adding a crypto asset, particularly one with perceived stability or unique backing, can diversify a company’s treasury portfolio. Inflation Hedge: Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as potential hedges against inflation, preserving purchasing power in a volatile economic climate. Growth Potential: While aiming for stability, the inherent growth potential of a nascent crypto project could offer higher returns than traditional low-yield assets. Strategic Alignment: For some companies, aligning with a project backed by a prominent political figure might offer strategic benefits or appeal to a specific customer base. Zak Folkman’s statements suggest that WLFI is positioning itself as a credible and attractive option for corporate balance sheets, aiming to provide a digital asset that meets the stringent requirements of public companies for liquidity, security, and regulatory compliance. The Michael Saylor Connection: A Blueprint for Corporate Treasury Assets? One of the most intriguing aspects highlighted by Folkman is WLFI’s close relationship with Michael Saylor , the executive chairman of MicroStrategy. Saylor is widely recognized as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, having famously converted MicroStrategy’s treasury into a significant Bitcoin holding. His strategy has become a de facto blueprint for other public companies considering similar moves. The association with Saylor lends considerable credibility to WLFI’s treasury aspirations. It suggests that the project is not merely dabbling in the idea but is potentially consulting with, or learning from, one of the most experienced figures in the corporate crypto treasury space. Saylor’s insights could help WLFI navigate the complexities of regulatory frameworks, institutional onboarding, and the technical infrastructure required to support large-scale corporate adoption. This connection indicates a serious intent to position WLFI as a viable, institutional-grade asset for companies seeking to optimize their balance sheets in the digital age. For companies considering a digital asset for their treasury, the Saylor endorsement, even if indirect, provides a level of reassurance and a potential roadmap for implementation. It transforms WLFI from just another crypto project into one with a strategic vision for corporate integration. Insights from the Permissionless Conference : What’s Next for WLFI? The Permissionless conference in New York served as a crucial platform for Zak Folkman to share updates on WLFI’s progress and vision. Such industry events are vital for networking, attracting investors, and building community trust. Folkman’s comments at the conference underscore the project’s ambition to become a significant player in the institutional crypto space. While specific details about the tokenomics or technical architecture of WLFI remain somewhat under wraps, the focus on corporate treasury interest suggests a priority on stability, compliance, and scalability. Future developments for WLFI will likely include: Regulatory Engagement: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies will be paramount, especially for attracting public companies. Technological Development: Ensuring the WLFI token and its underlying blockchain infrastructure are robust, secure, and scalable to handle large institutional transactions. Partnerships: Forming strategic alliances with financial institutions, custodians, and other blockchain service providers to facilitate corporate adoption. Transparency: Providing clear communication regarding the project’s roadmap, financial backing, and governance model to build investor confidence. The project’s success will largely depend on its ability to deliver on these fronts and to convince traditional finance players that a politically-backed crypto asset can be a secure and beneficial addition to their balance sheets. Navigating the Landscape of Digital Asset Adoption: Benefits and Challenges The increasing interest in digital assets for corporate treasuries, exemplified by WLFI, highlights a broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This trend comes with both significant benefits and inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Digital assets can offer 24/7 liquidity, unlike traditional markets. Lower Transaction Costs: Blockchain-based transactions can potentially reduce fees associated with traditional financial transfers. Faster Settlements: Near-instantaneous settlement times compared to traditional banking systems. New Revenue Streams: Opportunities for yield generation through staking, lending, or DeFi protocols. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulations remains a significant hurdle. Volatility: While some tokens aim for stability, the crypto market is inherently volatile, posing risks to treasury values. Security Risks: The threat of hacks, scams, and loss of private keys requires robust security protocols. Accounting and Tax Implications: Complexities in how crypto assets are treated for accounting and tax purposes. Public Perception: The association with a political figure could be a double-edged sword, attracting some while alienating others. For public companies, a meticulous due diligence process is essential before integrating any digital asset into their treasury strategy. This includes assessing the asset’s underlying technology, regulatory compliance, security measures, and the reputation of its backers. A Glimpse into the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors and Corporations The emergence of WLFI and its reported corporate interest provides several actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Trends: The move towards corporate treasury crypto indicates a maturing market. Keep an eye on which types of companies are adopting digital assets and why. Understand Project Backing: For investors, the backing of a project, whether by a political family or a prominent industry figure like Michael Saylor, can significantly influence its trajectory and perceived legitimacy. Assess Regulatory Readiness: Projects that actively engage with regulators and prioritize compliance are more likely to gain institutional trust. Diversify Smartly: For corporations considering crypto treasury, start small, understand the risks, and consult with experts in legal, accounting, and cybersecurity fields. The narrative around WLFI highlights a fascinating intersection of politics, finance, and technology. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, projects with unique value propositions and strong strategic backing will undoubtedly shape the future of corporate finance. Conclusion: A New Era for Corporate Treasury? The reported interest from public firms in the Trump-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing institutional adoption of digital assets. With the WLFI token seemingly positioning itself as a viable corporate treasury asset , and the strategic alignment with figures like Michael Saylor , the project stands at the forefront of a potential paradigm shift. While challenges remain, particularly around regulation and market volatility, the discussions at the Permissionless conference confirm a growing appetite among traditional businesses to explore cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading. As WLFI continues its journey, its progress will offer valuable insights into the future of corporate finance and the broader acceptance of digital currencies in mainstream economic activity.

Accordingly, Nasdaq-listed online banking platform SoFi Technologies announced that it has restarted its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading service after a two-year hiatus. At this point, SoFi Technologies, which has made a big comeback in cryptocurrencies, said that it has revived cryptocurrency trading and on-chain money transfers. For SoFi, the move marks a major milestone following its November 2023 crypto exit. With this move, SoFi customers will now be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in their accounts. The statement also reported that they will launch a blockchain-based overseas remittance service as well as a lending and staking transaction service. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said: “With innovations in crypto, digital assets and blockchain in general, the future of financial services is being completely reinvented. We are accelerating our efforts to give our members more choice and more control, whether they are investing, sending money across borders or planning for their future. Crypto and blockchain innovations can and will be woven into every aspect of our business and capability, including buying, paying, saving, investing, borrowing and protecting. And as we do this, we will continue to stand alone in providing our members with unparalleled products and services as the only digital one-stop shop for their financial needs.” *This is not investment advice.

But the breach may have revealed more than just security flaws, as troubling on-chain history raises questions over the platform’s operations. According to BeInCrypto, an investigation by blockchain intelligence firm Global Ledger into the June 18 Nobitex hack has found that the platform may have been engaging in stealthy fund movements well before the cyberattack. Per the report, on-chain analysis has revealed a pattern of practices typically linked to money laundering, such as peelchains, one-use wallets, and systematic balance sweeps, deeply embedded in the exchange’s infrastructure. The attack on Nobitex affected multiple chains, resulting in the loss of over $90 million in assets. Shortly after the breach, Nobitex moved 1,801 BTC (worth around $187 million) from exposed wallets to new addresses. While the exchange described this as a protective measure, the investigation shows similar movement patterns had been occurring quietly for months. Hot Wallets, Cold Moves: Nobitex’s shady crypto shuffle Since as far back as October 2024, Nobitex has been using a stealth tactic known as peelchains, a method where funds are gradually split and passed through intermediaries or one-time-use wallets. This technique is used to quietly move large amounts of crypto, while obscuring their trail and making them difficult to trace. On multiple occasions, several hot wallets tied to Nobitex repeatedly passed exactly 30 BTC between addresses, often through one-time-use intermediaries. Funds in these flows were eventually sent to exchange addresses or, in some cases, destinations linked to illicit actors. You might also like: Nobitex hackers leak full source code after $100m crypto heist Additionally, the investigation traced funds moving in and out of a wallet cluster that behaved like a central mixing layer. Many of these wallets had a short lifespan and were used just once before being abandoned, suggesting an intentional scheme to avoid detection. Further evidence shows that Nobitex’s “rescue wallet,” which was supposedly deployed after the hack to safeguard the remaining funds, was found to have been active for months prior, consistently receiving chipped-off funds. The exchange has also continued similar asset movements post-hack and is said to still hold substantial reserves. Global Ledger’s findings now raise questions about Nobitex’s operational transparency, including possible ties to illicit activity such as money laundering. Gonjeshke Darande, the pro-Israel hacker group that claimed responsibility for the attack, previously accused Nobitex of being Iran’s “favorite sanctions violation tool.” The group also cited this as a key reason for targeting the exchange, claiming it as part of a broader retaliation effort tied to the Israel-Iran conflict.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 867,400 followers on the social media platform X that on the higher time frames, the Bitcoin trend is up and the day-to-day fluctuations in price are just “noise.” According to Pentoshi, the demand for Bitcoin is currently outstripping the new supply of Bitcoin and more demand is likely to come in amid potential currency debasement. “There is factually more BTC being bought on any given day than is being mined. Until that trend changes, try to just relax a bit and enjoy the ride. It increasingly looks like more debasing will occur. And BTC is a hedge against debasement.” Pentoshi, however, warns that there’s danger lurking for Bitcoin from the corporations accumulating the crypto king in their balance sheets. The widely followed analyst says some of these companies will “hurt” Bitcoin in a couple of years when they will be potentially forced to liquidate their BTC holdings to pay the debt they will have incurred for purposes of accumulating the flagship digital asset. “I think many will end up being forced sellers eventually. When some of the notes come due.” Bitcoin is trading at $107,875 at time of writing.

Riot Platforms’ expansion at Corsicana and the Rhodium acquisition may boost power and hash rate, but legal and market risks can potentially persist. The data center hosting market is highly competitive, with hyperscalers like Oracle dominating the market. Riot’s Bitcoin mining profitability may be pressured by rising power costs and Bitcoin price volatility, limiting near-term upside despite strong Bitcoin treasury holdings. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) is in the process of expanding its Corsicana facility from 400MW to 600MW in capacity with the intention of hosting third-party hyperscalers at its data center site. With the ambition of navigating into a new market opportunity, I believe Riot may face certain hurdles in hosted shared space given the current competitive market environment. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Riot Platforms Operations Corporate Reports Riot closed the acquisition of certain assets of Rhodium at the Rockdale Facility in Q1’25. The acquisition included Rhodium’s 125MW of power capacity, as well as its existing operating assets at the facility. The acquisition was valued at $185mm, inclusive of $49mm in Riot common shares. In addition to acquiring the facility, compute capacity, and power capacity, Riot and Rhodium entered into an agreement to conclude all litigation. Prior to the announced acquisition, Rhodium filed a $300mm suit against Riot as a result of Riot’s acquisition of Whinstone and the cancellation of Rhodium’s power supply agreement for 100MW of power. Years prior, in 2023, Riot filed a suit against Rhodium over an alleged $26mm in unpaid fees. Staying on the topic of litigation, investors filed a suit against Rhodium in December 2024, suggesting that Rhodium misled investors by concealing critical information and engaging in self-dealing. The suit also suggests that Rhodium failed to disclose the pending sale of the organization’s operating facilities to Riot, creating conflict over power contracts. Given that Rhodium’s sale was an asset sale as opposed to the company being absorbed by Riot, Riot may be somewhat shielded from the suit. Other legacy suits were filed in Riot’s March 2025 10-Q , bearing no mention of the investor suit. As a result of the acquisition, management is anticipating increased hash rates, reduced operating losses, and gained power capacity for future development. At the end of Q1’25, Riot had 33.7EH/s in capacity, producing a total of 1,530 Bitcoin in the quarter. Riot began purchasing Bitcoin in Q4’24 to bolster its treasury while leveraging its holdings for a collateralized $100mm credit facility through Coinbase . Accordingly, this credit facility will ideally provide Riot with adequate financing to slow the dilution of the float. Riot ended Q1’25 with 19,223 Bitcoin. Using $105k as the base price, Riot’s Bitcoin holdings amount to $2b. TradingView As part of its growth strategy, Riot invested a substantial proportion of its capital outlay for Q1’25 in the development of its 600MW substation expansion at the Corsicana facility in Navarro County, Texas. According to Riot’s website , the facility currently has 400MW in capacity, with the option to expand to 1GW. Using a like-for-like approach, the expansion to 600MW should get the facility to 23.55EH/s in capacity. The data center buildout may also involve sourcing data center tenants, primarily targeting hyperscaler customers. Though data center hosting may be an appealing market for Riot, Riot will be competing with Oracle Corp . ( ORCL ), which develops purpose-built data centers with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as well as engages in a MultiCloud strategy, developing data center sites for hyperscaler customers. The growth factor management mentioned was that the existing GenAI capacity calls for 5GW of capacity with the expectation of growing to 30GW by 2030. Though this may be the case, I suspect a significant proportion of capacity will derive from enterprises rather than consumers, potentially limiting the full, total addressable market to a narrower figure. In addition to this, hyperscalers are investing in developing their data center footprints given the size and scale of compute capacity needed to operate AI models on their infrastructure. Referencing Oracle’s data center developments, OpenAI has partnered with Oracle to develop its first 1.2GW site in Abilene, Texas , and will likely continue working with Oracle for new site developments. What makes Oracle’s data center business stand out above Riot is that Oracle develops modular, autonomously operating data center facilities. Though I have no doubt that Riot will be successful in enticing tenants for its AI/HPC data center site, I believe that the data center hosting business will be fierce, particularly when considering the total cost to operate. The area in which I can see Riot competing is in its engineering and manufacturing business with ESS Metron for critical switchgear. This business could potentially add value to third-party customers in the data center business and may help debottleneck the electrical equipment market. Riot Platforms' Financial Position Corporate Reports One of the biggest costs Riot must address in Bitcoin mining, net of machine depreciation, is the cost of power. In the organization’s FY24 presentation , Riot reported that the cost to mine a single Bitcoin was 96.9% of the value of the coin. Corporate Reports Granted, the price per Bitcoin is substantially higher today when compared to all of FY24; however, power consumption may be a persistent headwind, particularly as electricity prices are set to increase with power demand for growing data centers and industrial footprints. Net of Bitcoin price appreciation, increasing power costs can create significant headwinds for Riot in the coming quarters, particularly as more connected infrastructure is added to the grid. TradingView Looking to eQ2’25, I’m forecasting Riot to generate $152mm in net revenue, with a diluted EPS of -$0.23/share. This is predicated on strong Bitcoin mining growth and sales for the quarter as a result of the high value of Bitcoin quarter-to-date. Risks Related to Riot Platforms Bull Case The price of Bitcoin has created a more appealing operating environment for Riot, potentially leading to the organization delivering positive adjusted EBITDA for eQ2’25. With data center power capacity being widely constrained, the organization may be well-positioned to advantageously take on hosted customers, potentially expanding its brand beyond Bitcoin mining and engineering operations. Bear Case The data center environment is highly competitive, potentially creating certain challenges for Riot to enter the space. The organization has also faced legal challenges relating to contractual power distribution that may deter third-party hyperscaler customers. Bitcoin remains highly volatile and may not sustain its $105k+/- price range, potentially impacting Riot’s revenue stream going forward. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports RIOT currently trades at 1.61x price/BV BTC, assuming a $105k price per Bitcoin. This is relatively comparable to its competitor CleanSpark ( CLSK ), which trades at roughly 1.89x, considering its 12,502 Bitcoin holdings. Despite this factor, investors in RIOT must consider its other operating unit in engineering and its aim to act as a data center host, creating a certain operating complexity when compared to CleanSpark. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Corporate Reports Using the model: the valuation table above references my financial forecast in the firm’s “financial position” section and ties it to the stock’s historical trading premiums. The trading premium array is derived through the normal operating cycle, with the blue-sky scenario being the stock’s peak multiple and the gray-sky scenario being the lowest point. The target multiple aims for the midpoint, or the most likely trading range for the company’s stock. The trading multiples from there are set to a probability factor based on the likelihood of the stock trading at that premium based on its historical presence. From there, the trading multiple is tied to the probability factor to derive its relative market cap and relative multiple.",CLSK|RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-26 11:46:51

While technical indications on the chart might present a mixed picture, the fact is that sentiment is shifting towards optimism. This is happening due to increased activity within the ecosystem and growing institutional support. For instance, this week, Social media buzz was on fire, with Cardano receiving over 200,000 mentions on X in just one week, largely sparked by the recent Midnight Glacier airdrop . Not just that, another factor changing the sentiment was the recent launch of Coinbase’s cbADA on its Layer 2 network, Base, which adds to the bullish outlook. This wrapped version of ADA could significantly enhance Cardano’s utility across decentralized finance protocols. As ADA continues to trade steadily near $0.57, the timing of this launch could be pivotal in propelling the asset into a new growth cycle. Keep reading to know more. Analyst Projects Cardano Price To Hit $2 As of now, ADA crypto is trading at $0.57, reflecting a 2% decline over the past day and nearly 24% over the last month. The cryptocurrency continues to follow a downward trend, confined within a descending channel. Yet, the Cardano price recently found support at April’s low, coinciding with the lower band of the Bollinger Bands. Interestingly, the Bollinger Bands have begun to narrow, suggesting that ADA price action is attempting to bounce off the lower band. If ADA price gains momentum, especially with the upcoming Midnight airdrop potentially boosting activity, it could test the resistance range of $0.60 to $0.62 towards the Bollinger band’s baseline. Should it break through this level, a move toward $0.70 might be on the horizon in the short term. On the contrary, if ADA crypto fails to sustain its price above $0.55, then the next significant support level lies near $0.52-$0.50. Despite the recent lower lows, some analysts remain optimistic and are projecting ambitious targets. In a recent YouTube video , crypto analyst Dan Gambardello projected a bold target for ADA price. Dan predicts that ADA could replicate its previous bull cycle, and could rally to $2 within weeks or months, contingent on broader market conditions. That said, if the overall market sentiment remains positive and ADA price can overcome key technical barriers, it may be poised for substantial gains in the coming months.

Arthur Hayes Reveals ‘Bull Market Checklist’,https://coinpedia.org/news/when-will-bitcoin-price-hit-new-ath-arthur-hayes-reveals-bull-market-checklist/,"The post When Will Bitcoin Price Hit New ATH? Arthur Hayes Reveals ‘Bull Market Checklist’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin could be heading for new all-time highs, at least if Arthur Hayes has it right. The BitMEX co-founder recently shared a bullish take on the market, pointing to key regulatory changes that he believes are setting the stage for a major crypto rally. From stablecoin reforms to broader shifts in global finance, Hayes sees the pieces falling into place for Bitcoin to surge. Bull market checklist: – UST SLR exemption progressing – Genius Act hands US stablecoin mrkt to banks, next essay will explain y +ve – Ignore the reality, Trump, Bibi, and Kahmenei are all pretending the conflict is finished so investors should too $BTC ATHs are coming — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 26, 2025 SLR Exemption Could Spark a Crypto Liquidity Boost Hayes highlights the U.S. Treasury’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption as a major factor. If reinstated, this policy would let banks free up more capital, allowing them to hold stablecoins and crypto-related assets with fewer restrictions. That means more liquidity, stronger support from big institutions, and a smoother path for crypto to integrate with the traditional financial system. For Hayes, it’s a clear sign that markets are preparing for a new bull cycle. The Genius Act: Giving Banks Control of Stablecoins Another big piece of the puzzle is the proposed Genius Act. This legislation could shift control of the U.S. stablecoin market to banks—a move Hayes believes is actually a good thing. Rather than slowing innovation, this could bring legitimacy and stability to stablecoins, making them a trusted part of the financial system. That kind of trust, in turn, can lift confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Hayes: Ignore the Drama, Watch the Market Hayes also pointed out how world leaders, like Trump, Netanyahu, and Iran’s Khamenei, are caught up in political and geopolitical tensions. But he urges investors to look past the headlines and focus on market signals instead. He points to a 22% surge in stablecoin market cap this year, now hitting $251 billion. To Hayes, that’s a strong sign that capital is flowing back into crypto and that investors are positioning for a run. Not His First Rodeo Hayes’s view ties into his past commentary, where he’s connected crypto market trends with global economic policy. He’s written before about the impact of central banks, like the Bank of Japan, on risk assets like Bitcoin. Now, as macro conditions shift and regulators appear more open to crypto, Hayes sees all signs pointing to another breakout moment. Bitcoin’s Setup for a New Rally? With policies like the SLR exemption and the Genius Act bringing crypto and traditional finance closer together, Hayes believes Bitcoin is primed for big gains. Stablecoins may be laying the groundwork—but Bitcoin, he argues, is the real beneficiary.

He stated that anyone holding 1,000 XRP could expect to earn a minimum profit of $50,000 by the end of 2025. At the token’s current price of approximately $2.19, 1,000 units are valued at $2,190. Layton’s claim implies that each token would need to reach at least $52.20 within the year, representing a 2,300% return on investment. Layton encouraged followers to save his post and revisit it in the future, emphasizing that the predicted profit is for 2025 alone. If you hold 1000 XRP in 2025, you will see $50,000 minimum in profit just this year alone. Bookmark this. — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) June 24, 2025 Reaction from the Community The reaction to Layton’s prediction was mixed, with many expressing cautious optimism or outright skepticism. Some users, while hopeful, acknowledged that the estimate appears unrealistic. A user named Ellian Betan commented that such forecasts tend to overlook real-world limitations. Others questioned the practical implications of such growth. For instance, one user asked whether Layton would delete his account if XRP failed to reach the projected price. Another user, Tobias, observed that while significant profits might be attainable, the return is determined by the token’s future price, not the cost at which it was acquired. Therefore, whether an investor bought XRP at $0.07 or $2.00, the key factor remains the token’s price performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Capitalization Implications of a $50 XRP If XRP were to exceed $50 per coin, its total market capitalization would surpass $3 trillion. For comparison, this would place XRP above Bitcoin’s current market value, making the target highly ambitious. Despite the boldness of Layton’s claim, he is not the only analyst proposing large price movements for XRP. In March, Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal predicted XRP could reach between $20 and $40 either this year or next, based on a 5-wave pattern. Similarly, a market analyst known as Steph suggested that if the global cryptocurrency market grows to $7 trillion and XRP captures a 30% share, the token could climb to $34.20. Other commentators have issued even more aggressive forecasts. Javon Marks, for example, has floated the idea that XRP could approach $99 during this market cycle, though he did not offer a specific timeline. Conservative Estimates Remain Cautious In contrast to these bullish views, some market analysts and platforms have adopted a more cautious stance. Forecasts from Changelly and Telegaon suggest that XRP may not reach the $50 milestone until at least 2035. These projections significantly diverge from Layton’s 2025 outlook, highlighting the divide between short-term optimism and long-term realism. While Layton’s prediction of a $50,000 profit from holding 1,000 XRP has generated considerable attention, it remains a speculative outlook. The wide range of price targets, from $34 to nearly $100, demonstrates the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future valuation.

If so, you’re not alone. A significant shift has just occurred that demands your attention: the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has plummeted to 97.48, marking its lowest point since February 2022. This dramatic movement isn’t just a headline for forex traders; it carries profound implications for the burgeoning crypto market, potentially reshaping investment strategies and the future trajectory of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this substantial DXY decline means for your crypto portfolio and the broader financial landscape. Understanding the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): What Just Happened? The U.S. Dollar Index , often simply referred to as the DXY, is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of six major world currencies. These currencies include the Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Swedish Krona (SEK), and Swiss Franc (CHF). It’s essentially a barometer for the dollar’s strength or weakness against its major trading partners. Recently, the DXY has been on a noticeable downward trajectory. According to MarketWatch data, it has fallen to 97.48, a level not seen since early 2022. This represents a significant 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline . To put this into perspective, consider these key points: Historical Context: The DXY had reached multi-decade highs in late 2022, driven by aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Its current level signifies a considerable reversal from those peaks. Magnitude of the Drop: A 10.1% year-to-date decline is not a minor fluctuation; it indicates a substantial shift in global investor sentiment towards the U.S. dollar. Key Currency Basket: The Euro holds the largest weight in the DXY basket (57.6%), meaning the dollar’s performance against the Euro heavily influences the index’s movement. This weakening of the dollar has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. Understanding the drivers behind this dollar weakness is crucial for anticipating its future impact. Why the Dollar Weakness is Making Waves: Key Drivers What’s behind this significant dollar weakness ? Several macroeconomic factors are converging to push the DXY lower. The primary drivers include shifts in monetary policy expectations, evolving inflation outlooks, and changes in global economic growth projections. Is the Fed’s Stance Fueling Further Dollar Weakness? A major catalyst for the recent DXY decline is the changing narrative around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. For much of 2022, the Fed was aggressively raising interest rates to combat soaring inflation, making the dollar more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. However, the market is now increasingly pricing in an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle, with expectations of potential rate cuts in the near future. This shift in sentiment reduces the dollar’s yield advantage over other currencies, diminishing its appeal. Interest Rate Differentials: As other central banks (like the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan) potentially catch up or even surpass the Fed in hawkishness, the interest rate differential narrows, reducing the incentive to hold dollars. Inflation Expectations: While inflation remains elevated, there’s a growing belief that it has peaked and is on a downward trend. This lessens the urgency for the Fed to maintain an ultra-tight monetary policy, further contributing to dollar weakness . Economic Slowdown Concerns: Persistent concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. also weigh on the dollar. A weaker economy might necessitate more accommodative monetary policy, which typically leads to a weaker currency. The interplay of these factors creates a challenging environment for the dollar, directly influencing its standing on the global stage and, by extension, its relationship with risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The Profound Crypto Market Impact: A New Era? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, a weakening dollar often signals a potentially bullish environment. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the U.S. Dollar Index and the performance of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. How Does Dollar Weakness Reshape the Bitcoin Price Narrative? When the dollar weakens, assets priced in dollars, such as commodities and cryptocurrencies, can become more attractive. This is because it takes fewer units of other currencies to buy dollars, making dollar-denominated assets relatively cheaper for international investors. More importantly, a weaker dollar can signify a broader flight from traditional fiat currencies into alternative stores of value. Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: The narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge gains traction during periods of dollar depreciation. As the purchasing power of the dollar diminishes, investors may seek assets with a fixed supply and perceived scarcity, like Bitcoin, to preserve wealth. This can lead to upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar can also lead to more global liquidity, as central banks potentially ease monetary policies. This increased liquidity often flows into riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, boosting overall crypto market impact . Investor Sentiment: The psychological effect of a declining dollar can shift investor sentiment towards assets outside the traditional financial system. This encourages diversification into digital assets, viewing them as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. While the DXY decline doesn’t guarantee an immediate surge in the Bitcoin price or the broader crypto market, it certainly creates a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Many analysts are now closely watching how this sustained dollar weakness might catalyze the next phase of growth for digital assets. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Opportunities While the narrative of a weakening dollar benefiting crypto is compelling, it’s crucial to approach the current market with a balanced perspective. The relationship is not always straightforward, and other factors significantly influence the crypto market impact . What Should Crypto Investors Watch Out For Amidst This DXY Decline? The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the U.S. Dollar Index . Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and specific project news all play significant roles. For instance, a sudden regulatory crackdown or a major hack could overshadow any positive influence from a weakening dollar. Challenges to Consider: Correlation vs. Causation: While an inverse correlation often exists, it’s not always a direct causal relationship. Other macro factors, such as global economic growth or geopolitical events, can also drive both DXY and crypto movements. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased scrutiny from global regulators could dampen enthusiasm, regardless of the dollar’s performance. Market Liquidity: While a weaker dollar can imply more liquidity, a sudden tightening by other central banks or a global financial shock could still impact crypto negatively. “Risk-On” vs. “Risk-Off” Sentiment: Sometimes, the dollar weakens because investors are taking on more risk globally (risk-on), which can benefit crypto. Other times, it might be due to specific U.S. economic concerns that don’t necessarily translate to immediate crypto gains. Despite these challenges, the current environment presents opportunities. The ongoing DXY decline , combined with increasing institutional interest and technological advancements within the crypto space, could set the stage for significant long-term growth. Investors who understand these dynamics are better positioned to capitalize on potential shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Understanding the intricate relationship between the U.S. Dollar Index and the crypto market can empower you to make more informed investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Keep a close eye on the DXY, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve announcements. These traditional financial indicators provide valuable context for anticipating crypto market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin often leads the charge, consider a diversified crypto portfolio that includes established altcoins and promising new projects. This can help mitigate risk and capture broader market gains. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the volatility, consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of market fluctuations, can be a prudent strategy. This helps average out your purchase price and reduces the impact of short-term swings. Stay Informed on Regulatory News: Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) can significantly impact crypto prices. Keep abreast of developments in major jurisdictions. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term DXY movements can create trading opportunities, the long-term success of cryptocurrencies depends on their underlying technology, adoption, and utility. The current period of dollar weakness is not just a fleeting trend; it reflects deeper shifts in global finance. For those invested in or considering the crypto space, this moment offers a unique lens through which to view potential future growth and strategic positioning. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Assets The dramatic drop in the U.S. Dollar Index to its lowest point since February 2022 signals a significant turning point in global finance. This 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline , driven by evolving monetary policies and shifting economic outlooks, directly impacts the perceived value and attractiveness of the dollar. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of sustained dollar weakness presents a compelling narrative, potentially bolstering the case for assets like Bitcoin as alternative stores of value. While the inverse correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin price is not absolute, the current macroeconomic environment certainly offers a more favorable backdrop for digital assets. As we navigate these dynamic shifts, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be key to unlocking the opportunities that this unprecedented financial recalibration presents for the future of money.

IRS Letters Signal Start of 1099-DA Enforcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a new wave of warning letters to crypto investors, signaling a crackdown ahead of the upcoming 1099-DA regulation, which is set to take effect in 2026. This aggressive move has sparked anxiety across the crypto community, especially as many investors face confusion over reporting requirements. Crypto Tax Anxiety Surges After IRS Letters According to David Kemmerer , Co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, crypto investors across the U.S. have received various types of IRS letters urging them to review and update their crypto tax filings. If left unaddressed, these warnings could lead to serious investigations. “We’re seeing a wave of confusion and fear among everyday crypto investors, many of whom made their best effort to report taxes accurately,” Kemmerer explained. Why Is the IRS Sending Crypto Warning Letters? The IRS is stepping up its visibility into digital asset transactions as the U.S. continues its push for financial transparency in the crypto space. This includes matching reported income with blockchain data, third-party records, and new forms like the 1099-DA. Kemmerer emphasized the urgency of proactive compliance: “With Form 1099-DA on the horizon, this kind of enforcement is only going to accelerate. The IRS has more visibility into crypto than ever before, but without accurate cost basis data, even compliant investors can get mistakenly flagged.” [post_titles_links postid=”475048″] Types of IRS Warning Letters Sent to Crypto Investors Here are the key letters crypto investors are receiving: Letter 6174 : A reminder that investors must report taxable crypto activity and update previous filings. Letter 6173 : A more serious notice demanding a response by a set deadline and requiring investors to file missing tax returns involving crypto. Letter CP2000 : Indicates that the IRS has already calculated underreported income or tax owed. Investors are given 30 days to respond. Form 1099-DA: What’s Coming in 2026? Starting in 2026, all crypto trades conducted in 2025 through digital asset brokers will be reported directly to the IRS using Form 1099-DA. This marks a major shift in how the IRS collects crypto tax data—and it will likely trigger widespread audits and possible criminal investigations for non-compliant taxpayers. Kemmerer warns: “If crypto investors fail to report their taxes accurately, especially after the rollout of 1099-DA, they could receive a CP2000 letter or face severe action.” Final Word: A Crucial Grace Period for Crypto Users The current wave of warning letters serves as a wake-up call for investors. This is a grace period —a final opportunity to get crypto tax filings in order before the IRS enforces stricter penalties. Investors are urged to: Organize transaction history Track cost basis and taxable events File or amend returns proactively Avoiding action now could lead to audit risks , fines, or worse once 1099-DA becomes mandatory.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana has signed an MoU with Kazakhstan to launch Central Asia’s first Solana Economic Zone. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 51.2% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

With RSI at 46.21 and price trading below the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

As Bitcoin trades above $107K, new data suggest that the leading crypto asset is approaching a critical juncture as on-chain and macroeconomic signals converge. Market Fundamentals Warn of Possible Correction On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, which happens to be an indicator of buying and selling pressure, exceeded $100 million for the first time since June 9. While this spike may suggest increased bullish momentum, CryptoQuant stated that such surges often stem from aggressive retail participation or the liquidation of over-leveraged short positions rather than sustainable investor demand. At the same time, the total stablecoin net outflows from derivative exchanges have topped $1.25 billion, the largest exodus since mid-May. This trend points to weakening structural support for long positions and reflects a broader withdrawal of capital from risk-on environments. Interestingly, the latest market movement coincided with growing speculation about a shift in US monetary policy. During his semiannual testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that future commercial and economic conditions could warrant interest rate cuts. The statement is a significant change in tone from the central bank, which indicates a possible pivot toward monetary easing. Further validating this narrative, the US 2-year Treasury yield has entered a clear downtrend, a pattern typically interpreted as the market pricing in future rate cuts. Investors are increasingly seeking safety in short-duration government bonds, which evidences rising caution. Elsewhere in the global currency markets, the Swiss Franc surged past 1.24 against the US dollar for the first time in several years, which, again, depicts an increased demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Together, these indicators suggest a rising risk-off sentiment in financial markets. While the Net Taker Volume spike may fuel short-term volatility, the significant outflow of stablecoins from derivative platforms raises concerns about the ability of Bitcoin’s price to sustain upward momentum. With macro uncertainty intensifying and liquidity thinning, the market could be nearing a near-term correction. Binance Open Interest Spikes; Long-Term Holders Trim Exposure As volatility returns and structural support wanes, Bitcoin’s internal market indicators are flashing additional cautionary signals worth close attention. In fact, data from Binance shows the 24-hour Open Interest (OI) percentage change has exceeded 6% for the third time in two months. Previous surges, observed around May 26 and June 10, were followed by price dips or periods of consolidation. This recurring trend could mean that increased inflows into leveraged positions may precede short-term profit-taking and de-risking by market participants. Additionally, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap has sharply declined from over $57 billion to just $3.5 billion. This significant drop indicates that long-term holders are reducing exposure and are likely capitalizing on recent price gains and reacting to evolving macroeconomic conditions. While these developments do not necessarily point to an immediate bearish reversal, CryptoQuant said that it does highlight a rising market sensitivity. As such, the market may be entering a profit-taking phase, where short-term pullbacks or sideways movement are more likely as speculative interest builds and long-term conviction wanes.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-shock-or-12-4-billion-outflows-glitch-you-need-to-see-this/,"A wave of excitement recently swept through the XRP community following reports that $12.4 billion worth of XRP had suddenly disappeared from major crypto exchanges like Binance and Upbit. The supposed “supply shock” led to a flurry of bullish predictions, with many expecting a dramatic price rally. But the facts tell a different story, one rooted not in real liquidity shifts but in likely data errors. The Origin of the $12.4B Shock Claim The speculation began when blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged what appeared to be massive XRP outflows from centralized exchanges. The data showed a sharp decline in XRP reserves, suggesting billions of tokens had been withdrawn in a short period. This triggered widespread speculation that large investors were accumulating XRP and moving funds to private wallets, a scenario often seen as bullish because it reduces the circulating supply on exchanges. XRP “Supply Shock” Outflows? Not so fast. Reports claimed $12.4B in XRP vanished from exchanges like Upbit & Binance—sparking major bullish speculation. But on-chain data tells a different story: No massive withdrawals recorded Likely a data glitch or mislabeling by… — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) June 26, 2025 However, Jungle Inc Crypto News, a well-known voice in the XRP community, quickly pushed back on the claims. In a post on X, he stated: “Reports claimed $12.4B in XRP vanished from exchanges like Upbit & Binance, sparking major bullish speculation. But on-chain data tells a different story: No massive withdrawals recorded… likely a data glitch or mislabeling by analytics platforms like CryptoQuant.” On-Chain Reality Paints a Different Picture Cross-referencing on-chain data from tools like XRPScan and Ledger. Exposed reveals no matching transactions to support such a large-scale exodus of XRP. The blockchain shows no significant withdrawals from the wallets tied to Upbit or Binance. Upbit wallets still hold close to 6 billion XRP, indicating no real change in holdings. This strongly suggests that the alarm over a $12.4 billion supply shock is the result of a reporting error, likely due to mislabeling of wallets or syncing issues on the part of the analytics provider. A Familiar Pattern of Data Glitches This isn’t the first time blockchain analytics platforms have reported questionable data. Similar incidents in the past, across various assets, have been traced back to incorrect wallet tagging, API delays, or temporary syncing problems. While these tools are invaluable, they’re not infallible, and raw blockchain data remains the ultimate source of truth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Verification Matters A genuine supply shock where a significant amount of XRP leaves exchanges could indicate long-term holding by whales or institutions, potentially triggering price increases due to reduced market liquidity. But acting on inaccurate data can lead to poor decisions, especially in a market as fast-moving and sentiment-driven as crypto. Jungle Inc.’s warning serves as a crucial reminder to investors: always verify data using the XRP Ledger before jumping to conclusions. Hype without confirmation can be costly. The reports of a $12.4 billion XRP outflow are not supported by any on-chain evidence. All indications point to a data glitch or misinterpretation, not a real supply shock. As always, diligence and verification are key. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Recently, SharpLink Gaming , a Nasdaq-listed technology firm, has once again made headlines with a substantial ETH acquisition , adding nearly 6,000 Ethereum to its already impressive portfolio. This latest move, valued at $14.47 million, signals a continued conviction in the second-largest cryptocurrency, even as the company faces an unrealized loss on its overall Ethereum investment . Unpacking SharpLink Gaming’s Latest ETH Acquisition: What Does It Mean? The digital asset space is constantly evolving, and institutional interest remains a powerful indicator of maturity and long-term potential. According to on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, SharpLink Gaming has bolstered its Ethereum reserves by an additional 5,989 ETH, facilitated through Galaxy Digital, amounting to a significant $14.47 million injection into the crypto market. This isn’t their first foray; the company has been steadily accumulating Ethereum, bringing their total holdings to an impressive 194,000 ETH. This massive accumulation represents a total expenditure of $507 million, with an average acquisition price of $2,611 per ETH. Such a consistent strategy from a publicly traded company highlights a strategic decision to allocate a substantial portion of its treasury to digital assets. It raises several questions: What drives this sustained conviction in Ethereum? How do companies manage the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency? What are the long-term implications for their balance sheet? Understanding the Unrealized Loss : A Common Investor Hurdle? While SharpLink Gaming’s total Ethereum holdings are substantial, the current market dynamics mean the company is navigating an unrealized loss of approximately $36 million. But what exactly does ‘unrealized loss’ signify in the context of large-scale investments? An unrealized loss occurs when an asset’s current market value is lower than its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. It’s a paper loss, not a realized one, meaning it only becomes concrete if the asset is sold at that lower price. For institutional investors like SharpLink Gaming, who often operate with long-term horizons, an unrealized loss might not be an immediate concern but rather a temporary fluctuation in market value. It reflects: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their rapid price swings. Long-Term Strategy: Many institutional players invest with the expectation of future growth, looking past short-term dips. Treasury Management: Companies might view these assets as a strategic reserve or a hedge against inflation, rather than a short-term trading position. This situation isn’t unique to SharpLink Gaming; many companies and individuals who invested during bull markets have faced similar unrealized losses. The key lies in their conviction and the strategic intent behind the investment. Why the Continued ETH Acquisition ? The Institutional Perspective Despite facing an unrealized loss, SharpLink Gaming’s continued ETH acquisition strategy suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value and future potential. Why would a Nasdaq-listed tech firm continue to pour millions into a volatile asset like Ethereum? Several factors likely play into this calculated risk: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Dominance: Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its network effect is unparalleled in the smart contract space. Deflationary Mechanism (EIP-1559): The implementation of EIP-1559, which burns a portion of transaction fees, has introduced a deflationary aspect to ETH, potentially increasing its scarcity over time. Scalability and Upgrade Path (Ethereum 2.0/Serenity): The transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge, Shanghai, Cancun-Deneb upgrades) aims to make Ethereum more scalable, secure, and energy-efficient, addressing some of its past limitations and paving the way for wider enterprise adoption. Institutional Interest and Adoption: Beyond SharpLink, other major players are exploring or holding Ethereum, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. This validates ETH as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. Diversification and Inflation Hedge: For some companies, holding crypto assets like ETH can be a way to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional fiat currencies and potentially hedge against inflation. These reasons collectively paint a picture of a sophisticated investment strategy, focusing on the long-term growth trajectory of the Ethereum network rather than short-term price movements. The Broader Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption SharpLink Gaming’s significant Ethereum investment is not an isolated incident but rather part of a growing trend of institutional crypto adoption. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a paradigm shift, with more corporations, hedge funds, and traditional financial institutions entering the digital asset space. This trend is driven by several factors: Maturing Infrastructure: The emergence of regulated custodians, prime brokers, and institutional-grade trading platforms (like Galaxy Digital, used by SharpLink) has made it safer and easier for large entities to engage with crypto. Regulatory Clarity (Evolving): While still a work in progress, increasing discussions and frameworks around crypto regulation are providing more confidence for institutions. Performance Potential: Despite volatility, the long-term returns of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have outperformed many traditional asset classes, attracting capital looking for growth. Technological Innovation: Institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized networks across various industries, from finance to supply chain. This institutional influx brings significant capital, liquidity, and legitimacy to the crypto market, paving the way for broader mainstream integration. Companies are increasingly viewing digital assets not just as speculative plays, but as strategic components of their balance sheets and future business models. Navigating the Nuances of Ethereum Investment for Corporations For a company like SharpLink Gaming , an Ethereum investment involves more than just buying ETH. It requires a comprehensive strategy that addresses risk management, accounting, and compliance. Here are some key considerations: Risk Management: Developing robust strategies to mitigate volatility, including potential hedging or dollar-cost averaging approaches. Custody Solutions: Utilizing secure, institutional-grade custodians to protect large holdings from hacks or loss. Galaxy Digital’s involvement here is a testament to this. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complexities of accounting for digital assets on balance sheets, which can vary by jurisdiction. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving regulations in different markets to ensure adherence and avoid penalties. Market Analysis: Continuous monitoring of market trends, technological developments (like Ethereum upgrades), and macroeconomic factors that could impact the value of their holdings. SharpLink Gaming’s repeated purchases suggest they have a well-defined strategy and a team capable of managing these complexities. Their approach could serve as a case study for other companies considering similar moves into the digital asset space. Conclusion: A Long-Term Vision Amidst Volatility SharpLink Gaming’s continued substantial ETH acquisition , even in the face of an unrealized loss , underscores a profound long-term conviction in Ethereum’s potential. This strategic move by a Nasdaq-listed firm is a powerful indicator of the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption, signaling a maturation of the digital asset market. While short-term price fluctuations are inherent to this nascent asset class, companies like SharpLink appear to be looking beyond the immediate horizon, focusing on the foundational strength and future growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. Their bold Ethereum investment highlights a belief that despite temporary dips, the long-term trajectory for decentralized technologies remains upward.

According to the latest data , the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP has hit an all-time high of 2,850, a record in XRP’s 12-year history. Wallets with 10,000+ XRP have surged too, up 6.2% year-to-date, now totaling around 306,000 wallets. The strong accumulation among whales shows growing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. Some have also pointed to a recent drop in XRP exchange reserves as a bullish sign. But experts like Dom caution that on-chain data can be misleading, as tokens moved off exchanges are not always newly purchased, and wallets are often misclassified. Over $915M in XRP Bought in Just One Week In the past week, XRP whales have bought over 420 million tokens, worth more than $915 million, which shows strong confidence in XRP’s recovery. But while big investors are buying, the number of new XRP wallets has dropped to a two-month low. Fewer users are entering the market, which shows hesitation despite the whale activity. XRP Surged 6% on Heavy Volume XRP recently saw a 6% surge, climbing from $2.19 to $2.23 before settling around $2.20. The rally was driven by a huge spike in trading volume, over 108 million XRP in one hour, nearly four times the usual. Whales made big moves during the rally. One transfer sent $58 million to Coinbase, and Ripple moved $439 million to an unknown wallet. But XRP held strong with strong buying support. Retail Interest Is Picking Up Retail interest in XRP is rising fast as Google searches for “XRP to $3” are climbing, and many traders expect a breakout between July and September.

However, price action is stalling just below a long-standing descending trendline, suggesting that $108,251 remains a critical inflection point. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Support levels: $106,237 (Fib 0.236), $105,081 (50-EMA), and $103,984 (Fib 0.5) Resistance targets: $110,448 and $111,944 MACD status: Bullish crossover, but histogram momentum flattening Candlestick signal: Spinning top forming under trendline, indicating potential hesitation If BTC closes above $108,251 with high volume, we could see a quick move to $111K. If not, we could see a short-term pullback to $105,000-$103,900. Macro Outlook: Russia is Back in Focus Middle East tensions have eased, but geopolitical risk remains. Market sentiment has shifted back to Eastern Europe as tensions between NATO and Russia escalate. According to QCP Capital, the risk premium on global assets is evolving from a short-term hedge to a long-term assumption. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a slight bounce, a temporary calm, but macroeconomic uncertainty remains a headwind. For BTC, any increase in global volatility, especially from traditional markets, could bring in safe-haven flows into crypto assets. However, BTC’s structure remains bullish. With on-chain data indicating lower realized profits and technical indicators suggesting a continuation, the path to new all-time highs remains open if $ 108,000 holds. Conclusion: BTC is at a crossroads. A close above $108,251 could signal a quick move to $111K and beyond. If not, we could see a pullback to key support zones. Traders are watching – this level will define the next move.

Bitcoin is down 2% in the month, and Ethereum is down nearly 3%, while the overall market momentum remains weak. But this period could be setting the stage for a powerful reversal, especially in AI-focused altcoins. Bitcoin dominance is approaching historical peak levels, which is often a sign of an upcoming shift in favor of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index has also hit its lowest in two years, indicating that altcoins may be due for a breakout. If the market starts to turn around, small AI-focused altcoins could rally hard, similar to the surge seen in April during the tariff-related uncertainty. Here are some promising AI tokens to watch for the next altcoin season. GRIFFAIN An AI Agent on Solana, Griffain rose from a $30 million to $130 million market cap in May, delivering a 6x return in a short period. Although it has cooled off since then, if the AI hype returns, it could be a strong contender again. It is currently trading at $0.03956, down 7.2% in the past day. June looks bearish for the token, and it could trade between $ 0.028372 and $ 0.040441. In July, the outlook improves, and prices may rise to an average of $0.0318. TARS AI This is another Solana-based AI agent marketplace that surged from $0.025 to $0.14 in April, which is a 6–7x increase. TARS offers a unified platform where users and businesses can access AI tools and services, helping them smoothly move from Web2 to the Web3 world. With a market cap of over $50 million, the token may see renewed interest if broader sentiment improves. It is currently trading at $0.08612, down over 3% in the past day. RAI (Reploy) This token climbed from $0.24 to $1.50 in May, but its recent inactivity on social platforms has raised concerns. Investors should approach with caution and monitor for project updates. It is currently priced at $0.6183, down 4.6% in the past day. AIOZ Network This token doubled from around $0.22 to $0.50 in May. It is not as volatile as others, but is still showing potential. It is currently trading at $0.3171, down 1.5% in the past day. Its 24-hour trading volume is $10,513,924, representing a 6.40% increase. Render (RNDR) Render is a more established AI coin with a large market cap of around $1.7B. It went from $3.30 to $5 in May, and recently bounced again from $2.60 to $3.25. This is one of the go-to options for retail investors interested in AI and GPUs. It is currently trading at $3.08, down 4.8%. In June 2025, Render is expected to trade around $3.94, with a potential range between $3.07 and $4.35. The outlook remains positive for July, and it could range from $3.81 to $4.13. Creator Bid Since April, the token rose from $0.035 to $0.12. Although it is less volatile than others, it continues to show upward movement. It is currently trading at $0.1195, up 6%. In July, Creator Bid could see its prices ranging between $0.0788 and $0.0864, and an average of around $0.0834. Virtuals Protocol Virtuals is also an AI agent ecosystem that jumped from $0.45 to $2.50 between April and May. The team remains active with ongoing developments and product launches. It is currently trading at $1.45, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. June may be rough for Virtual Protocol, with prices expected to dip to around $1.21. However, July brings a more optimistic outlook. Many of these coins are still trading close to their recent lows and well below their previous highs, which could present early opportunities. Even though the market is uncertain, the AI trend could regain strong momentum.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|AIOZ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 12:03:25

This article explores essential cryptocurrencies poised to capitalize on the next rebound. Delving into these top picks, readers will discover which coins are set to deliver strong returns, positioning portfolios for success. Kaspa Price Analysis: Recent Decline and Key Levels Kaspa saw a significant pullback over the past month and six months. Prices were recorded within a range from $0.065 to $0.116, with a one-month drop of nearly 29% and a six-month decline of approximately 34%. The coin experienced a short-term recovery, with a modest weekly gain of about 6%, but over the longer term, prices have trended downward. These movements indicate that the token has struggled with persistent negative pressure and investor caution. Price softness over the half-year signals lower buying strength while volatility remains evident. Currently, Kaspa trades between a nearest support at $0.047 and a key resistance at $0.15, with a second resistance looming around $0.201. The technical indicators reflect a mixed scene: the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.015 and the momentum indicator hovers just above zero, while the RSI at 44.56 hints at mild bearish bias. Bulls and bears continue to contest these levels, though the current clear trading range leaves little evidence of a dominant trend. Trading within the established zone offers opportunities; a bounce near $0.047 could invite short-term buys, whereas a sustained move above $0.15 might spark renewed bullish interest. Caution remains advisable as resistance near $0.201 may cap upward movement and prolong the market’s overall indecision. Ondo: A Rocky Journey with Support Levels and Bearish Momentum Ondo has experienced notable swings over recent months, with a one-month decline of nearly 18% and an over 46% drop over the past six months. The coin's price has fluctuated within a trading range of about $0.70 to just over $1.00, showing volatility and susceptibility to sharp downturns. A brief weekly increase of 5% indicates short-term recovery efforts amid prolonged weakness, marking a period of uneven momentum and uncertainty. At present, Ondo is trading within the defined range of $0.70 to $1.05, anchored by a clear support level at $0.57 and facing initial resistance at $1.27. A secondary support is visible at $0.21, while an additional resistance looms at $1.62. The current technical indicators show that bears still exert a degree of influence. Price movement appears indecisive with no clear prevailing trend, leaving traders to weigh short-term opportunities against lingering risks. An approach may involve aiming for a potential bounce at the support level of $0.57 and testing further resistance around $1.27, while remaining cautious of false breakout signals. Injective (INJ) Market Shifts and Key Price Levels Signal Trading Opportunities Injective recorded a one-week gain of 4.31% but faced a one-month decline of nearly 13% and a six-month drop of 46%. The historical price movement indicates a pattern of brief recoveries followed by prolonged downtrends, highlighting market volatility. The coin's performance fluctuates between short-term upticks and long-term challenges, exposing it to external pressures and inconsistent trading conditions. Currently, Injective is trading between $8.82 and $15.47, with immediate resistance at $18.81 and support near $5.50. A secondary resistance level is set at $25.47 if buyers become active. The market shows bearish tendencies, evidenced by a summary recommendation of -0.34 and an Awesome Oscillator reading of -1.65, indicating that bears dominate the market. The lack of a clear trend suggests traders consider buying on dips and exiting near resistance levels while monitoring market volatility closely. Conclusion KAS , ONDO , and INJ each show strong potential in the market. Their unique features and growth prospects make them worthy additions to any portfolio. KAS is noted for its rapid transaction capabilities. ONDO stands out for its innovative financial solutions. INJ offers exciting possibilities in the realm of decentralized finance. Including these coins could enhance portfolio performance in the upcoming market rebound. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric tracked by CoinMarketCap, indicates a strong move into what’s known as Bitcoin Season . At a modest 18 as of June 26, this index score is a clear signal for investors to re-evaluate their strategies in the dynamic crypto market . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a proprietary metric developed by CoinMarketCap (CMC) to provide a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency market’s health and sentiment. It serves as a compass, guiding investors through the often-turbulent waters of digital assets. Unlike simple market capitalization comparisons, this index delves deeper, analyzing the relative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. The methodology behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet insightful. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The core principle is simple: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during the specified 90-day period. This signifies a broad rally across the altcoin spectrum, often driven by speculative interest, technological advancements, or a general ‘risk-on’ sentiment in the crypto market . Bitcoin Season: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in Bitcoin Season . This suggests that capital is primarily flowing into Bitcoin, or that altcoins are struggling to maintain their value relative to the leading cryptocurrency. The current index reading of 18 clearly places us in this latter category. The index score itself ranges from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a stronger lean towards altcoin dominance and lower numbers signaling Bitcoin’s ascendancy. A score of 18, as reported, is a definitive indicator of Bitcoin’s current reign. Decoding Bitcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 isn’t just a number; it’s a declaration that we are firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor, and why does Bitcoin often take the lead in the broader crypto market ? Bitcoin Season signifies a period where Bitcoin (BTC) not only outperforms most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) but also often dictates the overall market sentiment. During such times, capital tends to flow primarily into BTC, either from fiat currencies or from altcoins, as investors seek relative safety or anticipate Bitcoin-specific rallies. Several factors contribute to the onset and persistence of Bitcoin Season : Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or broader economic downturns, investors often view Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or a safer haven compared to the more volatile and less established altcoins. Its larger market cap and longer track record make it a more trusted asset. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events, known as halvings, historically precede significant bull runs. The anticipation leading up to and immediately following a halving often draws immense attention and capital into BTC, temporarily overshadowing altcoin performance. Institutional Interest: With the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, large capital inflows from these entities tend to concentrate on BTC due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity compared to the vast array of altcoins. Dominance Cycle: The cryptocurrency market often moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin accumulation and price appreciation are frequently followed by an ‘altcoin catch-up’ phase. The current Bitcoin Season could be seen as part of this natural market ebb and flow. Market Consolidation: After periods of rapid altcoin growth, the market may consolidate, with capital rotating back into Bitcoin as profits are taken or as investors seek more stable ground before the next speculative wave. Impact on Altcoin Performance: What Investors Need to Know For those holding a diverse portfolio of digital assets, the shift to Bitcoin Season directly impacts altcoin performance . When Bitcoin takes center stage, altcoins typically struggle to keep pace, often seeing their value decrease relative to BTC, even if their fiat value remains somewhat stable or sees minor gains. Key observations regarding altcoin performance during Bitcoin Season include: Underperformance Against BTC: Even if an altcoin sees a modest price increase in USD terms, it’s likely losing value when measured against Bitcoin. This means your portfolio’s Bitcoin weighting naturally increases if you hold both, simply because BTC is outperforming. Reduced Liquidity: Capital tends to consolidate in Bitcoin, leading to thinner trading volumes for many altcoins. This can result in larger price swings on smaller trades and makes it harder to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. Narrative Shift: The market narrative during Bitcoin Season often revolves around Bitcoin’s price movements, adoption, and upcoming events. Altcoin-specific news or developments may get less attention, hindering their individual price action. Psychological Impact: Seeing your altcoin holdings lag behind Bitcoin can be frustrating. It tests investor conviction and often leads to premature selling or ‘altcoin fatigue’. While some strong fundamental altcoins might still show resilience or even modest gains, the broad trend for altcoin performance during this period is one of relative weakness against Bitcoin. Navigating Current Cryptocurrency Trends: Strategies for Success Understanding the prevailing cryptocurrency trends , especially the current Bitcoin Season , is paramount for informed decision-making. Rather than panic, investors can adopt strategic approaches to navigate these market conditions effectively. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Assess your current exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. During Bitcoin Season , it might be prudent to increase your BTC weighting, or at least ensure your altcoin positions are in projects with strong fundamentals that you believe will survive and thrive long-term. Focus on Research: This period offers an excellent opportunity to deep-dive into projects. Identify altcoins that have genuine utility, strong development teams, active communities, and clear roadmaps. These are the ones most likely to recover and outperform when altcoin season eventually returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider implementing a DCA strategy. Regularly investing a fixed amount into Bitcoin or select altcoins can average out your purchase price over time, reducing the risk of buying at peaks. Risk Management is Key: Set clear stop-loss orders or establish profit-taking targets, especially for more speculative altcoin holdings. Volatility can be extreme, and protecting your capital should be a priority. Patience and Long-Term Vision: Market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. A Bitcoin Season is often followed by an Altcoin Season . Those with a long-term perspective and the patience to hold through quieter periods are often the ones who reap the greatest rewards. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A rising dominance suggests capital is flowing into BTC, while a declining dominance could signal the beginning of a shift back towards altcoins. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin-Led Market While the current cryptocurrency trends lean heavily towards Bitcoin dominance, this period presents both distinct challenges and unique opportunities for savvy investors. Challenges: Underperforming Altcoins: The primary challenge is the potential for significant underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, leading to ‘opportunity cost’ if your capital is tied up in lagging assets. Increased Volatility: While Bitcoin might be seen as ‘safer,’ the overall crypto market remains highly volatile. Altcoins can experience sharper drops during downturns. Psychological Strain: Watching your portfolio stagnate or decline while Bitcoin soars can be emotionally taxing, leading to impulsive decisions. Opportunities: Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, Bitcoin Season can be an excellent time to accumulate high-conviction altcoins at discounted prices against Bitcoin. This allows for a stronger position when the tide eventually turns. Learning and Research: With less frenetic price action in altcoins, this period provides an ideal environment to educate yourself, research new projects, and refine your investment thesis without the pressure of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Focus on Fundamentals: The ‘noise’ of speculative altcoin pumps often quiets down, allowing fundamental analysis to come to the forefront. Projects with real utility and strong development continue to build, regardless of the immediate market sentiment. Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe in the cyclical nature of the market, increasing your Bitcoin exposure during Bitcoin Season can position you well for potential future gains as BTC solidifies its position or makes new all-time highs. When Will the Altcoin Season Index Signal a Change? The burning question for many is: when will the Altcoin Season Index signal a return to more favorable conditions for altcoin performance ? While no one can predict the future with certainty, historical patterns and prevailing cryptocurrency trends offer some clues. A shift back towards Altcoin Season typically requires one or a combination of the following catalysts: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a significant Bitcoin rally, BTC enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Major Altcoin-Specific Developments: Significant upgrades (like Ethereum’s upcoming advancements), successful mainnet launches, or major adoption news for prominent altcoins can trigger individual or sector-wide rallies, pulling the index higher. Broader Market Bull Run: A general ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global financial markets, coupled with increasing institutional and retail interest in crypto, can lift all boats, including altcoins. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Monitoring the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) is crucial. A sustained downtrend in BTC.D, particularly when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising modestly, often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index serves as a lagging indicator to some extent, confirming trends rather than predicting them. Therefore, continuous monitoring of market sentiment, technological developments, and macro-economic factors is essential to anticipate when the scales might tip back in favor of altcoins. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 is a clear testament to the ongoing Bitcoin Season . This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a crucial piece of information for navigating the complex crypto market . Understanding these cyclical shifts, from Bitcoin Season to eventual Altcoin Season , empowers investors to make more informed decisions regarding their altcoin performance and overall portfolio strategy. By focusing on strong fundamentals, practicing diligent risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can transform periods of Bitcoin dominance into opportunities for strategic accumulation and growth. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and staying abreast of key cryptocurrency trends like the Altcoin Season Index is vital for long-term success.

The contract is build on the Aztec network, combining zero-knowledge proofs and compliance. According to a press release sent to crypto.news, what sets the token apart from the mainstream legacy stablecoins is its private contract which encrypts all balances and transfers. Apart from the user, the smart contract only allows authorized parties like issuers and regulators. The feature prevents third parties from monitoring crypto wallets , reverse-engineering investment strategies, or physically targeting users for their high-valued holdings. Private stablecoin contracts enable financial institutions to issue stablecoins for payment and treasury applications while also ensuring security and compliance. Chief Security Officer at Taurus , JP Aumasson said that the launch of private contracts mark a major step in advancing security and anonymity for stablecoins. The token feature is able to address long-held concerns from banks and regulators looking to issue stablecoins. “We showed that it’s possible to protect the privacy and security of stablecoin users while retaining the features of industry-standard stablecoins,” said Aumasson.

Not only that, the token also allows users to blacklist addresses and events logging to create a verifiable audit trait.

Audit Report Incoming Speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday, co-founder Zak Folkman confirmed that the project has received its first attestation report from a third-party accounting firm. He stated that the report would be made public on the company’s website “within the next few days,” marking a step toward increasing transparency. Folkman also hinted at upcoming changes to WLFI, which currently grants holders governance rights but cannot be traded or transferred. While withholding details, he said that the next few weeks would likely bring welcome news to the WLFI community. On social media platform X, World Liberty Financial acknowledged growing user demand for WLFI transferability, posting, “You asked to make $WLFI transferable — we heard you,” and teasing “big news coming soon.” Mixed Reactions, Major WLFI Backers The response from the crypto community has been mixed. Some users expressed excitement at the prospect of finally being able to trade WLFI tokens, while skeptics questioned the motives behind the move. One user on X speculated it was a setup for insiders to liquidate their holdings, while another warned that retail investors might be left “holding the bag.” Despite the criticism, World Liberty Financial continues to draw high-profile support. Since its launch in September 2024, the project has raised $550 million through two public token offerings. It positions itself as a DeFi platform centered on stablecoins, aiming to disrupt traditional financial systems. According to his 2025 financial disclosure, Donald Trump earned $57.4 million from the project , largely from token sales. He currently holds more than 15 billion WLFI tokens, giving him significant governance power. Notable crypto figures have backed the venture, including Tron’s Justin Sun with a $30 million investment, Web3Port with $10 million, and Oddiyana Ventures joining in early 2025.

According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain, they have already sold more than 8% of the total MELANIA supply. The #Melania meme team sold 82.18M $MELANIA(8.22% of total supply) over the past 4 months across 44 wallets, cashing out 244,934 $SOL ($35.76M). Most of the $MELANIA tokens were sold through adding and removing liquidity. https://t.co/EJYWtbB5aE pic.twitter.com/gtmRdkNq1y — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 25, 2025 The post indicates that the team has cashed out over $35 million in MELANIA over the past four months from 44 wallets related to them. Within this timeframe, the meme coin related to the FLOTUS experienced a massive price dump. It peaked at $8.5 hours after its launch but quickly started to lose value. In the past 24 hours, the asset has plunged to $0.2, which represents a 98.4% price dump within just several months. Thus, the MELANIA team has followed the example set by those operating the TRUMP token. CryptoPotato reported numerous times in the past that wallets linked to the POTUS meme coin had disposed of enormous portions of the token. The most recent example was quite controversial as it came just hours before the US launched a missile attack against Iran, after which the entire crypto market turned red, including the TRUMP meme coin.

Previously, ZachXBT investigated the whale for aggressively trading MELANIA and other tokens. One of the high-profile whales, previously identified by ZachXBT as William Parker, is back with high-profile positions on Hyperliquid. The whale is also known for his social media handle @qwatio , with no live posts after deleting most of its content since 2015. The whale joined the league of James Wynn and Aguila Trades in a new trend of high-profile traders in recent weeks. MELANIA has a track record The same trader has returned multiple times with new wallets, causing havoc on Hyperliquid with some of the most destructive trades, especially linked to draining liquidity pools. @qwatio’s trading practice informed a subsequent deliberate manipulation of the JELLY token, again with the goal of draining the liquidity pool. In the past few months, @qwatio used four known addresses. Three of the previous ones are inactive, with no new positions. The whale, known as William Parker, or @qwatio, opened two new short positions on BTC and ETH. | Source: Hyperliquid The latest known address is $436K underwater, based on its short positions for BTC and ETH. This time around, the positions had a notional value above $210M, with no clear signs of deliberate counter-trading. The unrealized profit and loss may change, though the trader has shown readiness to keep the positions. On-chain data shows he posted $4.5M USDC collateral to extend his short positions and avoid liquidation. The whale is now considered to be in gambling mode, after six liquidations in the past three days. Hyperliquid becomes top crypto summer venue The stories of high-profile whales added to Hyperliquid’s fame as the go-to chain for derivative trading. It often competes with some of the biggest centralized exchanges in terms of volumes and open interest. In June, Hyperliquid activity slowed down a bit, with open interest of $7.2B. Hyperliquid remains a leader in 24-hour fees, surpassing Ethereum, Solana and other top apps and networks. Based on Artemis data, Hyperliquid generated $2.1M in fees. The perpetual futures DEX also carries $6.8B in 24-hour volumes, with over 500K daily active users. The market shows a mix of organic traffic and activity that aims to tap an eventual second airdrop of HYPE tokens, based on user activity. Since its launch, Hyperliquid has allowed whales to withdraw over $81B, with over $46B in liquidated positions. As of June 2025, Hyperliquid still carried over 60% of decentralized perpetual swaps traffic. The success of the platform inspired other attempts to copy its success. The perps DEX uses more than 64% of all USDC on Arbitrum for its liquidity purposes. The DEX drew in a total of $3.56B USDC, with around $2.91B remaining as available liquidity. HYPE took a step back in June, after peaking above $45. HYPE retains open interest above $1.5B, of which $1.1B is on the Hyperliquid exchange. Currently, short positions make up about 38% of the open interest, on expectations of further correction from peak prices. The native token currently trades around $37 and is closely watched for a rebound, based on recent whale activity. HYPE rallied after the inclusion of high-profile trades, which some consider deliberate attempts to draw attention to Hyperliquid. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While this situation has cast a shadow on the token launches of projects, Eclipse Labs has taken some precautions for the upcoming ES token airdrop. Eclipse Labs has banned its team members from participating in the upcoming ES token airdrop, The Block reported. Airdrop Ban Has Arrived! Eclipse Labs, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH), has banned its team members and employees from participating in the upcoming ES token airdrop. It was reported that this move by Eclipse Labs was planned to prevent insider selling that has been affecting the market recently. Eclipse Labs stated that every employee signed an agreement prohibiting airdrop requests and requested to exclude all wallet addresses, including test wallets. “Eclipse Labs employees signed a document prohibiting them from requesting any ES airdrops and providing all addresses (regardless of whether they were used for testing) to exclude the possibility of participating in airdrops.” Eclipse also noted that the ES tokens allocated to its team and investors will be subject to a one-year lock-up period after its IPO, followed by a three-year vesting period. “All employee and investor allocations will be locked for one year after public listing and will be gradually unlocked over 3 years.” The project has raised around $65 million in total funding so far, but has yet to set a specific date for its ES token airdrop. *This is not investment advice.

Amp ( AMP ) token dropped to a low of $0.00293 this week, its lowest level since April. This retreat has brought its market cap to $286 million, down from its all-time high of $3.5 billion. Here are the top three reasons why the coin may rebound soon. Amp crypto has formed a double-bottom pattern The first reason Amp may bounce back is that it has formed a double-bottom pattern on the daily chart. This pattern consists of two distinct lows and a neckline. In this case, the bottom section is at $0.0029, while the neckline is at $0.00578. The profit target in a double-bottom is established by subtracting the lower side from the neckline. In this case, the calculation gives the pattern’s height as $0.00288. Adding this figure to the neckline gives a target of $0.0086, up 155% from the current level. Amp price chart | Source: crypto.news Whales are buying Amp Another reason the Amp token may rebound is that whales are actively accumulating AMP. These large holders are increasing their token holdings, signaling expectations of a price recovery. One reason for this accumulation is the belief that Amp is highly undervalued, as the MVRV ratio has plunged to -1.78. An MVRV ratio below 1 typically indicates that a token is trading at a discount. The chart below shows that wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million AMP have increased their holdings to 1.1 billion from the year-to-date low of 1.05 billion. Similarly, whales holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens now hold over 1.97 billion coins, while those with 10 million to 100 million now hold 10.7 billion. Amp whale activity and MVRV | Source: Santiment Supply on exchanges is falling Meanwhile, there are signs that investors are not dumping AMP even as its price declines. Nansen data shows that exchange balances have dropped to 15.35 billion tokens, down 15% in the last 30 days and 20% in the last 90. There were nearly 20 billion AMP on exchanges in April. AMP exchange balances | Source: Nansen Therefore, the strong technicals, combined with the falling supply on exchanges and increased whale accumulation, suggest that AMP may bounce back.",Markets|DeFi|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-26 12:27:30
