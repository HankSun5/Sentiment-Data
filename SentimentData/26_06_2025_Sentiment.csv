While the world often focuses on the volatility of digital assets and traditional markets, the bedrock of global stability—and by extension, market confidence—lies in geopolitical harmony. It’s in this context that reports suggest former U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to initiate crucial Trump Iran talks next week, aiming to prevent further progress in Iran’s nuclear program. This potential diplomatic overture, if it materializes, could redefine a contentious relationship and significantly alter the landscape of the Middle East. Understanding the Stakes: Why are these Iran Nuclear Talks Pivotal? The prospect of renewed dialogue between the United States and Iran under a potential Trump administration is not merely a headline; it’s a potential turning point. The relationship between these two nations has been fraught with tension for decades, particularly concerning Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal , was a landmark agreement designed to curtail Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. However, in 2018, the Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA, reimposing stringent sanctions and leading to a significant escalation of tensions. Since then, Iran has progressively expanded its nuclear activities, raising international alarms. De-escalation of Tensions: Direct talks could offer a pathway to reduce the immediate threat of military confrontation in a volatile region. Non-Proliferation: A successful agreement could put verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program, preventing it from developing nuclear weapons. Regional Stability: Reduced US-Iran tensions could positively impact proxy conflicts and alliances across the Middle East. Economic Implications: Any breakthrough could lead to the easing of sanctions, potentially opening up Iran’s economy and impacting global oil markets. Navigating the Complexities of US Foreign Policy Towards Iran The potential for Trump Iran talks represents a fascinating, if not paradoxical, evolution in US foreign policy . During his previous term, President Trump adopted a ‘maximum pressure’ campaign against Iran, believing that stringent sanctions and diplomatic isolation would force Tehran to capitulate. This approach, while popular with some regional allies and domestic constituencies, did not lead to a new, broader agreement as initially hoped. Instead, it contributed to increased regional instability and Iran’s accelerated nuclear activities. The current reports suggest a potential shift in strategy, hinting at a willingness to engage directly, perhaps acknowledging that isolation alone has not yielded the desired results. A new approach, however, would face immense challenges. Both sides carry deep-seated mistrust, shaped by decades of adversarial interactions, including: The 1979 Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis. Support for opposing sides in regional conflicts. Accusations of state-sponsored terrorism and human rights abuses. The ongoing debate over Iran’s ballistic missile program and regional influence, which were not fully addressed by the JCPOA. Any future negotiations would need to carefully balance these historical grievances with pragmatic pathways forward, ensuring that the terms are verifiable and sustainable for both parties. Will Middle East Stability Benefit from Renewed Diplomacy? The ripple effects of any significant movement in Trump Iran talks would be felt keenly across the entire region. The pursuit of Middle East stability is a goal shared by many, yet the path to achieving it is fraught with conflicting interests. Countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia, long wary of Iran’s regional ambitions and nuclear program, would be keenly observing any new diplomatic efforts. Their concerns about Iran’s influence in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iraq would likely feature prominently in their reactions to any potential deal. Conversely, a reduction in US-Iran tensions could pave the way for broader regional de-escalation, fostering an environment where diplomatic solutions to other conflicts become more feasible. Consider the potential scenarios: Successful De-escalation: A new, verifiable agreement could reduce the risk of direct conflict, allowing regional actors to focus on economic development and internal challenges. Continued Skepticism: Even with talks, deep mistrust could persist, leading to a cautious or even negative response from regional powers who fear a ‘bad deal’ that legitimizes Iran’s nuclear program or regional influence. Internal Dynamics: Both the US and Iran face internal political pressures that could derail negotiations. Hardliners in both countries may view compromise as weakness, making sustained dialogue difficult. Analyzing the Geopolitical Impact: What Does This Mean for the World? Beyond the immediate region, the geopolitical impact of potential Trump Iran talks extends globally. Major powers like China, Russia, and European nations have their own stakes in the stability of the Middle East and the future of the Iran nuclear deal . China, a major importer of Iranian oil, would welcome any move that stabilizes energy markets and allows for increased trade. Russia, which has its own strategic partnership with Iran, would likely support diplomatic efforts that reduce US unilateralism. European nations, who have consistently advocated for the preservation of the JCPOA, would see renewed talks as an opportunity to revive multilateral diplomacy and prevent nuclear proliferation. This situation highlights the interconnectedness of global affairs. A shift in US-Iran relations could: Influence global oil prices and energy security. Affect the dynamics of international sanctions regimes. Set precedents for how major powers approach non-proliferation challenges. Potentially open new avenues for cooperation or competition among global players. The world watches to see if these talks can bridge profound divides and steer a path towards greater stability in a region vital to global peace and prosperity. What’s Next for the Trump Iran Talks? While the initial report from Solid Intel on X is concise, the implications are vast. As details emerge regarding the scope and nature of these anticipated talks, the international community will be scrutinizing every development. Key questions remain: Who will be at the table? What will be the preconditions, if any? What kind of deal, if any, could realistically emerge from such negotiations? The answers to these questions will not only shape the future of US-Iran relations but also have profound consequences for Middle East stability and the broader geopolitical impact on global affairs. For investors, policymakers, and global citizens alike, staying informed on these developments is crucial. The path to a resolution will undoubtedly be complex, marked by periods of optimism and potential setbacks. However, the mere initiation of dialogue after years of heightened tensions signals a potentially transformative moment in international diplomacy.

Bitcoin is leading the headlines once again, hovering at $105,127.34 after a 3.18% climb in the past 24 hours. That’s massive liquidity flowing through the world’s biggest coin, just weeks after hitting its all-time high of $111,970. Meanwhile, Polygon is trading around $0.26, carrying a $2.71 billion market cap. While it’s down nearly 42.4% year-to-date, Polygon remains one of the most heavily used layer-2 protocols in the ecosystem. But in the background, Qubetics is rapidly stealing the spotlight—thanks to its powerful Web3 infrastructure and a final-stage crypto presale that’s drawing attention for all the right reasons. In the middle of this high-stakes environment comes Qubetics ($TICS), an ambitious project entering the final stage of its public sale. It’s solving real pain points in Web3 and presenting new opportunities in this evolving digital finance space. For those searching for the best crypto ICOs to invest, Qubetics stands out thanks to its cross-chain tools, final phase pricing advantage, and confirmed listing on a top 10 global exchange. The Web3 Power Tool: How Qubetics Helps Real-World Businesses The Qubetics ecosystem is built to do what others couldn’t. At its heart lies the QubeQode framework and the Qubetics IDE, two tools offering true utility for individuals and businesses navigating multi-chain demands. QubeQode empowers small businesses to deploy loyalty tokens across multiple chains in one go. Picture a restaurant chain in North America issuing branded tokens usable across Ethereum, BNB, and Solana without needing separate dev teams. It saves time, money, and risk. Meanwhile, the Qubetics IDE functions like a no-code studio for smart contract development. A financial services startup can now launch its own staking protocol across multiple blockchains without hiring expensive Web3 engineers. Even artists can mint NFTs with dual-chain support using a visual interface. Qubetics isn’t just making development easier, it’s making it possible for those who were previously locked out. This is what makes it one of the best crypto ICOs to invest right now: it actually delivers meaningful tools for the next wave of digital entrepreneurs. Qubetics Presale: Final Stage of One of the Best Crypto ICOs to Invest The Qubetics crypto presale is at its final stage, Stage 37, and it’s getting intense. Priced at $0.3370 per $TICS token, the sale has already raised over $18.1 million, with more than 516 million tokens sold and over 28,200 community members on board. There are only 9 million tokens left before the crypto presale closes and the token lists at $0.40, a 20% ROI at listing for those entering now. But it gets better. Following a significant tokenomics update, Qubetics cut its total supply from over 4 billion down to 1.36 billion, instantly boosting scarcity. The project also shifted a hefty 38.55% of its tokens into the hands of its public sale community—flipping the typical centralized control structure into something user-led and organic. This is why the Qubetics crypto presale is gaining steam among people looking for smart early entries. Here’s a real-world example: If someone puts in $20,000 at the current price of $0.3370, they’ll receive around 59,345 $TICS tokens. At the listing price of $0.40, that investment becomes $23,738. That’s a 20% gain built right into the timeline. Now, if Qubetics hits $5 post-listing—as some early forecasts suggest, that same holding could be worth $296,725. If it pushes toward $10, it reaches $593,450. That’s a strong reason why this crypto presale is turning heads in the final stretch. And the momentum doesn’t stop there. An official listing on a top 10 global exchange has been confirmed. The exact exchange name is currently under NDA, but the public announcement is scheduled in tandem with the platform’s PR rollout. Combined with the upcoming mainnet launch, this makes the Qubetics crypto presale a rare window of opportunity. Exchange Launch at $0.40: Qubetics Eyes Institutional Demand Qubetics will soon be listed on a top-tier global exchange, with the starting price confirmed at $0.40, 20% higher than the current public sale rate. That difference offers immediate growth for final presale buyers ahead of broader market entry. With a lean token supply and ecosystem utility built for real adoption, Qubetics is earning strong forecasts from market analysts, who predict a potential rise to $10–$15 per token post-mainnet. The project’s upcoming listing is more than just a price move, it’s the beginning of a long-anticipated public breakout. Polygon: The Layer-2 Giant with Real Utility Polygon has long been a key scaling solution for Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions via its proof-of-stake mechanism. It has hosted thousands of decentralized applications, enabling real-world use in DeFi, gaming, and enterprise integrations. Trading today at roughly $0.26, its market cap holds at $2.71 billion. However, despite broad adoption and strong infrastructure, Polygon is down 42.4% in 2025—mirroring wider market pressures and skepticism around its upcoming POL token rebranding. Still, its influence can’t be ignored. From powering major DeFi apps to onboarding legacy enterprises like Nike and Disney into Web3, Polygon remains a staple for builders. While its price struggles to recover, it’s clear that many are betting on its technology—not just its token. Yet in a market driven by momentum and scarcity, Qubetics seems to be capturing more of the spotlight this quarter. Bitcoin: Still the Giant, Now Near Peak Levels Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto confidence. Trading at $105,127.34, its current price puts it only 6% below its May 2025 all-time high of $111,970. With a market cap above $2.09 trillion and a massive 24-hour volume of $67 billion, Bitcoin is signaling strength in a market that’s finally waking up. The total circulating supply is nearly maxed out at 19.88 million BTC, with only 1.12 million coins left to mine before it hits its hard cap of 21 million. Bitcoin’s dominance is not just about scarcity—it’s about perception. With countries now adding BTC to their reserves and large financial institutions offering spot ETF exposure, Bitcoin is no longer just a tech rebellion—it’s a mainstream asset. Its recent moves make it clear: the next bull cycle has already begun. Conclusion For those looking at the big picture, each of these assets serves a different role. Bitcoin is the gold standard, solid, scarce, and increasingly institutional. Polygon represents enterprise-grade scaling solutions, though its price action still reflects broader macro unease. Qubetics, however, is in acceleration mode. It’s got real tools solving real problems, with QubeQode and IDE making cross-chain development accessible to everyone from startups to solo creatives. The Qubetics crypto presale is in its last phase, priced at $0.3370, with a confirmed top-tier exchange listing and an expected 20% gain baked in. With only 9 million tokens left and momentum building fast, early adopters are moving quickly to lock in allocations. For those scanning the space for one final entry point before the next surge, it’s time to join this crypto presale.

Crypto analyst Diep Sahn first noticed this in the ECB Eurosystem report on using emerging technologies for settlements. One of the projects that participated in the Eurosystem experiment was Axiology, a DLT securities trading and settlement infrastructure. The startup, founded by a former board member of the Bank of Lithuania, Marius Jurgilas, operates under the EU DLT Pilot regime. According to the report , 60 stakeholders and four central banks participated in the exploratory work across two phases. Through experiments and trials, these projects tested out 48 use cases in eleven categories, ranging from issuance and settlement of bonds to margin calls. Axiology participated in the experiment under Category 1, focusing on the institutional issuance of debt securities and the lifecycle management of such securities, from the issuance to coupon payments to redemption. Axiology leveraging XRP Ledger technology for permissioned DLT The report included a comprehensive explanation of Axiology capabilities and its use cases in the experiment, which shows that the platform was built using the open-source code of XRP Ledger. However, it was designed to be private and permissioned, allowing it to be independent while leveraging XRPL. The report said: “While Axiology benefits from XRP Ledger technology, it operates as an independent system, designed to streamline trading, settlement, and custody of tokenized assets, such as financial securities, with enhanced security and efficiency.” As a private and permissioned network, Axiology reportedly combines trading, accounting, and settlement functions into one infrastructure. This enables instant Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) settlement capabilities. However, it also operates with more compliance standards and risk management frameworks than public blockchains. For instance, it has to Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, such as verifying investors’ identities and allowing freezing of wallets while its on-chain capabilities are limited to reduce the risks associated with smart contracts. The report also comprehensively explained how Axiology functions in the lifecycle management of a bond, with the platform handling issuance, coupon payments, and redemption upon maturity. Interestingly, XRP Payment plays a crucial role in the processes, with the ECB noting that the wallets involved in transactions use XRP Payment to move funds. However, most of the processes rely on instructions contained in metadata that ensure seamless transactions without the inefficiency of the traditional bond market. Meanwhile, the experiments focused mostly on whether Axiology infrastructure and solutions can be interoperable with Central Bank Money (CeBM) and external settlement platforms. This is essential to identifying how the platform will function in real-world use cases. XRP holders are bullish on the token after the ECB report Many in the XRP community have pointed to the ECB report as a positive sign for the XRP Ledger. Diep Sanh said that this is evidence that XRP is powering the future of finance. Others also shared optimism, noting that while Axiology only uses XRPL technology, it is a vote of confidence for the network and shows its capacity for institutional and permissioned use. XRPL has already planned new features to improve its capacity for enterprise-grade products. However, the positive sentiments in the community have not been enough to lift its price this year. XRP remains down 5.79% year-to-date and has lost 6.49% of its value in the last 30 days, continuing an underperforming year like other major cap altcoins. Still, most XRP investors are holding in profit, with 65.1% of XRP circulating currently held at a profit, according to Santiment data. This puts it among the top three for percentage of circulating supply in profit, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Russian exchange’s Managing Director Vladimir Krekoten said a new BTC derivative instrument launch was “imminent.” Speaking to RBC Investments, Krekoten explained that the product would be a futures contract on a new Bitcoin index. Moscow Exchange: BTC Bullishness Continues He explained that calculations on the index that will become the underlying asset for the contract began on June 10.

It is cash-settled in rubles and tied to the BlackRock-launched iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). IBIT prices (USD) since the start of 2025. (Source: Yahoo Finance) Krekoten suggested that the popularity of the first Bitcoin futures contract offering has inspired the exchange to fast-track the release of more crypto derivative products. He said: “We plan to launch trading in instruments based on cryptoasset indices or ETFs as soon as demand for them from the industry begins to appear. On the other hand, regulators will become more aware of what is permissible and which clients should be allowed to access them. I can say that we are currently working on launching a futures contract on the Bitcoin index. We plan to launch it soon.” Regulatory Approval Still Pending Krekoten added that the exchange’s discussions with management companies were ongoing as the parties await regulatory approval. The executive said the parties were discussing the launch of mutual funds and structured bonds focused on cryptoasset indices. He explained: “We believe that the industry will soon be ready to provide clients with access to structured bonds for cryptoassets. We are technically and legally ready for this.” The executive explained that since the June 4 launch, trading volumes on the BTC futures contract have hit a total of almost 7 billion rubles ($89,455,660).

(Source: RBC Investing/Screenshot) Krekoten said that more than 10,000 investors have already traded with the product, adding: “These are very good indicators considering the instrument has only been on the market for such a short time.” Obviously, the figures are not comparable with the volumes of futures contracts on the Moscow Exchange index. However, this is still a very high figure.” Crypto Investment Growing in Popularity in Russia The Managing Director dismissed claims that the exchange lacks the technical capacity to launch more crypto-related products, concluding: “I think there are no fundamental differences between funds for any underlying asset.

For years, Bitcoin was hailed as an uncorrelated asset, a true safe haven from the volatility of mainstream finance. Yet, recent data tells a different story, one where the Bitcoin correlation with assets like the S&P 500 is reaching levels not seen in years. But here’s the twist: this isn’t necessarily a sign of increased investor appetite for risk. Instead, a deeper look reveals it might be an alarming signal of underlying US dollar weakness and profound shifts in global finance. Understanding the Surprising Bitcoin Correlation For a long time, the narrative around Bitcoin positioned it as ‘digital gold’ – an asset that would hold its value or even appreciate when traditional markets faltered. The idea was that it offered true diversification, acting as a hedge against inflation or economic downturns. However, recent observations, particularly highlighted by RedStone Oracles and cited by Cointelegraph, indicate a significant change in this dynamic. What Does a 0.4 Correlation Mean? The Metric: The 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 recently climbed above 0.4. Historical Context: This figure represents its highest point since 2020, a period marked by unprecedented monetary expansion and market volatility. Interpretation: A correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A value of +1 means two assets move perfectly in the same direction, -1 means they move perfectly in opposite directions, and 0 means no linear relationship. A 0.4 correlation suggests a moderate, but noticeable, tendency for Bitcoin and the S&P 500 to move together. Traditionally, a rising correlation between a ‘risk-on’ asset like Bitcoin and equities might suggest that investors are feeling more confident and are willing to take on more risk across the board. However, the concurrent plummet of the Dollar Index (DXY) to a 12-month low paints a different picture entirely. This simultaneous movement – Bitcoin and stocks up, dollar down – suggests a flight from fiat, not just a surge in speculative enthusiasm. Why is US Dollar Weakness Driving This Trend? The strength of the U.S. dollar has been a cornerstone of global finance for decades. It’s the world’s primary reserve currency, used in most international trade and financial transactions. But cracks are beginning to show, and the recent DXY plunge is a stark indicator of growing concerns. Unpacking the Dollar Index Decline The Dollar Index (DXY) measures the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of six major world currencies. When the DXY falls, it means the dollar is weakening against these currencies. Several factors contribute to this concerning trend: Monetary Policy Concerns: The U.S. Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening cycle, followed by hints of a potential pivot, creates uncertainty. Investors question the long-term impact of high interest rates on economic growth and the sustainability of government debt. Fiscal Discipline Woes: The U.S. national debt continues to climb at an alarming rate, recently surpassing $34 trillion. This escalating debt, coupled with persistent budget deficits, raises red flags for fiscal sustainability. When governments print more money or borrow excessively, it can devalue the currency. Inflationary Pressures: While inflation has cooled from its peak, persistent inflationary pressures erode the purchasing power of the dollar. Investors seek assets that can preserve or grow their wealth in real terms. Geopolitical Shifts: Global geopolitical tensions and the rise of multi-polar economic blocs are prompting nations to reconsider their reliance on the dollar. This erosion of trust in U.S. monetary policy and fiscal discipline is a powerful catalyst. When the world’s most dominant currency shows signs of fragility, investors, both retail and institutional, naturally look for alternatives. The Accelerating Pace of De-dollarization The concept of de-dollarization is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a tangible movement gaining momentum across the globe. This trend refers to countries and entities reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar for international trade, investment, and as a reserve currency. Who is Driving De-dollarization and Why? The shift away from the dollar is being propelled by various players for a multitude of reasons: Geopolitical Risk Mitigation: Countries are increasingly wary of the U.S.’s ability to weaponize the dollar through sanctions. Nations like China, Russia, and even some allies are seeking to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and establish alternative payment systems to reduce their vulnerability. Economic Sovereignty: Many emerging economies desire greater control over their financial systems and wish to reduce exposure to U.S. economic fluctuations and policy decisions. Rise of Alternative Currencies/Blocs: The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), among others, are actively exploring new trade agreements settled in local currencies and even contemplating a new common currency. This directly challenges the dollar’s dominance. Search for Stable Alternatives: As trust in fiat currencies wavers, the appeal of decentralized, scarce assets like Bitcoin grows. It offers a permissionless, censorship-resistant alternative that is not subject to the whims of any single government or central bank. This broader movement underscores a systemic shift. When institutional and sovereign players begin exploring alternatives to fiat-backed holdings, it sends a clear signal: the perceived safety and stability of traditional currencies are being re-evaluated on a global scale. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, presents a compelling proposition as a non-sovereign, digitally scarce asset in this evolving landscape. Investor Hedging: A New Paradigm for Scarcity In an environment where traditional safe havens are looking less secure, investors are recalibrating their strategies. The current macroeconomic trends of persistent inflation, ballooning national debts, and geopolitical instability are forcing a re-evaluation of what constitutes a ‘safe’ asset. This is where the concept of investor hedging takes on new meaning. Why Bitcoin and Stocks as Hedges? Historically, gold has been the go-to hedge against inflation and currency debasement. However, in the digital age, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold’ due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. Similarly, certain equities, particularly those of companies with strong pricing power or essential services, can act as a hedge against inflation, as they can pass on rising costs to consumers. Asset Type Traditional Role New Perspective (Hedge Against Dollar Weakness) Bitcoin Speculative, High Risk Digital Gold, Scarcity-driven asset, Uncorrelated (historically), Non-sovereign store of value U.S. Equities (S&P 500) Growth-oriented, Economic Indicator Real assets, Inflation hedge (for certain sectors/companies), Proxy for economic activity in a weakening currency environment Gold Traditional Safe Haven, Inflation Hedge Continues to be a hedge, but Bitcoin offers a digital alternative with different properties The shift is profound. Investors aren’t necessarily chasing higher returns through increased risk; they are seeking to preserve wealth in a world where the bedrock of global finance – the U.S. dollar – appears increasingly shaky. This strategic pivot towards scarce assets, whether digital or physical, underscores a fundamental concern about the future value of fiat currency. Navigating the New Macroeconomic Trends: What’s Next? The confluence of Bitcoin’s rising correlation with equities and the declining dollar index paints a complex picture of evolving macroeconomic trends . It’s a testament to how deeply intertwined global finance has become and how quickly investor sentiment can shift in response to perceived instability. Key Takeaways for Investors and Observers: Beyond Risk Appetite: Don’t mistake this correlation solely for increased risk-taking. It’s more nuanced, reflecting a strategic move to hedge against currency debasement. The Dollar’s Crossroads: The long-term trajectory of the U.S. dollar will be crucial. Continued fiscal expansion and monetary uncertainty could further accelerate the de-dollarization trend. Bitcoin’s Evolving Role: Bitcoin is maturing beyond a purely speculative asset. Its role as a potential hedge against inflation and a non-sovereign store of value is gaining traction, especially among institutional players. Global Economic Rebalancing: The world economy is in a state of rebalancing. The rise of new economic powers and their desire for financial independence will continue to challenge the existing order. This isn’t just a fleeting market anomaly; it’s a reflection of deeper structural issues. As governments grapple with immense debt burdens and central banks navigate complex monetary policy decisions, the search for truly scarce and resilient assets will only intensify. The rising Bitcoin correlation with equities, viewed through the lens of a weakening dollar, serves as a powerful indicator of these underlying shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Understanding these complex dynamics is one thing; knowing how to act on them is another. For those looking to navigate these turbulent waters, here are some actionable insights: Diversify Beyond Traditional Hedges: While gold remains relevant, consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to digital scarce assets like Bitcoin. Research and understand its fundamentals, security, and long-term value proposition. Monitor Currency Markets Closely: Keep an eye on the Dollar Index (DXY) and other major currency pairs. A sustained decline in the dollar could signal continued shifts towards alternative assets. Assess Sovereign Debt and Fiscal Policies: Stay informed about the fiscal health of major economies. High and rising national debt can erode trust in fiat currencies over time. Educate Yourself on De-dollarization: Understand the geopolitical implications of de-dollarization and how it might impact global trade, reserve currencies, and commodity markets. Consider Long-Term Trends: Focus on long-term macroeconomic trends rather than short-term market noise. The shift towards scarce assets is a multi-year phenomenon. This era demands a more sophisticated approach to investment, one that acknowledges the changing nature of money and value in a digitally interconnected world. The signals are clear: the old rules are being rewritten, and adaptability will be key. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Digital Scarcity? The surprising convergence of Bitcoin and stock market movements, set against the backdrop of a weakening U.S. dollar, is more than just a statistical anomaly. It’s a compelling narrative of how global trust is shifting from traditional fiat currencies towards assets perceived as genuinely scarce and independent. RedStone Oracles’ insight, highlighting this as a response to US dollar weakness rather than mere risk appetite, offers a crucial lens through which to view the current financial landscape. This era of rising national debts, persistent inflation, and geopolitical re-alignments is compelling both retail and institutional investors to seek out new forms of wealth preservation. The growing Bitcoin correlation with equities underscores a broader theme of investor hedging against a backdrop of significant macroeconomic trends and an accelerating move towards de-dollarization . As the world re-evaluates its financial anchors, assets like Bitcoin are increasingly seen not just as speculative plays, but as vital components in a diversified portfolio designed to weather the storms of a changing global economy. The future of finance may well be defined by this ongoing search for true scarcity in an increasingly abundant world of fiat currency.

46784809,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72575,1750894230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Predicts XRP $2 as Last Buying Opportunity,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-predicts-xrp-2-as-last-buying-opportunity/,"Cryptocurrency analyst DustyBC has made a confident projection regarding the price trajectory of XRP. In a recent social media post, he stated that by December 2025, the broader market will look back at XRP trading below $2 as a significant buying opportunity that was overlooked by many. He encouraged followers to revisit his remarks at the end of the year, suggesting that a major shift in XRP’s valuation may occur within that time frame. $XRP under $2 is incredibly cheap Bookmark this post, look back in 6 months. — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) June 23, 2025 XRP’s Performance and Price Stability Over the past seven months, XRP has maintained a price above the $2 mark despite volatility in the broader crypto market. While skeptics had anticipated a sharp correction following XRP’s earlier surge, the asset has demonstrated notable price resilience. During this period, it has repeatedly recovered from dips, never falling below $1.60 for a sustained period. This price stability has led many investors to reassess the definition of what qualifies as “cheap” for XRP. Historically, XRP was accessible within the $0.40 to $0.60 range just a few years ago. As a result, investors who refrained from buying then are now facing significantly higher entry points. For example, acquiring 100,000 XRP would have cost around $50,000 last year; today, the same quantity is valued at over $200,000. Community Sentiment and Market Outlook The belief that XRP could soon experience a significant price appreciation is shared by a growing segment of the crypto community. According to DustyBC, current prices may represent the lower end of a new long-term trading range. Several users commenting on his post shared this view, speculating that a strong upward move could materialize by the end of the year. Supporters of this outlook also point to previous price patterns. XRP’s last notable breakout began in late 2024 and extended into early 2025, aligning with the timeline DustyBC has outlined. This historical parallel adds weight to the argument that XRP may follow a similar trajectory in the coming months. Varying Price Predictions from Analysts Although DustyBC did not specify a precise target price for XRP, he has previously shared technical charts predicting a potential increase of up to 4,000%, which would bring the token close to $30. That forecast was initially made when XRP traded around $0.51. Since then, the token has reached a peak of $3.40 before undergoing a retracement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other analysts have presented their forecasts. XForceGlobal, a South Korean analyst known for using Elliott Wave theory, expects XRP to rise to between $10 and $20, targeting early 2026 for this price realization. He remains confident in the asset’s potential, despite persistent skepticism in the market. Javon Marks, another analyst, has issued one of the most bullish forecasts, suggesting that XRP could reach $99 within this market cycle. He bases his analysis on the similarities between current price behavior and the coin’s performance during its 2017 rally, where it significantly exceeded prior resistance levels. More conservative projections suggest that XRP could climb to approximately $9 before the end of the year, reflecting a more measured outlook amid varying degrees of market optimism. While projections differ widely, from moderate gains to dramatic increases, the next six months will likely be critical in determining whether current valuations truly reflect the asset’s potential or if, as some believe, XRP remains undervalued at today’s prices.

Canary Capital’s ETF filing is drawing attention because it is one of the first ETFs to combine memecoin assets, with the PENGU meme coin and Pudgy Penguins NFTs. BREAKING: Canary Capital files for $PENGU ETF with CBOE pic.twitter.com/RNgLgctUv0 — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) June 25, 2025 Canary Capital’s filing moves forward According to the filing, the PENGU ETF will focus primarily on PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguin NFTs, and will allocate between 80% to 95% of its assets to PENGU while 5% to 15% go to the NFTs. Smaller portions of SOL and ETH will be held to cover transaction fees and NFT purchases; however, this will only be as needed rather than for investment exposure. Given PENGU was deployed on the Solana network while the Pudgy Penguin NFTs exist on Ethereum, ETH and SOL will be required for auction payments and gas fees. Since the filing was announced, users on X have weighed in with their opinions, with sentiments mostly highlighting the novelty of the idea. It has also not gone unnoticed to many netizens that only a few cryptocurrencies, like BTC, SOL, XRP, and DOGE, have ever reached this stage in the ETF process, underscoring the filing’s importance for Pudgy Penguins’ visibility. However, nothing is certain, and the outcome may not be what is expected. Even with the crypto-friendly Atkins SEC, the regulator still throws the occasional curve ball. Invesco joins the race for a Solana ETF News of Canary Capital’s filing comes as Invesco Ltd and crypto-focused firm Galaxy Digital LP filed for a Solana exchange-traded fund. Subsidiaries of the two companies reportedly filed a registration statement on Wednesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an “ Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF .” If approved, the fund will trade on Cboe BZX under the ticker symbol “QSOL,” according to the statement. Invesco Capital Management LLC was registered as the sponsor, and the Bank of New York Mellon was noted as the administrator. However, Galaxy will be tasked with acquiring the tokens while Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC would be the custodian of the SOL. The filing from Invesco and Galaxy Digital LP joins those from several firms like VanEck, Bitwise and 21Shares that are also vying for a Solana ETF. Many of those proposals were filed over the past year with the expectation that the new SEC administration installed by President Donald Trump would be more open toward the idea of crypto ETFs. However, the SEC has been sluggish, delaying its decision on the various ETFs for various reasons, much to the frustration of the general public.

Imagine a future where you, and only you, hold the keys to your digital self, moving seamlessly across platforms without compromising your privacy or ownership. This is not just a dream; it’s the groundbreaking vision behind Moca Network ‘s latest initiative. Backed by the formidable Animoca Brands, Moca Network is set to revolutionize how we interact with the internet, launching a new Layer-1 blockchain specifically designed for decentralized identity. This move signals a significant leap towards true digital property rights and a more user-centric Web3. What is Moca Network and Its Vision for Web3? At its core, Moca Network is more than just a blockchain project; it’s a strategic arm of Animoca Brands, a global leader in gamification and blockchain, dedicated to building and investing in the open metaverse. Moca Network’s primary mission is to foster a vibrant ecosystem that promotes digital property rights, empowering users with greater control over their data and digital assets. This vision is deeply rooted in the principles of Web3, advocating for an internet where ownership and governance are distributed, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants. Their focus extends beyond just digital collectibles; it delves into the fundamental concept of identity. In the current digital landscape, our personal data is often siloed, forcing us to create new profiles and trust multiple third parties with sensitive information. Moca Network aims to dismantle these silos, offering a unified, self-sovereign identity solution that travels with you, securely and privately, across various applications and platforms. How Does Moca Chain L1 Revolutionize Decentralized Identity? The cornerstone of Moca Network’s ambitious plan is the introduction of Moca Chain L1 , a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain engineered specifically for decentralized digital identity verification. Unlike existing identity solutions that might be built on general-purpose blockchains, Moca Chain is being optimized from the ground up to handle the unique demands of identity management, ensuring scalability, security, and efficiency. The goal is simple yet profound: to give users unprecedented control over their personal data. Imagine a scenario where instead of submitting your driver’s license or passport details to every new service, you can simply provide a cryptographically verified attestation of your age or nationality, without revealing the underlying document. This is the power of decentralized identity facilitated by Moca Chain. Key developments for Moca Chain L1 include: Testnet Launch: Expected in Q3 of the current year, allowing developers and early adopters to experiment with the protocol and provide crucial feedback. Mainnet Rollout: Slated for year-end, signifying the full operational launch of the blockchain, ready for widespread adoption. Native Token (MOCA): The Moca Chain will utilize its native token, MOCA, for essential network functions. This includes staking, which will secure the network and incentivize participation, as well as powering various data-related functions and transactions within the ecosystem. This dedicated L1 approach signifies Moca Network’s commitment to building a robust and scalable infrastructure for the future of identity in Web3. The Strategic Alliance: Animoca Brands and Moca Network The partnership between Animoca Brands and Moca Network is a formidable one, amplifying the potential impact of this decentralized identity initiative. Animoca Brands is renowned for its aggressive push into the open metaverse, NFTs, and blockchain gaming. Their extensive portfolio includes investments in hundreds of Web3 companies and popular titles like The Sandbox, bringing immense experience and a vast ecosystem to the table. Animoca’s broader mission aligns perfectly with Moca Chain’s focus on user data control and digital property rights. For years, Animoca Brands has been a vocal proponent of true digital ownership, where users genuinely own their in-game assets, virtual land, and digital identities. Moca Chain provides a fundamental layer for this vision, ensuring that the identity tied to these digital assets is also user-owned and controlled. As reported by CoinDesk, this synergy is crucial. Animoca’s backing provides not only financial support but also strategic guidance, network effects, and a clear pathway for Moca Chain to integrate with a wide array of existing and future Web3 applications within the Animoca ecosystem. This collaboration could accelerate the adoption of decentralized identity solutions, making them a standard feature of the open metaverse. What Are the Tangible Benefits of Moca Chain’s Approach? The advent of a dedicated L1 for decentralized identity, spearheaded by Moca Network, promises a multitude of benefits for individuals, developers, and the broader Web3 ecosystem: Unprecedented User Control and Privacy: The most significant benefit is the shift in power. Users will gain complete sovereignty over their personal data, deciding what information to share, with whom, and for how long. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and empowers individuals to manage their digital footprint proactively. Enhanced Security: By leveraging blockchain’s cryptographic security and immutability, Moca Chain offers a more secure method for identity verification compared to traditional centralized databases, which are often single points of failure. Seamless Interoperability Across Web3: A unified decentralized identity means users can carry their verified credentials across different dApps, metaverses, and blockchain networks without needing to re-verify or create new profiles repeatedly. This streamlines user experience and fosters a truly interconnected digital world. New Economic Models and Reputation Systems: Decentralized identity can unlock novel opportunities for data monetization (where users choose to share data for compensation) and the development of robust, verifiable reputation systems that are not tied to a single platform. Streamlined Compliance (Selective Disclosure): For businesses and regulated industries, Moca Chain could facilitate ‘selective disclosure,’ allowing users to prove compliance (e.g., being over 18) without revealing their exact birthdate or other sensitive information, thus balancing privacy with regulatory needs. Navigating the Path Forward: Potential Challenges and Opportunities While the promise of decentralized identity is immense, the journey towards widespread adoption for Moca Chain L1 will naturally encounter challenges. One significant hurdle is user education and onboarding. The concept of self-sovereign identity is new to many, and simplifying the user experience will be critical for mass adoption. Furthermore, regulatory frameworks around digital identity are still evolving globally, which could impact implementation strategies. However, these challenges are dwarfed by the immense opportunities. The market for secure, private, and interoperable digital identities is vast and growing. Moca Chain has the potential to become a foundational layer for countless Web3 applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming, social media, and even real-world applications. By empowering users with true ownership of their digital selves, Moca Network is not just building a blockchain; it’s laying the groundwork for a more equitable and trustworthy digital future. Looking Ahead: The Future of Digital Property Rights with Moca Network The launch of Moca Chain L1 marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital property rights . Animoca Brands and Moca Network are not just creating a technical solution; they are championing a philosophical shift towards an internet where individuals are sovereign. This means that your online persona, your digital assets, and your personal data are truly yours, controlled by you, and protected by the immutable power of the blockchain. For developers, Moca Chain offers a robust infrastructure to build applications that prioritize user privacy and ownership. For users, it promises a future where logging in doesn’t mean giving away your data, and moving between digital spaces is as seamless as walking from one room to another in your own home. As the testnet approaches in Q3 and the mainnet by year-end, the world will be watching closely to see how this revolutionary approach to identity reshapes the Web3 landscape. In conclusion, Moca Network’s foray into a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain for decentralized identity is a bold and necessary step towards a more secure, private, and user-controlled digital world. With Animoca Brands’ backing, Moca Chain L1 is poised to become a cornerstone of the open metaverse, truly empowering individuals with their digital property rights and shaping the next era of the internet.

What Does Data Show?,https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoins-btc-about-to-blow-up-to-120k-breakout-what-does-data-show/,"Bitcoin briefly dropped below $100,000 during the 12-day conflict involving Israeli and US strikes on Iran, along with retaliatory attacks on Israel and US bases in Qatar. Markets were shaken until US President Donald Trump confirmed that both Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. This announcement triggered a rebound in global risk sentiment. As investor confidence returned, Bitcoin began a fresh rally, breaking through the $106,000 level on Wednesday. New data suggest that the crypto asset could see a potential surge to $120K amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Beginning of a New Bull Leg? Bitcoin could be poised for a sharp upward move, potentially reaching $120,000, after successfully reclaiming its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). According to CryptoQuant, the 50-day EMA is widely regarded as a critical technical indicator, and often serves as support during corrections in a broader bullish trend. Historically, when Bitcoin dips below this level and quickly regains it, the market tends to respond with a rapid 10-20% surge. This pattern is playing out again: following a brief pullback below the EMA, Bitcoin has closed above it for three consecutive days, which is indicative of a renewed bullish momentum. CryptoQuant explained that this recovery could kickstart a new leg up in the ongoing cycle. However, they caution that external geopolitical factors, particularly developments related to the US, Israel, and Iran, may inject short-term volatility into the market. In such an environment, traders should avoid excessive leverage and maintain a risk-managed approach. While technical indicators currently support a bullish outlook, broader macro and geopolitical uncertainty continue to pose potential headwinds. Despite this, the reclaim of the 50-day EMA remains a significant milestone for Bitcoin, which strengthens the case for a possible rally toward the six-figure mark. Psychological Floor Beyond technical indicators, on-chain metrics also support Bitcoin’s current momentum, especially the behavior of short-term holders. The Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH-RP), which now stands at $98K, continues to act as a key psychological and technical support for Bitcoin. As it edges toward $100K, each uptick reinforces six figures as the new perceived “fair value.” Bitcoin’s spot price is $106.4K, a 7.2% premium over STH-RP, which suggests reduced “froth.” Recent sharp bounces off STH-RP confirm a bullish structure, while long-term holders remain unmoved, with their cost basis at $32K. This veteran supply lock-up limits downside risk. As long as the crypto asset holds above STH-RP, the uptrend of higher lows and higher highs remains intact; a break below would signal a potential correction The post Is Bitcoin’s (BTC) About to Blow Up to $120K Breakout?

This monumental sum is earmarked for a new crypto reserve fund , signaling a powerful convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. This isn’t just another fund; it’s a strategic move to build a substantial war chest of leading digital assets , potentially reshaping the landscape of institutional crypto investment . The Vision Behind the Tether Co-founder’s Bold Move At the heart of this significant development is a figure well-known in the cryptocurrency realm: a co-founder of Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT. While the specific name isn’t publicly detailed in the initial reports, the involvement of such a prominent individual from the stablecoin ecosystem lends immense credibility and deep industry insight to the venture. This Tether co-founder brings a wealth of experience in managing large-scale digital asset operations and understanding market dynamics. Joining forces with this crypto veteran is a former executive from Blackstone, one of the world’s leading investment firms. This partnership is particularly noteworthy as it bridges the often-disparate worlds of decentralized finance and traditional Wall Street. The combination of deep crypto expertise and seasoned institutional finance acumen creates a formidable team, capable of navigating the complexities of both markets. Their collective vision is to establish a robust fund designed not for speculative day trading, but for holding a diversified portfolio of foundational digital assets , aiming for long-term stability and growth within the crypto sphere. The decision to target a $1 billion raise underscores the immense ambition behind this project. It reflects a strong belief in the enduring value and future potential of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. This substantial capital injection could provide significant liquidity and stability to the targeted digital assets, further solidifying their position in the global financial ecosystem. It’s a clear signal that serious capital is increasingly comfortable making substantial bets on the future of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. What is this Crypto Reserve Fund and Why Does it Matter? So, what exactly is a crypto reserve fund , and why is this particular one generating so much buzz? Unlike typical venture capital funds that invest in crypto startups, or hedge funds that engage in active trading strategies, a reserve fund generally aims to hold a basket of assets, often with a focus on stability and long-term accumulation. In this context, the fund is structured to hold a variety of prominent digital assets , including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). The primary purpose of such a fund is multi-faceted: Long-Term Value Accumulation: By holding core digital assets, the fund aims to benefit from the overall growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market over an extended period. Market Stability: A large, well-capitalized reserve fund can contribute to market stability by acting as a significant holder, potentially mitigating some volatility associated with smaller, more speculative trading activities. Institutional Access: It provides a structured and familiar vehicle for traditional institutional investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly managing the complexities of private keys, exchanges, and regulatory nuances. Strategic Deployment: While primarily a reserve, such a fund could also be strategically deployed to support specific ecosystem developments, provide liquidity, or even participate in governance of decentralized protocols, depending on its specific mandate. The creation of a $1 billion crypto reserve fund of this magnitude, backed by such influential figures, could set a new benchmark for how large-scale capital interacts with the crypto market. It represents a more mature and measured approach to crypto investment, moving beyond the initial speculative fervor towards a more strategic, long-term perspective. This shift is crucial for attracting broader institutional crypto investment . Understanding SPAC Fundraising : The Vehicle for Innovation The chosen mechanism for raising this significant capital is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), specifically M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp. But what exactly is SPAC fundraising , and why would this high-profile team opt for this particular route? A SPAC, often dubbed a ‘blank check company,’ is a shell corporation listed on a stock exchange with the sole purpose of acquiring a private company, thereby taking it public without going through a traditional Initial Public Offering (IPO). Here’s a breakdown of why SPACs have become a popular fundraising tool, especially in emerging sectors like crypto: Speed to Market: SPACs generally offer a faster path to public listing compared to a traditional IPO, which can be a lengthy and arduous process involving extensive regulatory scrutiny and roadshows. For a rapidly evolving industry like crypto, speed can be a significant advantage. Access to Capital: SPACs can raise substantial amounts of capital from public investors, providing a powerful fundraising mechanism for companies that might not yet be ready for a conventional IPO due to their stage or industry. Experienced Sponsors: SPACs are typically led by experienced management teams (the ‘sponsors’) who bring expertise and credibility. In this case, the involvement of a Tether co-founder and a former Blackstone executive serves as a strong endorsement for potential investors. Flexibility: The terms of a SPAC merger can be more flexible than an IPO, allowing for tailored deals that suit the specific needs of the target company. However, SPAC fundraising also comes with its own set of considerations. These can include potential dilution for early investors, increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, and the need for careful due diligence. Despite these factors, the choice of a SPAC for this $1 billion crypto reserve fund highlights a strategic decision to leverage a proven, albeit sometimes controversial, method for rapid capital formation and public market access, signaling a serious intent to make a splash in the institutional crypto investment arena. Targeting Key Digital Assets : BTC, ETH, SOL The fund’s strategy focuses on three of the most prominent and influential digital assets : Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). This selection is not arbitrary; it reflects a calculated approach to investing in the foundational layers and leading innovations within the blockchain space. Bitcoin (BTC): As the original and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin is widely regarded as ‘digital gold’ and a store of value. Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and robust network security make it a cornerstone asset for any long-term crypto investment strategy. The fund’s inclusion of BTC underscores a belief in its enduring role as a primary reserve asset in the digital economy. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is the leading smart contract platform, powering the vast majority of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its vibrant developer ecosystem and ongoing evolution (e.g., the transition to Proof-of-Stake with Ethereum 2.0) position it as a critical infrastructure layer for the future of the internet. Investing in ETH is an investment in the programmable money and decentralized web revolution. Solana (SOL): Solana has emerged as a high-performance blockchain known for its exceptional speed and low transaction costs, making it a strong competitor in the layer-1 blockchain space. Its rapid growth in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming has attracted significant developer and user activity. The inclusion of SOL indicates an interest in scalable, high-throughput blockchain solutions that can support mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. By targeting these specific digital assets , the fund aims to capture value from different facets of the crypto market: the established store of value, the dominant smart contract platform, and a leading high-performance alternative. This diversified yet focused approach is designed to optimize for growth while managing risk, making it an attractive proposition for sophisticated investors looking for substantial institutional crypto investment opportunities. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Investment : A Game Changer? This $1 billion crypto reserve fund is more than just another large investment; it’s a powerful indicator of a seismic shift: the accelerating trend of institutional crypto investment . For years, the crypto market was largely driven by retail investors and early adopters. However, in recent times, traditional financial institutions (TradFi) are increasingly recognizing the legitimacy and potential of digital assets. Several factors are contributing to this surge in institutional interest: Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape is slowly becoming clearer, providing a more predictable environment for large financial entities to operate within. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in various jurisdictions, for example, has opened new avenues for institutional capital. Maturing Infrastructure: The development of robust custody solutions, institutional-grade trading platforms, and sophisticated analytics tools has made it safer and more efficient for institutions to engage with crypto assets. Demand from Clients: A growing number of institutional clients, including pension funds, endowments, and family offices, are expressing interest in gaining exposure to cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified portfolio strategy. Macroeconomic Factors: In an era of inflation concerns and geopolitical uncertainty, some institutions view digital assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge or an uncorrelated asset class. The involvement of a Tether co-founder and a former Blackstone executive in this $1 billion SPAC fundraising effort sends a strong signal that top-tier financial talent and capital are now actively building bridges into the crypto space. This influx of institutional capital is critical for the long-term growth and stability of the market. It brings not only significant funding but also professional expertise, governance standards, and a broader network that can help push digital assets further into the mainstream financial system. This development is truly a game changer, legitimizing the asset class and paving the way for unprecedented levels of adoption. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the prospect of a $1 billion crypto reserve fund is exciting, it’s essential to consider both the challenges and the vast opportunities that lie ahead for this ambitious venture and the broader market for digital assets . Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite some progress, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and unpredictable across different jurisdictions. Changes in policy could impact the fund’s operations or the assets it holds. Market Volatility: While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are established, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Significant price swings could impact the fund’s performance and investor confidence. Competition: As institutional crypto investment grows, so too does the competition among various funds and investment vehicles vying for institutional capital. Technological Risks: The underlying blockchain technologies, while robust, are still evolving. Risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities, network attacks, or unforeseen technological shifts could pose challenges. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, negative headlines or market downturns can still impact public and institutional perception of digital assets. Opportunities: Market Maturation: A large, well-managed fund can contribute to the overall maturation and professionalization of the crypto market, attracting more cautious investors. Driving Innovation: The capital and expertise brought by such a fund can indirectly support further innovation within the ecosystems of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, leading to new use cases and increased adoption. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: This initiative serves as a powerful bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, potentially accelerating the integration of blockchain technology into mainstream financial services. Liquidity Provision: A substantial reserve fund can provide significant liquidity to the markets for its target digital assets , benefiting all participants. Setting Standards: The fund’s operational practices and investment strategies could set new benchmarks for responsible and sophisticated institutional crypto investment . The success of this SPAC fundraising effort and the subsequent performance of the crypto reserve fund will undoubtedly be closely watched. It represents a significant test case for large-scale, institutionally-backed ventures in the crypto space, with the potential to unlock immense value and drive the industry forward. Conclusion The news of a Tether co-founder and a former Blackstone executive collaborating to raise $1 billion for a dedicated crypto reserve fund through SPAC fundraising is a landmark event. This ambitious project underscores the growing confidence in digital assets as a legitimate and lucrative asset class, drawing in serious capital and expertise from both the crypto native world and traditional finance. By focusing on foundational assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, this fund is positioning itself at the forefront of the burgeoning trend of institutional crypto investment . While challenges such as regulatory hurdles and market volatility persist, the opportunities for driving market maturity, fostering innovation, and bridging the gap between TradFi and DeFi are immense. This initiative is a clear signal that the future of finance will increasingly incorporate digital assets, moving beyond speculative interest towards strategic, long-term capital allocation. The coming months will reveal the full impact of this bold venture on the global financial landscape.

XRP’s rise remains one of the market’s iconic growth stories—and now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning similar attention. Bitcoin and Solana traders are also closely monitoring Polygon, with all three forming a key part of the smart capital rotation emerging in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE has firmly established itself as one of the year’s most talked-about pre-sale projects, having raised over $10 million and consistently selling out across each phase. The project’s capped 170 billion token supply , HashEx audit , and community-owned structure set it apart from most meme-inspired tokens. Its blend of viral engagement and sound fundamentals—like staking features and VC-free tokenomics—has made it a magnet for traders rotating out of saturated large caps. Analyst sentiment continues to build around the project’s growth trajectory, reinforcing its position as a prime early-stage play. Bitcoin: The Anchor Seeking New Multiples Bitcoin is holding firm above $105,000 , buoyed by institutional flows and long-term investor confidence. Still, many traders are redeploying gains into newer, faster-moving opportunities. For these investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a familiar early-stage profile that aligns with the type of breakout momentum Bitcoin once represented. Solana: Mature Ecosystem, Fresh Opportunities Solana maintains its dominance in NFTs and DeFi infrastructure thanks to an active development community. Yet with its price growth plateauing, many Solana holders are exploring more agile alternatives. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its scarcity appeal and surging engagement, is fast becoming a favored destination for these growth-focused portfolios. Polygon: The Layer-2 Standout Polygon (MATIC) remains a Layer-2 leader with broad utility and a long-term roadmap aimed at scalability. As market competition increases, however, traders seeking sharper near-term moves are branching into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Polygon remains foundational for many, capital is rotating into newer assets with more immediate upside visibility. Conclusion With disciplined execution, transparent governance, and rising market attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining serious momentum. Bitcoin and Solana traders are keeping Polygon on watch—but for early-stage strength and breakout potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning its place in the spotlight.

What The Wave Count Says",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-surge-to-130000/,"After a week of volatile price action, Bitcoin has once again returned to familiar territory around the $106,000 price level. However, on-chain data shows that investors are still cautious, with the crypto Fear & Greed Index now in the neutral zone. On the other hand, technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action on the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows that its price behavior has completed a significant correction, one that’s paving the way for a major rally to $130,000. Bitcoin’s Wave 2 Correction Might Be Complete According to XForceGlobal, a crypto analyst who posted a detailed Elliott Wave chart on the social platform X, Bitcoin’s recent correction fits neatly within a completed WXY pattern. The second wave, which started following the all-time high of $111,814 on May 22 and formed the corrective structure, has now retraced into the expected Fibonacci range between the 23.6% and 38.2% levels. Notably, the ideal minimum target for this correction move was in the $90,000 region, and Bitcoin fulfilled that condition with the pullback to just under $98,200 over the weekend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The most important thing was in preserving the macro wave structure. Instead of drawing out a deeper pullback into the 0.618 to 0.886 Fibonacci levels, which is often characteristic of bear market retracements, the analysis maintains the idea that this was a wave 2 correction within a larger bullish impulse. This distinction is important. If the WXY correction is indeed complete and wave 2 has concluded, the next logical move in the Elliott Wave sequence is a third wave advance. According to Elliott Wave analysis, the third wave is often the most explosive in terms of price expansion. Its outcome could therefore push the price of Bitcoin to new heights that are significantly higher than its most recent all-time high. Why $130,000 Is A Realistic Target For Bitcoin The analyst’s technical projection on Bitcoin’s 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows an expected wave 3 trajectory extending beyond $111,800, with an expansion arrow reaching up above $130,000. This is the expansion move and is based on a similar projection of Wave 1. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Move Is Over? Higher Lows Chart A Course To $115,482 In the accompanying chart, the analyst marks the key pivot zone between $98,000 and $102,000 as the Wave C termination area. If this zone indeed marks the completion of the second wave, the next movement would require validation through the formation of a clear 1-2 structure within Wave 3. This means that confirmation of the bullish count also depends on the price making a new local high above the current range and then pulling back without breaching the recent lows. If that structure plays out, then the market would likely be in the early stages of a powerful third wave. Bitcoin has already made an 8% price gain after it dropped to a low of $98,200 following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The most significant upward move came on Tuesday, June 24, when reports of a Middle East cease-fire pushed Bitcoin up roughly 4%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,330.

In a new strategy session, Kevin Svenson tells his 83,300 YouTube subscribers that he’s keeping a close watch on the OTHERS chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto, excluding the top 10 digital assets and stablecoins. Traders keep an eye on the OTHERS chart to gauge the performance of the altcoin market. According to the crypto strategist, OTHERS appears to be following its 2024 price action, when it went through a corrective period before sparking a parabolic surge toward the end of the year. Svenson predicts that altcoins will stage another explosive rally if Bitcoin and another asset class soar to new record highs. “I’m just showing what’s showing up on the chart. The setup is nearly the same. And this huge run-up when the OTHERS chart went up 140% last time… this happened because Bitcoin and the S&P [500] both broke into a new all-time high at the same time. We saw Bitcoin break a new all-time high recently, but the S&P did not. So if we both get the S&P and Bitcoin to break out to a new all-time high soon, a move like this [November to December 2024] up to $570 billion for OTHERS, the low-cap altcoins, are very likely, in my opinion, that we’re going to get a major pump.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube At time of writing, OTHERS is trading at $233.72 billion.

A legislative earthquake is rumbling through the digital asset landscape, specifically targeting stablecoins. At the epicenter of this seismic shift is the U.S. Senate’s recently passed Genius Act , a bill poised to fundamentally redefine how stablecoins operate. For Tether , the undisputed giant in the stablecoin arena with a staggering $156 billion in circulation, this isn’t just another legislative update; it’s a direct challenge to its very operational model. The implications are profound, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented transparency and compliance that could reshape the entire crypto ecosystem. Unpacking the Genius Act : A New Era for Stablecoins The Genius Act , a name that hints at its ambitious scope, is designed to bring stablecoins firmly within the regulatory purview of U.S. authorities. At its core, the bill introduces stringent requirements aimed at safeguarding financial stability and protecting consumers. It’s a clear signal from lawmakers that the wild west days of crypto are drawing to a close, at least for assets intended to maintain a stable value. The primary provisions of this landmark legislation are straightforward yet powerful: Full Asset Backing: Stablecoin issuers will be mandated to back their tokens 1:1 with highly liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, or U.S. Treasury bills. This moves away from the current, often opaque, mixed-asset backing models prevalent in the market. Annual Audits: Issuers will be required to undergo independent, annual audits of their reserves and financial statements. This provision is critical for enhancing transparency and ensuring that stated reserves genuinely exist and are managed appropriately. U.S. Registration: To operate within the U.S. market, stablecoin issuers must register with relevant U.S. financial authorities. This brings them under direct regulatory oversight, similar to traditional financial institutions. The stated goal, as reported by WSJ, is to integrate stablecoins more fully into mainstream financial use, fostering trust and stability. However, the path to compliance won’t be immediate. The legislation includes a grace period – three years under the Senate version and a more aggressive 18 months under the House proposal – offering issuers time to adapt. This disparity in grace periods highlights the ongoing legislative debate and the urgency with which different factions view the need for reform. The Tether Conundrum: Navigating Stricter Backing Rules No stablecoin issuer stands to be more impacted by the Genius Act than Tether (USDT). For years, Tether has been the dominant force in the stablecoin market, powering a vast portion of crypto trading volume. Its sheer size, with $156 billion in circulation, makes it a systemic player. However, Tether’s operational model has long been a subject of scrutiny, primarily due to its partial asset backing and perceived limited financial transparency. Unlike some competitors, Tether’s reserves have historically included a significant portion of commercial paper, corporate bonds, and other less liquid assets, rather than being exclusively backed by cash or cash equivalents. While Tether has made strides in increasing its cash and Treasury bill holdings, the Genius Act’s strict 1:1 full backing requirement will necessitate a fundamental overhaul of its reserve management strategy. Furthermore, its current practice of providing attestations, rather than full, independent audits, falls short of the rigorous auditing standards proposed by the bill. This legislative pressure forces Tether to choose: either dramatically transform its operations to meet U.S. standards, or risk being marginalized in one of the world’s largest and most influential financial markets. The stakes are incredibly high, not just for Tether, but for the entire ecosystem that relies on its liquidity and stability. Revolutionizing Stablecoin Regulation : What Does It Mean? The Genius Act represents a pivotal moment for stablecoin regulation , setting a precedent that could ripple across the globe. This isn’t just about one company; it’s about defining the future of digital money. The push for full backing and transparency aims to prevent scenarios reminiscent of the Terra/Luna collapse, where a stablecoin’s de-pegging sent shockwaves through the entire crypto market. By ensuring that every stablecoin unit is genuinely backed by tangible, easily verifiable assets, the legislation seeks to instill confidence and mitigate systemic risk. Consider the potential shifts: Increased Trust: Users and institutional investors will have greater assurance that their stablecoins are truly stable, fostering wider adoption. Competitive Landscape: Stablecoins that already adhere to stricter backing standards, like USDC, might find themselves in a more favorable position, potentially gaining market share from those forced to adapt. Market Consolidation: Smaller, less compliant stablecoin issuers may struggle to meet the new requirements, leading to market consolidation around larger, more robust players. Enhanced Financial Stability: The integration of stablecoins into the traditional financial system will be smoother and safer, reducing risks of contagion. This regulatory push is a double-edged sword. While it promises greater stability and legitimacy, it also poses significant operational and financial challenges for issuers, potentially stifling innovation for some. The debate will continue to rage over striking the right balance between regulation and fostering growth. Enhancing Crypto Compliance : The Road Ahead for Digital Assets The Genius Act is more than just a stablecoin bill; it’s a significant step towards a comprehensive framework for crypto compliance across the broader digital asset landscape. Lawmakers and regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing cryptocurrencies, driven by concerns over consumer protection, financial stability, anti-money laundering (AML), and illicit financing. This bill signals a maturing approach to digital assets, moving beyond initial skepticism to a phase of structured integration. Key elements of enhanced crypto compliance include: Know Your Customer (KYC) & AML: Stricter requirements for identifying users and monitoring transactions to combat financial crime. Data Reporting: More comprehensive reporting of financial data to regulatory bodies. Operational Resilience: Requirements for robust cybersecurity measures and operational safeguards to protect assets and systems. Consumer Protection: Mandates around disclosures, dispute resolution mechanisms, and safeguarding customer funds. The implications extend beyond stablecoins, setting a precedent for how other types of digital assets might be regulated in the future. Exchanges, DeFi protocols, and even NFT platforms could eventually face similar calls for greater transparency and oversight. The industry must prepare for a future where compliance is not an afterthought but a core operational pillar. Shaping Future Digital Asset Laws : Beyond Stablecoins The passage of the Genius Act is a strong indicator of the evolving landscape of digital asset laws . It underscores a growing consensus among policymakers that digital assets, particularly those designed to function as money, cannot operate outside the existing financial regulatory framework indefinitely. This bill could serve as a blueprint for future legislation addressing other facets of the crypto economy, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to tokenized securities. The U.S. is positioning itself to be a leader in establishing clear rules for the digital economy, aiming to foster innovation within a regulated environment. This approach contrasts with some jurisdictions that have adopted outright bans or highly restrictive measures. The goal is to harness the potential of blockchain technology while mitigating its inherent risks. What might this mean for the future? Clearer Definitions: We might see more precise legal definitions for various types of digital assets (e.g., utility tokens, security tokens, payment tokens). Interoperability with TradFi: Regulations could facilitate greater integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Global Harmonization: As major economies like the U.S. establish frameworks, there could be a push for greater global harmonization of crypto regulations. The Genius Act is not just a reaction to past issues but a proactive step towards building a more stable and trustworthy digital financial system. It signals a maturation of the crypto industry, where innovation will increasingly need to coexist with robust regulatory oversight. Benefits and Challenges of the New Regulatory Landscape This regulatory shift brings both promising benefits and considerable challenges: Benefits: Enhanced Trust and Credibility: Clear rules build confidence for retail investors and attract institutional capital, legitimizing the crypto market. Reduced Systemic Risk: Full backing and audits mitigate the risk of stablecoin de-pegs causing wider market instability. Mainstream Adoption: Regulatory clarity can pave the way for stablecoins to be used more widely in everyday transactions and traditional financial services. Investor Protection: Stronger oversight protects consumers from fraudulent schemes and mismanagement of funds. Challenges: Operational Burden: Compliance with new rules, especially for auditing and reserve management, will be costly and complex for issuers. Innovation Stifling: Overly strict regulations could stifle innovation or push projects to more lenient jurisdictions. Market Shifts: Companies unable or unwilling to comply may exit the U.S. market, potentially impacting liquidity and choice. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S.-based companies might face higher compliance costs compared to international competitors in less regulated environments. What’s Next? Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For stablecoin issuers, the message is clear: adapt or face significant hurdles. Proactive engagement with regulators, strengthening reserve management practices, and investing in robust compliance frameworks will be paramount. For users, this could mean greater security and reliability when using stablecoins, but also potentially fewer options or higher transaction costs if the market consolidates. The legislative process is ongoing, with the House and Senate versions needing reconciliation. However, the intent is clear: stablecoins are moving towards a more regulated future. The industry must prepare for a landscape where transparency, accountability, and consumer protection are not just buzzwords, but legal requirements. A Future Defined by Clarity and Confidence The Genius Act marks an undeniable turning point for stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency industry. While posing an immediate and significant challenge for market leaders like Tether , it also lays the groundwork for a more mature, stable, and trustworthy digital financial system. By demanding full asset backing, rigorous audits, and U.S. registration, the legislation aims to bring much-needed clarity and confidence to a sector often criticized for its opacity. This push for robust stablecoin regulation and enhanced crypto compliance will undoubtedly shape the future of digital asset laws , ensuring that innovation can thrive within a framework of accountability and consumer protection. The journey ahead for stablecoins is one of transformation, promising a future where digital money is not just innovative, but also inherently secure and reliable.

With a criminal trial scheduled for January 2026 in the Southern District Court of New York, the stakes are incredibly high. However, a recent development suggests that the landscape of this monumental case might be on the brink of a significant shift. Reports indicate that the ‘Genius Act,’ a legislative proposal aimed at shaping stablecoin regulation , could profoundly impact the securities fraud charges leveled against Kwon. This potential interplay between a high-profile criminal case and emerging cryptocurrency legislation has the entire digital asset community buzzing with anticipation. Understanding the ‘Genius Act’: A Game-Changer for Stablecoin Regulation ? To truly grasp the potential ramifications for the Do Kwon trial , it’s essential to understand what the ‘Genius Act’ entails. This bill, still making its way through legislative channels, is designed to bring much-needed clarity and oversight to the burgeoning stablecoin market. Its provisions are comprehensive, addressing several critical areas that have been points of contention and concern for regulators globally. Licensing Requirements: The Act proposes mandatory licensing for stablecoin issuers, aiming to ensure that entities handling significant financial operations are properly vetted and authorized. 100% Reserve Backing: A cornerstone of the bill is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to secure 100% of their reserves. This addresses a key vulnerability seen in past stablecoin incidents, aiming to prevent scenarios where a stablecoin loses its peg due to insufficient backing. Annual Audit Requirements: For larger issuers, specifically those with a market capitalization of $50 billion or more, the ‘Genius Act’ mandates annual audits. This provision seeks to enhance transparency and accountability, providing greater assurance to investors and the broader financial system. Regulation on Overseas Issuers: Recognizing the global nature of the crypto market, the bill extends its regulatory reach to overseas issuers, ensuring a more level playing field and preventing regulatory arbitrage. Legal Definitions for Algorithmic Stablecoins: Crucially, the ‘Genius Act’ includes specific legal definitions and application standards for algorithmic stablecoins, such as the ill-fated TerraUSD (UST). This is particularly relevant given the circumstances surrounding the TerraUSD collapse . The very existence of such detailed definitions for algorithmic stablecoins could be a pivotal factor in how existing charges, particularly those related to securities fraud, are interpreted or even altered in a court of law. The High Stakes of the Do Kwon Trial : Charges and Extradition Do Kwon’s journey to a U.S. courtroom has been a long and winding one, marked by international intrigue and significant legal hurdles. He was apprehended in Montenegro in March 2023 on charges of passport forgery. Following his arrest, the United States pursued his extradition, culminating in him being handed over to U.S. authorities. Upon his arrival, Kwon was immediately charged with a staggering nine felonies, reflecting the gravity of the accusations against him. These charges include: Securities fraud Market manipulation Wire fraud Conspiracy to defraud Money laundering Currently held without bail, Kwon faces a formidable legal battle. The securities fraud charge, in particular, is central to the prosecution’s case, asserting that certain assets within the Terraform Labs ecosystem were unregistered securities and that Kwon misled investors about their stability and value. The scheduled trial date of January 2026 provides ample time for legal maneuvers, and the mention of the ‘Genius Act’ by Judge Paul Engelmayer during a pretrial conference highlights a new, unexpected dimension to these proceedings. How the ‘Genius Act’ Could Reshape the Do Kwon Trial The judge’s acknowledgment of the ‘Genius Act’ is not merely a passing comment; it signals a recognition of how evolving legislation can intersect with ongoing criminal cases. Inner City Press reported that Judge Engelmayer explicitly stated his mindfulness of the bill and its potential to impact Do Kwon’s securities fraud charges. But how exactly could a stablecoin bill influence a pre-existing criminal indictment? The primary impact could stem from the Act’s definitions and classifications of digital assets, especially algorithmic stablecoins like TerraUSD (UST). If the ‘Genius Act’ were to be enacted before or during the trial, its legal definitions could potentially: Reclassify Assets: The Act’s precise definitions might clarify whether TerraUSD (UST) or other tokens associated with Terraform Labs fall under the category of a security. If a new law explicitly defines certain assets in a way that contradicts the prosecution’s current classification, it could weaken their argument. Impact Intent: Legal definitions can influence the element of intent. If a defendant can argue that at the time of the alleged offenses, there was no clear legal framework classifying their assets as securities, it could complicate the prosecution’s ability to prove fraudulent intent. Set Precedent: Even if not directly applied retroactively, the legislative intent and new legal standards established by the ‘Genius Act’ could inform judicial interpretation of existing laws in the context of digital assets. This situation presents a complex challenge for both the prosecution and defense. For the prosecution, it means potentially having to adapt their arguments to a changing legal landscape. For the defense, it opens new avenues for challenging the charges, particularly those related to securities fraud, which rely heavily on the classification of the assets involved. The outcome could range from a re-evaluation of specific charges to a fundamental shift in the trial’s focus, making this one of the most intriguing crypto legal challenges to watch. Beyond TerraUSD Collapse : Broader Implications for Crypto The specter of the TerraUSD collapse in May 2022 sent shockwaves through the entire cryptocurrency market, wiping out billions in investor wealth and triggering a cascade of bankruptcies. This catastrophic event served as a stark reminder of the regulatory void in the digital asset space and significantly accelerated calls for comprehensive stablecoin regulation . The ‘Genius Act’ is a direct response to such incidents, aiming to prevent future collapses by imposing stricter controls and transparency requirements. The interaction between this legislative effort and the Do Kwon trial extends beyond just the specifics of his case. It underscores a broader trend: the increasing convergence of traditional legal frameworks with the novel complexities of cryptocurrency. This trial, influenced by potential new laws, could set critical precedents for how digital assets are classified and regulated in the future. It highlights the urgent need for regulatory clarity that balances innovation with investor protection. The crypto industry is at a pivotal juncture, grappling with the aftermath of past failures while striving for mainstream adoption. The outcome of the Do Kwon trial , particularly its interaction with legislative developments like the ‘Genius Act,’ will undoubtedly shape future regulatory approaches and influence how future crypto legal challenges are navigated. It serves as a powerful reminder that the legal and regulatory environment for digital assets is rapidly evolving, demanding constant vigilance and adaptation from all market participants. A Crucial Turning Point for Crypto Justice The upcoming Do Kwon trial is already a landmark case, but the potential influence of the ‘Genius Act’ adds an extraordinary layer of complexity and significance. Judge Engelmayer’s acknowledgment of the bill’s relevance suggests that the legal system is actively grappling with how to apply existing laws to a rapidly evolving technological landscape, especially concerning stablecoin regulation . The outcome of this interplay could redefine the legal classification of digital assets, impacting not just Do Kwon’s fate but also setting a powerful precedent for future crypto legal challenges arising from events like the TerraUSD collapse . As the crypto world watches, this case serves as a crucial barometer for the future of digital asset oversight.

This revelation, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, suggests that the U.S. government might be quietly building a significant reserve of the world’s leading digital asset. If true, this marks a pivotal moment, signaling a profound shift in how the nation views and potentially integrates cryptocurrencies into its broader financial and strategic framework. Understanding the Bitcoin Accumulation Plan: What Does it Mean? The report from Watcher Guru on X was concise yet impactful: a U.S. White House official stated that the government has an “accumulation plan” to purchase Bitcoin. This single sentence has ignited widespread speculation and discussion across financial markets and the crypto community. An “accumulation plan” typically implies a systematic and long-term strategy to acquire assets, rather than a one-off purchase. While details remain scarce and official confirmation is pending, the very notion of the U.S. government engaging in a Bitcoin accumulation plan suggests a significant departure from previous, often cautious, stances on cryptocurrencies. It raises questions about the motivations behind such a strategy and its potential implications for both national policy and the global financial landscape. Is this a move towards a strategic reserve, a hedge against economic instability, or perhaps a proactive step in the evolving digital economy? Why the US Government Bitcoin Interest? Exploring Potential Motivations The idea of the US government Bitcoin holdings might seem counterintuitive to some, given past regulatory scrutiny and skepticism. However, several compelling reasons could underpin such a strategic shift: Strategic Asset Diversification: Just as nations hold gold and foreign currencies as reserves, Bitcoin could be viewed as a modern, digital alternative for diversifying national assets, especially in an era of unprecedented fiat currency printing and inflation concerns. National Security & Seized Assets: Governments often seize cryptocurrencies from illicit activities. Instead of immediately liquidating these assets, a strategic accumulation plan could involve holding them, or even actively purchasing more, for various national interests. Maintaining Global Financial Leadership: As other nations and blocs explore digital currencies and blockchain technology, the U.S. might feel compelled to actively participate in the digital asset space to maintain its competitive edge and influence in the global financial system. Hedge Against Future Economic Shocks: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive asset for some as a hedge against inflation or geopolitical instability, potentially offering a new layer of resilience to national treasuries. The potential for the US government Bitcoin strategy reflects a growing recognition of digital assets as legitimate, and potentially vital, components of a nation’s economic and strategic arsenal. How Will This Impact Crypto Policy US? A confirmed crypto policy US shift towards Bitcoin accumulation would undoubtedly reshape the regulatory environment. For years, the focus has been on consumer protection, anti-money laundering, and taxation. An active accumulation strategy would imply a deeper, more integrated understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies at the highest levels of government. Such a policy could lead to: More Defined Regulatory Frameworks: A clear government stake in Bitcoin might accelerate the development of comprehensive and clearer regulations, providing more certainty for businesses and investors. Increased Legitimacy: Government adoption, even in an accumulation phase, would lend immense credibility to Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, potentially encouraging wider institutional and retail adoption. Influence on CBDC Discussions: While the U.S. is exploring a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a Bitcoin accumulation strategy could run in parallel, showcasing a multi-pronged approach to digital finance rather than a singular focus on government-issued digital money. This potential evolution in crypto policy US could transform the nation into a more active participant in the digital asset revolution, rather than primarily a regulator. What Does This Mean for the Broader Digital Asset Strategy? If the White House is indeed planning Bitcoin accumulation, it speaks volumes about a larger, evolving digital asset strategy . This isn’t just about one cryptocurrency; it’s about acknowledging the fundamental shift towards a digitized global economy. Such a move could signify: Broader Acceptance of Digital Assets: A government holding Bitcoin could pave the way for recognizing other digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles or strategic resources. Innovation and Investment Boost: A more favorable governmental stance could attract significant capital and talent into the U.S. crypto sector, fostering innovation in blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi). Global Competition: As nations like China push their digital currencies and others like El Salvador embrace Bitcoin, the U.S. might be positioning itself to lead, rather than follow, in the race for digital financial supremacy. This proactive digital asset strategy could redefine the U.S.’s role in the future of finance, moving from a cautious observer to a key player in the digital economy. Analyzing the Bitcoin Market Impact: What to Expect? The mere rumor of a U.S. government Bitcoin market impact is enough to send ripples through the crypto space. Should an official confirmation emerge, the implications would be profound: Price Surge Potential: Significant, consistent buying pressure from a sovereign entity like the U.S. government could lead to substantial price appreciation for Bitcoin, given its finite supply. Increased Liquidity: While accumulation might initially reduce circulating supply, the increased institutional interest and market depth spurred by government involvement could ultimately enhance liquidity. Enhanced Legitimacy and Trust: A government endorsement through accumulation would significantly boost Bitcoin’s legitimacy, potentially attracting new classes of investors and reducing perceived risks. Shift in Narrative: Bitcoin could transition further from a speculative asset to a recognized strategic reserve asset, akin to gold, fundamentally altering its market narrative. The potential Bitcoin market impact of such a plan cannot be overstated. It would likely be one of the most significant catalysts in Bitcoin’s history, solidifying its position in the global financial architecture. Challenges and Caveats: A Closer Look While the prospect of a U.S. Bitcoin accumulation plan is exciting, it’s crucial to approach this news with a balanced perspective. Several challenges and caveats need to be considered: Unconfirmed Source: The statement originated from a report by Watcher Guru on X, citing an unnamed White House official. Official confirmation from the White House or Treasury Department is paramount before drawing definitive conclusions. Logistical Hurdles: Acquiring significant amounts of Bitcoin discreetly and securely would present considerable logistical and operational challenges for any government, given Bitcoin’s transparency and market depth. Political Divisiveness: Cryptocurrency remains a politically charged topic. Any official move to accumulate Bitcoin could face significant pushback from various political factions, potentially leading to policy reversals or delays. Security Concerns: Holding vast amounts of a digital asset like Bitcoin necessitates robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks or theft, a considerable undertaking for a government entity. Until official statements are made, the news remains speculative, albeit highly impactful. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast For those invested in or interested in the crypto space, this news, whether confirmed or not, highlights several key takeaways: Stay Informed: Monitor official government announcements, reputable financial news outlets, and expert analyses closely. Understand the Macro Picture: Recognize that Bitcoin’s trajectory is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors, geopolitical strategies, and national policies, not just technological developments. Prepare for Volatility: News of this magnitude can lead to significant market fluctuations. Exercise caution and consider your risk tolerance. Long-Term Vision: Such developments underscore the growing institutional and governmental recognition of digital assets, reinforcing a long-term bullish outlook for the sector. Conclusion: A Potential Game-Changer for Bitcoin The report of a U.S. White House official indicating a Bitcoin accumulation plan is more than just a fleeting headline; it represents a potential paradigm shift in global finance and national strategy. While awaiting official confirmation, the mere discussion of such a plan elevates Bitcoin’s status from a niche digital currency to a potential strategic national asset. It signals a future where digital assets play an undeniable role in economic policy, national security, and international relations. Should this plan materialize, it would not only validate Bitcoin’s revolutionary potential but also usher in an unprecedented era of governmental engagement with the decentralized digital economy, marking a truly monumental moment for the crypto world.

Bitcoin’s rise from under a dollar to tens of thousands remains the ultimate benchmark for early-stage investing. Ethereum followed, launching under $1 before peaking near $3,000. These success stories continue to shape how investors evaluate new altcoins — and in 2025, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could follow a similar trajectory. As Ethereum and Bitcoin mature, investors are increasingly looking for the next project that could replicate that kind of asymmetric upside — and the attention is shifting to tokens with strong fundamentals but early positioning. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Asymmetric Opportunity of the Year MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for its rare mix of transparency, structure, and hype. With a fixed 170 billion token supply, fully audited contracts, and a VC-free, community-first model, the project is being embraced by analysts as one of the most promising altcoins of the year . Its ongoing early-stage traction is fueling bold forecasts an ROI seasoned upside by 2025. What’s more, the community has rallied behind a limited-time access bonus: PATRIOTS100X . This entry offer is pushing demand as buyers move quickly to secure a stake before the next update or listing trigger sends waves through the market. Injective Protocol Traders Are Entering Early Injective Protocol (INJ) has been one of 2025’s standout performers, particularly with the news of a potential staked ETF and rising total value locked across its ecosystem. However, seasoned Injective holders — often known for rotating capital at opportune moments — are now exploring early momentum plays. And according to on-chain data, many of them are quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE. The move isn’t random. INJ traders have historically favored tokens with strong community energy paired with technical credibility. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s capped supply and live staking feature, it’s checking all the boxes for this savvy investor class. Final Thoughts: Could History Repeat? The stories of Bitcoin and Ethereum were once viewed as once-in-a-lifetime. But analysts now argue that MAGACOIN FINANCE has the same DNA — early-stage access, locked tokenomics, strong community, and a growing staking ecosystem.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Kalshi secured an astounding $185 million in Series C funding, propelling its valuation to an impressive $2 billion. This significant Kalshi Funding round, led by crypto-native venture capital giant Paradigm, with strong participation from industry heavyweights like Sequoia, Multicoin, and Bond Capital, signals a transformative moment for the prediction market landscape and broader financial technology. Kalshi Funding: A Landmark Achievement for Financial Innovation The recent Kalshi Funding announcement is more than just a financial milestone; it is a powerful endorsement of a new paradigm in how we perceive and interact with future events. Reaching a $2 billion valuation underscores investor confidence in Kalshi’s unique, regulated approach to event contracts. This substantial capital infusion positions Kalshi to significantly expand its operations, enhance its platform, and solidify its standing as a leader in the prediction market space. What makes this particular funding round so compelling is not just the sheer amount, but the caliber and diverse nature of the investors, hinting at a strategic bridge between traditional finance and the innovative spirit of the digital asset world. What is a Prediction Market and Why Kalshi Stands Out? At its core, a prediction market is an exchange where participants trade contracts whose payoffs are tied to the outcome of future events. Think of it as a stock market for information and foresight. Instead of trading shares of a company, you’re trading shares of whether a specific event will happen or not. The price of these contracts then reflects the market’s collective probability of that event occurring. While prediction markets have existed in various forms, Kalshi distinguishes itself through its regulatory compliance. Unlike many decentralized or unregulated platforms, Kalshi operates under the direct oversight of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This regulatory clarity is a game-changer, providing a level of legitimacy and security that attracts institutional investors and mainstream users who might otherwise be wary. Kalshi allows users to trade on a vast array of verifiable future events, from economic indicators and political outcomes to weather patterns and technological advancements. This unique position as a regulated entity offering event contracts is a key factor in its rapid ascent and significant valuation. The Power of Event Contracts: Redefining Risk and Opportunity Kalshi’s platform revolves around event contracts, which are binary options that pay out a fixed amount if a specific event occurs and nothing if it does not. These contracts offer a fascinating new way to engage with the future. Here’s how they redefine risk and opportunity: Information Aggregation: Event contracts serve as powerful tools for aggregating dispersed information. The market price of a contract reflects the collective wisdom of all participants, often providing more accurate forecasts than traditional polling or expert opinions. Hedging and Risk Management: Businesses and individuals can use event contracts to hedge against specific risks. For example, a company reliant on a particular commodity price might buy contracts predicting its rise or fall to offset potential losses in their primary business. Speculation and Investment: For investors, event contracts offer a novel avenue for speculation on macro-economic trends, geopolitical events, or industry-specific developments. They provide a direct way to profit from accurate foresight. Transparency and Liquidity: Operating as a regulated exchange, Kalshi ensures transparency in pricing and robust liquidity, allowing users to enter and exit positions efficiently. The applications are vast. Imagine hedging against a sudden interest rate hike, speculating on the success of a new technology, or even gaining insights into consumer sentiment regarding a product launch. Kalshi’s regulated framework opens these possibilities to a wider audience, moving prediction markets from the fringes to a more central role in financial strategy. Understanding the Series C Investment and its Strategic Implications The $185 million Series C Investment is a clear signal that top-tier investors see immense value and growth potential in Kalshi. Let’s look at the key players in this round: Investor Significance / Focus Paradigm A leading crypto-focused venture capital firm; its involvement signifies a strong bridge between traditional finance and Web3 innovation, recognizing Kalshi’s potential to disrupt established markets. Sequoia Capital A renowned, long-standing venture capital firm with a track record of investing in highly successful tech companies (e.g., Apple, Google, PayPal); lends significant mainstream credibility and strategic guidance. Multicoin Capital Another prominent crypto-native investment firm; reinforces the strategic alignment with the future of decentralized and innovative finance, and the potential for these markets to evolve. Bond Capital A growth equity firm founded by legendary analyst Mary Meeker; focuses on innovative companies with significant market potential, highlighting Kalshi’s scalability and broad appeal. The strategic implications of this Series C Investment are profound. The capital will likely be deployed to: Product Development: Expanding the types of event contracts offered and improving the user experience. Market Expansion: Reaching new user demographics and potentially exploring international markets, where regulatory landscapes allow. Regulatory Compliance: Further strengthening its robust compliance framework, which is crucial for long-term growth and institutional adoption. Talent Acquisition: Hiring top-tier engineers, market makers, and legal experts to drive innovation and maintain market leadership. This funding round is not just about money; it’s about validating a new asset class and a new way of interacting with financial markets. The Role of Crypto Venture Capital in Mainstream Finance The participation of firms like Paradigm and Multicoin Capital in a regulated, non-blockchain-native platform like Kalshi highlights a fascinating trend: the increasing influence of crypto venture capital beyond the confines of purely decentralized projects. These firms, known for their foresight in the digital asset space, are now actively investing in companies that bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and the innovative principles often found in Web3. Why would crypto venture capital firms invest in a CFTC-regulated prediction market? The answer lies in the shared ethos of transparency, efficiency, and disintermediation. While Kalshi isn’t built on a blockchain, its mission to create transparent, liquid markets for information aligns perfectly with the goals of many crypto projects. These investments suggest a growing recognition that innovation doesn’t always have to be decentralized to be transformative. Instead, it can leverage existing regulatory frameworks to achieve broader adoption and impact. This trend could lead to a future where crypto-native capital fuels a wider range of fintech innovations, fostering a more interconnected and dynamic financial ecosystem. It demonstrates a maturity in the venture capital landscape, where the best ideas, regardless of their underlying technology, attract the most strategic capital. Kalshi’s Vision: Paving the Way for Future Financial Innovation With this monumental Kalshi Funding, the company is poised to redefine how individuals and institutions approach forecasting and risk. Kalshi’s commitment to regulatory compliance sets a precedent, showing that innovative financial instruments can thrive within established legal frameworks. Their vision extends beyond simple speculation; they aim to create a global marketplace for verifiable outcomes, offering invaluable insights for businesses, policymakers, and researchers. The implications for financial markets are significant. As event contracts become more sophisticated and widely adopted, they could complement or even challenge traditional derivatives markets by offering more direct and transparent ways to trade on specific events. For data scientists and analysts, Kalshi’s markets could become a rich source of real-time, aggregated probabilities, offering a unique lens through which to view future trends. Conclusion: A New Era for Prediction Markets Kalshi’s impressive $185 million Series C Investment and its $2 billion valuation mark a pivotal moment for the prediction market industry. Led by influential crypto venture capital and traditional powerhouses, this funding round validates Kalshi’s regulated approach to event contracts and its potential to revolutionize financial forecasting. By bridging the gap between innovative financial instruments and established regulatory frameworks, Kalshi is not just building a platform; it is shaping the future of how we collectively anticipate and act upon the world’s unfolding events. This is more than just a funding round; it’s a powerful statement about the growing maturity and mainstream acceptance of prediction markets as a legitimate and valuable component of the global financial landscape. The journey ahead for this pioneering prediction market promises to be fascinating, as it continues to unlock new possibilities for information, hedging, and investment.

SoFi, a prominent personal finance company, is making a significant splash in the digital asset space, announcing not only the reintroduction of its SoFi crypto trading services but also an ambitious venture into international money transfers powered by blockchain technology. This isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about reshaping how we think about global finance. For anyone following the evolution of financial services, this move by SoFi signals a powerful convergence of traditional banking and the decentralized future. What’s Driving SoFi’s Crypto Trading Relaunch? SoFi’s decision to re-enter the crypto arena isn’t a whimsical one. It’s a calculated move reflecting a maturing regulatory environment and increasing consumer demand for digital assets. Initially, SoFi users will gain the ability to buy and hold major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). But that’s just the beginning. The company has hinted at an expanded suite of offerings, including exciting possibilities like crypto staking and even crypto-backed borrowing. Imagine using your digital assets not just as an investment, but as collateral for loans – that’s the kind of financial flexibility SoFi aims to unlock. This expansion comes at a time when more traditional financial institutions are exploring or adopting crypto. What makes SoFi’s approach compelling is its existing user base and its integrated financial platform. For many, SoFi is already their go-to for banking, loans, and investments. Adding robust crypto trading directly into this ecosystem creates a seamless experience, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for millions who might be curious about crypto but hesitant to use dedicated crypto exchanges. Revolutionizing Transfers with Blockchain Remittances Beyond simple trading, perhaps the most groundbreaking aspect of SoFi’s announcement is its foray into international remittances using stablecoins and blockchain networks. For years, sending money across borders has been a slow, expensive, and often opaque process. Traditional remittance services typically involve multiple intermediaries, leading to high fees, unfavorable exchange rates, and delays that can stretch for days. SoFi aims to disrupt this model by leveraging the inherent advantages of blockchain technology: Speed: Transactions on blockchain networks can settle in minutes or even seconds, rather than days. Cost-Efficiency: By reducing the number of intermediaries, transaction fees can be significantly lower. Transparency: Blockchain ledgers offer an immutable and verifiable record of transactions. Accessibility: Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer the stability of traditional money with the transfer benefits of crypto. Consider the impact on migrant workers sending money home, or businesses conducting international trade. Faster, cheaper, and more reliable transfers can have a profound positive effect on economies and individual livelihoods. This strategic focus on blockchain remittances positions SoFi at the forefront of financial innovation. How Will Stablecoin Transfers Work? The core of SoFi’s remittance service will rely on stablecoin transfers . Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, usually by being pegged 1:1 to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This eliminates the price fluctuation risk typically associated with crypto, making them ideal for transfers and payments. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it might function: A SoFi user initiates an international transfer, specifying the amount in their local currency. SoFi converts the fiat currency into a stablecoin (e.g., USDC or USDT) on a chosen blockchain network. The stablecoin is quickly sent across the blockchain to the recipient’s designated wallet or a local partner. The recipient can then convert the stablecoin back into their local fiat currency through SoFi’s network or a partner, often with significantly lower fees and faster processing times than traditional methods. This innovative approach could redefine the landscape of global money movement, offering a powerful alternative to legacy systems. Navigating the Regulatory Tides: The Role of OCC Guidance SoFi’s confident stride back into crypto isn’t happening in a vacuum. It follows significant shifts in the regulatory landscape, particularly under the Trump administration, which saw a more open stance towards digital assets. Crucially, new guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has played a pivotal role. The OCC guidance has provided much-needed clarity for federally chartered banks and savings associations, explicitly stating that they can engage in certain cryptocurrency-related activities. This includes holding stablecoin reserves, facilitating crypto transactions, and even providing custody services for digital assets. Such guidance from a key banking regulator has legitimized crypto operations for traditional financial institutions, reducing regulatory uncertainty and paving the way for players like SoFi to innovate with greater confidence. This regulatory clarity is a massive boon for the entire crypto ecosystem. It encourages more institutional participation, which in turn can lead to greater liquidity, better infrastructure, and enhanced security for users. SoFi’s move is a direct reflection of this evolving regulatory environment, demonstrating that financial innovation can thrive when clear guidelines are established. The Future is Here: Benefits and Challenges Ahead SoFi’s re-entry into crypto and its push for blockchain remittances heralds a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into everyday financial lives. The benefits are clear: Enhanced User Experience: A single platform for traditional banking, investments, and crypto. Financial Inclusion: Lower-cost remittances can empower individuals in developing nations. Innovation Catalyst: SoFi’s move could inspire other traditional finance players to accelerate their crypto adoption. Global Connectivity: Faster, cheaper international transfers foster greater economic integration. However, challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving globally, and SoFi will need to navigate diverse legal landscapes for its remittance services. Market volatility, while mitigated by stablecoins for transfers, remains a factor for direct crypto holdings. User education will also be key to ensure widespread adoption and understanding of these new financial tools. Comparison: Traditional vs. Blockchain Remittances Feature Traditional Remittances Blockchain Remittances (SoFi) Transaction Speed Typically 1-5 business days Minutes to hours Cost/Fees High, often percentage-based + hidden fees Significantly lower, transparent network fees Transparency Limited tracking, often requires inquiries Publicly verifiable on blockchain ledger Exchange Rates Often marked up, less favorable More competitive, near real-time rates Accessibility Requires bank accounts or physical agents Internet connection and digital wallet/app A Glimpse into SoFi’s Strategic Vision SoFi’s comprehensive strategy indicates a clear vision: to be a one-stop shop for all personal finance needs, bridging the gap between traditional banking and the burgeoning digital economy. By integrating SoFi crypto services and pioneering blockchain remittances, they are not just offering new products; they are building a more connected, efficient, and accessible financial future for their members. This move is a testament to the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets and the transformative power of blockchain technology. As regulatory environments continue to mature, we can expect more financial institutions to follow SoFi’s lead, further accelerating the adoption of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance solutions globally. For consumers, this means more choices, lower costs, and greater control over their money.

Just when you thought the dust was settling on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a new contender has stepped into the ring, signaling a monumental shift in how traditional finance views cryptocurrencies. We’re talking about the recent filing by financial giants Invesco and Galaxy Digital for a Solana ETF . This move isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful indicator of Solana’s growing legitimacy and the broader mainstream adoption of digital assets. The Latest Wave: Invesco Galaxy Joins the Solana ETF Race In a significant development that has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, Invesco and Galaxy Digital have officially filed a registration statement (S-1) for the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This pivotal filing was reported by Bloomberg ETF Analyst James Seyffart via X, confirming the increasing institutional interest in Solana (SOL). This isn’t an isolated incident; Invesco and Galaxy Digital are now the ninth issuers to apply for a Solana exchange-traded fund, highlighting a clear trend towards diversifying crypto investment vehicles beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, what exactly does an S-1 filing mean? It’s the initial registration form required by the SEC for new securities. Think of it as a formal declaration of intent, outlining the proposed ETF’s structure, objectives, risks, and fees. For investors, the emergence of a Solana ETF from reputable firms like Invesco and Galaxy Digital could simplify access to SOL, removing the complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases and storage. Why Solana? Understanding the Appeal for Digital Assets With so many cryptocurrencies available, why is Solana attracting such significant attention from institutional players? Solana has carved out a unique niche in the blockchain landscape, distinguishing itself with several key features: Blazing Fast Transactions: Solana boasts incredibly high transaction speeds, capable of processing tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS), far surpassing many legacy blockchains. This speed makes it ideal for high-frequency applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming. Low Transaction Costs: Fees on the Solana network are notoriously low, making it an attractive option for developers and users alike who want to avoid the high gas fees sometimes seen on other networks. Scalability: Solana’s innovative architecture, including its Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, allows it to scale effectively without compromising decentralization or security. This scalability is crucial for supporting a burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Vibrant Ecosystem: Solana has fostered a rapidly growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and Web3 applications, attracting a diverse community of developers and users. These attributes make Solana a compelling candidate for an ETF, offering a gateway to a high-performance blockchain network that is increasingly central to the future of digital assets . Navigating the Path to SEC Approval: Challenges and Prospects The journey for any cryptocurrency ETF to gain SEC approval is often fraught with challenges, and a Solana ETF is no exception. The SEC’s primary concerns revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. While the SEC has historically been cautious, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, and more recently spot Ethereum ETFs, has set a precedent. Key factors the SEC considers include: Market Surveillance Agreements: The ability of exchanges listing the ETF to enter into surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size related to the underlying asset. Liquidity and Price Discovery: Ensuring there’s sufficient liquidity in the underlying asset’s market to prevent manipulation and ensure fair price discovery. Investor Protection: Adequacy of disclosures and safeguards for investors. For Solana, the path to approval will likely hinge on similar criteria. The growing number of applicants, including the notable Invesco Galaxy partnership, suggests increasing confidence that these regulatory hurdles can be overcome. Each new filing adds pressure and provides more data for the SEC to consider, potentially paving the way for a new era of regulated crypto investment products. Unlocking New Frontiers for Crypto Investment The potential approval of a Solana ETF could unlock significant new avenues for crypto investment . For years, investing in cryptocurrencies directly has presented various barriers for traditional investors, including: Custody Concerns: The complexities of securely storing digital assets (e.g., using hardware wallets, managing private keys). Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving and often unclear regulatory landscape for direct crypto holdings. Accessibility: The need to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges, which can be unfamiliar to traditional brokerage account holders. An ETF addresses these concerns by allowing investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements through a regulated investment vehicle traded on traditional stock exchanges. This democratizes access, potentially bringing in a wave of institutional capital and retail investors who prefer the familiar framework of an ETF. This increased accessibility could lead to higher liquidity for SOL, greater price stability, and a more robust market overall. The Broader Impact on Digital Assets and Market Dynamics The pursuit of a Solana ETF is not just about Solana; it’s a powerful testament to the maturing landscape of digital assets . The approval of such an ETF would signify a further embrace of cryptocurrencies by mainstream finance, moving them from the periphery to a more integrated position within diversified investment portfolios. It validates the underlying technology and economic models of these digital currencies. Consider the ripple effect: Increased Legitimacy: Each new regulated product adds a layer of legitimacy to the crypto space, potentially reducing skepticism and attracting more cautious investors. Diversification Opportunities: For investors, a Solana ETF offers a new tool for portfolio diversification, allowing them to gain exposure to a high-growth sector without solely relying on Bitcoin or Ethereum. Innovation Catalyst: Increased institutional interest and capital could spur further innovation within the Solana ecosystem and across the broader Web3 space, as more resources become available for development and adoption. This trend suggests a future where a broader array of digital assets could become available through regulated financial products, fundamentally altering how investors interact with this asset class. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights for Investors While the prospect of a Solana ETF is exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach it with a well-informed perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Updates: The SEC’s decision-making process is critical. Keep an eye on announcements regarding the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF and other filings. Understand the Underlying Asset: Even if you invest via an ETF, it’s vital to understand Solana’s technology, use cases, and market dynamics. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies, even through an ETF, are volatile. Ensure any investment aligns with your overall financial goals and risk appetite. Consider Diversification: An ETF can be a valuable addition to a diversified portfolio, but it shouldn’t be your sole exposure to digital assets. The journey from filing to approval can be long, but the mere application by major players like Invesco and Galaxy Digital signals strong confidence in Solana’s future. A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Asset Investment The filing for a Solana ETF by Invesco and Galaxy Digital marks a pivotal moment, not just for Solana, but for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It underscores a growing institutional appetite for digital assets and a progressive shift in how these innovative technologies are being integrated into traditional financial frameworks. As the SEC continues to deliberate on these applications, the financial world watches with anticipation, eager to see how this new wave of regulated products will shape the future of investment. This isn’t merely about adding another ticker symbol to an exchange; it’s about validating an entire asset class, opening doors for unprecedented capital inflow, and accelerating the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. The Invesco Galaxy filing is a powerful testament to Solana’s potential and a clear signal that the era of diversified crypto investment is rapidly unfolding before our eyes.

Traders observed a quick turnaround from levels below $0.72. Active wallets handling WIF jumped by 20%, and daily volume hit over $70 million. All those actions brought the Solana meme coin to within range of the $1.00 mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Paces $15 Billion YTD Influx Amid 10-Week Fund Flow Streak Network Activity Shoots Up Based on reports, the Dogwifhat network saw a jump in trading volume to over $700 million in the past two days. That level of activity is rare for a token ranked 45th by market cap at about $1.75 billion. It now sits behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu but outpaces fellow Solana names like FLOKI, PEPE and BONK.

Grassroots campaigns rolled out on social media channels, fueling renewed interest. That momentum helped to maintain volume levels over $70 million a day and continued to keep wallet counts rising. Support at $0.81 held firm when the rally began, giving buyers confidence. Technical Breakout Hints At More Gains Based on chart analysis, WIF broke out of a descending wedge on the 4-hour chart. That pattern formed over the past week before prices cleared the $0.83 level on higher trading volume. The Relative Strength Index sits near 60, below overbought territory, suggesting there’s still room to run. Traders now eye a move to $0.90, the next Fibonacci retracement. A push past $1.00 would be the strongest signal yet. Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities Bitcoin And Solana Link Remains Strong According to market watchers, WIF’s fate is tied to Bitcoin and the wider Solana ecosystem. Maintaining Bitcoin above $105,000 will be crucial for keeping momentum. Any pullback could force WIF back toward support at $0.77 or even the recent floor at $0.71. At the same time, new exchange listings or partnership news could stoke another leg higher. Risk Management Key For Traders According to trading guides, meme coins such as WIF bear large swings. Smart traders are encouraged to place tight stops and control position sizes. A retreat below $0.80 would be a call to exercise caution. In case support fails, prices can test the lower bands once again. But if the coin holds ground, a run at $1.00 could spark fresh buying.

With many believing Bitcoin’s major runs are now less explosive than in past cycles, capital is flowing toward tokens with asymmetrical upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the standout names in this rotation, as large wallets begin accumulating in anticipation of its market debut and growing staking ecosystem. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Quiet Momentum With Clear Structure Unlike many meme-inspired projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE has established a solid foundation that includes: A 170 billion hard token supply cap, limiting dilution A fully audited contract by HashEx No VC control or treasury manipulation Community-first growth and governance What’s especially compelling is the mix of humor-driven branding with institutional-level tokenomics. The project is gaining traction not just on social platforms, but also among traders known for spotting early cycles before the crowd. Additionally, a limited-time promo, PATRIOTS100X , gives new investors added incentive — adding to the urgency already building around this launch. Solana’s Momentum Faces a Saturation Point Solana continues to attract developer activity and remains a powerhouse in NFT and DePIN sectors. However, with its current market cap and recent rallies, many investors believe the room for exponential gains may be narrowing. As a result, traders who once held long positions in SOL are now diversifying into early-phase projects with faster growth velocity — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the strongest options on their radar. XRP Still Faces Legal Uncertainty While XRP’s pending settlement with the SEC could trigger a breakout, uncertainty remains. Investor confidence is cautiously optimistic, with many watching the June 16 court date closely. Still, the risk of delays or unsatisfactory outcomes has made some traders hesitant to hold too much exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, offers a clean slate — no legal baggage, no centralized treasury, and no looming institutional complications — making it attractive to those seeking lower-friction upside. SEI Traders Are Joining the Momentum SEI Network has drawn significant attention for its performance-driven architecture, but even some of its early investors are now exploring new frontiers. With MAGACOIN FINANCE offering early staking, capped supply, and rising social volume, SEI holders are beginning to diversify into what they see as one of the next big viral-capable altcoins. This cross-ecosystem movement is further fueling the project’s visibility. Final Thoughts While Solana continues to build and XRP navigates its legal crossroads, investors from Bitcoin and SEI communities are quietly pivoting toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. With smart contract credibility, early staking, and favorable tokenomics, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about early altcoins. If momentum continues, this project could easily become a leader in the next crypto wave.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has just made a groundbreaking move, filing a 19b-4 application for the first-ever NFT ETF directly linked to the iconic Pudgy Penguins collection and its associated PENGU token. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a monumental step that could redefine how we approach crypto investment and bring the vibrant world of non-fungible tokens into the mainstream financial arena. What Does CBOE’s Bold Move Mean for Cryptocurrency ETFs? For those closely watching the evolution of digital finance, the name CBOE carries significant weight. As one of the largest exchange operators globally, CBOE’s involvement lends immense credibility to any financial product it backs. Their filing of a 19b-4 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the crucial first step towards launching an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Essentially, this application is a proposal to change exchange rules to allow the listing and trading of a new product. We’ve seen the impact of Cryptocurrency ETFs with the recent approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which opened the floodgates for institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning the underlying cryptocurrencies. An NFT ETF takes this concept a step further, applying it to a unique, often illiquid, and highly speculative asset class. This move by CBOE signals a growing comfort and demand from traditional finance for diversified exposure to the crypto ecosystem, moving beyond just foundational cryptocurrencies. Think about it: owning a physical NFT can be complex, involving digital wallets, understanding blockchain networks, and navigating marketplaces. An ETF simplifies this immensely, allowing investors to gain exposure through a regulated, familiar vehicle traded on a traditional stock exchange. This could be a game-changer for accessibility. Unpacking the Appeal of Pudgy Penguins and Digital Asset Investment So, why Pudgy Penguins ? Among the myriad of NFT collections, Pudgy Penguins has emerged as a blue-chip project, renowned for its strong community, distinctive artwork, and successful brand expansion. Launched in 2021, these charming, cartoonish penguin avatars quickly gained popularity, evolving into a lifestyle brand with physical toys, merchandise, and a significant presence in Web3 culture. Their success story is a testament to the power of community and intellectual property in the digital realm. The proposed ETF’s link to Pudgy Penguins NFTs and the PENGU token is particularly interesting. While the exact structure of how the ETF will track these assets is yet to be fully detailed, it likely aims to provide diversified exposure to the collection’s value and perhaps the broader ecosystem built around it. This represents a significant leap in Digital asset investment , moving from direct ownership of individual NFTs to a more aggregated, diversified investment product. For many, the idea of investing in NFTs still feels abstract or too risky. An ETF, however, could democratize access, allowing investors to participate in the potential growth of high-value NFT collections without the complexities of direct ownership, custody, or the high entry price of individual rare NFTs. It’s about bridging the gap between niche digital collectibles and mainstream financial portfolios. How Will This NFT ETF Transform Crypto Investment? The potential approval of an NFT ETF could have profound implications for crypto investment . Here are a few key benefits and transformations we might see: Increased Accessibility: Millions of investors who currently shy away from direct crypto or NFT ownership due to perceived complexity or regulatory uncertainty could now gain exposure through their existing brokerage accounts. This dramatically broadens the investor base. Diversification within Digital Assets: An ETF could offer a diversified basket of NFTs, mitigating the risk associated with investing in a single, highly volatile collection. While this specific filing targets Pudgy Penguins, its success could pave the way for ETFs tracking broader NFT indices. Regulatory Clarity and Legitimacy: SEC approval, if granted, would bestow a significant level of legitimacy upon NFTs as an investable asset class. This could encourage more institutional participation and foster greater trust in the digital asset market. Price Discovery and Liquidity: A publicly traded ETF could improve price discovery for the underlying NFTs by creating a new, regulated avenue for valuation and trading. It might also indirectly enhance liquidity for the NFT market by increasing overall demand and interest. Mainstream Adoption: The mere existence of an NFT ETF on a major exchange like CBOE would push NFTs further into the public consciousness, normalizing them as a legitimate component of the financial landscape. This development mirrors the trajectory of Bitcoin ETFs, which, once approved, led to significant capital inflows and increased market maturity. While NFTs present unique challenges, the precedent set by crypto ETFs suggests a similar positive trajectory for institutional adoption and investor confidence. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges for the First NFT ETF While the prospect of an NFT ETF is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant hurdles it faces. The SEC has historically been cautious with novel financial products, especially those tied to highly volatile and less-regulated markets. Here are some of the challenges: Valuation Complexity: Unlike traditional stocks or even cryptocurrencies with relatively straightforward market prices, NFTs are unique and often illiquid. Valuing an entire collection like Pudgy Penguins, let alone individual pieces within it, for daily ETF pricing is a complex task. How will the ETF’s net asset value (NAV) be accurately determined and updated in real-time? Custody and Security: Securing high-value NFTs is paramount. The ETF would need robust, secure custody solutions to protect the underlying digital assets from hacks, theft, or loss. This is a specialized area that traditional custodians are still adapting to. Market Volatility and Liquidity: The NFT market is notoriously volatile and can experience rapid price swings. Furthermore, many NFTs are illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily bought or sold without significantly impacting their price. An ETF needs sufficient liquidity in its underlying assets to manage creations and redemptions effectively. Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously scrutinize the application for investor protection, market manipulation concerns, and the overall structure. The lack of a clear regulatory framework specifically for NFTs adds an extra layer of complexity. Intellectual Property Rights: The ownership and usage rights associated with NFTs are still evolving. An ETF would need clear legal frameworks to ensure it can manage and utilize the underlying IP effectively, especially if the fund aims to generate revenue beyond just price appreciation. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they require innovative solutions and clear communication with regulators. The approval process could be lengthy, and the final product might look different from initial expectations. The Future Landscape of Digital Assets and Beyond If approved, this pioneering NFT ETF could usher in a new era for Digital asset investment . Its success might pave the way for similar funds tracking other blue-chip NFT collections, or even broader NFT market indices. Imagine an ETF that offers exposure to the entire metaverse economy, or funds focused on tokenized real estate, art, or music rights. The possibilities are vast. This move also underscores a broader trend: the convergence of traditional finance and Web3. As blockchain technology matures, we can expect more innovative financial products that bridge these two worlds, making complex digital assets accessible to a wider audience. The future of investment is increasingly digital, and initiatives like CBOE’s NFT ETF are crucial steps in that evolution. It’s not just about investing in JPEGs; it’s about recognizing the underlying technology and the cultural shift that NFTs represent. They are a new form of digital ownership, community building, and brand engagement. An ETF would acknowledge this value proposition within a regulated financial product. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Investors The CBOE’s filing for an NFT ETF tied to Pudgy Penguins is more than just a news item; it’s a landmark event that signifies the maturation of the digital asset space. While the road to approval may be long and fraught with regulatory challenges, this bold step by a major exchange like CBOE signals an undeniable shift towards mainstream acceptance of NFTs as a legitimate investment class. It promises to unlock new avenues for crypto investment , offering unprecedented accessibility and potentially reshaping the landscape of digital asset investment for years to come. Keep a close eye on this development; it could very well be the beginning of a revolutionary chapter in finance.

With increasing AI adoption, Micron, a producer of hardware essential to AI development, is experiencing a surge in demand. Micron raises Q4 predictions Micron Technology Inc., the largest U.S.-based manufacturer of computer memory chips, has raised its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue prediction up to $11B. This change was brought on by the surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. The new figure significantly exceeded Wall Street’s initial expectations and sent Micron shares climbing in after-hours trading. The Idaho-based company announced on Wednesday that it expects its fourth-quarter revenue to range between $10.4B and $11B. These figures are well above the average analyst estimate of $9.89, according to data compiled by Bloomberg . Investors responded positively to the prediction, and Micron shares gained over 6% in extended trading. This year, the company’s stock has surged by 51% so far, outperforming many peers in the semiconductor sector. Earnings per share, excluding certain items, are projected to come in at around $2.50, which is also more than the estimated $2.03. This increase is due to Micron experiencing growing demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, which are integral to training and operating large-scale AI models. AI demand boosts Micron’s optimism Micron’s latest earnings guidance shows just how important memory technology has become to AI infrastructure and innovation. Companies like cloud providers or chipmakers that build AI systems are relying on more advanced memory components to support the heavy processing requirements of modern AI workloads. Micron’s high-bandwidth memory is used in data centers and servers that run machine learning and generative AI applications. These applications, such as those powering AI chatbots or image generators, require fast data access and vast storage capacity. Micron previously faced tighter profit margins due to an oversupply in some memory segments and weakened demand for consumer electronics, but the shift toward AI has helped the company bounce back from recent struggles. “The growing complexity of AI models requires more advanced memory solutions, and we’re seeing strong interest in our HBM products,” Micron said in its earnings statement Wednesday. Wall Street analysts have stated that Micron is in a strategic position in the current AI industry and has the ability to monetize the growing demand for specialized memory. Although overall PC and smartphone markets remain relatively stagnant, Micron’s diversification into AI, cloud, and data center customers has helped offset these weaknesses. Analysts expect that trajectory to continue as AI development accelerates globally. Micron’s leadership suggested that the interest in AI adoption will likely persist through 2025. However, the company remains cautious about broader macroeconomic risks, including fluctuations in consumer tech spending and potential supply chain disruptions.

Known previously for its robust Bitcoin operations , the company is now setting its sights firmly on the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, aiming to become a dominant force in Ethereum staking and an integral ETH reserve company. This bold move signals not just a change for Bit Digital but potentially a broader trend within the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The Strategic Pivot: Why Bit Digital is Embracing Ethereum Staking The core of Bit Digital’s audacious new direction lies in its commitment to Ethereum staking . This strategic pivot underscores a profound belief in Ethereum’s future, particularly its post-Merge Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. For Bit Digital, embracing Ethereum staking offers several compelling advantages over traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) Bitcoin operations . Yield Generation: Unlike energy-intensive mining, staking involves locking up ETH to support the network’s security and validate transactions, earning consistent rewards (yield) in the process. This can provide a more predictable revenue stream. Environmental Sustainability: Ethereum’s shift to PoS dramatically reduced its energy consumption, aligning with increasing global demands for more sustainable blockchain solutions. This move positions Bit Digital as a more environmentally conscious player in the crypto space. Reduced Operational Overhead: Staking requires significantly less specialized hardware and energy compared to Bitcoin mining, potentially leading to lower capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational costs. Network Participation: By staking ETH, Bit Digital actively participates in securing and decentralizing the Ethereum network, contributing to the ecosystem’s health and future development. Bit Digital has been quietly building its Ethereum presence since 2022, stockpiling and staking ETH. As of the end of March, their foresight is evident in their substantial holdings of 24,434.2 ETH, alongside 417.6 BTC. The company’s future plans include converting its existing Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum, further solidifying its commitment to this new path. Scaling Back Bitcoin Operations: A Changing Landscape for Bitcoin Mining The decision by Bit Digital to scale back its Bitcoin operations is not made lightly and reflects a broader industry re-evaluation. The landscape of Bitcoin mining has evolved significantly, presenting increasing challenges that make a pivot strategically sound for companies like Bit Digital. Traditional Bitcoin mining, while foundational to the crypto industry, is characterized by: High Capital Expenditure: The constant need to upgrade to the latest, most powerful Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) miners requires significant upfront investment. Intense Energy Consumption: Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism is inherently energy-intensive, leading to high electricity costs and environmental scrutiny. Increasing Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining new blocks increases, making it harder to earn rewards without proportional increases in hash power. Halving Events: Every four years, the reward for mining a Bitcoin block is halved, putting pressure on miners to maintain profitability through efficiency or scale. By divesting from its energy-intensive Bitcoin mining infrastructure, Bit Digital can reallocate resources towards more capital-efficient and potentially more profitable ventures like Ethereum staking . This move highlights a pragmatic approach to navigating the volatile and competitive crypto mining sector. Building a Robust ETH Reserve: A Foundation for Future Growth Beyond just staking, Bit Digital’s ambition to become a significant ETH reserve company speaks volumes about its long-term vision for stability and growth within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Holding a substantial reserve of Ethereum serves multiple strategic purposes: Strategic Asset: Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s the backbone of a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. A large ETH reserve positions Bit Digital to potentially participate in or leverage these growing sectors. Liquidity and Flexibility: A healthy ETH reserve provides the company with significant liquidity, allowing it to respond to market opportunities or navigate potential downturns. Confidence in Ethereum’s Future: Amassing a large ETH reserve demonstrates a strong belief in Ethereum’s continued dominance and potential for price appreciation, reflecting a long-term investment strategy. The company’s plan to convert its existing BTC holdings to ETH further emphasizes its conviction in Ethereum as a foundational digital asset for its future operations and balance sheet. This move creates a more streamlined and focused asset base, reducing exposure to the complexities of managing two distinct mining operations. Implications for the Crypto Mining Shift: What Does This Mean for the Industry? Could Bit Digital ‘s bold move herald a wider crypto mining shift ? This strategic pivot by a Nasdaq-listed firm could serve as a significant precedent for other publicly traded mining companies, signaling a potential broader industry trend towards more sustainable and yield-generating crypto activities. The crypto industry is constantly evolving, and companies that adapt quickly to technological advancements, market demands, and environmental concerns are often the ones that thrive. Bit Digital’s shift highlights: Maturation of the Industry: The focus is moving beyond just raw computational power to more sophisticated financial strategies and participation in network governance. Environmental Pressure: As ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors become more critical for investors, companies are seeking greener alternatives to traditional PoW mining. Diversification of Revenue Streams: Relying solely on mining rewards can be precarious. Staking offers a different, potentially more stable, source of income. While Bitcoin mining will undoubtedly continue to be a vital part of the crypto ecosystem, Bit Digital’s decision underscores a growing recognition of Ethereum’s post-Merge potential and the strategic advantages of staking as a core business model. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts Bit Digital’s strategic shift offers several key takeaways: Observe Industry Trends: Keep an eye on other mining companies. Will they follow Bit Digital’s lead in a similar crypto mining shift ? Understand Staking Rewards: For those interested in passive income from crypto, Ethereum staking presents an attractive option. Research reputable staking services or consider solo staking if you have sufficient ETH. Evaluate Company Strategies: When looking at crypto-related stocks, consider companies that are adapting to market changes and exploring diverse revenue streams beyond just mining. Bit Digital’s proactive approach to building an ETH reserve and focusing on staking could be a model for future success. Long-Term Ethereum Outlook: This move reinforces institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and its role as a programmable blockchain for the future of finance and decentralized applications. A Bold Leap into Ethereum’s Future Bit Digital ‘s strategic reorientation from primary Bitcoin operations to a dedicated Ethereum staking and ETH reserve company marks a significant moment in the digital asset space. It’s a testament to the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency industry and the willingness of forward-thinking companies to adapt and innovate. By embracing the efficiencies and opportunities presented by Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake mechanism, Bit Digital is not just changing its business model; it’s potentially setting a new standard for sustainability and profitability in the evolving world of crypto. This bold leap positions Bit Digital at the forefront of a new era, demonstrating confidence in Ethereum’s pivotal role in the future of decentralized finance and beyond.

46789960,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=755517,1750900262,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46789960.jpeg,Meta’s transformative use defense tips scales in its favor in AI copyright legal battle,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-scores-legal-win-in-ai-copyright-fight/,"A federal court on Wednesday ruled that Meta Platforms Inc.’s use of millions of copyrighted books, academic papers, and comics to train its Llama artificial intelligence models falls under “fair use”. This marks a significant legal win for tech companies developing generative AI. The lawsuit, filed by a group of writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates and Richard Kadrey, accused the $1.4 trillion social media and AI giant of illicitly using a huge web content catalog without permission. These works were obtained through archives such as LibGen — a shadow library that hosts content without granting publisher rights. However, US District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco sided with Meta, concluding that the authors failed to make the right legal arguments to support their claims. “This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,” Chhabria clarified in his decision. “It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.” Meta’s transformative use defense tips scales in its favor Meta argued that its AI model training was a transformative use — a key tenet of fair use under US copyright law — and that how it acquired the data was irrelevant. The court agreed that the transformative nature of the technology and the plaintiffs’ lack of compelling counterarguments tipped the scales in Meta’s favor. This decision arrives just days after another high-profile win for an AI company: Anthropic, the maker of the Claude language models, secured a favorable ruling after demonstrating that it had trained its models on legally acquired physical books . A federal judge in San Francisco said Anthropic made “fair use” of books by the writers Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson to train its Claude large language model (LLM). Judge William Alsup compared the Anthropic model’s use of books to a “reader aspiring to be a writer” who uses works “not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them” but to “turn a hard corner and create something different”. Alsup added, however, that Anthropic’s copying and storage of more than 7 million pirated books in a central library infringed the authors’ copyrights and was not fair use, although the company later bought “millions” of print books as well. The judge ordered a December trial to determine how much Anthropic owes for the infringement. Alsup noted that the fact that Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it had stolen off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft. Still, it may affect the extent of statutory damages. US copyright law says that wilful copyright infringement can result in damages of up to $150,000 (£110,000) per work. The copyright debate has sparked growing tensions between AI companies and the creative industries, as generative AI models — which power tools like ChatGPT — rely on massive datasets to learn and produce responses. Much of that training data includes copyright-protected material, raising concerns among authors, publishers, and artists over unauthorized use. Ruling signals a turning point in AI copyright battles While the Meta case has been hailed as a victory for Big Tech, Judge Chhabria hinted at what could be more persuasive legal avenues in future cases. He noted that a stronger argument would focus on market dilution — the threat posed to authors by AI-generated content that can saturate markets with machine-created books, music, and art. “People can prompt generative AI models to produce these outputs using a tiny fraction of the time and creativity that would otherwise be required,” he warned. “This could dramatically undermine the incentive for human beings to create things the old-fashioned way.” Meta and legal counsel for the plaintiffs have not yet commented on the ruling. The decision will likely influence the many ongoing lawsuits created by creators against AI firms, as the legal system continues grappling with how copyright law applies in the era of artificial intelligence.

The license allows the firm to offer fully regulated digital asset services across the European Economic Area (EEA). The approval is a major milestone for Kraken, which seeks to ramp up its European presence. The license will enable Kraken to offer services in all 30 EEA member states. MiCA began operating in 2024 and is viewed as the most extensive crypto regulation worldwide. It establishes clear rules for asset issuance, trading platforms, stablecoin issuers, and custodial services. The license allows the crypto exchange to work in a new jurisdiction; more importantly, it is a concrete step toward compliance and long-term success. Kraken intensifies focus on the EU market The MiCA license is on top of Kraken’s robust regulatory footing in Europe. It has had an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license since March 2025 and received a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license in February 2025. These licenses support significant growth opportunities across retail, professional, and institutional client segments, including spot trading, derivatives, and payments. On top of that, the firm is also VASP-registered in multiple EU nations (Ireland, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain). These registrations demonstrate Kraken’s serious commitment to operating in a fully regulated capacity around the country, as is already the case in most states. Kraken has had a strong European presence since 2013. Today, Kraken is one of the most liquid and trustworthy euro markets for trading cryptocurrency. The MiCA license will allow Kraken’s subsidiary Fractal to provide retailers and institutions with a range of crypto services, including spot trading, derivatives, and payments, across a harmonized, continent-wide regime of regulations. “Securing a license from the Central Bank of Ireland, with its long heritage and experience as a rigorous financial regulator, isn’t just about compliance. It’s a powerful signal of Kraken’s commitment to expanding the crypto ecosystem through responsible innovation,” said Arjun Sethi, co-CEO of Kraken. Kraken isn’t the only one that has decided to capitalize on MiCA’s harmonized regulatory framework. Tier one exchanges like Coinbase, OKX, Crypto.com, and Bybit have already applied for or obtained MiCA licenses in the country ahead of the framework going into full effect in 2025. Gemini, the U.S. exchange run by the Winklevoss brothers, is believed to be on the verge of receiving approval via Malta’s regulations, one of the jurisdiction’s best-known stepping stones for fintech licensing. U.S. falls behind on MiCA crypto regulations Kraken’s MiCA win arrives a few days after the exchange moved its home office to Wyoming, a U.S. state that has earned a reputation for crypto-friendly legislation. The move is partly a nod to Wyoming’s friendly stance toward blockchain and a signal that the crypto exchange is hedging its bets on more than one jurisdiction to facilitate its overseas growth. However, the larger regulatory climate in the United States is hazy. Members of Congress are still going back and forth on the specifics of federal digital asset regulations that address markets, stablecoins, and market structure frameworks in standalone bills. Although some states have been friendly to the industry, federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission have been more aggressive. While the U.S. struggles with regulating crypto, Kraken’s MiCA approval could lend it an edge against global competition. It underscores Europe’s leadership in regulating crypto and how much clarity of oversight matters for the future of digital finance.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the Thursday trading day, BTC is changing hands above $107K, according to CoinDesk Market data , and the CoinDesk 20 , a measure of the largest digital assets, is trading just shy of 3000, up 0.7%. Looking back at the week that was, analysts and market observers are looking at what began as a selloff on Middle East tensions, with Israel and Iran trading rocket fire, and a U.S. bombing campaign on Iran's nuclear facilities, turned into a textbook risk-on rally, one that’s lifting crypto, tech stocks, and broader market sentiment alike. “War drums fade, risk appetite roars,” wrote QCP Capital in its June 25 market note, capturing the sudden mood swing after days of escalating headlines. “Traders appeared to have priced in a resolution or simply stopped waiting for one. Instead of flight-to-safety, the move was risk-on in full force.” That shift was visible across asset classes. U.S. equities surged, oil prices retraced to pre-conflict levels, and Coinbase stock jumped 12% on regulatory news. For BTC, the rebound above $107K signals not just relief but renewed momentum, even as investors keep one eye on the macro calendar and the other on global flashpoints. “It’s been a week of sharp swings in crypto,” said Gracie Lin, CEO of OKX Singapore. “Bitcoin dipped below $100,000 earlier in the week when Middle East tensions rattled the markets, but rebounded quickly after news of a ceasefire – now trading just below its all-time high in a sharp reversal.” Lin points to a slew of U.S. economic data, including GDP and unemployment claims, coming later this week as the next catalyst for BTC's movement. “Recent PMI numbers have held steady, but continued weakness in housing is raising questions about the broader economy,” she said. “If Thursday’s GDP or unemployment claims come in weaker than expected, bitcoin could benefit as investors look for hedges against traditional market weakness.” Add to that the quarterly expiration of bitcoin futures and options on June 27, and volatility could return in force. “Another bout of volatility is expected,” Lin said. QCP, meanwhile, is looking beyond the week’s swings, spotlighting the structural forces driving bitcoin’s evolution into a macro asset. From ProCap’s $386 million BTC buy to Coinbase’s regulatory win under MiCA, institutional momentum continues to build. “If this accumulation trend persists,” QCP wrote, “bitcoin may not just rival gold as a macro hedge but potentially in total market capitalisation.” Still, QCP adds a note of caution: “Geopolitics remains an ever-present undercurrent.” While markets have largely shrugged off renewed Israeli strikes, concerns are mounting over NATO–Russia tensions. With Western nations boosting defense budgets and Trump set to attend the NATO summit, the next geopolitical shock may not come from the Middle East. For now, bitcoin is riding the wave of risk-on enthusiasm. But beneath the surface, the battle between volatility and conviction, war drums and buying sprees, continues to define the market. Korean Crypto Investors Favor Community Over Capital, Analyst Explains For overseas crypto projects, getting listed on a Korean exchange like Upbit or Bithumb is seen as a golden ticket, an instant liquidity injection, and a validation milestone. But that mindset might be part of the problem, Bradley Park, an analyst with Seoul-based DNTV Research, explained in a recent interview with CoinDesk. At Korea Blockchain Week last year, Park kept hearing the same question from foreign teams: “ How do we get listed on a Korean exchange?” Korean exchanges have deep liquidity pools, and traders in the country are known for their euphoric rallies. “Honestly, many of them are approaching it the wrong way,” Park told CoinDesk. “Instead of starting with listing applications, maybe the better question is: How can we genuinely connect with the Korean community?” Park’s thesis is simple: in Korea’s Web3 market, community isn’t a checkbox. It’s the core. Listings are often a result, not a goal, and the key signal for exchanges is genuine grassroots activity. Take NEWT, for instance . In the lead-up to its token generation event, Korean degens lit up platforms like Kaito with homegrown content, discussions, and speculation. “This grassroots excitement translated directly into momentum,” said Park. “Both Upbit and Bithumb listed NEWT on the same day . That wasn’t a coincidence. It was the result of weeks of organic community buildup.” But Park cautions against seeing NEWT as a flawless blueprint. “It’s not a perfect model, but it does show how even a basic level of respect toward the Korean community can translate into visible outcomes,” he said. “That said, the subsequent price drop and fading short-term excitement left the project with another challenge: keeping the spark alive is just as difficult as igniting it in the first place.” Another example: Edward Park, a well-known Korean influencer and early Pudgy Penguins holder, posted about NEWT in Korean, garnering over 50,000 views. While that might not seem like a lot, it's the quality of the engagement that matters, argues Bradley Park. He attributes the single post to catalyzing a wave of engagement with other key stakeholders in Korea's crypto sphere because of Edward Park's trust. Projects that treat Korean users like exit liquidity rather than stakeholders tend to be punished. Park points to the case of ZORA , where Korean users showed strong early participation but soured on the project after a perceived unfair airdrop. “Interest in future Base ecosystem projects declined. They failed to go viral in Korea because users felt they weren’t valued.” Localization matters too, especially the language. Park contrasts two projects: COOKIE , which suffered from poorly translated, low-quality content created by outsiders, and KAITO , which invested in Korean-speaking staff and dedicated native-language campaigns and subsequently pumped after its Upbit listing. The lesson? If your go-to-market strategy starts with “get listed, dump tokens,” don’t expect Korean users to play along. “Even if your goal is to exit through a Korean exchange,” Park said, “then at the very least, respect the Korean users, encourage their participation, and acknowledge their contributions.” Token listings driven by the community are possible, but they’re fragile. “A listing strategy focused purely on short-term liquidity will always have its limits,” Park said. “Without a plan to build lasting trust, even the most explosive momentum will eventually burn out.” Because in Korea, authenticity isn’t a vibe. It’s the price of admission. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin rose 1.46% to $107,600 as a ceasefire and $514M in institutional buying fueled a rebound from sub-$100K, with strong support at $107K and the CD20 index up 1.4%. ETH: Ethereum rose 1.42% to $2,425.53, rebounding from recent lows as a Middle East ceasefire and continued whale accumulation boosted market sentiment and helped defend key $2,400 support, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Gold: Gold edged up to $3,340.90 and silver to $35.79 as markets digested the Israel-Iran ceasefire and lingering global tensions, with Trade Nation’s David Morrison warning that unresolved U.S.-China trade issues still pose risks. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets opened mixed Thursday as investors weighed the Israel-Iran ceasefire, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.4%. S&P 500: U.S. stock futures were flat Wednesday with the S&P 500 near record highs, but analysts warned that geopolitics or black swan events could halt the rally.

The 33-year-old three-term Assemblymember and democratic socialist plans to raise taxes on high earners, slap levies on trades and dividends, and tighten rules that investors say keep their deals fast. Veteran hedge fund founder Philippe Laffont warned live on Squawk Box that the result could start another rush of wealthy residents toward low-tax Florida and Texas. “Some people are going to, for sure, go,” Philippe said after former governor Andrew Cuomo conceded, adding that Cuomo might still run as an independent. Since the pandemic, many firms and crypto whales already relocated; with President Donald Trump back in the White House, the trek south could speed up. Investors warn of flight Zohran’s proposals land opposite Wall Street’s wish list. He supports a state wealth tax and higher marginal rates, ideas that persuade Pershing Square boss Bill Ackman to call himself “a bit depressed” while he scouts a fresh candidate. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers posted that he felt “profoundly alarmed” by the nomination because the candidate “advocated Trotskyite economic policies” and refused to reject the “globalize the intifada” slogan. Stocks mirrored the mood. Shares in New York-focused lender Flagstar fell nearly four percent, while office landlords SL Green Realty slipped more than six percent and Vornado Realty Trust tumbled almost seven percent on the day Zohran celebrated. Market desks blamed fear of upcoming revenue hits if City Hall freezes rent hikes and demands bigger checks from business profits. Markets price in rent control moves Universal rent control sits at the heart of Zohran’s housing pitch. The mayor appoints members to the board that governs rent-regulated apartments, and roughly one million units stand to see a pause on increases if his allies take those seats. Only about twenty thousand apartments remain under the older, stricter rent-control rules, yet landlords fear the broader cap could crush cash flow. Macro analyst Jim Bianco called the trajectory “suicide by mayor” in a late-night X post. Partnership for New York City president Kathryn Wylde told CNBC that “terror is the feeling” across corporate suites, though she still hopes Governor Kathy Hochul can steer the city away from disaster by blocking fresh taxes. Up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, precinct tallies show more than seventy percent of voters backed Cuomo, highlighting the rift between capital and ballot boxes. Wall Street has seen this script before. In 2013, Bill de Blasio’s victory sounded similar alarms, but face-to-face talks cooled tempers before policies rolled out. Philippe believes New York’s resilience may repeat that history, saying, “We had Mayor DeBlasio for eight years. New York is really strong. I’m hopeful the same will happen.” Business desks, crypto chat rooms, and traders on every exchange will find out soon enough whether Zohran delivers the jolt or the calm. Either way, tax accountants are bracing now. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The Treasury labeled the firms as “primary money laundering concerns ,” a designation that enables it to impose strict restrictions on their access to the US financial system. The sanctions mark the first time the Treasury’s financial crimes unit has exercised new powers granted under recently enacted anti-fentanyl legislation. The move comes amid a broader crackdown on opioid trafficking, as former President Donald Trump intensifies his campaign focus on combating the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. Alvaro Vértiz asserts that the US will stop at nothing to stop fentanyl trafficking The three companies, according to the Treasury, had played a long-standing and central role in laundering millions of dollars for Mexican cartels and facilitating payments to secure precursor chemicals for the production of fentanyl. Concerning this, Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender highlighted that they have taken steps to stop the financial institutions based in Mexico from working with US financial institutions. The sanctions were the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s first actions to be carried out under the FEND Off Fentanyl Act. The bill was signed into law last year and provides the agency with new authorities to go after opioid smuggling. Fentanyl, a cheap synthetic painkiller, has driven the opioid epidemic in the United States over the last decade and is the most common cause of overdose deaths. The news comes as Trump has been ramping up a US assault on drug trafficking from Mexico in a challenge to left-wing President Claudia Sheinbaum. The founder of Vector Casa de Bolsa is Alfonso Romo, who for two years managed the office of Sheinbaum’s mentor and predecessor, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Meanwhile, there are no allegations of wrongdoing on Romo’s part or that of the former president. Alvaro Vértiz, who leads Latin America at the Washington-based advisory firm DGA Group, commented on the topic of discussion. According to Vértiz, this seriously damages the trust in the Mexican financial system. He also mentioned that the US is ready to do anything necessary to fight fentanyl trafficking, and there will be no exceptions. Mexico’s financial firms vow to adhere to oversight regulations strictly All three institutions — two banks and a brokerage — are small but prominent players in Mexico’s financial sector , which manage $7 billion, $4 billion, and $11 billion, respectively. Following the Treasury’s claims, CIBanco and Intercam conducted business with or offered services to the now-dominant Jalisco New Generation cartel. For Vector, it assisted a Sinaloa cartel mule to launder US dollars 2 million from the US to Mexico. Several senior industry executives have reacted to the news. According to them, this will force Mexico’s financial institutions to strictly adhere to “know your customer” and anti-money laundering oversight. It is worth noting that Sheinbaum has won some praise from US officials for prioritizing greater co-operation on security, with her security minister increasing arrests, seizures, and extraditions. Despite this, in response to this news, Mexico’s finance ministry said it had not been provided proof of the accusations. The ministry stated that if they received clear evidence showing illegal actions by these three financial institutions, they would take strong legal action. However, at that moment, they did not have any such information. The wider US-Mexico relationship has been rocky as Trump imposed a 25% tariff on a broader range of goods, and the administration has raised the possibility of unilateral military action against drug cartels. Trump issued an executive order designating six cartels as terrorist organisations in his first weeks in office, and he sent a former Army Green Beret to be his ambassador in Mexico City. CIBanco and Intercam did not respond to requests for comment. In the statement, Vector said it categorically denies any claim against its integrity, and that the transactions were with legitimate companies.

Trading at just $0.03, MUTM has emerged as a standout among new utility coins, driven by rapid presale growth and strong investor appetite for fundamentally-backed altcoins amid broader market volatility. At present, Mutuum Finance has sold out over 40% of phase 5 of its presale. The project has already received more than 11.1 million and has drawn close to 12,400 investors. What’s drawing attention is more than price, Mutuum’s dual lending protocol, dynamic interest structure, and buyback-driven tokenomics have it poised as a serious coin in the next crypto. As capital rotates into presale-phase projects and investors seek what crypto to invest in before June ends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will hit $1.50 soon after launch, especially as Shiba Inu and other majors enter short-term consolidation zones. Mutuum Finance Reinventing DeFi Lending, a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance is set to establish a new standard in decentralized finance and introduce the next-generation lending protocol to offer the best of both worlds, combining the Profits of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Within the P2C system, lending pool and interest rate auto-update to reflect the current market trends through the intervention of automated smart contracts. This will offer a stable and predictable set of returns to lenders and consistent set of terms to borrowers, which is sorely lacking in DeFi lending. The P2P model, on the contrary, eliminates middlemen, which enables borrowers and lenders to access each other. The model is particularly beneficial in handling highly volatile assets and it gives its users more flexibility, control and risk management that suits their needs. Combining two effective solutions, Mutuum Finance offers an incomparable balance of efficiency, decentralization, and flexibility and will become a leader of the DeFi market in the future. Presale Phase 5 Accelerates Mutuum Finance presale is currently at Phase 5 and the momentum is gaining pace rapidly. Having over 12,400 investors who have joined already, and with almost 11.1 million already raised, the project is demonstrating that it is not just another DeFi experiment. Smart investors can’t miss a chance to purchase Mutuum Finance tokens with a price of just $0.03, which are set to increase and be $0.06 at launch, leading to a 2x yield on investments in the early phase. Mutuum Finance is designing an Ethereum-based fully collateralized USD stablecoin to complement its ecosystem even more. The asset is stable in volatile markets unlike algorithmic stablecoins that are vulnerable to depegging in volatile markets environments; therefore, making it a stable medium of exchange and store value institutionally and retail-wise. Over $11.1 million raised and a fast-growing base of 12,400+ investors signal that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is no longer flying under the radar. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) eyes modest gains, Mutuum Finance is gunning for a potential breakout to $1.50, powered by a fundamentally strong DeFi use case, CertiK-audited smart contracts, and an innovative dual lending model. Currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5, early investors are positioned for a 2x return at launch, with much higher upside projected as broader market momentum returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a high-conviction altcoin for early movers this cycle.

Investors Closely Watch Aptos,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-fueled-by-ethereum-and-bitcoin-momentum-investors-closely-watch-aptos/,"Ethereum Is Rebounding on Strong Institutional Signals Ethereum is entering June with renewed optimism after surviving heavy selling pressure. It’s now trading near critical levels around $2,500–$2,600, with traders watching for a move back toward $2,800. Institutional appetite remains a key support: SharpLink Gaming recently became the largest public ETH holder, securing over 176,000 ETH and staking the majority. This confidence is bolstered by Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade and a surge in cash-margined futures interest, both pointing toward long-term bullish activity. These signals are prompting Ethereum whales to look at new, undervalued assets with potential — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is landing on their radar. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Gaining Speed from the Momentum of Giants While MAGACOIN FINANCE is not a Bitcoin or Ethereum competitor, it is increasingly benefitting from the flows of investors who originally built their portfolios around those giants. The fixed 170 billion token supply and fully audited smart contract have established MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare project with both meme appeal and strong tokenomics. But it’s the activation of staking — already live and seeing notable uptake — that has turned speculative interest into strategic accumulation. With investors locking in tokens for yield, not just short-term flips, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a new phase of market awareness. This isn’t just another presale token. It’s becoming a magnet for traders looking for long-term upside — and doing so just as capital rotates out of slow-moving assets. A temporary early entry promo — PATRIOTS100X — remains active, offering new buyers a boost before the next pricing phase. It’s another reason traders are rushing to establish a position before wider listings and coverage emerge. Bitcoin Shows Stability, Drawing Eyes to Emerging Plays Bitcoin’s volatility has cooled recently, but the asset remains a key benchmark for crypto sentiment. With ETFs in play and miners adjusting post-halving, the network remains strong, and traders are comfortable holding. However, for those looking to go beyond steady growth, attention is shifting toward smaller tokens with asymmetric upside. Veteran Bitcoin investors are selectively deploying capital into promising new opportunities — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few gaining consistent traction in these portfolios. Aptos Investors Monitor Strategic Shifts Aptos has maintained strong user engagement and ranks high in active address activity. While price catalysts have been limited in recent weeks, the community remains active, and developers continue to build within its ecosystem. But as new opportunities present themselves in more hyped and rapidly moving projects, many in the Aptos space are beginning to shift their attention to potential early-stage breakouts. That’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is now showing up in Aptos circles — as a possible next move for those seeking action and long-term rewards. Final Thoughts Ethereum and Bitcoin are setting the tone, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight for those hunting breakout potential. With key features already deployed and early whale activity rising, investors are positioning now. Aptos holders, altcoin traders, and smart money players are watching closely as this altcoin evolves from underdog to contender.

TIAA Wealth Management said in its midyear report that Trump’s trade policy could still shift “frequently,” warning about the “elevated uncertainty” surrounding whether new tariffs will be added or the old ones will be enforced again. They pointed out that even a few product-specific tariffs could push the total tariff rate over 10% of imports. They also noted Trump has enough legal power to bring back tariffs through other channels, and that court rulings, including possibly the Supreme Court, may not stop him. The real danger, they added, is that the damage to companies and consumers might not have even started showing up fully yet. Powell links tariffs to inflation risk Inflation is directly tied to all this. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, testified to Congress this week, saying the central bank is closely monitoring how tariffs could lead to price increases. “The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level,” Powell said. He wasn’t guessing. He was warning. Another major factor for inflation is oil. The Iran-Israel conflict and rising tension with the US has made oil prices unstable over the last few weeks. That’s not just about supply and demand. If Iran decides to block the Strait of Hormuz, which carries nearly 20% of the world’s crude oil, it could send energy prices through the roof. This all ties back to the Fed’s interest rate decision. Powell’s team is balancing inflation threats against whether to cut or hold rates. Meanwhile, Congress is debating a tax-and-spending bill. If spending stays high and the Fed keeps rates where they are, both the stock and Treasury markets could face a sell-off. That’s not just a theory. A new Natixis survey, published Wednesday, said bond market turmoil is now the top fear among the firm’s investment managers. JPMorgan flags recession risk The economy itself is no longer a solid safety net. The US housing market is already showing weakness. If that spreads to other industries, investors could face a much broader slowdown. JPMorgan’s research team put the odds of a recession at 40% in its latest forecast for the rest of the year. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, a strategist at the bank, wrote that if the global outlook gets worse and risk assets start falling, the US could underperform. He explained that the US market is at “the epicenter of the growth shock” due to its current valuations, but also mentioned the large weight of less-cyclical tech stocks could help limit losses. That’s not comfort. That’s just math. Despite all this, Wall Street’s still hoping things don’t blow up. As long as nothing gets worse, the 500 might stay up. But that’s a big if. One mistake, one escalation, and the whole thing unravels. Investors have taken positions assuming only moderate outcomes. The risk is if something completely unplanned throws everything off. Tavis McCourt, strategist at Raymond James, put it bluntly in a note to clients: “There are only two consensus opinions in the world of equity investors that I speak with. One, the [US dollar] will continue to weaken, the second is yields are going higher. We all know what the pain trade would be, and [it] will be interesting if this weekend’s events pressure this consensus.” That pain trade? A reversal of both bets. If the dollar strengthens or yields drop, everyone’s on the wrong side. That’s not a crack in the market. That’s a trapdoor.

In a mid-year economic outlook released Wednesday, the bank said there is a 40% chance of a recession in the second half of 2025. JPMorgan said that the U.S. GDP was projected to rise just 1.3% in 2025, down from a prior 2% projection. The new forecast comes as fears increase that protectionist trade measures, including broad new tariffs announced in April, will raise prices while slowing business activity. “The stagflationary impulse from higher tariffs has been the impetus for our lowered GDP growth outlook for this year,” it said. “We still view recession risks as elevated.” Stagflation, which was last seen during the economic crises of the 1970s, is an unusual and troubling turn of events. It happens when inflation remains elevated even as economic growth slows and unemployment rises in a toxic economic mix that can be hard to address using conventional policy tools. Trade shock raises concerns over recession The warning comes as financial markets react to the tariff announcements by the Trump administration, which are intended to protect U.S. industries but could also push up costs for American consumers and businesses. Markets had already repriced sharply in April when the deal announcement sent U.S. Treasury yields surging. JPMorgan explains that 2-year Treasury yields are up 3.8% while 10-year yields are near 4.3%. Yet despite the twists and turns, JPMorgan sees some relief coming by year-end, narrowing its target to 3.5% for two-year Treasuries and 4.35% for the 10-year. Still, the bank also cautioned that the term premium, or the extra yield investors demand to hold longer-dated bonds, could rise by 40 to 50 basis points amid mounting concerns about U.S. fiscal sustainability and reduced appetite from foreign buyers, the Federal Reserve, and commercial banks. JPMorgan is more cautious, even though some investors still bet the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates later this year. The bank thinks that because of “sticky inflation,” tariffs are a factor in keeping it high; there probably won’t be any cuts from the Fed until December, only a start to a 100-basis-point pace-cutting cycle stretched out until the spring of 2026. If the economy cools off more than expected, the Fed may have to be more aggressive, but for now, JPMorgan is bracing for a more gradual recalibration. U.S. dollar falls as global growth picks up JPMorgan also offered a bearish take on the dollar, arguing that it will suffer as foreign economies perform better than the United States, supported by growth-friendly policies abroad. On the other hand, the U.S. is considered to be heading toward protectionism and possibly isolationist measures, which could weigh on domestic expansion . The bank says that divergence should put foreign currencies, particularly in emerging markets, on an upward trajectory while reducing foreign demand for U.S. assets like Treasury bonds. A major worry cited is the sheer magnitude of the U.S. debt market, which could be more difficult to support as key purchasers, including China, Japan, and global banks, began to pull back. But not all the news is bad. JPMorgan is still bullish on U.S. stocks, arguing that robust consumer spending, strong tech sector earnings, and investor demand could push stocks higher. The bank thinks that barring a big geopolitical letdown or policy disappointment, tech and AI-driven growth will support equity markets.

Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade improved scalability and boosted validator performance, while institutional interest remains strong due to ETF backing. Despite this, ETH’s price remains locked in a consolidation zone, creating impatience among some investors. XRP, meanwhile, is holding firm around a narrow price band, with legal clarity finally within reach. The SEC lawsuit is nearing resolution, and optimism is growing around a potential XRP ETF approval. Yet despite these developments, XRP’s price action remains unpredictable. This uncertainty has spurred many traders to explore alternatives—Polkadot and MAGACOIN FINANCE are now at the top of that list. Polkadot’s Technology Draws Fresh Capital Polkadot is gaining renewed traction due to its Elastic Scaling upgrade, which aims to dramatically improve the network’s throughput. As this scaling framework goes live, traders are speculating on a potential price breakout. Polkadot remains a leader in the Web3 interoperability movement, and staking activity is on the rise. Analysts see price targets between $8 and $10 by year’s end, depending on broader altcoin market recovery. Still, many investors are not just rotating into Polkadot—they’re looking for a newer, more explosive play. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the equation. MAGACOIN FINANCE Momentum Is Accelerating MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most watched tokens in 2025. What started as a community-driven initiative is now transforming into a serious altcoin contender. Traders rotating out of long-held majors are fueling its rise, and a number of key features are creating a perfect setup for acceleration: Locked Token Supply: With 170 billion tokens capped, long-term dilution is off the table. Staking Activated: Investors can now earn passive rewards, boosting long-term holding behavior. HashEx Audit Completed: Security and transparency concerns are resolved, adding institutional confidence. Full Community Control: No VC overrides, no hidden allocations—just grassroots growth. These structural advantages, combined with rapidly growing attention across crypto forums and Telegram channels, have sparked strong early demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not only holding investor attention—it’s redefining early-phase momentum. Analysts Are Watching Closely Market strategists have noted that smart money is rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE not because of hype—but because of structure. Its clean tokenomics, active staking inflows, and rising wallet concentration are all early indicators of a maturing asset. Analysts forecast it could mirror early Solana growth patterns, especially as listings come into play. Final Thoughts As Ethereum consolidates and XRP waits for its legal finish line, Polkadot has emerged as a strong technology-backed option. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched for a different reason—undervalued positioning and structural clarity. Veteran traders are beginning to recognize its potential to outpace other altcoins in 2025.

After briefly dropping to a local low of $2,177 over the weekend, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has climbed back above $2,400. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at approximately $2,412, though it still reflects a 2.9% loss over the past week and a 2.4% dip over the last two weeks. Amid this price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst has assessed Ethereum’s interaction with the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a commonly used trend indicator, and came up with an outlook on where the asset is likely headed. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month Ethereum Key Resistance Levels and Historical Price Patterns According to a recent post by CryptoQuant contributor İbrahim COŞAR, Ethereum is approaching a pivotal moment that could define its next price trajectory. The analyst believes that a decisive break above the 50-day EMA could propel ETH to the $2,800 level, with a further push toward $4,000 if resistance levels are breached. In his analysis, İbrahim COŞAR emphasizes that Ethereum must close consistently above the $2,500–$2,600 range to confirm a breakout. Past data suggests that ETH has previously moved sharply after breaking out of similar consolidation zones. Specifically, in an earlier phase, Ethereum oscillated between $2,100 and $2,800 before moving strongly to $4,000. A similar move could unfold if ETH can surpass the $2,800 resistance in the current market cycle. COŞAR also noted that Ethereum’s 50-week EMA remains a longer-term resistance barrier. A breach of this technical ceiling, combined with strong daily closes above short-term resistance levels, could indicate the beginning of a more aggressive upward trend. However, the analyst advised caution, pointing out that macroeconomic and geopolitical events, particularly those involving the US, Israel, and Iran, could trigger market volatility. He recommended avoiding excessive leverage during such periods. Additional Technical Perspectives Point to Further Gains Javon Marks, another crypto market analyst, presented a more aggressive outlook for Ethereum. In a recent post, Marks observed that Ethereum has broken above a descending trend line, which historically aligns with upward price continuation. He projected that Ethereum could see an 81% gain to reach a target price of $4,811.71. Furthermore, if momentum builds, an additional rally could extend gains by another 77%, pushing prices toward $8,557.68. These projections are not guaranteed, but they highlight growing optimism in Ethereum’s market structure, especially among traders who base strategies on technical chart formations.

The threat came just hours after NATO leaders agreed to major defense spending increases that Trump had pushed hard for. But Spain publicly refused to meet the target, insisting it could fulfill its obligations without crossing that 5% line. “I think their decision is very terrible,” Trump said. “We’re negotiating with Spain on a trade deal. We’re going to make them pay twice as much.” The statement, reported by Reuters, raised eyebrows because Spain, like other EU members, doesn’t make individual trade deals with the U.S.. Those negotiations are handled by the European Commission, representing all 27 member states. That means if Trump wants to carry out this punishment, he’d need to insert that language into a broader agreement with the entire European Union—something that would likely face major opposition. Trump jokes about ‘daddy’ nickname, defends himself at NATO Instead of focusing on Spain’s refusal, Trump spent a chunk of the summit praising his own impact on the alliance. “They said, ‘You did it, sir, you did it,’” Trump said. “Well, I don’t know if I did it, but I think I did.” He said this while smiling, clearly enjoying the attention from fellow leaders. When asked about NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte calling him “daddy,” Trump said it was “very affectionately.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, standing behind him, tried not to laugh. This summit was calmer than the ones Trump attended during his first term. Back then, meetings were tense, with European leaders uncertain about his loyalty to NATO’s collective defense clause. But on Wednesday, Trump said he no longer believed the alliance was a scam. “I left here differently,” he said. “I left here saying that these people really love their countries. It’s not a rip off, and we’re here to help them protect their country.” Still, not everyone was pleased with how things unfolded. French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking after the summit, called out Trump’s trade threats. “We cannot, among allies, say that we must spend more…and wage a trade war,” Macron said . He added, “It is very important that we can return to what should be the rule within a group of allies…a true trade peace.” Macron was also the only leader to criticize Trump over his decision to hit Iran last week. Trump says Iran attack was like Hiroshima, meets with Zelenskyy At the press conference, Trump also talked about the U.S. military strikes on Iran, calling them “very, very successful—total obliteration.” He said media outlets like CNN and The New York Times had “demeaned” U.S. troops with their coverage. He added that intelligence reports backed the attack’s effectiveness. “We think we hit ‘em so hard and so fast, they didn’t get to move,” Trump said. “We destroyed the nuclear. It’s blown up…to kingdom come.” He even compared the strikes to the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. “That ended the war, too. This ended a war in a different way, but it was so devastating,” Trump said. He claimed that bunker-buster bombs were used and insisted this cleared a path to peace in the Middle East. Before stepping onstage, Trump held a private meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which lasted nearly an hour. He described Zelenskyy as “very nice” and commended Ukraine’s fight. When asked if he’d approve more defense aid, Trump replied, “We’ll see what happens.” A Ukrainian journalist told him her husband was in the military. Trump responded directly, saying, “Vladimir Putin really has to end that war.” At the very end, Trump was asked why he believed the latest ceasefire between Iran and Israel would hold. “They’re both tired, exhausted,” he said. “They were both satisfied to go home and get out.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Donald Trump|NATO|Spain,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-26 02:07:58

Traders responded immediately in Asia as the US currency dropped against all its major peers. The news came after Trump said he’s unhappy with how current Fed Chair Jerome Powell has handled interest rates, believing he’s been too slow to cut them. Source: Bloomberg Trump is now considering making an announcement as early as September or October, while Powell’s term doesn’t end until May 2026. According to the Journal , the names being floated inside the White House include Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, and Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council. Both men have had previous ties to Trump’s circle, and the idea of naming a successor so early is already shaking investor confidence. Trump told reporters Wednesday he’s currently considering “three or four” potential replacements. He’s openly criticized Powell’s recent decision to keep interest rates on hold, saying it’s keeping government borrowing costs high and hurting growth. Earlier this month, he said new names would be coming “very soon.” White House sends mixed signals Rodrigo Catril, strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, said Trump’s possible early announcement could “amp up the pressure” on Powell long before his term ends. “We could have a shadow Fed chair before May next year,” Catril said, adding that this kind of political pressure could push the dollar lower in coming weeks. When asked about Trump’s intentions, the White House responded by saying the Fed should focus on growth-oriented monetary policy. Powell, for his part, insisted politics wouldn’t influence the Fed’s choices. “If we make a mistake here, people will pay…the cost for a long time,” Powell told lawmakers during a Senate hearing. He added that rate cuts are still possible later this year, but said the Fed would take a “careful approach.” On the timeline, Larry Bessent, current Treasury Secretary, previously said interviews for the next chair wouldn’t begin until September. But that schedule might not hold. The Fed’s independence has been guarded since the 1970s, when President Nixon pressured the central bank for lower rates ahead of his reelection. That led to disastrous inflation that took years to fix. Trump eyes Warsh, Bessent, and Malpass for top role Trump has had Warsh on his radar for a while. He spoke with him earlier this year about possibly replacing Powell before his term ends. Warsh was also interviewed by Trump last fall for the Treasury job. At a closed-door event in Boston this month, Warsh told a group of finance professionals, “I wouldn’t be shocked if the president made a nomination sooner than would be customary, just to…try to make a lame duck lamer or something like that.” Still, there are concerns. Some of Trump’s aides worry Warsh could be a maverick. He’s long been seen as a policy hawk, more focused on fighting inflation than boosting employment. When asked about that label in Boston, Warsh said, “My fatal flaw is I say what I believe. If the president wants someone who is weak, I don’t think I’m going to get the job.” He also took a shot at zero interest rates: “When things are free, when rates are zero, that leads to very bad economic outcomes.” Warsh also praised Kazuo Ueda, head of the Bank of Japan, saying he’s “the most talented central banker on the planet right now.” Then there’s Hassett, who’s reportedly told people he’s not interested in taking the job. That makes room for Bessent. Despite saying he’s committed to his current position, people familiar with both him and Trump say Bessent hasn’t ruled it out. Speaking before Congress earlier this month, Bessent said, “I’m happy to do what President Trump wants me to do.” That loyalty matters—Trump barely knew Powell when he picked him in 2018 and now sees that decision as a mistake. He’s determined not to repeat it. Trump has also been talking to aides about David Malpass, who ran the World Bank during his first term. Malpass has recently supported rate cuts and criticized the Fed’s internal models in a Journal op-ed. Those views line up with Trump’s. But in recent private dinners and lunches, Trump reportedly raised doubts over Malpass’s TV appeal, suggesting his appearance might not suit the role.

Qubetics Presale Enters Final Stage with Strong Tokenomics and Community Growth In Stage 37, Qubetics’ presale offers $TICS tokens at $0.3370, just below the confirmed listing price of $0.40. Over $18.1 million has been raised, with 516+ million tokens already distributed to a growing base of 28,200+ holders. The presale is nearing completion, with only 10 million tokens left fueling urgency among buyers. The team recently overhauled tokenomics, cutting the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion and increasing the public allocation to 38.55%. These changes enhance decentralization and long-term sustainability. Participants entering at this stage are locking in immediate upside while positioning themselves for deeper market involvement and governance access. Confirmed Qubetics Exchange Listing Ignites Bullish Outlook for Early Backers Qubetics has secured a confirmed listing on a top-7 centralized exchange, opening the door to global investor access, fiat onboarding, and institutional-grade liquidity. The expected launch price of $0.40 signals a potential 20% immediate return for crypto presale participants. As token velocity and visibility increase, so will opportunities for volume growth across Qubetics-powered dApps. With strong fundamentals, audit clearance from CertiK, and a $30,000 bug bounty program reinforcing transparency, Qubetics is a strategic Layer 1 poised for a breakout. Investors looking for the best coins to join now should keep Qubetics in their watchlist. Chainlink Gains Developer Momentum Despite Trading Below ATH Chainlink (LINK), once the king of oracle integrations, is slowly regaining market attention in 2025 after announcing new partnerships and ecosystem expansions. While the token currently trades at 74.54% below its all-time high of $52.70, it remains 8,953.83% up from its all-time low, a sign of its historic and sustained growth potential. As the market tilts toward real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is being adopted by major institutions to bridge data securely across chains. In March 2025, Chainlink confirmed multiple integrations with traditional financial players, including a pilot with a global bank for real-time FX data feeds using Chainlink oracles. This development has prompted bullish sentiment, particularly among institutional DeFi platforms that rely on trust-minimized data inputs. Developers are also beginning to favor Chainlink’s modularity, citing reduced latency and improved network uptime. LINK has been consolidating around $15–$18 for the past quarter, which analysts consider a potential accumulation zone. Given its continued focus on decentralized data delivery and expanding enterprise presence, Chainlink remains one of the top-rated crypto tokens in the utility segment. If momentum holds and the macro market stays bullish, LINK is poised to revisit key resistance zones as new use cases take hold. Tron Surges as TRX Becomes Utility Layer for USDT and Stablecoin Transfers Tron (TRX) has long been known for its high-throughput blockchain and dominance in USDT transaction volume. In 2025, it is doubling down on that lead by launching a zero-fee stablecoin remittance pilot across Southeast Asia. Today, TRX is trading at $0.2745, with a 0.88% 24-hour gain and growing liquidity across centralized and decentralized exchanges. Tron’s ecosystem has quietly grown to include thousands of smart contracts, and its TVL has increased by over 18% since January. Much of this growth comes from expanding use cases in DeFi, particularly around permissionless lending, staking, and NFT issuance. TRON DAO has also announced a $50 million fund to support ecosystem dApps focused on remittance, gaming, and low-latency trading. While TRX has often flown under the radar compared to flashier tokens, its stable performance and focus on financial utility make it a consistent performer. With its partnerships in government pilot programs and increasing usage in borderless payments, Tron continues to show why it belongs among the top-rated crypto assets in the current cycle. Conclusion: Qubetics, Chainlink, and Tron Stand Out Amid Market Acceleration As Bitcoin smashes past the $106,000 milestone, the eyes of the crypto world are turning toward high-conviction altcoins with a clear purpose and strong execution. Qubetics leads this wave with a real utility stack, a confirmed listing, and deflationary tokenomics; Chainlink follows with institutional-grade infrastructure and powerful developer tooling; and Tron provides borderless financial rails for the stablecoin economy. All three represent a class of top rated crypto projects that aren’t just speculatively priced but grounded in solving actual problems. As altcoin season heats up, these tokens are not just worth watching; they may be among the top-rated crypto. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other Layer 1s? Qubetics integrates multichain interoperability, low-code tooling, and enterprise-grade compliance features, all in a single stack, making it suitable for large-scale use and real-world finance. When will Qubetics be listed on an exchange? Qubetics is confirmed for listing on a top-7 centralized exchange at a starting price of $0.40, following its Stage 37 presale, which was priced at $0.3370. Is Chainlink still a good buy below its all-time high? Yes. Chainlink’s utility in decentralized data and growing enterprise integrations make it a resilient, long-term option, even below ATH pricing. What is TRON being used for in 2025? TRON is expanding its use in stablecoin remittances, DeFi lending, and permissionless asset transfers, particularly in regions underserved by traditional banking. Which is the best crypto for short- and long-term growth? Qubetics, Chainlink, and TRON offer strong use cases, but Qubetics’ mix of utility, scarcity, and upcoming exchange listing gives it a decisive short-term advantage. Summary As Bitcoin exceeds $106,000, the spotlight turns to the altcoin market, where utility-first projects capture investor interest. Qubetics ($TICS) leads the charge with a modular interoperability framework, low-code deployment tools, and a confirmed listing on a top-7 exchange, making it one of the top rated crypto opportunities today. Chainlink (LINK), despite trading below its ATH, continues to dominate decentralized data services with new institutional pilots, while TRON (TRX) enhances its stablecoin remittance infrastructure across emerging markets. Each coin serves a distinct role in the next wave of Web3 evolution: Qubetics in development infrastructure, Chainlink in oracles and DeFi, and Tron in low-fee digital finance. All are poised for continued growth in 2025.

Market participants are closely watching as the SEC and Ripple move toward a possible settlement, with a joint motion filed to finalize penalties. This development has energized investor sentiment, with analysts forecasting that XRP could retest the $3.00–$4.00 range if regulatory clarity is achieved. A spot ETF approval—looking increasingly likely—could also bring institutional momentum into play. Still, some traders believe the most explosive growth might already be behind XRP, prompting them to seek earlier-stage alternatives. Bitcoin Traders Turn to NEAR for Ecosystem Expansion Bitcoin’s recent consolidation has given traders room to explore altcoins with strong development traction. NEAR Protocol is one such asset drawing attention. Its focus on user-friendly Web3 tools and scaling through sharding has positioned it as a high-potential platform. Developer activity remains strong, and integrations across decentralized apps have expanded. However, despite its technical strengths, NEAR’s price movement has remained relatively subdued. This has led many traders to hedge their exposure with projects offering a clearer path to near-term upside—namely MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Early Positioning Is What Traders Want MAGACOIN FINANC E is becoming one of the most compelling opportunities of 2025. For traders who missed early entries into Ethereum, Solana, or XRP, this token is offering a rare second chance. Its appeal stems not from speculation alone, but from a solid framework that checks the boxes seasoned investors look for. Fixed Token Supply: Capped at 170 billion, removing dilution concerns. Audited by HashEx: Ensuring smart contract security and investor trust. Promo Bonus Active: The limited-time PATRIOTS100X offer provides early investors a major boost. This mix of transparency, community focus, and passive rewards has made MAGACOIN FINANCE a strong alternative for those reallocating from large caps. Traders don’t need a massive stake to see big potential. Even modest buys are being treated as strategic positioning ahead of its listing event. Market Dynamics Are Shifting Crypto is in transition. As large caps face macro-driven pressure, altcoins with clear structures and early momentum are rising. Analysts are watching wallet growth and on-chain staking behavior for MAGACOIN FINANCE—both of which are pointing upward. It’s a signal that investor confidence is growing organically, not through hype, but through consistent strategic entry. Final Thoughts XRP continues to show resilience, and NEAR’s tech remains promising—but MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for one key reason: asymmetric upside. A small investment today may produce returns that rival some of crypto’s biggest gainers, especially as listings and wider adoption unfold in the months ahead.

According to Bloomberg, Jeff has already talked to President Trump twice this month, and Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp met with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in mid-June. In those meetings, Jeff and his space company pushed hard for more government contracts, using Elon’s public fall from grace as their opening. The timing couldn’t have been better for Jeff. Earlier in June, Elon tore into Trump-backed legislation on X and even suggested starting a new political party. Days later, Trump pulled his support for Elon’s NASA nominee, Jared Isaacman, and warned publicly that Elon’s companies might lose their government deals. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump posted. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!” Jeff offers Trump what Elon can’t Elon used to be deep inside Trump’s circle. He helped with transition picks, ran a $250 million super PAC to support Trump’s re-election, and was behind Isaacman’s nomination to lead NASA. That’s gone now. The breakup cleared the way for Jeff, who’s wasted no time getting close. Trump, who wants a crewed mission to the moon during his term, brought that up with Jeff in recent calls, Bloomberg reported. Blue Origin is aiming to land a cargo ship on the moon this year. That’s a strong pitch, but there’s still a problem: SpaceX is way ahead. Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket made it to orbit for the first time in January, but a second flight planned for spring never happened. The next shot is in mid-August. Meanwhile, SpaceX is expected to hit 170 launches in 2025. Most of those are for its satellite arm, Starlink, but many are also tied to government missions. In April, the U.S. Space Force awarded SpaceX $5.9 billion for 28 upcoming launches. United Launch Alliance got less for 19. Blue Origin only landed $2.4 billion for seven. Elon’s rockets are proven and fast. Jeff’ rockets are still trying to catch up. Limp has been pressing Blue Origin to speed things up and compete harder. The company is also aiming at several major future government contracts, including Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile-defense plan and upcoming Mars programs NASA has been asked to pursue. Jeff repairs relationship with the White House Jeff wasn’t always this close to Trump, as you may know. During Trump’s first term, the president accused Jeff of using the Washington Post to attack his presidency and even launched an investigation into Amazon’s Postal Service contracts, saying the company’s discounts were hurting the system. Trump also called Amazon a monopoly. But that tension is fading. Jeff built connections with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. He also backed the Washington Post’s decision not to endorse any candidate, blocking a planned editorial that would’ve supported Vice President Kamala Harris. That move didn’t go unnoticed. Trump has privately praised Jeff for stopping the endorsement, according to people close to him. Jeff also brought cash. Amazon paid $40 million, nearly three times the next highest offer, for a documentary about First Lady Melania Trump. Over 70% of that money is going directly to her, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. And Amazon gave $1 million to Trump’s 2025 inauguration, where Jeff and his fiancée Lauren Sánchez were seated right behind the president. Jeff even invited Trump to his wedding in Venice this weekend. Trump isn’t expected to attend, but the invitation itself was part of the charm offensive. Jeff is doing what Elon can’t right now: keep Trump happy, feed his space ambitions, do as he says, and avoid drama. Whether that’s enough to push Blue Origin ahead of SpaceX in the government contract race is still unclear. But for now, the billionaire who once clashed with Trump is back in the room, and Elon is out.

However, Lightchain AI is climbing for a different, more compelling reason: organic momentum. With $20.9 million raised in its presale and tokens priced steadily at $0.007, Lightchain AI is gaining traction through consistent buyer interest and genuine community support. Unlike the headline-driven spikes of XRP, Lightchain AI’s growth reflects real engagement and confidence in its intelligent blockchain infrastructure. This steady, grassroots momentum is harder to ignore, positioning Lightchain AI as a serious contender in the evolving crypto landscape. XRP Gains Short-Term Boost From Continuous Media Coverage XRP rallied in the past few days, boosted short-term by a surge in media coverage and regulatory developments favoring the token. However, the fact the CEO has appeared on nationally broadcast television in the form of FOX News is giving credibility to Ripple, drawing the attention of AM TV watchers and investors. This media glare comes in the wake of Ripple’s legal win, with the SEC drawing from its appeal after coming to concede that XRP is in fact not a security. In case you missed it- all these have contributed to market sentiment, with XRP trading at $2.29, a 0.43% drop in the past day. Some analysts feel that media exposure can cause short-term price movement, but long-term value will come from wider usage on the technology and regulatory development will be pivotal. Lightchain AI Advances Through Community-Driven Market Activity Lightchain AI is advancing through consistent, community-driven market activity as buyers and builders align around its long-term vision. Unlike short-lived trends, Lightchain’s growth is anchored in its infrastructure and governance design. Through full governance integration, token holders can vote on proposals, protocol upgrades, and development directions—placing decision-making power directly in the hands of the community. Gas optimization ensures that AI tasks are executed efficiently, with dynamic fees based on task complexity, improving scalability and accessibility. Crucially, the original 5% team allocation has been fully reallocated to fund development, grants, and ecosystem incentives—signaling a builder-first approach that resonates with serious participants. As momentum builds, Lightchain AI is proving that transparent, utility-backed projects can thrive through decentralized, community-led growth. Hype Comes and Goes—Belief Is Driving Lightchain AI Forward In a world of shifting market trends, Lightchain AI stands out by building on trust, innovation, and a clear vision for the future.

Following a sharp breakdown below its long-standing consolidation range, ETH found support near the $2,100 level and has since surged 15% from Sunday’s low. The move comes amid improving market sentiment after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran helped ease geopolitical tensions, while broader macroeconomic conditions remain in flux. Related Reading: Bitcoin Buy-Side Pressure Surges: Taker Buy Volume Spikes Sharply This recent bounce has placed Ethereum back into a critical technical zone, where bulls are once again attempting to reclaim control. After spending much of May and June in a sideways range, ETH is showing signs of renewed strength, fueling optimism that the next decisive move could be to the upside. Top analyst Mister Crypto shared a bullish technical outlook, highlighting that Ethereum is getting ready for a breakout. According to his view, the current price structure and momentum suggest ETH may be preparing to challenge previous resistance levels and enter a new phase of expansion. With on-chain activity starting to pick up and broader market confidence slowly returning, Ethereum could be positioning itself as the key altcoin to lead a potential rally in the coming weeks. Ethereum Reclaims Strength Ethereum has surged more than 15% from Sunday’s lows, recovering from sharp losses triggered by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran sent a wave of relief through global markets, with ETH leading the charge among major altcoins. After briefly losing key support levels, bulls are regaining momentum as Ethereum reclaims price levels last seen before the breakdown. This rebound marks a crucial moment for ETH, as it tests the strength of current market sentiment. While macroeconomic uncertainty continues—driven by growing fears of a U.S. recession, rising bond yields, and a cautious Federal Reserve—Ethereum appears to be consolidating for a potential breakout. The broader crypto market remains on edge, with altcoins underperforming Bitcoin, and many investors watching Ethereum closely as the likely catalyst for the long-awaited altseason. According to Mister Crypto, Ethereum is now preparing for a breakout above the $2,800 resistance. This level represents a major psychological and structural barrier, and a decisive move beyond it could redefine ETH’s trajectory for the remainder of the year. Volume is returning, and on-chain data shows rising confidence from long-term holders, signaling a potential shift in trend. If bulls succeed in pushing ETH past this zone, it could trigger renewed interest across the altcoin market and usher in a wave of fresh capital. As Ethereum flirts with this breakout level, its price action in the coming days may very well set the tone for the next phase of the crypto cycle.

The 8-hour chart shows a clean V-shaped recovery, with bulls pushing the price through the 200 SMA ($2,326), reclaiming short-term control. Volume surged on the way up, confirming strong buying interest during the bounce. However, ETH now faces a test near the $2,450–$2,500 zone, where the 50 and 100 SMAs converge. These moving averages, currently acting as resistance, previously played a key role during Ethereum’s consolidation in early June. A successful breakout above this range would open the door to a retest of the $2,700–$2,800 levels, as suggested by top analysts like Mister Crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction For now, price action remains in a neutral consolidation range with a slight bullish tilt. If Ethereum holds above the 200 SMA while building support above $2,400, the bullish case strengthens. However, failure to break above $2,500 could trigger another pullback toward the $2,300 level. The next few sessions will be crucial to determine whether ETH continues its breakout attempt or enters another phase of sideways consolidation amid broader market uncertainty.

Nasdaq-listed SharpLink recently acquired over $460 million in ETH, staking 95% of its holdings—a move that emphasizes long-term conviction. Meanwhile, the Pectra upgrade has enhanced scalability, and open interest in Ethereum futures hit new highs, signaling continued trader engagement. These developments hint at Ethereum’s potential to move past $2,800–$3,000, yet some early-stage investors are starting to shift capital to assets with more explosive upside—like MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as the Wild Card of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention for the same reasons early Bitcoin once did—scarcity, clarity, and unwavering community focus. But unlike Bitcoin, which was once seen as a risk, MAGACOIN FINANCE is entering a matured crypto landscape with higher expectations and a clearer investor profile. At the core of its appeal is a fixed 170 billion token supply, meaning no dilution or inflation threats. The project is 100% community-owned with zero VC overrides and was recently audited by HashEx, adding a layer of security that most early-stage coins can’t offer. A major bonus offer, PATRIOTS100X , is now active and delivering a compelling incentive for new buyers to enter early. This is especially important for those who missed the early Bitcoin window and now want to get in before another asset takes off. Polkadot Sees Scalability Gains as Traders Take Notice Polkadot is also gaining traction, buoyed by its Elastic Scaling upgrade and steady expansion in Web3 infrastructure. The token recently climbed above key resistance zones and is testing the $3.00 barrier. Long-term projections remain positive, especially with increased parachain activity and enhanced staking yields on the horizon. While Polkadot’s progress is notable, many investors believe the biggest gains will come from earlier-phase projects with defined tokenomics and clear momentum. Strategic Buyers Are Positioning Early Analysts tracking wallet distribution and on-chain trends have flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as a clear accumulation play. Key indicators—rising staking deposits, minimal outbound transfers, and growing wallet diversity—are all signs of a token moving from speculative to strategic territory. Veteran traders aren’t just watching—they’re quietly buying. The story here isn’t hype. It’s setup. MAGACOIN FINANCE is exhibiting the same early behaviors seen in historic bull runs. This is why many believe it could mirror Bitcoin’s rise—not in narrative, but in outcome. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s institutional momentum and Polkadot’s tech-focused growth make both strong contenders. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched for something bigger— its potential to become the unexpected leader of 2025 . As more seasoned traders recognize the structural setup, they’re stepping in quietly, before the broader market catches on.

Speaking at the Permissionless crypto conference in New York on Wednesday, June 25, Folkman also announced the launch of the new World Liberty Financial App. Folkman anticipates USD1 becoming the biggest stablecoin by market cap Crypto treasury firms have become popular since the success of Strategy, the company Michael Saylor leads. The firm has over $60 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and a market capitalization surging to over $100 billion. Folkman noted that several companies admire Michael Saylor and his accomplishments. This is particularly true of his strategy and his promotion of companies keeping their crypto reserves. Goodfood Market Corp., Semler Scientific Inc ., and Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. are some companies that have revealed plans or started their own efforts to hold cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, companies are changing the Strategy Playbook by using alternative tokens instead of Bitcoin when implementing their plans. For instance, Upexi raised $100 million to purchase the Solana token last week to keep in its treasury, while Sharplink Inc. holds $425 million worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether. Folkman also weighed on the future potential of World Liberty’s USD1 stablecoin, valued at approximately $2.1 billion. Notably, the largest stablecoin is USDT, from Tether, which has about $156.8 billion in circulation. Based on Folkman’s speculations, they have tackled the challenges that a company will encounter, and now it is just a matter of time before USD1 becomes the biggest stablecoin by market cap. He further anticipated that everyone would come to this conclusion when they witness several developments in the upcoming months. With the Genesis Act , one of the main US stablecoin laws, set to pass into law, digital dollar-pegged assets have become even more attractive to investors. Fintech firms adopt the growing trend of launching stablecoins Apart from public companies showing interest in stablecoins, fintech firms have adopted this trend and aim to follow World Liberty Financial’s lead in launching stablecoins. Fiserv announced that it plans to release a stablecoin, amid increasing interest in the token from US companies as the cryptos move toward the mainstream. The announcement followed the US Senate passing a milestone stablecoin bill that analysts said could represent a turning point in the crypto oversight debate and a breakthrough for a sector stuck in regulatory limbo for years. The fintech company said its stablecoin, FIUSD, will be embedded into its existing banking and payments platform by the end of the year. The company added that FIUSD will use stablecoin infrastructure delivered from Paxos and Circle Internet. Shares of Circle, the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin by market value, were up 15%, and Fiserv and PayPal were up 2.3% and 1.7% respectively. Stablecoins are tied to currencies such as the US dollar and are meant to maintain a consistent value from reserves held. Once a niche corner of crypto, they have become popular for their ability to protect from price swings. Fintech companies and traditional banks use stablecoins more frequently to make cross-border payments easier, speed up transactions, and expand access to digital finance. Analysts at TD Cowen mentioned that they view the launch as a sign of Fiserv’s skill in quickly innovating and utilizing its central role between banks and merchants to connect old and new payment systems.

The price is trading above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

The price is now stuck near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,115 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,480 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,600 resistance. An upside break above the $2,600 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,550 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,440 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $2,390 zone. A clear move below the $2,390 support might push the price toward the $2,310 support.

The popular altcoin has now broken above the $2.20 mark and is just 42% away from its previous all-time high (ATH) of $3.84. The question now is: can XRP keep up this pace, or a pullback is coming? XRP Bounces Strong From Key Support After a period of sluggish price action, XRP recently staged a strong rebound from its critical support zone between $1.92 and $1.95. This move was fueled by improving sentiment across the broader crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin and Ethereum turning bullish in the short term. The $2.19 to $2.20 range acted as a stubborn resistance level in recent sessions. Now that XRP has punched through this zone, it’s likely to flip into a new support area, giving bulls a solid platform to aim for higher targets. Next Key Target: $2.30 to $2.35 The next crucial resistance lies between $2.30 and $2.35. If XRP can clear this hurdle, it opens up the path to revisit May’s high around $2.66, and move closer to the $3 mark in the coming weeks. Despite this promising breakout, XRP’s broader trend on the daily chart still shows a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, a classic sign of an ongoing bearish trend. To truly confirm a shift back to a bullish structure, XRP would need to consistently post higher highs, starting with a decisive move above the $2.35 resistance. Short-Term Outlook: Bullish, But Watch the Levels The recent rally from the June 22nd low has already shown a promising three-wave structure to the upside. While this is encouraging, analysts warn that one more dip remains a possibility, especially if the price fails to hold above the $2.08 support zone. A clean five-wave impulsive move, which would typically signal a stronger, more sustainable uptrend, is what experts are hoping to see next. If that happens, XRP could quickly push towards $2.29 to $2.32.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 03:15:22

This intervention puts pressure on what’s been one of the most profitable carry trades globally. Traders have been borrowing cheap Hong Kong dollars, flipping them into US dollars, and pocketing the difference. That trade just got harder. To stop the drop, the HKMA sold HK$9.4 billion, about $1.2 billion, from its reserves to buy back local currency. This tightens up the cash flowing in the banking system and pushes up interbank lending rates. Since early May, those rates had been scraping near zero. That cheap money fueled carry trades, but now it’s about to get expensive. HKMA pushes back after second straight month of currency pressure This is not the first time they’ve stepped in. The last intervention happened just last month, when the Hong Kong dollar got too strong. Back then, the HKMA had to do the opposite—dump local currency onto the market. That pumped liquidity into the system, sending lending rates even lower. The result? A cheaper Hong Kong dollar, an even wider rate gap with the US, and a golden month for traders. But now, the HKMA is reversing that. They’re pulling liquidity out to lift borrowing costs and make shorting the Hong Kong dollar painful. This will lower the city’s aggregate balance, basically a cash measure banks watch like hawks, to HK$164 billion, according to the authority. That balance had swelled when they last intervened. Now it’s getting cut down. Source: Bloomberg The last time the HKMA had to prop up the local currency this way was May 2023, and it’s no coincidence. The US dollar has been weaker lately, putting unwanted pressure on the peg. The carry trade, driven by the rate gap, made Hong Kong’s currency too appealing to bet against. The gap between one-month US and Hong Kong interest rates hit 3.4% this week, making the trade extremely juicy for global players. Volatility triggers talk, but peg remains firm This sudden back-and-forth has made people nervous about the peg’s future. The Hong Kong dollar’s drop in May 2025 was the steepest since the peg began in 1983, and that’s got some wondering how much longer this system will hold. But there’s no sign of it breaking anytime soon. The currency recovered slightly after the latest action, moving up to HK$7.8492 per US dollar during Thursday morning trading in Asia. The HKMA wants to keep it in the HK$7.75-HK$7.85 band. It’s a rigid system, but one that’s worked for decades—until volatility kicked in hard this year. Back in May, the HKMA had injected a large amount of cash into the financial system when the Hong Kong dollar appreciated too fast. That helped cool things down, but also sent lending costs plunging. Traders used the moment to borrow low and convert to US dollars, feeding the carry trade even more. That’s what made the current reversal necessary. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu said earlier this month that the peg isn’t going anywhere. Speaking to local media in early June, John made it clear: “Hong Kong will maintain its currency’s peg to the US dollar as it is a key success factor.” His comments were aimed at calming speculation around alternative systems. But with markets pushing the currency to both ends of its band in just two months, staying the course might require more firepower, and more interventions like this. Still, the city’s got muscle. As of May, Hong Kong holds $431 billion in foreign currency reserves. That’s enough to keep defending the peg, even if the carry trade keeps pulling in big money from abroad. For now, the HKMA has made its move, traders are recalculating, and the Hong Kong dollar is back inside its cage. How long it stays there is another story.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a primary beneficiary, raising over $10 million in its presale and drawing comparisons to early-stage successes like Shiba Inu. This migration is driven by regulatory uncertainties around XRP and Bitcoin’s slowing momentum, pushing traders toward high-upside opportunities. Why Investors Are Rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE ROI Potential: Analysts project returns of 50x–100x, citing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s capped supply (170 billion tokens), HashEx-audited contracts, and community-driven model. For instance, a $100 investment could yield $6,360 at its $0.007 listing price and up to $909,000 if it reaches $1. Structural Advantages: Unlike VeChain, which targets enterprise solutions, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines meme virality with deflationary tokenomics and staking rewards, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Market Timing: Bitcoin’s consolidation above $105,000 and XRP’s regulatory baggage have accelerated capital reallocation. On-chain data shows “smart money” accumulation in MAGACOIN FINANCE, signaling bullish sentiment. VeChain’s Rally: A Benchmark for MAGACOIN FINANCE? VeChain (VET) surged to a two-year high of $0.726 in late 2024, fueled by enterprise adoption and Bitcoin’s bull run. However, it now faces resistance at $0.03, with recent pullbacks risking its inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Predictions suggest modest 2025 growth to $0.085, constrained by its $120B market cap and regulatory headwinds. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s low entry point ($0.000266 presale) and political branding could amplify its rally potential. Like VeChain in 2021—which saw a 150% surge—MAGACOIN FINANCE leverages scarcity and hype but with greater retail accessibility. Will the Rotation Trigger a VeChain-Like Surge? Similar Catalysts: VeChain’s 2024 rally was partly driven by Bitcoin’s momentum, mirroring MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current tailwinds from crypto’s “altcoin season”. Diverging Fundamentals: VeChain focuses on supply-chain utility, while MAGACOIN FINANCE prioritizes viral growth and staking APY. The latter’s 5000%+ ROI forecasts dwarf VeChain’s 203% projected 2025 return. Risks: VeChain battles resistance and sell-off pressures, whereas MAGACOIN FINANCE’s success hinges on post-listing demand and meme sustainability. Analyst Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE: Targeted for 2000%–5000% gains in 2025, potentially turning $500 into $10,000. VeChain: Conservative $0.085–$0.12 targets by 2025, with longer-term $1–$2 projections by 2040. Conclusion The rotation from XRP and Bitcoin into MAGACOIN FINANCE could indeed ignite a rally reminiscent of VeChain’s 2021 breakout, but with higher upside potential. While VeChain offers steady enterprise-driven growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum, scarcity model, and political narrative position it for explosive, albeit riskier, gains. For investors seeking asymmetric opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a calculated bet on 2025’s altcoin cycle.

This move could allow potential homebuyers to use crypto holdings as reserves when applying for a loan—without needing to convert those digital assets into U.S. dollars. FHFA Director William J. Pulte issued the directive via letter on Wednesday, asking both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore how digital currencies might be treated as part of single-family mortgage loan assessments. The letter calls on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to “prepare a proposal for consideration of cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessments, without conversion of said cryptocurrency to U.S. dollars.” Historic Shift in Mortgage Criteria This order marks a significant departure from traditional mortgage qualification standards, where crypto assets have typically been excluded unless liquidated into fiat currency. The FHFA has overseen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since the 2008 financial crisis, when both entities were placed under federal conservatorship. Since then, the two have provided vital liquidity and stability in the housing market by purchasing loans from lenders, allowing banks to issue more credit. By considering crypto as part of a borrower’s financial profile, the FHFA aims to modernize underwriting practices in line with broader digital asset adoption. Aligning with Pro-Crypto Policy Goals In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Pulte emphasized that this decision was made “after significant studying” and aligns with former President Donald Trump’s ambition to establish the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the world.” The directive also includes a condition: only cryptocurrencies that are “evidenced and stored on a U.S.-regulated centralized exchange subject to all applicable laws” will be eligible for consideration. This restriction is designed to ensure compliance and reduce risks associated with unregulated crypto markets. Broader Acceptance of Crypto in Finance The FHFA’s order reflects a broader trend of digital assets becoming more integrated into mainstream financial practices in the United States. Recent reports from Cointelegraph note that JPMorgan plans to allow select wealth management clients to use crypto-backed products, such as Bitcoin ETFs, as collateral for financing. In another development, Circle’s USDC stablecoin will soon be eligible collateral for futures trading, through a collaboration between Coinbase Derivatives and Nodal Clear. Crypto-backed mortgage lending, though still niche, has already begun to emerge. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, told Cointelegraph that many Bitcoin holders are using digital assets to secure real estate loans without selling their crypto. “Bitcoin holders have used their digital assets as collateral to purchase real estate,” he said. As digital finance continues to evolve, this latest FHFA move signals a shift in how traditional financial institutions might assess and interact with cryptocurrencies going forward.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-26 03:41:50

Link , trading within a $13.02 – $13.51 range after a 13% surge following the partnership announcement, faces resistance at the 20-day EMA of $13.31 amid mixed technical signals. Source: Cryptonews The market cap reached $8.86 billion , with 24-hour volume declining 35.56% to $446.66 million as profit-taking emerged post-announcement. The following analysis was conducted using ChatGPT’s o3 AI model. It synthesized 40 real-time technical indicators, institutional adoption metrics, Oracle network growth data, and partnership developments to assess LINK’s 90-day price trajectory. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Consolidation After Partnership-Driven Rally Chainlink’s current price of $13.05 reflects a -2.76% daily decline from an opening price of $13.42 , establishing a narrow trading range between $13.51 (high) and $13.02 (low), a 3.8% intraday spread indicating moderate volatility after yesterday’s explosive 13% surge. Despite recent partnership-driven momentum, the RSI at 46.81 remains in neutral territory, suggesting balanced buying and selling pressure. This reading indicates room for movement in either direction without extreme overbought or oversold conditions that typically signal reversal points. Source: TradingView MACD indicators present mixed signals with the MACD line at 0.03 slightly above zero, suggesting mild bullish momentum, while the signal line at -0.43 and negative histogram at -0.52 indicate weakening momentum. This divergence often precedes consolidation phases or trend changes. Moving averages create a tiered resistance structure across timeframes. The 20-day EMA at $13.31 sits just 2% above the current price, representing the most accessible resistance target. The 50-day EMA at $13.99 requires 7.2% appreciation, while the 100-day and 200-day EMAs at $14.66 and $15.38 represent 12.3% and 17.9% overhead resistance, respectively. Source: TradingView The proximity to the 20-day EMA suggests that LINK remains in a short-term consolidation phase, with the ability to test higher resistance levels if partnership momentum is sustained quickly. Volume analysis shows moderate activity at 2.19 million LINK traded daily, representing normal participation levels. ATR readings at 11.30 indicate moderate volatility, with current low volatility components suggesting compressed trading ranges that often precede directional breakouts when catalyzed by fundamental developments. Historical Price Context: Oracle Network Pioneer Seeks New Highs Chainlink’s 2025 performance reflects the maturation of decentralized Oracle infrastructure, with price action testing multi-year resistance levels. LINK, trading between $10 – $27 throughout the first half of 2025, has established critical support around $12.50 – $13.00 , where institutional accumulation historically occurs. The current price represents a 75.25% decline from the May 2021 all-time high of $52.88 , though maintaining extraordinary gains of 10,260% from the September 2017 all-time low of $0.1263 . This historical context highlights both the significant correction from peak levels and the transformative long-term appreciation potential. Source: TradingView Recent technical analysis identified a hammer pattern formation that triggered a 15% bounce from weekly lows near $10.95 , demonstrating strong buying interest at lower levels. This recovery established current support structures and confirmed whale accumulation patterns observed throughout 2025. The broader trading range between $10.50 and $18.00 defines LINK’s major technical corridor. Current positioning in the lower-middle portion provides attractive risk-reward dynamics for both tactical and strategic investors. Support & Resistance: Critical Levels Define Partnership-Driven Momentum Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $13.02 , backed by the psychological $13.00 level where buying interest historically materializes. The key support zone extends from $12.50 to $13.00 , representing major technical levels and institutional accumulation areas. Major support lies within the $11.50 – $12.00 range, corresponding to recent whale accumulation zones and historical base-building periods. The strong support level spans $10.00 – $10.50 , representing the historical base where significant institutional interest emerges. Resistance begins immediately at the 20-day EMA at $13.31 , followed by the key resistance at the 50-day EMA of $13.99 . Breaking this level would signal potential trend reversal and open pathways toward the major resistance zone of $14.50 – $15.50 . Source: TradingView The strong resistance zone spans $18.00 – $20.00 , representing previous range highs and significant supply levels that would require sustained institutional adoption momentum to overcome. Breaking above $15.50 would likely trigger momentum expansion toward these higher targets. Current consolidation between $13.00 and $13.50 creates a defined trading range within which directional momentum could emerge rapidly once triggered by continued partnership developments or broader market catalysts. Revolutionary Partnership: 3.5 Billion Users Gain Direct On-Chain Access Mastercard and Chainlink announced a groundbreaking partnership on June 24, 2025, enabling over 3.5 billion cardholders worldwide to purchase cryptocurrencies directly on-chain through secure fiat-to-crypto conversion. This breakthrough is powered by Chainlink’s secure interoperability infrastructure and Mastercard’s trusted global payments network. @chainlink announces historic @Mastercard partnership enabling 3 billion+ cardholders to buy cryptocurrency onchain through seamless fiat-to-crypto conversion eliminating complex barriers. #Chainlink #Mastercard #Crypto https://t.co/SSrILSQ5Tf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 The initiative launches through Swapper Finance , which leverages Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure to facilitate secure communication between off-chain financial systems and on-chain smart contracts. Users can use Mastercard credit or debit cards to buy tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, with crypto deposited directly into their wallets. Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of Blockchain & Digital Assets at Mastercard, emphasized the partnership’s significance: “This is what crypto looks like when it’s ready for the real world. In coming together with Chainlink, we’re at the start of a very exciting journey to truly revolutionize the way we use cards for on-chain finance.” The partnership integrates multiple infrastructure providers, including ZeroHash for compliance and custody, Shift4 Payments for processing, Swapper Finance for user experience, and XSwap for decentralized exchange functionality, all of which utilize the Uniswap protocol. Market Metrics: Fundamental Strength Despite Technical Consolidation Chainlink maintains a market capitalization of $8.97 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $394.95 million , representing a volume-to-market cap ratio of 4.4% . The fully diluted valuation reaches $13.24 billion based on the maximum supply of 1 billion LINK tokens. The circulating supply stands at 678.1 million LINK, representing 67.8% of the maximum supply. The remaining tokens are allocated to ecosystem development and node operator incentives. Source: CoinMarketCap This controlled supply mechanism provides predictable inflation dynamics, supporting long-term value appreciation. Despite recent consolidation pressure, market dominance remains stable at approximately 0.3% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, maintaining LINK’s position among the top 20 digital assets. The 75.25% decline from all-time highs contrasts with the 10,260% gain from all-time lows, highlighting both correction depth and long-term potential. Volume analysis shows a 35.56% decline in daily trading activity following the initial partnership announcement surge, indicating normal profit-taking behavior after significant news-driven appreciation. This consolidation pattern often precedes sustained momentum if fundamental developments continue. Oracle Network Dominance: Infrastructure Layer Driving Adoption Chainlink operates the world’s largest decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to access off-chain data and computation securely. The network has facilitated tens of trillions in transaction value across DeFi, banking, tokenized real-world assets, and cross-chain applications. Major financial institutions, including Swift, Euroclear, Fidelity International, UBS, and ANZ, utilize Chainlink infrastructure for critical operations. Top DeFi protocols, including Aave, GMX, and Lido, depend on Chainlink oracles for secure price feeds and automated execution. Recent network expansion highlights 14 new integrations of 5 Chainlink services across 10 different blockchain platforms, demonstrating versatility and growing adoption across multiple ecosystems. This expansion supports the fundamental thesis that oracle infrastructure becomes increasingly critical as blockchain adoption scales. Mastercard, live for real value.

This scenario requires continued institutional adoption, positive user adoption metrics, and broader crypto market recovery. Source: TradingView Key catalysts include additional major payment processor partnerships, increased on-chain transaction volume through Swapper Finance , and successful navigation of regulatory requirements. Daily volume would need expansion above 3 million LINK to support sustained upward momentum. For full bull case realization, resistance levels at $13.99 , $15.38 , and $18.00 would need sequential clearing with volume confirmation. ChatGPT’s bullish scenario envisions potential appreciation to $25 based on technical pattern completion. Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case – 45% Probability) LINK may continue trading within the $12.50 – $15.50 range pending broader market direction and partnership implementation progress. The 20-day EMA at $13.31 provides near-term resistance while $12.50 support offers downside protection. Source: TradingView This scenario requires steady institutional adoption progress, moderate oracle network growth, and stable broader crypto market conditions. Volume would likely remain around current levels without significant expansion or contraction. Risk management involves monitoring daily closes above $13.50 for bullish momentum confirmation or below $12.50 for bearish breakdown signals toward deeper support levels. Technical Breakdown (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Failure to hold $12.50 support could trigger selling toward $10.50 – $11.50 historical support levels. This scenario would require partnership implementation delays, broader crypto market weakness, or unexpected competitive pressures. Source: TradingView A breakdown below $12.50 with volume expansion would signal a potential deeper correction toward major support zones. Strong support at $10.00 – $10.50 would likely attract renewed institutional interest. Recovery would depend on successful partnership progress, Oracle network adoption metrics, or broader market stabilization, which would provide fundamental support for price recovery. LINK Price Forecast: Infrastructure Layer Meets Mainstream Adoption Chainlink’s current position reflects a unique convergence of technical consolidation, revolutionary partnership announcements, and established oracle network dominance. The 40-signal analysis reveals a cryptocurrency positioned at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized infrastructure. The Mastercard partnership represents a paradigm shift that could drive mainstream cryptocurrency adoption through trusted payment rails. Enabling 3.5 billion cardholders to purchase crypto directly on-chain eliminates traditional barriers and gives Chainlink unprecedented utility demonstration. Technical indicators suggest consolidation after partnership-driven momentum, with mixed signals indicating potential for both continuation and reversal. Current price levels near $13.05 offer attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to Oracle infrastructure and institutional adoption themes. Critical Levels to Monitor Support defense at $12.50 – $13.00 remains crucial for maintaining bullish structure potential, while resistance clearing above $13.99 could indicate momentum expansion toward partnership-driven targets. Daily closes above the 20-day EMA at $13.31 would confirm short-term consolidation completion. Over the next 90 days, investors should monitor Mastercard partnership implementation metrics, additional institutional partnership announcements, Oracle network adoption growth, and broader DeFi market sentiment.

This will allow lawmakers more time to solve the problem before funds run dry. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged Congress to act before the August recess , warning that court decisions on Trump-era tariffs could accelerate the projected X-date. Treasury extends emergency actions to avoid hitting the debt limit Bessent extended the period when the government can use “special accounting measures” to stay under the legal debt limit. The move allows the Treasury Department to temporarily shift funds between federal accounts and pause investments in certain government programs. Moreover, it enables the delay in issuing new debt as it extends the so-called “debt issuance suspension period” through July 24, 2025. Bessent sent a formal letter addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson and other key congressional leaders before the previous suspension period’s expiration on June 27. This will help the government continue making payments without exceeding its borrowing authority . Bessent also repeated his warning in May and urged Congress to act quickly to raise or suspend the debt ceiling before lawmakers leave town for their scheduled August recess. He said these special measures do not solve the underlying problem, despite providing temporary relief. He also said the Treasury will shake investor confidence and damage the US government’s credit rating if it eventually exhausts its ability to pay the government’s bills on time. Bessent’s letter now puts more pressure on Republican leaders in both the House and Senate, who have been trying to finalize a massive tax and spending package but have failed due to internal disagreements over funding priorities. The Treasury may soon find itself without the tools to manage government payments. This could push the US closer to a financial crisis if these lawmakers don’t pass the package or delay action on the debt ceiling. The longer lawmakers delay, the higher the risk that markets will react with volatility and the harder it may become to calm public and investor fears. Tariff court battles could change the debt ceiling deadline Bessent told reporters that the outcome of legal battles surrounding tariffs imposed during the Trump administration could affect the “X-date”. This is because these tariffs have become a significant source of short-term federal revenue. They generated an unprecedented $23 billion in customs duties to boost the Treasury’s cash reserves when the federal government operates under strict borrowing limits and relies on temporary accounting measures to stay solvent. However, a recent US Court of International Trade ruling determined that some of Trump’s tariffs exceeded presidential authority and lacked a valid legal basis. The Treasury may be forced to halt the collection of certain tariffs altogether. Thus, the government could also be required to issue refunds for duties it has already collected. These court decisions can affect the government’s cash position and ability to delay a debt limit breach using internal workarounds. The ripple effects could be a loss of incoming revenue and an actual outflow of funds at a time when every dollar counts. A sudden drop in this revenue due to court-ordered changes could bring the X date closer by weeks and leave Congress with far less time to act than current projections suggest. Treasury signals it will scrap revenge tax as global tax talks advance Meanwhile, the US Treasury Department hints that it may soon abolish the controversial “revenge tax,” as the international tax talks led by the OECD finally appear to be making real headway. Michael Faulkender, the deputy Treasury secretary, said that a global agreement could make a US proposal called Section 899 , which is its provision against countries with a digital tax, unnecessary. Section 899 is an addition to the Trump administration and is widely viewed as retaliatory. It would levy tax penalties on companies and investors in countries the US believes discriminate against American technology giants, like Google, Apple, and Amazon, with digital services taxes. Several US allies, such as Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, have adopted some of these taxes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This report systematically reviews technological advancements in institutional applications and credit mechanisms, delving into the policy-driven surge of institutional DeFi as regulatory tailwinds in the U.S. ease constraints on digital assets. A new DeFi summer is emerging, not for retail investors, but for institutions. Central to this shift, HTX has recently doubled down its focus on the DeFi sector. Following the listing of SPK (Spark), the flagship part of MakerDAO’s Endgame roadmap, HTX continues to offer users access to high-yield DeFi opportunities while connecting institutional capital and on-chain liquidity. HTX Stands at the DeFi’s Forefront HTX is ramping up its DeFi expansion as institutional adoption gains pace. Recent trading data highlights a renewed enthusiasm in the DeFi market. Over the past week, UNI (Uniswap, an Ethereum-based DEX) surged by 31% while RAY (Raydium, a Solana-based DEX) jumped 39%. Lending protocols like AAVE and SNX (Synthetix) gained 13% and oracle leader LINK (Chainlink) added 10%. Notably, real world assets (RWA) token ONDO experienced significant interest, driven by capital inflows from the U.S.. HTX has also made strategic moves into emerging ecosystems. Post-listing, Sui-based tokens like BLUE and CUTES demonstrated strong performance, underscoring HTX’s ability to identify high-potential assets in nascent DeFi ecosystems. Regulatory Relaxation: Paving the Way for Institutional Entry According to HTX Research, two key developments in 2025 catalyzed the institutional wave for DeFi: the repeal of SAB 121 and the advancement of the GENIUS Act. These policies provide a solid foundation for traditional financial institutions to legally issue stablecoins and participate in on-chain finance. Against this backdrop, Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald partnered with DeFi lending platform Maple Finance to execute the first on-chain Bitcoin loan transaction. The bank deposited its acquired BTC into Maple and earned an annualized yield of 4–6%. Symbolically, Cantor Fitzgerald’s helmsman is none other than U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, signaling growing confidence in DeFi’s institutional future and a future of “on-chain mainstream finance”. On-Chain Credit Rises Along with Institutional DeFi Institutional-grade applications in DeFi are rapidly taking shape. Maple Finance’s TVL has surpassed $2 billion and continues to grow. Moreover, MakerDAO’s Spark protocol allocated $50 million directly to Maple, building on-chain lending products that generate a stable yield of 10-17%. This establishes a multi-step credit loop that mirrors the complexity and yield sophistication of traditional finance. HTX Research identifies a wave of technical and structural upgrades transforming DeFi into an institutional-grade financial layer: ● Sybil Resistance and On-Chain Trust : Projects like 3Jane form a decentralized credit rating system combining ZK and FICO scores to offer non-collateralized USDC loans to small- and medium-sized institutions. ● Structured Debt Instruments (CLOs) : Currently, several DeFi protocols, such as Maple, are developing on-chain collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), issuing different classes of debt securities—senior and junior—to meet investors’ varied risk preferences and offering greater liquidity and transparency through smart contracts. ● Credit Default Swaps (CDS) : Aave’s Umbrella module and Opium’s CDS products reduce counterparty default risk in DeFi through automatic execution and tradable agreements. ● Delegated Lending and Restaking Insurance : Maple’s “pool delegate + sub-leading” model expands the coverage and layering of lending services. SyrupUSDC boosts capital efficiency through a “restaking + insurance pool” design. The Future of DeFi: High-Dimensional AMMs and Modular Stablecoins With institutions now actively engaging with DeFi, the infrastructure must evolve. Platforms like Uniswap V3 and Curve , though dominant, often face challenges in multi-asset environments. To address this, Paradigm has recently proposed the Orbital AMM , which leverages spherical and toroidal invariants in high-dimensional space to enable single-pool, multi-assets trading, significantly reducing slippage and maximizing capital efficiency. Meanwhile, Spark, now surpassing $5.9 billion TVL, is fast becoming the heart of MakerDAO’s Endgame strategy. It’s building an on-chain yield and stablecoin engine through partnerships with Maple, EigenLayer, and others.

Fresh on-chain data suggests that the short-term holder (STH) floor for BTC has been steadily rising toward the $100,000 level. Bitcoin STH Floor Approaching $100,000 According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor unchained, Bitcoin’s STH Realized Price has been making its slow grind up toward the psychologically important $100,000 level. Notably, the analyst had earlier dubbed this metric as the “fault line” to watch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Binary CDD Hints At Healthy Consolidation, Not A Top For the uninitiated, the STH Realized Price represents the average price at which all Bitcoin held for less than 155 days was acquired. It acts as both a key psychological and technical support level. When the market price stays above it, STH are in profit and more confident, whereas if it falls below, fear and selling pressure often increase. Currently, the STH Realized Price hovers around $98,000. The analyst notes that each $500 rise in the STH Realized Price effectively resets the “new buyers’ comfort floor.” As this metric nears six figures, the mental stop-loss for newer investors also moves upward. The following chart illustrates two recent instances where BTC bounced sharply after touching the blue STH Realized Price line. This price action suggests a bullish structure, where selling pressure diminishes as soon as BTC revisits its average cost basis. Meanwhile, the premium – the difference between BTC’s spot price and STH Realized Price – currently hovers around 7.2%. A shrinking premium, typically under 10%, has historically signalled reduced market froth and often preceded the next leg up once open interest began to rebuild. On the long-term side, the long-term holder (LTH) Realized Price remains largely unchanged at $32,000, roughly one-third of the STH Realized Price. The analyst observes that these long-term coins are likely held in cold storage, indicating “strong hands” with little incentive to sell. They concluded: The blue line is climbing relentlessly; as long as BTC lives above it, the prevailing tide is still higher-lows, higher-highs. Lose it on a daily close, and we get our first real gut-check since April – otherwise the bull engine is merely cooling its cylinders. Experts Predict New High For BTC As BTC’s STH Realized Price continues to surge higher – resulting in a higher floor price for the digital asset – several crypto experts seem to agree that the cryptocurrency may soon reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months.

By improving validator limits and increasing scalability, Ethereum is setting the foundation for broader ecosystem growth. But instead of reigniting a price rally, this technical shift has left Ethereum consolidating around the $2,500–$2,600 zone — prompting traders to look elsewhere for higher upside. While Ethereum remains essential to the smart contract space, the momentum has shifted toward lower-cap opportunities with cleaner setups. One name leading that pivot is MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP’s Regulatory Milestone Drives Confidence Meanwhile, XRP is riding a separate wave of transformation. With the long-running SEC case nearing resolution and an XRP ETF approval potentially on the horizon, market sentiment is turning sharply bullish. XRP recently bounced off support in the $2.20 range and is flirting with breakouts toward $2.80–$3.00. On-chain data shows increased institutional accumulation and a dramatic spike in payment volume, which supports Ripple’s ambitions to capture a greater share of global remittances. Still, many XRP holders are hedging or complementing their positions with newer assets — and MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught that attention. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the Strategic Choice for 2025 While Ethereum, XRP, and SEI each offer compelling narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly becoming the most watched altcoin among early-stage traders. What sets it apart isn’t hype — it’s mechanics. The 170 billion token supply is permanently capped, which immediately sets a boundary for dilution and long-term value. Traders are also seeing disciplined on-chain behavior: wallet growth is strong, transfers are stable, and staking activity shows investors are willing to hold — not just flip. More importantly, MAGACOIN FINANCE has done something few meme-origin projects manage: it’s won trust. With a full audit from HashEx, zero VC interference, and real traction in staking adoption, it’s positioning itself as a rare early-entry token with staying power. Investors who act now can also access a limited-time 100% bonus, increasing token allocation and enhancing early ROI potential. This has led to accelerated accumulation — and analysts say the setup could mirror early cycles of other explosive performers like Shiba Inu and Solana. SEI Gains Momentum as Layer 1 Activity Builds SEI, the performance-focused Layer 1 blockchain, has started to attract retail and developer interest again following a string of upgrades and DeFi partnerships. Its speed and low latency appeal to applications requiring fast execution, and recent price movements suggest early bullish sentiment. SEI is carving out its own niche in the competitive L1 space, but it still faces significant headwinds from better-known chains like Solana and Avalanche. As such, SEI is being seen as a speculative pick — with many traders rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE, where early accumulation signals a more asymmetric bet. Final Thoughts As Ethereum stabilizes after its upgrade, traders are broadening their altcoin exposure. XRP’s regulatory progress and SEI’s technical promise are creating optimism, but the clearest early-stage opportunity may be MAGACOIN FINANCE. With its capped supply, staking momentum, and strategic on-chain growth, it’s becoming the kind of asset that seasoned traders position for before the wave hits.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has officially ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two of America’s biggest government-backed mortgage companies, to start recognizing cryptocurrency as an asset when people apply for home loans. On social media platform X (formerly Twitter), FHFA Director Bill Pulte announced this decision. He explained that after careful study, and in line with President Trump’s goal to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must now prepare their businesses to accept cryptocurrency as part of mortgage applications. After significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump’s vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world, today I ordered the Great Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. SO ORDERED pic.twitter.com/Tg9ReJQXC3 — Pulte (@pulte) June 25, 2025 In simple terms, this means that if you own crypto like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP, it could be counted as part of your assets when applying for a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Why This Matters This is important because it marks the first time U.S. government-supported mortgage firms have officially recognized crypto as a financial asset. Until now, crypto was often seen as too risky or too new for traditional financial products like home loans. Now, with this new rule, it could open the door for millions of crypto holders in the U.S. to use their digital assets to qualify for mortgages. It’s another clear sign that crypto is becoming more mainstream and accepted by big institutions. What’s Next? This move will likely push private banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo to follow suit. If government-backed firms are doing it, the private sector won’t want to be left behind. This could lead to new crypto-related financial products, loans, and services in the near future. There’s also talk of banks launching their own stablecoins and expanding crypto services like trading and custody for their customers.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 04:03:51

The update was shared by WLF co-founder Zak Folkman on June 25 in a Blockworks interview during the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, as reported by Reuters. The audit, which is expected to be completed in a few days, will provide details on the reserves backing USD1, which has grown to a $2.2 billion market cap since launch in March. The stablecoin is backed by U.S. dollar deposits, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries. It runs Ethereum ( ETH ), BNB Chain ( BNB ), and TRON ( TRX ), with BitGo acting as the custodian. Folkman said WLF will begin publishing monthly reserve reports going forward. WLF is also preparing to roll out a mobile app designed to make using crypto simpler for everyday investors. “We’re going to have very transparent auditing from a financial level,” Folkman said. You might also like: Alchemy Pay integrates World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin He also hinted that WLFI, the platform’s non-tradable governance token, could soon become tradable. “If you pay attention over the next couple of weeks, I think everyone’s going to be very, very happy,” he added. WLFI currently allows holders to vote on protocol changes but is not listed on exchanges. Although WLFI and USD1 have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for Trump’s family business , they have also come under fire from lawmakers and critics. The timing of Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures has been questioned by ethics watchdogs, particularly as his administration rolls back regulatory oversight in the industry. The Trump family allegedly pocketed over $130 million after reducing their ownership of WLF from 60% to 40% in June, a move that reportedly brought in a total of about $190 million. Despite the criticism, adoption continues. The stablecoin has been gaining traction among institutional users. USD1 was used in a $2 billion investment in Binance by MGX, a UAE-based firm in March. Earlier in June, a $4 million USD1 airdrop reached over 85,000 wallets, boosting awareness and confidence in the stablecoin’s infrastructure. Thanks to new tools, growing demand, and an expanding user base, WLF appears to be establishing USD1 as a major player in the stablecoin market.

In the last 24 hours, its price has jumped over 19% to $0.63, with trading volume soaring 153% to $285.65 million. The coin has also climbed to the 1 spot on the trending crypto list. According to analyst Kim H. Wong , this surge is an important milestone for Pi Coin, especially with Pi2Day just three days away. The event is expected to bring updates on the project’s progress, ecosystem growth, and AI integration. If Pi breaks above the $0.65 resistance, it could quickly rise to the $0.80 to $1 range. With its all-time high at $3 and a recent low of $0.40, Pi Coin still has room to move higher. Analyst Joe Swanson added that this breakout is happening exactly as he expected, and it might be the beginning of a longer rally, one that could gain even more strength as Pi2Day 2025 approaches. Technicals Show Bullish Signs for Short-term Pi Network’s charts show a neutral trend overall, but there are signs of short-term strength. Short-term moving averages (10, 20, and 30-day) are mostly showing buy signals, pointing to a possible upward move. However, the longer-term averages (50 and 100-day) are still flashing sell signs, so the long-term trend remains weak for now. What To Expect On Pi2Day? The rally comes as excitement builds around a possible GenAI announcement on June 28. The Core Team is also expected to reveal major ecosystem updates. Whale activity is also driving the price as one wallet has bought over $173M worth of Pi, likely a big institutional player. The community is waiting for the launch of KYC Sync, making it easier for users to link their ID between the Pi App and Browser. This move pushes millions closer to full Mainnet migration. Will A Correction Follow Next? However, some analysts warn that Pi’s recent rally could be short-lived. While hype and technical momentum are driving the surge, a correction may be on the horizon. Additionally, over 268 million PI tokens are set to unlock in July, the biggest release until 2027, which could put downward pressure on the price. Dr. Altcoin recently shared that the recent Israel-Iran ceasefire is a positive signal for Pi.

Further, Coinbase will serve as the fund’s custodian, and Bank of New York Mellon as the administrator.

Early this month, the regulator requested spot SOL ETF issuers to update their S-1 filings by June and clarify procedures for in-kind redemptions. Invesco ETF Filing – A Clear Tailwind for Solana Per the S-1 registration statement, Invesco has proposed the planned ETF to directly hold Solana, similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. The fund will be traded under the ticker symbol QSOL. The recent flurry of filings to track the price of Solana, the sixth-largest crypto by market cap, sets off a wave of optimism across the sector that saw Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals and BTC’s new highs in the recent past. Additionally, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst James Seyffart predicted that there is a 95% odds of Solana and other altcoin ETF approvals this year. “Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected,” he said in May , adding that the approvals are “more likely” to be in early Q4, 2025. Growing Solana Activity on CME Signals Imminent ETF Launch Per a recent report, Solana activity on CME had hit record highs, signalling strong institutional positioning.

Franklin Templeton’s application is currently under review by the SEC. The commission has opened a public comment period, as part of the review, to allow people to submit feedback. Analysts, on the other hand, have grown bullish on SOL, as its price action reflects ETF optimism. According to a trader Cipher X, “Solana ETFs approval chances are 80% by July.” The pseudonymous trader expects a repricing to follow and projects that SOL could deliver a monthly move of 40% to 50% following the ETF catalyst. $SOL is at a very crucial support level right now. If the $138-$140 level holds, SOL could rally towards $190-$200 by July. In case the support level didn't hold, I'm placing some bids at $130.

On the geopolitical front, US officials expected to meet Iranian counterparts next week and the ceasefire between Iran and Israel appeared to be holding for now.

The market is now betting on a convergence of two trends: dovish Fed commentary and retail’s accelerating rotation into digital assets, traders say. “Crypto will continue its bullish trend,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “Institutional purchases are picking up, and Jerome Powell’s comments hinting at rate cuts have flipped investor sentiment quickly.” Powell this week said rate adjustments remain on the table, contingent on successful trade deals and softening inflation, words that markets took as code for a late-2025 pivot. At press time, bitcoin was trading over $107,800, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Ether ETH is holding at $2,480 with a 1.8% gain. Solana’s SOL SOL, dogecoin DOGE, XRP XRP and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB showed gains under 1%, but could be next to move if BTC and ETH prices further recover. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich said that the overall market capitalization had previously dipped below its 200-day moving average and rebounded sharply, “confirming that level as new support.” Bitcoin also reclaimed its 50-day average, signaling that momentum may accelerate if sentiment holds, he noted, adding that BTC remains about 5% below its recent highs and is lagging behind traditional tech benchmarks, such as the Nasdaq 100, which has just hit fresh all-time highs. “If crypto-related equities maintain this pace, they may soon catch up with traditional finance,” he said. Meanwhile, underlying demand is strengthening. eToro data shows U.S. retail investors are increasing crypto exposure amid a weakening dollar and rising global uncertainty, with 58% reportedly rebalancing their portfolios to favor digital assets.

Donald Trump’s Shortlist Just Dropped appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tensions between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are heating up again. With Powell’s term set to end in May 2026, Trump is reportedly thinking about announcing a replacement much earlier. According to Wall Street Journal journalist Nick Timiraos , Trump is frustrated with how slowly the Fed is cutting interest rates. However, naming someone too early could backfire, as that person might face more public pressure and be less likely to get the job in the end. Who is the Next FED Chair? SCOOP: As President Trump remains furious at Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he has started deliberating to make his choice of chair and announce it to the world months before Powell's term ends. On the rise in his considerations for Fed Chair are loyalists but with their own… — Brian Schwartz (@schwartzbWSJ) June 25, 2025 While Trump hasn’t officially named his pick, he said during a NATO summit press conference that he’s narrowed it down to “three or four people.” Among the top contenders are known Trump loyalists: Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, Chris Waller, and David Malpass. Additionally, Scott Bessent is being pushed as a strong candidate. These candidates are seen as more likely to support Trump’s push for faster rate cuts and stronger economic growth. [post_titles_links postid=”474867″] Can Trump Fire Jerome Powell ? Even though Trump has hinted at firing Powell, it’s not that simple. A recent Supreme Court ruling confirmed that the Fed operates differently from other government agencies, which means Powell’s job is more secure. During his first term, Trump also thought about removing Powell but backed off after markets reacted badly. This time, he’s been more open, even posting online that he “might change [his] mind” about firing him. A Battle Over FED Interest Rates The disagreement between Trump and Powell mainly revolves around interest rates and inflation. Trump wants the Fed to cut rates to help the economy grow, but Powell is holding firm, saying Trump’s tariff plans could drive up prices. With only 11 months left in Powell’s term, the decision on who leads the Fed next could have a big impact on the U.S. economy, especially if Trump returns to the White House. In short, Trump wants change at the top of the Fed, but legal limits, market reactions, and careful timing could make that tricky.

Trump wants faster interest rate cuts for economic growth, while Powell prioritizes stable prices, citing concerns that Trump’s tariffs could fuel inflation.

This week, asset manager Invesco became the ninth firm to file for a spot Solana ETF, aiming to track the cryptocurrency’s market performance alongside several major competitors. At the same time, analysts and investors are pointing to Solana’s expanding potential beyond speculative use cases, with growing support for its role in the long-term development of tokenized capital markets. Invesco Joins Race for Solana ETFs, Paving Way for a Possible Altcoin ETF Summer Asset manager Invesco has filed for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) in partnership with Galaxy Digital. The filing makes Invesco the ninth contender seeking regulatory approval to launch a spot Solana ETF, reflecting a growing appetite to expand crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF would directly hold SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain, which currently ranks as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trading at approximately $145.81. The filing outlines that the ETF aims to mirror the spot price of Solana and would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker “QSOL.” With the explosive success of spot Bitcoin ETFs following their long-awaited launch in early 2024 — and a more modest reception for Ethereum ETFs later that year — asset managers are now probing the market’s appetite for altcoin-based funds. Solana, known for its high-speed and low-cost blockchain network, has emerged as the leading candidate for this next wave of ETF innovation. Joining heavyweights like VanEck, Grayscale, Bitwise, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares, Invesco’s entry into the fray signals growing institutional confidence in Solana's long-term value proposition. These firms are all betting that the demand for Solana exposure — especially via regulated and accessible investment vehicles — is substantial enough to warrant SEC approval. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve Solana ETF applications as early as July, well ahead of the final decision deadline of Oct. 10. Seyffart’s analysis, backed by Bloomberg senior ETF strategist Eric Balchunas, assigns a 90% probability to approval, suggesting that momentum behind these filings is rapidly gaining traction. “Get ready for a potential altcoin ETF summer with Solana likely leading the way,” Balchunas noted. Coinbase Custody and Staking Provisions A notable feature of the Invesco Galaxy Solana ETF is its custodial and staking structure. The fund will use Coinbase Custody to securely hold its underlying SOL assets. Furthermore, the filing reveals that the ETF may occasionally stake a portion of its assets through “trusted staking providers.” Staking — locking up tokens to help secure the network in exchange for yield — has become an increasingly popular strategy among crypto investors seeking passive returns. The ETF would receive additional SOL tokens as staking rewards, which the filing states could be treated as taxable income to the trust. This staking provision aligns with similar updates made by competing Solana ETF applicants earlier this month. By integrating staking, these ETFs aim to enhance yield potential for investors, a move that could make them more attractive relative to traditional crypto funds. The wave of Solana ETF filings comes at a time of renewed optimism in the US crypto sector. The Trump administration has signaled its intent to reduce regulatory barriers for digital assets, a shift that has already catalyzed billions of dollars in institutional Bitcoin investment and sent prices to new all-time highs. This deregulatory stance appears to have emboldened asset managers to move forward with ETF products that just months ago seemed politically and legally infeasible. The push for Solana ETFs mirrors the aggressive expansion of crypto integration into traditional finance, as public companies continue to raise capital for long-term digital asset holdings. Race to the Finish: Who Will Win the SOL ETF Game? The simultaneous nature of the nine filings suggests that, if approved, all Solana ETFs will launch concurrently — likely to avoid giving any single firm a first-mover advantage. The list of current bidders now includes: Invesco & Galaxy Digital Grayscale VanEck Bitwise Fidelity Franklin Templeton 21Shares Canary Capital While all of these issuers — except Canary — have already launched spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, Canary has stood out for its aggressive push to introduce ETFs tracking a broader range of altcoins. Whether the SEC will greenlight all applications remains to be seen, but analysts believe concurrent approval is the most probable scenario. A greenlight from regulators could mark a watershed moment not only for Solana but for altcoins more broadly. It would also validate Solana's increasing prominence in the decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible token (NFT), and Layer 1 blockchain sectors — areas where it has increasingly challenged Ethereum’s dominance. For institutional and retail investors alike, a regulated Solana ETF offers a safer, more convenient way to gain exposure without navigating the complexities of self-custody or crypto exchanges. If this wave of ETF approvals materializes, the summer of 2025 may be remembered as the beginning of the “Altcoin ETF Era,” with Solana leading the charge. Solana Dips Slightly After Session Highs as Syncracy Capital’s Watkins Renews Long-Term Bullish Outlook Solana’s native token, SOL, saw a minor pullback on Tuesday — after briefly touching $147.73 earlier in the session. The dip came amid heightened trading volume and renewed commentary from Syncracy Capital Co-Founder Ryan Watkins, whose latest remarks are reinforcing bullish narratives around Solana’s role in the future of the crypto economy. The session’s high and subsequent retracement illustrate a common pattern among top-performing crypto assets that are seeing both institutional interest and macro-level validation. In Solana’s case, those tailwinds appear to be growing stronger despite near-term price softness. Watkins: Solana to Lead the “Tokenization of Everything” The latest momentum in market discussion came after Ryan Watkins revisited his bold May forecast, which positioned the competition between Solana and Hyperliquid as the defining contest in the next phase of the blockchain economy. In a new post on X (formerly Twitter) published June 25, Watkins asserted that Solana now appears poised to lead the “tokenization of everything” — a phrase increasingly associated with the digitization of real-world assets, financial instruments, and equities on permissionless blockchains. Watkins’s thesis contrasts Solana’s future with that of Hyperliquid, another high-performance chain, which he sees dominating the perpetual futures space. His bifurcated vision underscores two key narratives gaining traction in the broader digital asset landscape: the migration of capital markets onto public blockchains and the institutional appetite for decentralized derivatives. Back in May, Watkins speculated that the winner of the Solana-Hyperliquid race could eventually mature into a platform worth between $100 billion and $500 billion, depending on how successfully it absorbs market share from both traditional finance and competing Layer-1 networks. This bold projection now carries added weight given recent developments: record-breaking CME Futures volume for SOL and the sustained influx of institutional investors seeking exposure to alternative Layer-1 blockchains. Watkins’s remarks are seen as a reinforcement of the narrative that Solana is no longer just a high-speed alternative to Ethereum, but a core player in a future financial system increasingly governed by decentralized protocols. CME Futures Volume Signals Institutional Momentum Perhaps most telling of Solana’s increasing institutional legitimacy is the record futures activity on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The open interest in SOL futures recently hit a high of 1.75 million contracts, reflecting a significant uptick in participation from sophisticated investors and hedge funds. This level of volume places SOL alongside Ethereum and Bitcoin as one of the few cryptocurrencies with strong, sustained institutional engagement. Market observers have noted that this surge in futures trading activity is likely to underpin price stability and may even lead to further price discovery, especially if coupled with a favorable macro environment and supportive regulatory developments. Despite the brief cooldown from session highs, technical indicators remain favorable for Solana . The $144–$145 zone is holding as short-term support, while bulls continue eyeing the $148 to $150 range as the next major resistance band. Traders are also watching for a breakout past the psychological $150 level, which could confirm a broader bullish continuation pattern that’s been forming since early June. Solana’s Position in the Tokenization Race Solana’s efficient transaction processing, low fees, and growing developer ecosystem make it an ideal candidate for powering large-scale tokenization of assets. From stablecoins to real-world assets like stocks and real estate, multiple projects are already experimenting with bringing financial instruments onchain using Solana’s infrastructure. This is further bolstered by the growing interest from traditional financial institutions and asset managers. With major players like Franklin Templeton already issuing tokenized funds on Solana and a possible Solana ETF approval on the horizon, the network’s institutional footprint is expected to expand significantly.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-26 05:30:00

Speaking at the Permissionless conference hosted by Blockworks in Brooklyn, Folkman reportedly said the audit, completed by an independent accounting firm, will be published soon . The move comes as the firm tries to bolster trust in its financial infrastructure while facing intense political scrutiny. Folkman also teased the possibility of future changes to the platform’s governance token, WLFI, which currently cannot be traded. “I don’t want to give away too much, but if you pay attention over the next couple of weeks, I think everyone is going to be very, very happy,” he told the audience when asked about potential token liquidity. @zakfolkman —co-founder of @worldlibertyfi is talking about $WLFI “Yeah, so, first things first.

The token grants holders voting rights on network proposals and roadmap decisions, but not ownership stakes. Earlier this month, public disclosures revealed that Trump personally received $57.35m from WLFI token sales and still holds 15.75b tokens in the venture. The project has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and ethics watchdogs, who argue it raises serious concerns over conflicts of interest. They point to the timing, as Trump has supported deregulatory measures in crypto while benefiting financially from the sector. In January, the Trump Organization said the former president’s business interests are managed through a trust overseen by his children. WLF Bets on Simplicity to Drive Mainstream Adoption Folkman said the company’s upcoming app is aimed at making digital assets more accessible to mainstream users. The platform will integrate stablecoin payments and wallet functionality. It is designed with a simple interface to encourage wider adoption. Meanwhile, World Liberty’s rapid fundraising, fueled by token sales and strong brand visibility, has made it a significant player. This rise comes during a politically sensitive year for the crypto sector. However, questions persist. Observers are unsure how much transparency and oversight the firm is prepared to accept.

This is a major shift in federal housing finance and aligns with President Donald Trump’s vision of positioning the US as a leader in crypto innovation. Only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges will be considered to ensure compliance. On the other hand, the UK is tightening restrictions. Barclays announced a ban on crypto purchases via its credit cards, due to consumer protection concerns. On the legislative front, Senator Cynthia Lummis is very optimistic that two key crypto bills — the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts — could pass by year-end. Overall, these developments shed some light on growing divergence in regulatory approaches between the US and UK during a time of global institutional adoption of digital assets. FHFA Backs Crypto for Home Loans The US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) directed mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals for recognizing cryptocurrency as a form of asset in mortgage loan risk assessments. In a letter that was issued Wednesday, FHFA director William J. Pulte instructed the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to explore incorporating crypto holdings into risk assessments for single-family mortgage loans without requiring conversion of those assets into US dollars. This is a big shift in federal housing policy, as digital assets have typically not been factored into traditional mortgage evaluations unless liquidated into fiat currency. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under federal conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, and are key players in the US housing finance system. Their ability to purchase mortgages from lenders has long helped maintain liquidity and stability in the housing market. Pulte explained that the move comes after extensive study and aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of positioning the US as a global hub for crypto innovation. Importantly, Pulte’s letter specifies that only cryptocurrencies held on US-regulated centralized exchanges and subject to relevant laws should be considered. This cautious approach ensures regulatory compliance while acknowledging the growing role of crypto in the financial ecosystem. The decision was made amid broader trends indicating increasing institutional acceptance of digital assets as legitimate collateral. JPMorgan , for instance, is preparing to let some of its wealth management clients use crypto-based financial products like Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for financing. Additionally, Coinbase Derivatives and clearinghouse Nodal Clear are planning to make Circle’s USDC stablecoin eligible as collateral for futures trading beginning next year. While crypto-backed mortgages are still a niche offering, their use is expanding. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Bitcoin lending platform Ledn, said that many crypto investors have successfully leveraged Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase property without having to sell their holdings. Barclays Blocks Crypto Credit Card Purchases While US financial institutions might be opening up to crypto, Barclays, one of the United Kingdom’s leading banks, will begin blocking cryptocurrency transactions made through its Barclaycard credit cards starting Friday. This is due to the inherent risks tied to digital assets. The bank stated that the move is driven by concerns over the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulatory protections for consumers. According to a notice on its website, Barclays stated that falling crypto prices could leave customers in unmanageable debt, especially given that crypto assets are not covered by the Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme if something goes wrong. A notice of Barclays website Barclays allowed crypto purchases via its credit cards since at least 2018, giving customers access to crypto markets through major exchanges. Their latest announcement is a huge reversal in policy from a bank that services over five million credit card accounts in the UK. The ban comes during a time of broader debate in the UK over whether additional restrictions should be imposed on using credit to purchase cryptocurrencies. On May 2, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a discussion paper seeking feedback on whether these kinds of transactions should face tighter controls. The Payments Association, a London-based group representing the payments industry, responded critically to the FCA’s suggestion by arguing that it unfairly likens crypto investments to gambling. They pointed out that consumers should have the autonomy to make informed financial decisions within existing credit limits. The Payments Association also mentioned that credit card restrictions already exist for high-risk investments, including crypto. In some cases, banks even block cash purchases of crypto, making credit cards a last resort for some users. However, buying digital assets with a credit card can come at a steep cost. Bankrate reports that many credit card issuers categorize these transactions as cash advances, which often result in higher fees and interest rates. GENIUS and CLARITY Acts Gain Momentum Part of the reason why the US is warming up to crypto could be its recent regulatory progress. In fact, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis said she expects Congress to pass two major crypto bills related to stablecoins and digital asset market structure by the end of 2025. At the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C., Lummis shared some details about the ongoing progress of the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act in the House of Representatives and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in the Senate. While she hopes the legislation will pass before the end of this calendar year, she stated she would be “extremely disappointed” if they were not passed by 2026. Lummis chairs the Senate Banking Committee’s digital asset subcommittee, and acknowledged the political difficulty of securing bipartisan support for crypto bills. At a hearing on Tuesday, she pointed out concerns that legislation might benefit individuals with connections to the current administration. She believes it is very important to ensure both sides of the aisle feel involved in the process to avoid partisan resistance. While some Democrats have supported crypto-related legislation, including the GENIUS Act — which passed the Senate with 68 votes, 18 from Democrats — others are still a bit hesitant . Their concerns center around President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the crypto sector, including his issuance of meme coins, his ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and political donations from digital asset industry executives. The path to passage in the House is still uncertain. Lummis’s timeline contrasts with that of Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, He predicted in May that the GENIUS Act could be ready before the congressional recess in August. Trump is also ready to sign the bill without amendments if it passes swiftly through the House. However, with Republicans holding only a slim majority, both the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts will need at least some Democratic support to move forward.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-26 05:32:01

The launch, which took place during a live demonstration with Tawasul Transport, featured the first official ride paid for using AE Coin, signaling the country’s intention to integrate blockchain technology into everyday services. While the pilot program currently supports AE Coin, it has sparked significant interest in the potential for other digital assets to be included, particularly XRP. Known for its fast transaction speeds and institutional use cases, XRP has already gained considerable traction in the UAE through Ripple’s expanding presence. Crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) highlighted the development online, pointing to XRP’s growing footprint in the region and voicing the broader community’s hope that XRP could soon be used for such public-facing transactions.

It recently became the first blockchain-based payments provider to receive regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This milestone has positioned Ripple favorably for future integrations within the region’s evolving financial and service infrastructure. While XRP is not currently included in the Abu Dhabi taxi payment system, Ripple’s momentum suggests that expansion into this space is plausible. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s technology is already being adopted within the UAE government frameworks. The Dubai Land Department has integrated XRP for tokenized land deed transfers , signaling early confidence in the asset’s utility for secure, real-time settlement of high-value transactions. Additionally, Webus International, a Chinese AI-driven transport firm, announced plans to build a $300 million XRP reserve fund , aimed at supporting digital innovation in global mobility sectors, including luxury transport. Strategic Fit for Urban Innovation The adoption of crypto payments for taxis comes at a time when the UAE is accelerating efforts to modernize transportation and shift toward a digital economy. The initiative is part of a broader strategy aimed at enhancing sustainability, reducing cash dependency, and embracing emerging technologies across public services. XRP is becoming a dominant asset in Asia , and although AE Coin was the first to be used in the taxi pilot, the move lays foundational groundwork for broader crypto adoption. Given Ripple’s growing regulatory acceptance and practical deployments across the UAE, XRP remains a likely candidate for future inclusion in transportation-related payment systems.

Key Takeaways: SoFi has reentered the crypto market with trading, remittances, and future DeFi tools. The platform plans to offer stablecoins, staking, and asset-backed borrowing to users. Regulatory shifts in the U.S. have opened the path for SoFi’s renewed crypto strategy. The US-based online banking platform announced Wednesday that it is reintroducing crypto trading and launching blockchain-based international remittances as part of a broader expansion into digital assets. SoFi users will soon be able to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies through their accounts, with future plans to offer stablecoin products, crypto-backed loans, and staking features. SoFi Plans Asset-Backed Borrowing and Expanded Payment Options The company said it aims to create a more comprehensive digital finance experience by expanding payment options and introducing asset-backed borrowing. CEO Anthony Noto said SoFi is “very excited” to leverage blockchain technology across its operations. The planned remittance service will convert fiat to crypto, transmit funds over blockchain rails, and reconvert them into local fiat on the receiving end. “This is just day one,” Noto said, hinting at long-term plans involving crypto, blockchain, and artificial intelligence to improve financial accessibility and cost-efficiency. SoFi’s crypto reboot coincides with projections of rapid industry growth, with the fintech blockchain market expected to reach $49 billion by 2030, up from $3.4 billion in 2024, according to Insider. The firm’s Galileo platform will support third-party crypto infrastructure, including wallets and custody services, positioning SoFi as a serious contender in the expanding digital finance ecosystem. Very excited about the innovation we can drive via blockchain and crypto across our businesses. @Sofi ‘s planned new international payments (frequently called remittances) will convert fiat to crypto, transmit via blockchain, and convert to local fiat.

However, recent shifts in Washington, such as advancing stablecoin legislation and the Federal Reserve’s rollback of “reputational risk” assessments, have opened the door for traditional banks to work more closely with crypto firms. Shares of SoFi Technologies (SOFI) have climbed roughly 12% over the past week, reflecting renewed investor interest in its pivot back to crypto-enabled services. Venture Capital Backing For Crypto Payment Services on the Rise Earlier this year, crypto payment firm RedotPay closed a $40 million Series A funding round , led by Lightspeed with key investments from HSG, Galaxy Ventures, and other prominent investors including DST Global Partners, Accel, and Vertex Ventures. RedotPay’s funding round came shortly after crypto payments firm Mesh raised $82 million in a Series B funding round to expand its blockchain-based settlement network globally. The round was led by Paradigm, with participation from ConsenSys, QuantumLight, Yolo Investments, Evolution VC, Hike Ventures, Opportuna, and AltaIR Capital. Notably, most of the investment was settled using PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin, highlighting the growing role of stablecoins in financial transactions. Venture capital firms are increasingly backing projects focused on stablecoin services and financial infrastructure. The sector’s potential was further underscored by payments giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion last year, signaling strong institutional interest in blockchain-based financial solutions.

Despite a slight dip in the past day, interest in ADA is picking up again driven by rising trading activity and positive ecosystem developments. Coinbase Launches cbADA on Base In a latest update, Coinbase has launched cbADA, a wrapped version of Cardano’s ADA token on the Ethereum Layer 2 chain, Base. This allows Cardano users to tap into a wider range of DeFi protocols. This move is part of Coinbase’s broader push to unify liquidity across blockchains, after its earlier launches like cbETH and the recent cbLTC for Litecoin. Backed 1:1 by ADA held in Coinbase custody, cbADA comes with full proof-of-reserves for transparency. This move could boost ADA’s presence across DeFi platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Aerodrome. cbADA and cbLTC are now live on @base . cbADA and cbLTC are ERC-20 tokens backed 1:1 by ADA and LTC held in custody by Coinbase. Here’s what you need to know ↓ pic.twitter.com/iEUMPOrZYi — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) June 25, 2025 On-Chain and Derivatives Activity Surge ADA’s fundamentals are also showing strength. Its trading volume is close to $600 million, while open interest in Cardano futures jumped to 1.2 billion ADA. The Midnight Glacier airdrop has also sparked fresh interest in Cardano, with over 200,000 mentions on X in a week. Currently, ADA is holding strong near $0.57, with solid support at $0.51. While it may revisit $0.51, it could present a prime buying opportunity for long term holders. Analyst Sees $2 ADA in Sight According to analyst Dan Gambardello , Cardano is setting up for a major move, with $2 as the next big target. It is following a familiar path from the last bull cycle. If history repeats, a quick rally from around $0.59 to $2 could happen in weeks or a few months. Although a dip to $0.30–$0.40 is still possible but that would be normal before a breakout. He believes this cycle is even stronger than the last, with lower interest rates, rising adoption, and pro-crypto regulation. Technical Indicators Remain Cautious Technical indicators show a cautious picture for ADA. Most moving averages are flashing sell signals. The RSI sits at 36.32, close to oversold levels, which shows that a bounce may come soon. ADA is still down 65% from its all-time high of $3.09, and investors are watching closely for either a recovery or another dip. Over the past few days, ADA has attempted to push higher but is facing resistance around the $0.58 level. Buyers will need to step up for ADA to continue its rebound. A clean move above $0.60–$0.62 could open the door for further upside.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|LTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 05:54:44

Key Takeaways: A7A5 processed $9.3B through Grinex, mostly from just 124 wallets. Elliptic and Global Ledger suggest Grinex may be Garantex’s unofficial successor. Analysts question A7A5’s adoption amid concentrated flows and political ties. According to the Financial Times , the bulk of these transactions originated from just 124 wallets, raising questions about the nature of the token’s usage. In March, Global Ledger alleged that operators of the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex have moved liquidity and customer funds to Grinex, which it described as the platform’s “full-fledged successor.” Elliptic Flags A7A5 Transfers as Likely Internal Fund Movements Analysts from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic told the paper that many of the transfers followed “rigid fixed patterns,” hinting at internal fund movement rather than organic adoption. While Grinex has denied direct links to Garantex, evidence suggests the platform may have absorbed some of its clientele. “Garantex users with outstanding balances at the time it was shut down could have these balances credited to new accounts set up on Grinex,” said Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson. Garantex was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury and hit with a $27 million USDT freeze by Tether earlier this year. Currently, A7A5 is listed only on Uniswap and has a market cap of $151 million, with roughly 12 million tokens in circulation. Compliance alert: #Garantex founders launch a new platform 1/ Following Garantex’s shutdown and #Tether freezing its wallets, the founders have launched Grinex. Here’s what we’ve uncovered pic.twitter.com/m28einnisn — Global Ledger Alerts (@GlobalLedger) March 19, 2025 It is traded not only against the Russian ruble but also against major stablecoins like USDT and even U.S. dollars, according to Grinex’s Telegram channel. The company behind A7A5 claims the token is fully backed 1:1 by ruble reserves held at Promsvyazbank, a Moscow-based bank under Western sanctions due to its role in Russia’s military financing. Despite its controversial rise, A7A5 has attracted approximately 24,000 holders, based on data from Etherscan and Tronscan. However, analysts remain skeptical of its broader adoption, noting the concentrated transaction activity and opaque origins of many flows. Adding to the intrigue is A7A5’s alleged political connection. The Centre for Information Resilience has reported links between the stablecoin and Ilan Shor, a Moldovan businessman and sanctioned political figure convicted of fraud. Although A7A5 claims to have severed ties with the Shor-related A7 project in May, Shor was seen promoting the stablecoin at Russia’s St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June. Archetyp Market Shut Down in Europol Raid In June, Europol dismantled one of the dark web’s longest-running marketplaces , Archetyp Market, following coordinated raids across six countries. In a similar incident, the US law enforcement seized crypto linked to BidenCash , the infamous dark web marketplace, accused of selling over 15 million stolen credit cards and personal data. The international operation took down around 145 darknet and traditional internet domains associated with the marketplace. Additionally, the DOJ recently seized over $24 million in cryptocurrency from a Russian national accused of developing and operating the Qakbot malware.

Chainlink Has Seen Its Total Holder Count Reach A New High In a new post on X, the analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the latest trend in the Total Amount of Holders metric for Chainlink. This indicator measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the LINK network that are carrying some non-zero balance. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It Below is the chart shared by Santiment that shows how the value of the metric has changed during the past year. As displayed in the graph, the Total Amount of Holders observed an inflection point earlier this year and has since been climbing up at a notable rate. This suggests that new non-empty wallets are popping up on the network. This kind of trend can arise due to a number of reasons. Fresh investors coming into the space or old ones who sold before making a return naturally contribute to an increase in the indicator. Another factor could be existing users creating new wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes. In general, all of these could be assumed to be occurring simultaneously to a degree whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, the recent uptrend in the metric could indicate that some net adoption (that is, the influx of new investors) has steadily been taking place for Chainlink. Over the past month, 7,903 new non-zero balance addresses have joined the chain, bringing the Total Amount of Holders to a fresh all-time high (ATH) of 769,380. In the same chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data of another indicator: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. This metric basically compares how the value held by the BTC investors (the market cap) compares against the value put in by them (the realized cap). In other words, the indicator tells us about the profit-loss balance of the holders. Here, the version of the MVRV Ratio that’s relevant is the 365-day version, capturing the situation of the investors who bought their coins within the past year. Related Reading: Crypto Bears Rekt: $359M Gone As Bitcoin, Ethereum Rebound From the graph, it’s visible that the 1-year MVRV Ratio of Chainlink is currently sitting at a negative 17.3%, an indication that these traders are, on average, holding a loss of 17.3%. Generally, however, investors being underwater isn’t actually a bad thing for the cryptocurrency. This is because holders in profit are the ones more likely to participate in selling. As such, Santiment notes that the trend in the 365-day MVRV Ratio could suggest the asset’s “long-term investing timeframe is in an opportunity zone.” LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $13.15, up more than 2% in the last seven days.

Announced in a June 25 blog post, the license allows the exchange to scale its regulated services across all 30 European Economic Area (EEA) member states. With this authorization, Kraken can offer a broader range of fully regulated products, including trading, derivatives, and payments solutions, building on its existing Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registrations in several key European markets, such as France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. https://twitter.com/krakenfx/status/1937944560165908926?s=46 The MiCA greenlight follows Kraken’s acquisition of a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) license through its Cyprus-regulated entity in February. Kraken Co-CEO Arjun Sethi celebrated the latest milestone, highlighting that it reflects the exchange’s broader efforts to meet regulatory standards across Europe. “Securing a license from the Central Bank of Ireland, with its long heritage and experience as a rigorous financial regulator, isn’t just about compliance. It’s a powerful signal of Kraken’s commitment to expanding the crypto ecosystem through responsible innovation,” he said in the statement.

According to a June 26 filing , Invesco and Galaxy’s proposed fund will offer direct exposure to Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Following the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the proposed Solana fund would hold the asset directly under a commodity trust structure. The fund would trade under the ticker symbol “QSOL” on the Cboe BZX Exchange, with Coinbase Custody set to act as custodian for the underlying Solana assets. The ETF may also stake a portion of its SOL holdings to earn additional token rewards, which would be treated as income to the trust. Wednesday’s submission is a Form S-1 registration statement, which informs the commission of the intent to launch a new security. However, before the ETF can be listed, Invesco and Galaxy must also file a Form 19b-4, which proposes a rule change and initiates the formal review process. The SEC will then determine whether the product meets regulatory standards under the Securities Exchange Act.

Other applicants that have filed for Solana ETFs, including VanEck, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Fidelity, are already awaiting SEC review as momentum builds around altcoin ETFs. So far, the SEC has delayed decisions on several Solana ETF applications and has since requested updates from issuers, but has not ruled out eventual approval. The final decision deadline on many of these filings falls in October. However, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have speculated the SEC may act on Solana ETF applications as early as July, with a 90% likelihood of approval. As of now, altcoin ETFs remain unapproved in the United States, with current spot approvals limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the existence of CME-listed Solana futures and growing institutional interest in the asset have strengthened the case for a spot product.

Pivotal Regulatory Catalyst: The potential passage of “GENIUS Act” could solidify USDC's market-leading position as a regulated digital dollar. High Valuation Sets Up a Risk: With hype pushing its ultra-high Price-to-Book multiple, a quick correction is a high risk. Discernible Headwinds: Material risks to the business are potential downturns in interest rates, intense competition with other stablecoins (essentially Tether's USDT), and considerable potential selling pressure.

Get published, earn money, and unlock exclusive SA Premium access. Click here to find out more » Our overall view of Circle Internet Group, Inc. (CRCL) is neutral with cautious optimism, balancing recent favorable market events with inbuilt uncertainties. The stock's strong trend at present is likely to persist for some time, with optimism in market sentiment for stablecoin usage. However, one should be cautious that there are strong and tangible risks associated with the stock, so far, necessitating caution. Investors should therefore closely watch US stablecoin regulation evolution and Federal Reserve policy before assuming a buy position at current levels to make informed choices. 2025Q1 Financial Performance Highlights Circle registered high financial growth in Q1 2025, registering a growth of almost 60% year-over-year in revenues, purely on account of interest income accrued on its USCoin USD (USDC-USD) reserves. While a huge decline was registered in net profit margin, both adjusted EBITDA and absolute net income registered positive growth, giving a healthy indication of high operational efficiency excluding non-cash and financing expenses. Financial Metric Mar 2025 ((USD)) Y/Y Change Reserve Income 557.9M 55.13% Total Revenue 578.6M 58.47% Distribution Costs 347.6M 68.15% Operating Expense 137.9M 30.12% Adjusted EBITDA 122.4M 60.55% Net Income 64.8M 33.21% Net Profit Margin 11.20% -15.94% Company Business and Revenue Model Stablecoin (USDC & EURC) The engine behind this stellar first-line performance is the stablecoin business of Circle. It earns interest on the massive stockpiles of money and government securities that collateralize each USDC issued. In the first quarter of 2025, this interest income made up more than 96% of revenues. Accordingly, the company's profitability is exceptionally interest-rate sensitive. These revenues are determined primarily by two dynamic factors: Interest Rates : If the U.S. Federal Reserve increases or decreases rates, the yield on Circle's reserves is directly impacted, affecting revenues. USDC in Circulation : A greater quantity of USDC in the market requires a greater reserve fund, thus generating a greater quantity of interest income. The company understands that forecasting its performance in the future is not easy, describing the interaction of user behavior with interest rates as ""complex, highly uncertain, and unproven"". For example, at higher rates, will investors redeem their USDC to put money into a traditional high-interest savings account? Or will investors hold their USDC because it is convenient to use to make digital payables and trades? To make a direct comparison to rate change impacts, Circle also simulated a fictional scenario with a stable USDC circulatory volume of 2025 at the IPO prospectus . With this foundation, a 1% (100bps) rise or fall of the interest rate would mean a $441 million boost or loss of reserve income. source : IPO prospectus Strategic Entry to Tokenized Money Market Funds Most stablecoins, including USDC, don't pay interest. TMMFs, by contrast, are a relatively new financial product that tokenizes the traditional money market funds. These funds invest in the safe and liquid assets like banks deposits and U.S. Treasuries to keep the net asset value (NAV) stable. While stablecoins do not pay interest, TMMFs do pay interest to the token holders. In the current high interest rate environment, the option to invest in TMMFs or other yield-bearing digital assets has become increasingly attractive relative to holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, especially for those planning to hold these assets for an extended period of time. Moreover, TMMFs are increasingly being accepted as collateral for margin trading. For instance, CFTC market advisory committee approved the recommendations to adopt DLT and tokenized assets as collateral for margin, indicating growing acceptance. Therefore, TMMFs become more readily accessible and widely integrated on blockchains as a form of collateral in margin trading. To capitalize on these emerging market trends and diversify its revenues, Circle is positioning itself to strategically enter Tokenized Money Market Funds (TMMFs). In an effort to accelerate this plan, Circle acquired Hashnote Holdings LLC on January 21, 2025, to include the USYC tokenized fund in its portfolio. USYC was one of the largest onchain TMMFs on March 31, 2025, with approximately $663.7 million under management. Circle wants to onboard USYC into its network to enable eligible non-U.S. customers to switch seamlessly from non-yield-bearing stablecoins like USDC to the yield-bearing USYC. That also poses a challenge to USDC. With TMMFs increasingly becoming popular as a type of collateral used in trading, a movement to TMMFs is likely to negatively impact the competitiveness and adoption of USDC as a collateral used in margin trading. Future Growth Drivers Circle's future growth is underpinned by several key opportunities: Regulatory Clarity Rapid expansions in stablecoins pose threats to the safeguard of the consumers, market stability and even its viability for the illicit activities like the money laundering. GENIUS Act, an acronym for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, is an important proposed legislation to govern payment stablecoins in the United States. The GENIUS Act attempts to resolve such problems by enacting an extensive federal regime of regulation and seeking a middle ground between innovation and safety. GENIUS Act has various intricate provisions to accomplish its goals, such as full reserve support, monthly reviews, as well as anti-money laundering requirements. Senate passed the GENIUS Act on June 18, 2025, by a vote of 68-30. The bill still faces hurdles in the Republican-controlled House, but its passage through the Senate is a turning point. The possible signing into law of the ""GENIUS Act"" would witness a federal framework governing stablecoins, to the possible advantage of an issuer such as Circle that is focused on compliance. Ecosystem Expansion Cooperative relations with payment behemoths such as Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, Worldpay, and MoneyGram are essential to bringing USDC into global trade and reaching mainstream adoption. Market Leadership According to the report published by Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets , the current stablecoin market is just 1% of the U.S. M2 money supply and 1% of international currency trades. It is likely to reach 10% of such markets with the increasing legitimacy of the sector, and Circle is well positioned to capture a substantial portion of this growth. Significant Risks to Consider Despite such heartening prompts, prospective investors have to offset some considerable risks: Valuation Concerns Based on the IPO prospectus, post-IPO net tangible book value per share was $7. At the close price of $222.65 (June 24), this translates to a high 31.8 Price-to-Book (P/B) multiple. Such massive premium is fueled based on market hype about stablecoin usage, a thesis that is most likely to see significant reversion. source : IPO prospectus Macroeconomic Headwinds Circle's business is highly sensitive to U.S. rates. A Federal Reserve pivot to a cycle of rate cuts would directly harm the company's core source of revenues. Intense Competition The company is also under constant pressure to compete with market capitalization leading Tether (USDT) and other emerging stablecoins. Post-IPO Selling Pressure Up to the second trading day after Circle's public release of its June 30, 2025, quarterly results, about 1.4 million Class A shares will be released from lock-up restrictions. These shares belong to non-selling stockholders of employees and Section 16 officers at the IPO, and represent 15% of their holdings. The rest lock-up agreements of majority of other insiders (directors, executive officers, selling stockholders, and major shareholders) also expire on the earlier of: 1) The second trading day after the public release of Circle's September 30, 2025, quarterly results. Or 2) 180 days after the IPO prospectus date. These announcements are likely to lead to a sizable increase in the amount of shares available to be sold on the market, and thus have a bearing on the stock price. Conclusion: A Persuasive Thesis Qualified with Circumspection The overall view of Circle is Neutral with Cautious Optimism. Circle Internet Group has a distinct investment thesis, offering a direct exposure to the digital asset economy's underlying infrastructure through a very profitable business model. With its compliance-driven outlook, the company is better positioned to achieve long-term success, provided a clear framework is established at the U.S. level. However, the ""Neutral"" recommendation is driven by tangible and sizable risks. Exceptionally high valuation depends on flawless execution and a continuing benign macroeconomic environment. Both risks of sensitivity to the interest rate, stiff competition, and imminent share unlock align to produce considerable downside volatility. Investors should therefore pay incredibly close attention to stablecoin regulation and Federal Reserve policy prior to considering a purchase at the current levels of discussed valuation.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-26 06:11:32

This makes it the first decentralized data collection app available directly through the wallet, representing a milestone for artificial intelligence development and blockchain interoperability. A decentralized solution to better AI training OORT’s pitch is simple: training better AI starts with better data. The company says centralized collection methods aren’t cutting it, they’re expensive, slow to scale, and often miss out on diverse or high-quality input. DataHub flips the model: anyone can contribute useful data and earn rewards in Tehter ( USDT ). It’s already catching on. OORT says it has over 300,000 registered users, with 80,000+ logging in daily.

Many now believe it could even surpass Shiba Inu in market cap by 2026. But while Pepe’s climb is grabbing attention, a new player called Remittix (RTX) is emerging as the real story especially with its token presale heating up and a platform built to solve real-world problems that meme coins never address. Let’s get into the details surrounding the PEPE and SHIB rivalry and why RTX is worth keeping an eye on. Pepe surges amid bullish sentiment, eyes Shiba Inu flip by 2026 PEPE price analysis. Source: Crypto.news Pepe recently surged to $0.000010, its highest level since February, climbing 65% from its yearly low. Trading volume exploded by 140% to $1.2 billion overtaking meme coins like Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Floki. This rise came as investor sentiment turned bullish, with Bitcoin crossing $100,000 and the overall crypto market shifting into “greed” mode. Adding to the momentum, Pepe’s futures open interest hit $475 million its highest since January while fewer tokens on exchanges hint that holders aren’t selling. Analysts see bullish patterns like a falling wedge and double-bottom, suggesting a rally to $0.00001545 is possible, with some even eyeing a Shiba Inu flip by 2026. Shiba Inu rebounds as whales scoop up over 10 trillion tokens Following a weekend of global tension that wiped out $250 billion from the crypto market, Shiba Inu dropped nearly 9% before bouncing back with a 9.18% gain on June 23. This recovery was fueled by whales who bought 10.4 trillion tokens worth $114 million in just 24 hours. This marked their largest daily buy since January, lifting their total holdings from 182.47 trillion to 192.87 trillion. SHIB 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite mixed whale behavior, with some large holders selling, the increased long positions and exchange reserves show renewed confidence in SHIB’s future. As shown in the daily charts, Shiba Inu is 19.06% down for the month, however, 88% of the community sentiment is bullish, suggesting many investors believe the meme coin could rally again soon. How Remittix makes crypto spendable, convertible and investable Remittix is designed not just as a token, but as a full remittance and payment ecosystem that bridges the gap between crypto and traditional finance. One standout feature is its fiat gateway integration. This lets users convert crypto into local currencies and withdraw directly into bank accounts, making crypto spending in real life finally practical especially in underserved regions. The RTX token i tself is more than just a digital coin. It has actual utility. Holders benefit from lower fees, quicker transaction times, and premium features within the ecosystem. This kind of integration adds real value to the token beyond just price speculation. A strong example of how all these features connect: imagine a freelance graphic designer in Ghana working with a U.S.-based client. With Remittix, the client pays in USDT, the funds are converted instantly to Ghanaian cedis and the money lands in the designer’s bank account within hours far cheaper and faster than any traditional service. Analysts forecast RTX could soar 348% to $0.35 by 2026 As for the presale, Remittix has already raised over $15.8 million, with more than 546 million tokens sold. At the current price of $0.0781, early investors are racing to buy before the next price jump to $0.0811 a projected 3.8% increase. Analysts predict RTX could easily hit $0.35 by early 2026, a 348% rise from current levels, with some even suggesting a long-term potential of $1.20 a staggering 1,437% increase.

Multi-year support being found at the one-year moving average, and not too far extended from that average.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Lastly, he says Bitcoin’s recent sideways price action, including a temporary dip into the $90,000 level, is likely due to geopolitical concerns. “BTC continued consolidation.

Details regarding the airdrop mechanism and distribution will be released once trading begins. Other major exchanges such as Bitget, Gate.io, MEXC, and KuCoin will also begin trading for CESS at 10:00 UTC today. Since the CESS Network’s mainnet has not yet launched, per the latest tokenomics documentation, the token is initially being issued on the BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20 standard). A mainnet launch is expected in the coming months, after which the BEP-20 CESS tokens will be swappable 1:1 for native tokens through an official cross-chain bridge or token migration mechanism supported by the CESS team.

CESS serves as the native utility token within the CESS ecosystem, used for paying storage fees, staking by node operators, rewarding verifiers, and participating in decentralized governance. In December 2023, CESS raised $8 million in a Series A funding round led by DWF Labs, HTX Ventures, Web3 Foundation, and Infinity Ventures Crypto, with participation from other strategic backers. The capital was reportedly used to expand core infrastructure, support mainnet readiness, and scale adoption among AI and decentralized data platforms.

But as hype fades and real utility takes center stage, newer contenders like Ondo Finance, Kaspa and the new Pay-Fi network, Remittix are emerging as smarter bets for those chasing life-changing returns. Unlike Dogecoin, which leans heavily on internet memes, or Pi Network, still stuck in a vague phase of development, Remittix offers a working product, real-world use cases, and powerful tokenomics that position it as a serious candidate for 1000%+ growth. Let’s learn more about Remittix and why its token along with Ondo and KAS are so promising. Ondo Finance Launches Alliance to Expand Access to Tokenized Securities Ondo Finance has announced a major step forward in making real-world assets like stocks and ETFs easier to access through blockchain technology. On June 17, the company launched the Global Markets Alliance, teaming up with major crypto players such as Solana Foundation, Fireblocks, Trust Wallet, and others. The announcement comes as Ondo prepares to launch its Global Markets platform, which will allow users outside the U.S. to directly access American securities through crypto apps and wallets. ONDO 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Despite a 17.25% price drop this month, 86% of voters remain bullish. This shows that investor confidence in Ondo Finance’s long-term vision stays strong. Kaspa Surges as GHOSTDAG Boosts Speed, Security, and Market Momentum Kaspa has made a name for itself with its recently launched GHOSTDAG protocol, a faster and more scalable alternative to traditional blockchains. Unlike older systems, Kaspa’s GHOSTDAG protocol maintains strong Proof-of-Work security while drastically reducing wait times. Now processing over 3 blocks per second, Kaspa is the fastest PoW Layer 1, with OKX Wallet integration expanding its global reach. KAS 1M price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Following this tech-driven momentum, Kaspa’s native token KAS is showing signs of revival after weeks of decline. It surged nearly 15%, closing above its 9-day moving average for the first time since early June. Traders are watching closely to see if it can break above the $0.077 resistance level, which could open the door to $0.080 or higher. Remittix revolutionizes remittance with speed, simplicity, and low fees Remittix is already making waves in the remittance and cross-border payments space by blending the speed of crypto with the reach of traditional banking. It’s built for users who want the flexibility of blockchain but with the familiar experience of apps like PayPal or CashApp. One of the standout features is its impressively low transaction fees. Unlike the high charges tied to services like Western Union or PayPal, Remittix ensures that users keep more of their funds, whether they’re sending $50 or $5,000. A small business paying remote freelancers overseas, for example, would find this particularly cost-effective. Speed is also a major strength. Traditional international transfers often take two to five business days. With Remittix, most transactions are processed within 24 hours—sometimes much faster. This rapid delivery builds trust among users who rely on timely transfers, such as expatriates sending money home. Remittix presale gains momentum with 1,000% growth potential on the horizon While Dogecoin and Pi Network continue to trend online, Remittix is becoming impossible to ignore in the conversation about the best sub-$1 cryptos to buy now. Currently in presale, Remittix offers RTX tokens at just $0.0781. The platform has already raised over $15.8 million and sold more than 546 million tokens. Analysts speculate that RTX could reach $0.50 within the next few months—a 540% increase from its current value. Some even project a long-term target of $1.00 if adoption grows, marking over 1,180% in potential gains.

While Bitcoin continues to lead the way, altcoins are setting up for some interesting moves too. Bitcoin at Key Resistance: Breakout or Pullback? As of now, Bitcoin is testing an important resistance zone between $109,000 and $111,000. While the fundamentals like stock market stability, a steady volatility index, and a growing Coinbase Bitcoin premium are looking positive, analysts are divided on whether Bitcoin can break above this level in the short term. While there’s strong bullish momentum right now, the volume isn’t quite high enough for a confirmed breakout. If Bitcoin gets rejected at this resistance, it could see a pullback before any new highs. Ethereum and XRP: Lagging Behind, But Watching Bitcoin Ethereum (ETH) and XRP haven’t kept up with Bitcoin’s recent surge. Ethereum especially looks weak, still stuck below its key resistance level and struggling to attract volume. XRP, too, is heavily dependent on Bitcoin’s moves and may need a pullback before any serious rally. Altcoins: Calm Before the Storm? Altcoins in general have stabilized but remain at risky levels. A short-term pullback in altcoins is likely before a possible bounce and more sustained upside. The open interest in altcoins remains high, keeping things volatile, but if Bitcoin can hold its ground, altcoins might follow suit soon. However, crypto trader JRNY Crypto is positive about what’s coming next. According to him, Bitcoin reaching $125,000 could kick off a mini altcoin season. If it crosses $150,000, a bigger rally might follow, and if Bitcoin pushes above $180,000, the market could enter a massive, parabolic altcoin season.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 07:09:23

Coinbase has previously issued versions of bitcoin BTC, ether ETH, XRP XRP, and dogecoin (DOGE on Base, creating one of the most comprehensive cross-chain ecosystems in layer 2. Wrapped tokens solve the interoperability puzzle. ADA and LTC are native to other blockchains and cannot be directly used on Ethereum or dependent layer 2s, such as Base. However, using wrapped tokens allows holders and users to interact in onchain activities like yield farming, liquidity pools, trading, and lending — all without selling their original tokens.

The final requirement? Profitability. Thanks to a recent accounting rule change, Bitcoin could be the catalyst that gets them there. With 592,345 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $63.7 billion, MicroStrategy is on track to post one of its most profitable quarters—but only if Bitcoin stays above $95,240 by June 30. What’s Holding MicroStrategy Back? To qualify for the S&P 500, a company must meet these criteria: Be based in the U.S. Have a large market capitalization Maintain adequate share float and trading volume Post positive earnings over the past four quarters MicroStrategy satisfies the first three. However, under previous accounting rules, it had to record unrealized Bitcoin losses—even without selling. These losses kept its earnings negative. According to a post by Bitcoin advocate Alex on X , this was the main obstacle preventing S&P 500 inclusion. Why June 30 Is a Pivotal Date A new accounting rule now allows companies to include fair-value gains from Bitcoin in quarterly earnings. This means if Bitcoin remains above $95,240, MicroStrategy’s profits for Q2 could turn sharply positive—meeting the final S&P 500 requirement. Analyst Jeff Walton points out that such a price level would erase previous losses and unlock S&P eligibility. Current BTC price: $107,753 Q2 performance: +29.2% Probability of Bitcoin holding above $95,240: 91% What Happens If MicroStrategy Is Added? If MicroStrategy joins the S&P 500, every major index fund will be required to include MSTR in their holdings. This creates indirect exposure to Bitcoin across the entire U.S. index ecosystem. Alex notes this could bring a new level of mainstream legitimacy and adoption for Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin Investors Should Watch This Closely MicroStrategy’s potential S&P 500 inclusion could: Accelerate institutional interest in Bitcoin Increase demand for BTC-backed stocks Further cement Bitcoin’s place in traditional finance As June 30 approaches, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s price. If it holds above the $95,240 threshold, MicroStrategy may finally enter the S&P 500, bringing Bitcoin with it.

The rally has now entered a critical red supply zone between $108,000 and $110,000, where historical rejections have often triggered consolidation phases. Price is pausing just below this resistance, and several indicators hint at an imminent inflection. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) From a multi-timeframe perspective, Bitcoin price action has flipped bullish after a breakout from the descending channel seen on the daily and 4-hour charts. The current rally originated from a liquidity sweep near $98,000, forming a bullish order block and reclaiming the broken structure. BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Price is now testing the same region that caused the last rejection near $108,000. The 1D chart shows this area aligning with the upper trendline projection, where BTC reversed in early June.

One month later, the data supports that decision. According to CME’s official update on X, over 24,600 contracts have already been traded, totaling more than $542.8 million in notional volume. Notably, nearly half of that activity came from outside the United States. This international demand shows the broad appeal of XRP. CME described XRP as “one of the most watched crypto assets,” emphasizing its role in a rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. These futures contracts provide exposure to XRP price movements without requiring direct asset custody. This gives more room for accessible risk management and portfolio diversification. The interest in these products shows that investors are eager to engage with XRP. Since launching on May 19, XRP and Micro XRP futures have shown demand across institutional and retail participants, highlighting interest in regulated tools to access one of the most watched crypto assets.

This immediate traction signaled strong interest from a mix of ETF issuers, institutional players, and retail traders. According to CME, open interest in the contracts has climbed steadily, with $70.5 million currently held in active positions. The trend illustrates continued engagement rather than a brief spike in interest. A trading activity chart included in CME’s breakdown shows a clear upward trajectory in volume, XRP equivalents, and open interest throughout the first month. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Moves and Ledger Growth Support Outlook The trading performance of XRP futures aligns with broader developments around the asset. In its 2025 XRP outlook, CME notes that the XRP Ledger has seen increased usage, along with growth in active wallet addresses and transaction volume. A key driver behind this growth is Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road , which CME called a strategic move to strengthen XRP’s role in institutional finance. Notably, Hidden Road cleared the first block trade on CME after the XRP futures launch, and the acquisition is expected to support cross-margining between traditional and digital assets. CME also highlighted the launch of RLUSD, as it boosts transaction liquidity, enhances adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and aids XRP’s goal of becoming a global reserve asset . XRP is set to see broader institutional adoption as Ripple’s innovations drive real-world use, and CME’s data signals accelerating demand for regulated XRP exposure.

According to analysts, the current altcoin winter may continue for a while due to various factors. One of these reasons is that most of the market continues to ignore altcoins, with focus primarily on Bitcoin (BTC). The data shows that while most of the market dipped following the US strikes on Iran, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered quite well, and is now above $103,000, after briefly falling below $100,000. Another reason has been the flood of meme coins into the crypto space. For instance, the pump.fun meme coin platform has created over 6 million meme coins, which has left many newbies confused about which meme coin to purchase. Amid these market conditions, investors are looking into tokens at the bargain-basement pricing, which have real utility and massive upside. One of the main candidates that meets all these conditions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, the presale for MUTM tokens is doing well and promises to be one of the biggest gainers of 2025 when it goes live. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where it has raised over $11.2 million so far from around 12,450 buyers. At the current price of $0.03, it represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This trend will continue until the final listing price of $0.06. As such, buyers in phase 5 are getting their tokens at a generous 50% discount. Not wanting to miss out on massive gains, investors have bought 50% of the tokens, barely a week after they launched. Another factor pushing the presale forward is the positive forecasts by analysts. According to the analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could go up by 4,500% once they go live. Based on this forecast, a $1,800 investment in the presale at the current price could grow to $81,000. On any scale, that is a massive return that is getting rarer to find in the crypto market. Best of all, the value of MUTM tokens is expected to continue growing, thanks to the design of the protocol. Unlike meme coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to offer stable, long-term returns for its holders. One of the ways in which the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team plans to support the long-term value of MUTM tokens is via a buyback and distribution program. In this program, they will purchase MUTM tokens off the open market, which will be distributed to stakers on the platform. These purchases will support the long-term growth of the tokens, helping to attract even more buyers. As a result, it will create a sustainable process of upward growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders on the protocol, they deposit funds, which they can use to earn an annual percentage yield (APY). The yield rate in a pool is determined by the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it pushes up the interest rate, which causes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it incentivizes new lenders to join in to benefit from the higher yields. The result is a cycle of liquidity growth and growing user participation that ensures the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Additionally, the design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency. To put it into perspective, if a lender were to deposit $5,000 worth of AVAX in a pool, and the utilization rises, that could push the yield to 20%. An APY of 20% means that the owner would receive $1,000 worth of AVAX on their deposit. That is a convenient means to earn passive income with the least amount of effort possible. To protect lenders on the protocol, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) requires that all loans be overcollateralized. It ensures that all borrowers deposit collateral that is worth more than the value of their deposit. That ensures that if there is rapid price movement that lowers the value of the collateral, liquidators have a buffer in which they can step in and purchase the collateral at a discount. As a result, the protocol is stabilized, while lenders get their full amount back. Conclusion The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is what happens when ingenuity meets determination. By creating real-world utility, it ensures that the value of MUTM tokens will continue to grow over time. The current 50% discount on the tokens in the ongoing presale presents a lucrative opportunity to secure massive gains amid turmoil in the rest of the market.

How do such trends impact the broader crypto ecosystem and CoinW’s strategy? A: Institutional adoption is a powerful catalyst for the broader crypto ecosystem since it increases credibility, liquidity, and market stability. The growing popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs this year has played a pivotal role in making digital assets more accessible to traditional investors. At CoinW, we are proactively aligning our strategy to capture this expanding institutional segment by enhancing our suite of institutional-grade services.

The strategic pivot comes at a time when Ethereum , after it transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, has gained traction in the crypto ecosystem.

Here’s How Crypto Is Entering the Real Estate Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, many investors wonder how useful their crypto is in daily life. In a big development, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency took a bold step by allowing cryptocurrencies to be counted as assets in mortgage applications. Crypto Now Counts for Home Loans! This new rule means crypto holdings can now help people qualify for loans. It’s a positive move for crypto users and a sign that digital assets are becoming a regular part of the financial system. From rising prices to new rules that recognize digital assets, XRP is stepping out of the trading charts. How much XRP would you need to purchase a home in the United States? Let us explore the details as ChatGPT reveals the answer. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.19. The median price for a typical home in the U.S. is approximately $420,000, though this can vary by state, city, and property type. If one were to pay the full cost of the home using XRP, one would need about 192,000 XRP. This is calculated by dividing the home price of $420,000 by the XRP price at $2.19. This amount would cover a typical home purchase in an average market without a mortgage or loan. How Much XRP for a Down Payment? A 20% down payment on a median-priced home would require approximately 38,400 XRP at the current market rate. In high-value real estate markets such as San Francisco or New York City, where property prices often exceed $1 million, the total XRP required for a full purchase could cross 450,000. These figures clearly show how the number of tokens required rise with the property’s value. Also, XRP’s price is highly volatile, so the number of tokens needed may shift over time. At the current price of $2.19, purchasing a median-priced home in the U.S. would take approximately 190,000 to 200,000 XRP. A Larger Shift Globally This shift is part of a larger trend. Japan’s Open House Group now accepts XRP for real estate purchases. Buyers can use XRP to purchase properties in cities like Tokyo and Osaka. The company, already supporting Bitcoin and Ethereum, recently expanded its crypto payment options to include XRP, SOL, and DOGE. Dubai is also using XRP Ledger to Tokenize Real Estate. These moves reflect a growing global trend of using XRP for real-world payments.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 07:44:45

Instead, it pertains specifically to the joint motion recently filed by both Ripple and the SEC, focusing on remedies rather than the underlying legal status of XRP or digital assets in general. This is incorrect. The decision on the joint motion filed last week will be an indicative ruling on whether there are exceptional circumstances to warrant the Court reducing the penalty and dissolving the injunction. It will not be a ruling that will redefine the status of… https://t.co/lkjE24WkSE pic.twitter.com/YR8Lq6gxwG — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 25, 2025 The True Nature of the Indicative Ruling Morgan emphasized that the court is considering what is known as an “indicative ruling,” a legal mechanism where the judge assesses whether there are exceptional circumstances that justify reducing the financial penalty against Ripple and dissolving the previously imposed injunction. This process does not revisit or alter the core legal questions settled in the summary judgment issued in July 2023 . Morgan attached a screenshot from this ruling, which stated that “the Parties here do not seek to vacate, amend, or modify the Summary Judgment Order.” It further adds that the order will “remain untouched and will continue to bind the parties under the principles of claim and issue preclusion.” This means that the court’s landmark determination, which found that XRP sales on secondary markets did not constitute securities transactions, remains intact and unaffected by the current proceedings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Scope of the Current Proceedings The distinction is crucial. While some observers, including Squire, frame the forthcoming ruling as one that could redefine the status of digital assets nationwide, Morgan stressed that this is inaccurate. The decision is procedural and limited in scope, dealing exclusively with whether Ripple’s penalty should be adjusted and whether the injunction initially sought by the SEC should be dissolved. After the court denied the first joint motion , Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, explained that XRP’s status remains intact , and the remedy the parties are seeking will not modify any part of that ruling. Despite the excitement generated by recent commentary, the Ripple vs SEC case is not about to deliver a new ruling on the status of crypto assets. Instead, the court’s focus is firmly on resolving remaining issues, including lowering Ripple’s penalty and removing the permanent injunction preventing institutional sales.

The acquisition pushed its total holdings to 12,345 BTC, secured at an average price of $98,303 per coin. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy With this latest addition , Metaplanet has now surpassed Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC, to become the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, as it continued with its aggressive accumulation strategy. Announcing the latest milestone, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich tweeted , “1, 2, 3, 4, 5… liftoff. We just climbed past Tesla on the BTC leaderboard. Bolder. Faster. Harder. Elon Musk – meet you on Mars.” The move comes shortly after the firm raised ¥74.9 billion (approximately $515 million), a significant funding round aimed primarily at expanding its Bitcoin treasury. The capital raise was facilitated through the exercise of 540,000 stock-acquisition rights by Metaplanet’s primary backer, EVO Fund, which resulted in the issuance of 54 million new shares. This represents nearly a third of the company’s 20th warrant series, with a significant number of rights still unconverted. The purchase also aligns with Metaplanet’s broader goal to acquire 1% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million coins. This ambition would place it among the most committed corporate adopters of the world’s leading asset. Metaplanet’s $5.4B “555 Million Plan” Earlier this year, the company unveiled its “555 Million Plan,” wherein it proposed the issuance of 555 million new shares to raise roughly $5.4 billion for future bitcoin purchases. That plan represents a 92% dilution of existing shares and is part of a larger roadmap to amass 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Looking further ahead, Metaplanet has outlined targets of reaching 100,000 BTC by 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. This scale of accumulation is matched only by the business intelligence company Strategy, which is currently the top corporate holder with over 592,300 BTC. Data from BitcoinTreasuries revealed that Marathon Digital Holdings stands second in line with 49,179 BTC, followed by Riot Platforms with 19,225 BTC, and CleanSpark with 12,502 BTC, respectively.

At the same time, the euro held near a three-and-a-half-year high. The overall mood in the markets improved after a ceasefire between Israel and Iran appeared to hold, easing fears of oil supply disruptions and lifting market sentiment. Still, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific stocks was up only slightly, while Tokyo’s Nikkei climbed 1.6 percent to reach a four-month peak. At the same time, South Korea’s Kospi dipped by 1.07 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was also down by 0.3% while the CSI 300 remained mostly steady. Dollar hit fresh 3.5 year lows on the Euro Pressure on the U.S. dollar intensified after media reports suggested Trump might announce a proposed replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell by September or October. That speculation drove the euro up to $1.6837, its strongest level since November 2021. The Swiss franc also firmed to a ten-year high, and the Japanese yen was up 0.3 percent to 144.815 per dollar. Trump has been criticizing Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively and has even hinted at firing him, moves that have rattled investor confidence in U.S. assets and raised questions about the Fed’s independence. The U.S. dollar index lied at its weakest since March 2022, down roughly 10 percent so far this year as investors, worried by Trump’s tariff threats and their possible impact on economic growth, seek alternatives. At the same time, Gold edged up on Thursday due to the weakening dollar . Spot gold increased by 0.1 percent to $3,336.02 per ounce by 06:40 GMT. US Gold futures increased by 0.2 percent to $3,349.30. It was expected of gold, as the bullion continues to do well during uncertain periods. Oil prices edged up while US stocks made mixed moves In energy markets, Brent crude futures nudged up 0.8 percent to $68.21 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up by 0.9 percent to $65.48, as traders continued to digest the impact of the Middle East tensions on supply. Equity futures also ticked higher early on Thursday. S&P 500 futures rose 0.12 percent, and Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.17 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was up 38 points, or 0.09 percent. This followed Wednesday’s session in which the S&P 500 closed flat, the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3 percent, and the Dow fell by 0.25 percent (106.59 points). Despite those mixed moves, all three indexes remain on track for weekly gains, and the S&P 500 sits less than 1 percent below record high in February.

Claim Jack Dorsey is Satoshi Nakamoto Verdict False Fact-Check by Coinpedia Our research found no credible or verifiable evidence to support this claim. The theory is built on coincidences and online speculation, not facts. Who Made This Claim? The theory recently went viral after crypto trader James Wynn posted a thread suggesting Dorsey could be Satoshi. Matthew Sigel (former Head of Digital Asset Research at VanEck) and Seán Murray also hinted at similar ideas in the past. Coinpedia’s Key Findings and Counter-Evidence 1. Coincidental Timelines and Symbolism Are Not Proof The viral post highlights Dorsey’s 2003 bio mentioning crypto, pseudonyms, and “4 AM hack” sessions, which are said to match timestamps in Bitcoin’s code. However, Coinpedia points out these are circumstantial and not unique to Dorsey. The supposed sailor’s saying in the original Bitcoin code is cited as a nod to Dorsey’s sailing background, but this is speculative and not a direct link. 2. No Concrete Technical or Blockchain Evidence Claims about a Bitcoin address labeled “jD2m” being tied to Dorsey’s San Francisco location are unsubstantiated. There is no verifiable blockchain or cryptographic evidence connecting Dorsey to Satoshi’s wallets or code commits. Coinpedia notes that while Dorsey is a vocal Bitcoin supporter and has worn Satoshi-themed shirts, advocacy does not equate to authorship. 3. Public Behavior and Communication Style Differ Dorsey’s communication style and public persona are well-documented and differ significantly from Satoshi’s writing style in emails and forum posts . Dorsey has publicly supported Bitcoin projects and spoken openly about his involvement, while Satoshi remained anonymous and distanced from all publicity. 4. Time Constraints and Professional Commitments Coinpedia and other researchers highlight that Dorsey was deeply involved in running Twitter (now x) and later Square during the years Satoshi was most active. The enormous time and technical commitment required to create and launch Bitcoin would have been nearly impossible to conceal alongside Dorsey’s public roles. 5. No Cryptographic Proof or Wallet Movement There is no evidence that Dorsey controls any of Satoshi’s original Bitcoin wallets . The early coins attributed to Satoshi have never been moved, and no one has demonstrated the ability to sign a message with Satoshi’s private keys. 6. Community and Expert Skepticism Coinpedia references skepticism from leading crypto researchers, such as Jameson Lopp and BitMEX Research, who argue that the theory relies on unreliable patterns and speculative links, not on hard facts. BitMEX Research, for example, challenges claims about the “Patoshi pattern” and the ability to pinpoint Satoshi’s mining activity or identity based on block timing and forum sign-up dates. Summary Table: Coinpedia’s Evidence Against the Theory Claim Made by Theory Coinpedia’s Counter-Evidence Dorsey’s bio and habits match Satoshi Coincidental, not unique; many cypherpunks had similar interests. “jD2m” address links Dorsey to Satoshi No verifiable blockchain evidence; speculative at best. Satoshi’s actions align with Dorsey’s timeline Dorsey’s public commitments at Twitter/Square make this implausible. Symbolic gestures (shirts, books) Advocacy ≠ authorship; no direct proof. Satoshi’s communication style is like Dorsey’s Writing styles are significantly different. No denial from Dorsey Dorsey has denied being Satoshi in interviews; playful answers are not proof . No cryptographic evidence No access to Satoshi’s wallets or ability to sign messages Conclusion Coinpedia’s research, along with input from blockchain experts, finds no concrete or technical evidence linking Jack Dorsey to Satoshi Nakamoto. The claims are based on coincidences, symbolism, and speculative connections that do not withstand scrutiny. Without cryptographic proof or blockchain evidence, the theory remains just that—a viral internet rumor, not fact.

Currently trading robustly around $107,900 , Bitcoin stands on the cusp of, or has recently breached, its all-time high (ATH) at $111,970 last May 22, 2025. Bitcoin is expected to reach new ATH at $120,000 before June ends. This formidable performance is not just a triumph for Bitcoin holders but is widely regarded as the ultimate catalyst for the eagerly anticipated ""altcoin season""—a period where alternative cryptocurrencies are poised for explosive, often 100x, gains. Investors are keenly observing these dynamics, seeking to strategically position themselves for the next wave of exponential growth in the digital asset landscape. Bitcoin's Historic Rise: Paving the Way for Market Expansion Bitcoin's recent price action has cemented its role as the undisputed leader of the crypto market. Its ability to reclaim and test ATH levels signifies immense market strength and renewed institutional confidence. The achievement of a Bitcoin all-time high draws significant global attention, pulling new capital into the ecosystem and bolstering overall market sentiment. Analysts are already making bold predictions, with some technical indicators pointing towards a swift ascent to $110,000, and potentially even $120,000 following a confirmed breakout from key resistance ranges. More ambitious forecasts suggest targets reaching $135,000-$140,000, or even $150,000 by late August, and significantly higher by year-end. This upward trajectory for Bitcoin is crucial; it establishes a stable foundation and historically precedes a rotation of funds into altcoins as investors seek higher percentage gains. On his viral tweet , Crypto Influencer, Crypto Beast, is expecting surge to other tokens aside from Bitcoin. Decoding the Dynamics of an Altcoin Surge Altcoin Market Cap: $1,291,255,594,413 The concept of an ""altcoin season"" is well-established in crypto cycles. It typically occurs after Bitcoin has experienced a significant rally, consolidating its gains or moving sideways. This period often sees Bitcoin dominance—its market share relative to the total crypto market —begin to decline, as savvy investors reallocate profits from Bitcoin into more volatile, yet high-potential, altcoins. Key indicators signaling the onset of an altcoin season include a rising Ethereum (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) ratio, a surge in the overall altcoin market capitalization, increased trading volumes across various altcoins, and a general shift in market sentiment towards higher risk appetite. While current data may show Bitcoin dominance remaining high or the Altcoin Season Index still low, historical patterns suggest these periods of Bitcoin's strength often precede a significant altcoin run in the latter half of the year, driven by factors like increasing stablecoin liquidity and an overall bullish macro environment.

Currently positioned around $107,900 , and with prospects to reach or even exceed $120,000 soon, Bitcoin’s performance is a key indicator of market sentiment and potential liquidity influx into the altcoin markets. The recent breakthrough not only enhances Bitcoin's stature but also serves to attract fresh capital, creating a fertile ground for altcoins to flourish. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ""altcoin season,"" a phase when smaller cap coins might see exponential growth. The market’s dynamics hint at an upcoming altcoin season, much anticipated by the trading community. Characteristics of an Impending Altcoin Surge Following Bitcoin’s lead, the entire crypto market often gets a speculative boost. As seen currently, a new all-time high has been set by Bitcoin, which historically signals a shift of focus to altcoins. Investors typically start to diversify their investments to leverage potential higher returns from altcoins, which are deemed to have a higher growth potential in shorter time frames. Detailed market analyses indicate that key metrics such as the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio and total crypto market cap growth are favorable. Increased trading volumes and a general buzz around altcoins further validate this shift. This transition often coincides with Bitcoin consolidating its gains, paving the way for the much-discussed altcoin season.

But experts are expecting Remittix (RTX), a trailblazing token that falls into this category of coins, to hit a whopping $3 – way before crypto bigwig Cardano (ADA) does. This article reveals the reasons fueling this extremely bullish sentiment. Why are analysts bullish about Remittix? By creating a peer-to-peer electronic payment network, Bitcoin revolutionized how we perceive and transfer value. Remittix builds on this transformative technology by eliminating more middlemen and delivering a useful solution for end users. It empowers its users to make crypto-fiat transactions without FX charges. To be more specific, Remittix’s PayFi protocol allows anyone to send crypto, right from their wallets, to recipients who get fiat in their traditional bank accounts. It mimics Ripple’s cross-border efficiency but appeals to both retail and institutional users. This makes it potentially a top crypto coin, even though it is yet to hit the limelight. The rationale behind RTX hitting $3 is simple. If Ripple could rally as strongly as it did even though it had legal troubles and doesn’t appeal to retail users, how much more would Remittix perform? It has no issues with the government and appeals to a broader audience. Even more, it is still in its infancy, unknown to many but is steadily growing in stature and value. Remittix has appreciated by over 500% already, with its presale fetching more than $15.8 million from investors. The token is currently priced around $0.0811, which is a sweet spot for anyone looking to make serious profits. Cardano keeps on struggling Cardano is one of the OG crypto projects. It is almost as old as Bitcoin and has methodically developed its network to be the sprawling ecosystem that it currently is. But despite its elevated status, Cardano price has underperformed and has hardly fetched investors tangible gains. This is in spite of the accelerated rollout of the Leios upgrade , a foundational overhaul of Cardano’s Ouroboros consensus protocol that is designed to boost transaction throughput to “tens of thousands per second. Source: CoinMarketCap Cardano is down by over 20% on the monthly scene, with ADA trading below $0.6. The coin continues to fluctuate below the $1 mark, and remains stubbornly range-bound, frustrating holders looking to make robust profits in 2025. Cardano price prediction: Can ADA break $3 ceiling? Cardano’s inability to climb above the $3 threshold has become a defining feature of its disappointing history. Since peaking at $3.10 in Q4 2021, ADA has consistently failed to revisit or surpass this psychological barrier. This is despite multiple crypto market bull runs and market-wide rallies and it casts a long shadow over its future price trajectories. Source: TradingView Presently, the Cardano price is testing a multi-touch demand zone marked by strong historical reactions. The 50/200 MA convergence suggests long-term resistance around $1 remains intact. However, the Stochastic RSI shows oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term reversal. If Cardano price moves above $0.67 and approaches $0.8, there’s a chance ADA could breach $1. However, the possibility of a $3 ADA remains as slim as ever. Don’t miss out on Remittix Remittix is well-positioned to hit $3 before ADA breaks this price ceiling. It’s got a really strong momentum, packs a revolutionary potential, and remains extremely affordable for the average investor. Smart money is flowing towards Remittix, and it’s only a matter of time before others get wind of it.

Accordingly, the exchange announced that cbADA, cbDOGE, cbLTC and cbXRP, which are bridged versions of Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC) and Ripple (XRP) coins to the Base network, will be released soon. The exchange has now announced that this announcement has been implemented for ADA and LTC after DOGE and XRP. Accordingly, Coinbase announced that it has launched two new wrapping tokens called cbADA and cbLTC on the Layer 2 Ethereum network Base. Both tokens are backed 1:1 by ADA and LTC, which are under the custody of Coinbase. The exchange said the aim of the launch of the new tokens is to enable cross-chain usage of Cardano and Litecoin within Base’s DeFi ecosystem. These tokens allow users to trade, lend, and provide liquidity on DeFi platforms that Cardano and Litecoin do not natively support. Coinbase also announced the launch of cbXRP and cbDOGE in early June. cbADA and cbLTC are now live on @base . cbADA and cbLTC are ERC-20 tokens backed 1:1 by ADA and LTC held in custody by Coinbase.

This is the agency’s first enforcement action under the state’s 2023 Digital Financial Assets Law. The settlement also includes $51,700 in restitution to a senior citizen who fell victim to fraud. Similar incidents prompted global concern. In Australia, police uncovered widespread abuse of crypto ATMs in romance scams, with one widow losing close to $282,000. Authorities found many supposed criminals were actually victims being manipulated. Meanwhile, Spokane, Washington became the first city in the state to ban crypto ATMs entirely due to rising fraud, particularly in low-income areas. Regulators across the globe are now cracking down on cryptocurrency ATMs. Coinme Agrees to Pay $300K Fine Seattle-based cryptocurrency ATM operator Coinme agreed to pay a $300,000 penalty to California regulators for violating state laws governing digital financial assets. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) stated that Coinme breached transaction limits by allowing crypto ATM users to exceed the state’s $1,000 per-day cap per customer. The company also failed to include mandatory disclosures on receipts provided at its kiosks, which are located in grocery and convenience stores throughout California. This enforcement is the DFPI’s first action under the Digital Financial Assets Law , which came into effect in 2023. The legislation was designed to address consumer protection concerns related to crypto kiosks, especially as scams involving these machines have become increasingly common. As part of the consent order, Coinme will also pay $51,700 in restitution to an elderly customer who said they were scammed. Coinme crypto ATM DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni explained that the penalty serves as a warning to other digital asset operators that the state is very serious about enforcing compliance to protect consumers. The rise in crypto ATM-related scams has become a growing concern for regulators, as criminals often trick victims into purchasing digital assets at kiosks and sending them directly to fraudsters' wallets. The FBI reported close to 11,000 complaints related to these kinds of scams in 2024 alone, totaling over $246 million in losses. This was a 31% increase from the previous year, and seniors over 60 made up the majority of victims. Crypto ATM complaints for 2024 (Source: FBI ) Similar concerns are emerging globally. In Australia, federal police recently reached out to over 90 people as part of a crackdown on the misuse of crypto ATMs, including those affected by ”pig butchering” scams. In Texas, a sheriff physically dismantled a crypto ATM after a local family reportedly lost $25,000 in a scam. Crypto ATM Scam Targets Elderly in Australia After the Australian federal police contacted people as part of its ongoing crackdown on the criminal use of cryptocurrency ATMs, one case stood out. A 77-year-old widow lost 433,000 Australian dollars, or approximately $281,947, in an elaborate online dating scam. According to Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, the woman was misled for over two years by a man posing as a Belgian national, who encouraged her to invest in Bitcoin using forged investment returns. The victim was completely unaware of the deception until police arrived at her door. She eventually became proficient at operating Bitcoin ATMs, and spent months transferring her entire life savings. Media release from AUSTRAC The scammer guided her through the process step by step, starting with cash withdrawals from traditional ATMs and feeding the funds into crypto kiosks. At one point, she carried as much as 20,000 Australian dollars in cash to complete a single transaction. She described the process as taking “half a day’s work” and recounted the emotional toll of confessing the loss of her life savings to her daughter. Another woman in her 70s also fell victim to a fake investment firm and lost over 200,000 Australian dollars. Police actions under the crackdown focused on the highest-risk users of crypto ATMs. Of the 21 people that were singled out for investigation, many turned out to be victims rather than perpetrators. This shed some light on the growing trend of ordinary citizens being exploited through promises of love, job offers, or high-return investments. Only one person has been charged so far with property laundering, while four others received formal cautions for allegedly using crypto to purchase drugs or acting as intermediaries for criminals. Some suspected mules were also revealed to be victims, who were unknowingly helping cybercriminals or attempting to recover their own stolen money. (Source: CoinATMRadar ) In response to the rising number of these incidents, AUSTRAC introduced new rules and transaction limits for crypto ATM operators on June 3 to help mitigate scams. The agency made crypto regulation a top priority for 2025. AFP Commander Graeme Marshall stressed that people should be wary of anyone promising quick profits or creating a sense of urgency, particularly if contact is made online and the person has never been met in real life. He warned the public not to make any payments via cryptocurrency if instructed by a supposed business or government agency. According to Australia’s national cybercrime reporting system, ReportCyber , there were 150 reports of scams involving crypto ATMs from January of 2024 to January of 2025, which resulted in more than 3.1 million Australian dollars in losses. Spokane Bans Crypto ATMs Spokane, Washington became the first city in the state to ban cryptocurrency ATMs . This happened after a unanimous vote by the City Council in response to the rise in scams targeting local residents. The ordinance was proposed by Council member Paul Dillon , and it aims to protect vulnerable people from fraud involving virtual currency kiosks, which he described as a favored tool of scammers. The new measure prohibits the installation of future crypto ATMs and mandates the removal of existing machines, many of which are located in low-income neighborhoods and high-traffic locations like grocery and convenience stores. Ordinance to ban crypto ATMs (Source: Spokane City Council ) The ordinance referred to a concerning increase in scam activity linked to these kiosks, and pointed out that victims often lose thousands of dollars. Within 60 days, crypto ATM operators are required to remove their machines or face civil penalties and potential revocation of business licenses. The City Council also plans to monitor and report on the effectiveness of the ban by tracking changes in reported crimes involving crypto kiosks. Local law enforcement supported the move, with police detective Tim Schwering sharing cases where funds deposited into these ATMs ended up in foreign jurisdictions like China, North Korea, and Russia. Schwering explained that scammers often impersonate law enforcement or tax officials to coerce victims into converting their money into crypto to avoid fictitious legal consequences. Once the money is transferred into cryptocurrency, it becomes nearly impossible to recover.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-26 08:17:16

Key Takeaways: Resupply lost $9.5 million after an attacker manipulated the price of cvcrvUSD to borrow reUSD cheaply. The exploit exploited faulty price logic in the CurveLend contract used by ResupplyPair. Resupply paused the affected contract and is investigating the breach, with a full post-mortem pending. The attack targeted cvcrvUSD, a wrapped version of Curve USD (crvUSD) staked on Convex Finance. By sending donations to the cvcrvUSD vault, the attacker inflated the token’s share price. This inflated price was then used as collateral to borrow Resupply’s native stablecoin, reUSD, at a highly favorable exchange rate. Resupply Exploit Linked to Manipulated Price Feed in CurveLend Contract The Resupply smart contract involved, ResupplyPair (CurveLend: crvUSD/wstUSR), used the manipulated cvcrvUSD price in its calculations. Once the attacker borrowed the reUSD, the manipulated exchange rate collapsed, triggering a major devaluation of the protocol’s reserves. Analysts at Blocksec noted that the attacker primarily drained funds from the wstUSR market by exploiting the flawed price logic in the borrowing function. The stolen reUSD was then swiftly converted into other crypto assets on external markets. “As a result, the attacker borrowed massive reUSD with just 1 wei of cvcrvUSD as collateral, bypassing the insolvency check,” Blocksec wrote on X. Resupply acknowledged the breach in a statement and confirmed that the compromised contract has been paused. The team is investigating the incident and has not yet confirmed any recovery plans. “A full post-mortem will be shared as soon as a complete analysis of the situation has been conducted,” the team wrote.

The attacker used social engineering, inserted malware via a trojanized Rust crate, and maintained undetected access to engineering systems for over three weeks. The breach culminated in the UniBTC protocol being exploited shortly after Fuzzland discussed a security vulnerability. Notably, in the first three months of 2025, the crypto ecosystem lost a whopping $1,635,933,800 across 39 incidents, according to the blockchain security platform Immunefi . Most of that was the result of only two hacks of two centralized exchanges. Phemex suffered a $69.1 million loss in January, while Bybit lost $1.46 billion in February. Subsequently, the total number of losses in the first quarter marks a 4.7x increase compared to Q1 2024 . At that time, hackers and fraudsters stole $348,251,217. Notably, experts assume that the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group is behind the two largest attacks. They stole $1.52 billion, or 94% of total losses.

SEC Member Explains!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/sec-gets-green-light-for-bitcoin-feature-that-it-never-wanted-before-sec-member-explains/,"As is known, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. While approving them, it pressured them to include only cash refunds and rejected the in-kind refund option in spot ETF applications. However, BlackRock has applied for in-kind repayments for its ISHARES Bitcoin ET at the beginning of 2025. At this point, companies including BlackRock have been asking the SEC for months to allow in-kind investments and repurchases specifically for Bitcoin ETFs. At this point, if tax-advantaged refunds in kind are accepted, it will be positive for the cryptocurrency market. Because these features can be made without selling cryptocurrencies, they reduce the selling pressure in the market. While this development is eagerly awaited, SEC Republican member Hester Peirce said that the in-kind refunds that the SEC has been delaying on Bitcoin ETFs are imminent. Speaking at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, Hester Peirce said that in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto ETFs are on the horizon and will definitely come. Peirce said that the SEC's stance on Bitcoin ETFs is inadequate, noting that in-kind investment and refund application files are currently under review by the SEC. “The SEC really mismanaged the spot Bitcoin ETF. Additionally, the same investment and redemption applications for the spot Bitcoin ETF are going through the review process before the SEC. So I think that will definitely be approved at some point. It's a guess, but we're seeing a lot of interest in these features.” The SEC under US President Donald Trump has adopted a friendlier approach to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies compared to the SEC under Joe Biden. Since the Trump administration, ETF applications have not been limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with many top firms filing with the SEC for altcoins ranging from XRP to Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE). While the market expects altcoin ETFs to be approved in 2025, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas say the SEC has a 90% or higher probability of approving most altcoin ETF applications. *This is not investment advice.

However, the sellers have also been defending the mark vigorously and have so far prevented any upside, but will they prevail? Bitcoin Double Taps $108K As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, the primary cryptocurrency tapped the important level at $108,000 on multiple separate occasions in the past 24 hours, but fell short each time. At the time of this writing, the price is trading at around $107,500, and it’s interesting to see if the bulls will be able to break above. Source: TradingView This is clearly becoming an important level to watch, as both buyers and sellers are committing serious resources here. If the buyers are able to keep going, this could consume the seller-side liquidity at around $108K and pave the way for a move upwards. Of course, the opposite is also not out of the picture. However, it’s also important to note that the cryptocurrency managed to successfully reclaim its 50-day exponentioal moving average, which, according to many analysts, is widely regarded as a critical technical indicator that’s oftentimes used as support during corrections in a broader bullish trend. Reclaiming this level is historically followed by bullish continuation, so let’s see if it plays out again. Altcoins Paint a Mixed Picture The wide majority of altcoins are thrading in the red in the past 24 hours, with a few certain exceptions that are mostly trading at the same price they were before that, failing to chart any considerable increases. As you can see in the heatmap below, Bitcoin Cash is one of the best performers and it’s up by almost 4% on the day.

The recent developments in the AI copyright battle between industry giants Getty Images and Stability AI offer a compelling case study, shedding light on the intricate challenges and uncertainties facing generative AI companies and content creators alike. For those keenly observing the intersection of technology and intellectual property, this ongoing saga provides crucial insights into how digital assets, whether code or imagery, are being protected and leveraged in the age of intelligent machines. Understanding the Evolving Landscape of AI Copyright The legal skirmish between Getty Images, a global leader in visual content, and Stability AI, the startup behind the popular Stable Diffusion AI image generator, has been one of the most closely watched cases in the realm of artificial intelligence. It specifically concerns the use of copyrighted material for training AI models and the originality of their outputs. On Wednesday, a significant turn occurred at London’s High Court when Getty Images opted to drop its primary claims of direct copyright infringement against Stability AI. These claims centered on two core allegations: Training Infringement: Getty initially alleged that Stability AI utilized millions of copyrighted images from Getty’s extensive library to train its AI model without obtaining the necessary permissions or licenses. This claim struck at the heart of how AI models are built, raising questions about whether the ingestion of copyrighted data for ‘learning’ constitutes infringement. Output Infringement: The second primary claim asserted that the images generated by Stable Diffusion were not merely inspired but were substantially similar to Getty’s copyrighted content. Furthermore, Getty pointed out that some of these AI-generated works even bore its proprietary watermarks, suggesting a direct link to the original source material. This strategic withdrawal, as explained by legal experts such as Ben Maling, a partner at law firm EIP, likely stems from the inherent difficulties in proving these specific types of infringement within the UK legal framework. Maling suggested that Getty may have struggled to establish a sufficient connection between the alleged infringing training acts and the UK jurisdiction for copyright law to apply effectively. Similarly, proving output infringement proved challenging, as Getty likely failed to establish that what the models reproduced reflected a ‘substantial part’ of the original copyrighted images, a high bar in copyright law. Getty’s lawyers themselves framed the move as a strategic recalibration, allowing them to focus resources on what they believe are stronger, more winnable allegations. This development underscores the complex nature of proving direct copyright infringement when dealing with AI models that ‘learn’ from vast datasets rather than directly copying, highlighting the ‘gray areas’ that define the future of content ownership in the generative AI era. What Remains for the Getty Images Lawsuit ? Unpacking the Continuing Legal Battle While the initial claims have been dropped, the legal battle is far from over. Getty Images is still pursuing other significant allegations against Stability AI in the UK, as well as a separate, substantial lawsuit in the United States. The remaining claims in the UK focus on two critical areas: Secondary Infringement: This is a particularly impactful claim, as it argues that the AI models themselves might infringe copyright law. If successful, it could mean that merely using these models within the UK could constitute importing ‘infringing articles,’ even if the initial training occurred outside the UK. This claim holds wide-ranging implications for generative AI companies operating globally, as it could compel them to reconsider their operational models and the distribution of their AI products. As Ben Maling noted, “Secondary infringement is the one with widest relevance to genAI companies training outside of the UK, namely via the models themselves potentially being ‘infringing articles’ that are subsequently imported into the UK.” Trademark Infringement: Getty alleges that Stability AI’s models reproduced Getty’s distinctive watermarks, leading to potential trademark infringement and ‘passing off’ – implying that consumers might mistakenly associate the AI-generated content with Getty Images. This claim targets the brand reputation and commercial identity of Getty. Stability AI, however, remains confident that these claims will fail, asserting that consumers do not interpret the appearance of watermarks on AI-generated images as a commercial message or endorsement from Stability AI itself. Across the Atlantic, the stakes are even higher. Getty’s U.S. division filed a separate lawsuit in February 2023, escalating the legal pressure by alleging that Stability AI used as many as 12 million copyrighted images without permission. In this case, Getty is seeking damages for 11,383 specific works at an astonishing $150,000 per infringement, potentially totaling a staggering $1.7 billion. This massive figure highlights the financial magnitude and potential industry-shaping consequences of these legal disputes, emphasizing the profound economic implications for both content creators and AI developers. The Broader Implications for Generative AI and the Creative Industries The legal challenges faced by Stability AI are not isolated incidents; they are part of a larger, global conversation about the ethical and legal boundaries of generative AI. The core issue revolves around how AI systems ‘learn’ from vast datasets, often containing copyrighted material, and whether this learning process constitutes infringement. Just a day before Getty’s decision, a U.S. judge sided with Anthropic in a similar dispute regarding the use of books for AI training without author permission, indicating a nuanced and evolving judicial understanding of these issues. This suggests that courts are grappling with the specific mechanisms of AI training and output, rather than applying blanket rules. This landscape is further complicated by other ongoing cases that reflect the growing concerns of artists and creators. Stability AI, alongside fellow prominent AI image generators Midjourney and DeviantArt, is also facing a class-action complaint from a group of visual artists who allege widespread copyright infringement. These cases collectively highlight the urgent need for clearer legal guidelines, industry-wide standards, and potentially new licensing frameworks for AI development and deployment. The lack of established precedents means each case contributes to shaping future policy and practice. Interestingly, Getty Images itself has entered the generative AI space, underscoring the transformative potential of this technology even for those engaged in legal battles over its use. The company offers its own AI tool that leverages models trained exclusively on Getty’s vast iStock stock photography and video libraries. This proprietary tool allows users to generate new licensable images and artwork, providing a licensed and controlled environment for AI content creation. This dual role as both a plaintiff in copyright lawsuits and a developer in the generative AI market adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing discussions about fair use, licensing, and the future of creative industries. It demonstrates a recognition that while legal boundaries are being tested, the technology itself holds immense promise. Navigating AI Legal Challenges : A Glimpse into the Future of Intellectual Property The legal proceedings involving Getty Images and Stability AI are more than just a corporate dispute; they are a critical bellwether for the future of intellectual property in the age of artificial intelligence. The outcomes of these cases will undoubtedly set powerful precedents that could reshape how AI models are trained, how AI-generated content is regulated, and how creators are compensated for their invaluable contributions. This ongoing legal saga forces us to confront fundamental questions about creativity, ownership, and the very definition of ‘original work’ in an era where machines can generate art. Consider the following critical questions emerging from these challenges, which will dictate the trajectory of AI innovation: Data Licensing Paradigms: Will AI developers be universally required to license vast datasets for training, or will existing fair use doctrines expand to accommodate AI learning processes, perhaps under specific conditions? The answer will significantly impact the cost and accessibility of AI model development. Attribution and Royalties: How can original creators be properly attributed and fairly compensated when their work contributes, even indirectly, to AI models that generate new content? This is a crucial question for the sustainability of creative professions. Jurisdictional Hurdles and Global Harmonization: How will fragmented international laws adapt to the borderless nature of AI model training and deployment? Achieving some level of global legal harmonization may become essential for predictable AI development. Defining ‘Transformative Use’: When does an AI model’s use of copyrighted material become ‘transformative’ enough to fall under fair use, and when does it remain derivative? The courts are currently defining these nuanced boundaries. These questions underscore the profound impact that current legal battles will have on the innovation trajectory of generative AI and the broader digital economy. Companies, artists, and legal experts are all grappling with these complex issues, striving to find a delicate balance that fosters technological advancement while robustly protecting creative rights and ensuring fair compensation for intellectual labor. The precedents set here will resonate for decades. Stability AI ‘s Stance and the Road Ahead for Innovation Throughout these complex legal proceedings, Stability AI has maintained a resolute stance, expressing confidence in its defense against the remaining claims. A spokesperson for Stability AI conveyed their satisfaction, stating they were “pleased to see Getty’s decision to drop multiple claims after the conclusion of the testimony,” signaling their belief that the remaining claims, particularly trademark and passing off, will also prove unsuccessful. Their argument hinges on the idea that consumers do not interpret the appearance of watermarks on AI-generated content as an endorsement or commercial message directly from Stability AI itself, but rather as artifacts from the training data. The road ahead for both Getty Images and Stability AI, as well as the broader generative AI industry, is paved with significant legal uncertainty. The outcomes of the remaining UK claims, particularly the secondary infringement argument, and the substantial U.S. lawsuit, will be pivotal. These decisions will not only determine significant financial liabilities for the parties involved but will also establish critical legal interpretations that will guide future AI development, content creation, and intellectual property rights globally. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, stakeholders across technology, art, and law will be watching closely, understanding that these rulings will shape the future contours of the AI revolution and its impact on human creativity and innovation. The decision by Getty Images to narrow its UK lawsuit against Stability AI marks a significant, albeit not conclusive, moment in the ongoing debate over AI and copyright. It vividly highlights the inherent complexities of applying traditional intellectual property laws to the novel and transformative capabilities of generative AI.

46814110,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=755256,1750930200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46814110.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Attracts Global Attention As Bitcoin Investments Surge in Japan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-attracts-global-attention-as-bitcoin-investments-surge-in-japan/,"Amid weakness in the Japanese Yen and sluggish growth in domestic investments, firms like ANAP and Metapalent in Japan have been stocking up on Bitcoin. The Japanese economy is going through a period of persistent low interest rates and limited investment opportunities. As a result, BTC treasury holdings in Japan now exceed $85 billion. Favorable laws in Japan are making this shift possible, turning Japan into a global leader when it comes to corporate crypto holdings. Amid the growing adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) in Japan, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has recently begun to attract global attention. It is especially so amongst whales in Asia and other regions of the world, who feel that gains from Bitcoin (BTC) may be limited. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its focus on utility, has become an attractive option for them. Noticing this trend, analysts have upped their forecasts for MUTM tokens, and they now forecast gains of 33x or higher when the tokens go live. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the fifth phase of its presale, where tokens are going for $0.03 each. So far, over $11.2 million has been raised in the ongoing presale from around 12,450 unique buyers. A major reason for this high participation rate is that tokens in the current phase are going for a huge 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. Driven by the massive opportunity for growth, investors have bought 50% of the tokens in phase 5, less than a month after they launched. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. That will also reduce the guaranteed ROI based on the listing price from 100% to 71.43%. No one wants to miss this massive opportunity, and investors are taking every exit opportunity to pour capital into the presale. With analysts forecasting gains of 33x when the tokens go live, a $1,400 investment in the presale right now could grow to over $46,000. This represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make life-changing gains in the crypto market. Do not be left out. Best of all, since there is no upper limit on how much you can invest in the presale, this could represent an opportunity to secure your retirement from the crypto investment world. A major driver of the presale is the fact that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is CertiK audited. With a Token Scan Score of 95 on CertiK, this has boosted trust in the project, leading to the current pace of the presale. The presale momentum is expected to carry on after launch, driven by the massive utility of the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the platform, they can deposit their assets into the protocol for a chance to earn an annual percentage yield (APY). The rate at which they earn interest in the protocol’s pools is based on the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises, it increases the interest rate, which causes borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the higher rates. At the same time, it attracts more lenders who deposit liquidity into the pools to enjoy the rising yields. Consequently, the entire process leads to higher liquidity in the pools, which stabilizes the ecosystem in the long term. Additionally, it ensures optimal capital efficiency, giving lenders and borrowers the best possible market rates. For lenders, this massive opportunity for passive income will prove quite attractive. For instance, a user can deposit $10,000 worth of BNB in a pool. Since BNB is in high demand, it could push the APY in that pool up to 15% as borrowers take loans. For the lenders, that could mean that they earn $1,500 worth of BNB a year on their deposit. Best of all, they do not need to actively trade, which can be stressful, for both newbie and experienced traders. Another benefit of Mutuum Finance is that it will ensure users of the protocol have a means to easily track their earnings in the protocol via mtTokens. These tokens will represent the value of the original deposit plus any interest accrued. For instance, when they make a deposit of BNB in a pool, lenders will receive mtBNB tokens in return. The mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, which means they can be traded on secondary exchanges where the standard is accepted. Additionally, the team will encourage the creation of pools on DEXs, which pair with mtTokens. That will provide lenders with avenues to trade on the open market, even as they continue to make passive income in the protocol. Conclusion With a massive discount in the ongoing presale, coupled with the perfect design of the protocol, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale presents a rare opportunity for massive gains in the crypto sector. Do not let this massive opportunity for returns of 33x or higher slip through your fingers.

Amid the multi-billion-dollar industry’s troubles, newcomer Block3 is offering a fundamentally different model for how games are created, distributed, and monetised. Block3 introduces the first AI-powered gaming engine capable of converting simple text prompts into fully playable, immersive game worlds within seconds. By removing traditional barriers, the platform aims to democratise game development and unlock unprecedented creative potential. Central to the ecosystem is the BL3 token, which provides investors with liquid exposure to the growing intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming—a market projected to reach $665 billion. At the core of Block3’s technology is Trinity, a generative gaming engine trained via a decentralised network. Contributors to Trinity’s development are incentivised through blockchain-based rewards, reinforcing the community-driven nature of the platform. The project’s native token, BL3, is set to begin its presale on July 1. How does it all work? To see an idea come to life in seconds—that’s the promise of Block3’s Trinity model, operating at a scale previously unseen in gaming. Users simply enter a text prompt, much like using ChatGPT. But instead of receiving a static response, they get a fully functional video game—featuring expansive environments, complex NPCs, and any feature the imagination can conjure. As with all AI systems, output quality depends heavily on input volume. Block3 addresses this through a blockchain-powered incentive model. Using the BL3 token, it encourages contributions from across the gaming community—submissions such as 3D assets, gameplay clips, and custom maps, all of which help train Trinity. These data inputs are stored on-chain, ensuring full transparency, verifiable provenance, and fair compensation. This approach also tackles a growing issue in AI development: the shrinking availability of quality public datasets. In contrast to closed systems developed by firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, Block3’s open training model invites broader participation and scrutiny. Importantly, training the AI isn’t the only way to earn BL3. Every user-generated game can be hosted within the Block3 ecosystem, building an expansive, living library of interactive experiences. Creators earn BL3 tokens based on engagement, with top-performing games generating real income. In-game purchases offer yet another monetisation channel, making the platform both creator-centric and financially self-sustaining. The token behind it all The BL3 token functions as the central utility asset within the Block3 ecosystem, facilitating key activities such as creation fees, in-game asset trading, and revenue sharing. For investors, BL3 provides a liquid and scalable entry point into the convergence of artificial intelligence and gaming—two rapidly expanding sectors. For retail users, it represents one of the first opportunities to gain tokenised exposure to the foundational layers of game development, monetisation, and distribution. Value in the Block3 ecosystem is designed to accrue across multiple channels, including creation fees, royalties, and marketplace transactions. By aggregating these flows into a single asset, BL3 serves as a broad-based instrument tied to the future of AI-generated gaming, offering an index-like exposure to the emerging sector of synthetic entertainment. The token presale is set to run for three months, with prices scheduled to rise at regular intervals. This tiered pricing model is structured to reward early participation, enabling buyers to secure tokens at lower valuations ahead of BL3’s expected exchange listing in the fourth quarter.

Per local media , the suspects allegedly used a foreign payment gateway service to facilitate illegal foreign exchange transactions. The group operated unregistered crypto exchanges that offered overseas remittance services. They accepted funds from local users, converted them into crypto, and transferred them abroad using foreign platforms. Over time, they bypassed legal channels and collected millions in hidden fees while evading regulation. Authorities confiscated the assets during a raid that also led to the arrest of three individuals and the indictment of two crypto exchange firms. The group reportedly handled hundreds of billions of won over a six-year period while operating without registration. According to the Busan District Prosecutors’ Office, the scheme generated approximately 25.7 billion won (around $18.9 million) in fees, with a total transaction volume reaching 943.4 billion won, or roughly $694.5 million. Authorities allege the group breached both the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act and the Electronic Financial Transactions Act through unlicensed crypto dealings. Illicit proceeds were funneled into offshore gambling sites, with much of the money moved using Nettel Pay, a foreign electronic payment service often linked to online betting and high-risk forex trading platforms, and not approved for use in South Korea. Authorities tracked wallet addresses and accounts tied to the suspects and successfully seized 12.4 billion won ($9.1 million) in assets held under borrowed names. Ethereum worth 4.4 billion won ($3.2 million), believed to have been hidden in personal wallets, was also recovered. Five more suspects linked to the scheme are currently under investigation. South Korea probes crypto exchanges This crackdown unfolds as South Korea steps up its overhaul of the crypto exchange landscape, with regulators digging into the operations of local platforms. Earlier this month, regulators opened a formal investigation into trading fee structures at major platforms including Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone. Led by the FSC, the probe is assessing whether current commission rates place an undue burden on locals and how they compare to global benchmarks. The FSC had previously introduced a 0.6% supervision fee on crypto exchanges’ operating revenue to strengthen regulatory oversight. Regulators have also stepped up enforcement against offshore platforms like BitMEX and KuCoin for operating without local registration. Exchanges found to be in violation now face criminal charges and the threat of ISP-level access restrictions. President Lee Jae-myung has placed crypto reform high on his policy agenda, promising tighter oversight, lower fees, and greater investor protections. One of his administration’s first major steps was the introduction of the Digital Asset Basic Act —an all-encompassing proposal that outlines licensing rules for on-chain-backed stablecoins, mandatory reporting for digital asset activity, and a unified framework to govern virtual asset service providers. The roadmap also charts a path toward legalising cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds by late 2025, with the FSC laying the groundwork through new frameworks on fund structuring, custody, pricing, and investor guardrails. To ensure accountability, the roadmap outlines harsher penalties for misconduct, including permanent bans and steep fines for individuals and entities violating crypto-related laws. A dedicated presidential committee is expected to guide the implementation of these reforms and coordinate with financial regulators to modernize the country’s digital asset ecosystem.

The complaint, made by Dallas-based plaintiff Michael Zidell, accuses the banking giant of aiding and abetting fraud after scammers allegedly stole $20 million from him through a “pig butchering” scheme. According to court documents filed on June 24, Zidell was approached in January 2023 by a person named Carolyn Parker via Facebook. Parker claimed to be a businesswoman based in California, and made contact with the victim through phone calls and video chats on the WeChat messaging platform. Zidell said the relationship seemed friendly at the start, but he grew fond of Parker romantically over the following weeks. Dozens of wire transfers and a $300 million Phantom balance In February 2023, Parker supposedly told Zidell about her investments in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), insisting that she had made millions in profits through a trading platform called OpenrarityPro. Per Zidell, the scammer presented the website to him as “one of the largest NFT trading platforms in the world.” He propounded that the personal relationship and Parker’s “falsified” investment success was enough reason for him to invest in the NFT venture she recommended. Zidell began making wire transfers to multiple bank accounts listed on OpenrarityPro. When he questioned the need to send funds to different accounts, he was told that due to high customer traffic, the platform relied on several banks to handle deposits. He accepted the explanation and, over several months, sent 43 wire transfers totaling over $20 million. Of that amount, nearly $4 million reportedly went to accounts held at Citibank. Among the beneficiaries was a company named Guju Inc., which per court records, received 12 wire transfers through Citibank. The lawsuit blames Citibank for failing to detect numerous red flags, including unusually large and round-numbered transactions, and that these suspicious activities should have started a compliance review under the bank’s regulatory obligations. By March 2023, Zidell believed his investments had grown exponentially. The court filings put in record that the OpenrarityPro website showed an account balance of over $300 million. When he attempted to withdraw some of his funds, the site demanded a “risk deposit” to unlock the assets. Zidell complied and sent the additional funds, but was then asked to pay more fees to process the withdrawal. No funds were ever returned. Sudden disappearance of the trading platform In late April 2023, the OpenrarityPro website was inaccessible. Zidell realized he had been defrauded and deemed the whole incident as a case of a “rug pull,” a term used in crypto to describe exit scams. Zidell then reported the case to the Dallas Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The lawsuit dictates Citibank is responsible for enabling the scam by failing to act on obvious “red flags.” It also states the bank should have investigated the accounts receiving Zidell’s transfers, given the pattern of large transactions to multiple trusts and individuals. The complaint also stated that Citibank breached its legal mandate to monitor suspicious activities and failed to implement adequate security protocols. “ Citibank failed to detect clearly suspicious transactions and failed to monitor the accounts even though large, round sums were transferred in and out of the accounts from trusts and other individuals in a suspicious manner, ” Zidell’s attorneys wrote.

The Critical Role of Data Cybersecurity in AI Adoption Rubrik’s foundation is in data cybersecurity , and this acquisition underscores the growing understanding that secure data is not just a compliance requirement, but a fundamental prerequisite for effective and responsible AI. AI models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. If that data is compromised, inaccurate, or improperly managed, the AI agents built upon it can produce flawed, biased, or even malicious outcomes. Consider the implications for blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi). In these ecosystems, the immutability and integrity of data are paramount. If AI agents are to operate within these environments, performing tasks like smart contract auditing, fraud detection, or automated trading, their underlying data must be unimpeachable. Rubrik’s expertise in securing and governing data provides a crucial layer of trust, ensuring that the AI agents developed using Predibase’s tools are powered by reliable, protected information. This synergy ensures that as AI becomes more pervasive, it does so on a foundation of trust and security, mitigating risks that could otherwise undermine its benefits.

The technical chart shows resistance around $0.66, while on-chain fundamentals remain mixed. With the July token unlock looming and the highly anticipated Pi2Day event approaching on June 28, traders are weighing short-term volatility against long-term potential. If the core team delivers on key promises—such as mainnet expansion, AI integration, and smoother KYC—PI could reclaim bullish momentum in the coming weeks. What Just Happened with Pi’s Price? Lately, Pi Network’s price experienced a sudden spike earlier this week, marking local highs at $0.66. This was when market sentiment turned bullish as global tensions eased, triggering a smooth rebound in the Bitcoin price. On the other hand, the excitement around the Pi2Day also intensified, which is looked at as the network’s mid-year milestone event that could deliver updates on AI features, KYC tools, and broader ecosystem upgrades. Many traders who bought the dip under $0.55 saw the rally as a chance to lock in quick gains. Meanwhile, the experienced investors were cautious of the upcoming token unlock in July, where 274 million Pi could enter circulation. That could potentially flood the market—unless there’s a strong demand boost from Pi2Day announcements or growing dApp adoption on the open mainnet. Pi Price Forecast: Cautious Optimism Ever since the launch, the PI has been facing immense upward pressure. Although the bulls tried hard to push the prices higher, they soon experienced immense exhaustion. As a result, the price plunged as the selling pressure surged. The token is undergoing a similar price action now, which suggests the price may encounter a 15% pullback to reach the support if it fails to defend $0.5. The recent rejection from the resistance suggests the buyers are not completely in control, as the volume remains below the average levels. Besides, the volume has been plunging since its inception, which remains the main concern at the moment, indicating a drop in the investor’s confidence and interest. On the other hand, CMF plunges before surpassing the previous highs, and the Ichimoku cloud diverges before undergoing a bullish crossover. The chart patterns and the technical indicators suggest the continuation of a descending trend, which may reach $0.5 in a short while. If the bulls manage to trigger a rebound, a breakout from the wedge could follow; otherwise, a drop to the support at $0.47 is imminent. Pi2Day could be a game changer or a missed opportunity. If the event delivers solid progress and timelines, expect renewed upward momentum; the Pi price could rise above $0.7 which may further push to the pivotal resistance at $1.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 09:41:37

A newly surfaced document suggests that Ripple was conceived as far back as 2004 — years before Bitcoin was introduced. Ripple Predates Bitcoin? The document, shared by XRP community figure SMOQE, entails a 2014 email exchange between prominent industry insiders, notably tech journalist Reutzel Bailey. Bailey suggested that Ripple’s origin dates back to 2004, four years before Satoshi Nakamoto put out the Bitcoin Whitepaper in 2008, sparking questions about the true origins of the digital finance revolution. 2014 E-mails confirm: “Ripple is older than Bitcoin.” pic.twitter.com/9c8cOF4065 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 24, 2025 According to Bailey, Ryan Fugger first conceived the idea behind Ripple in 2004, creating a platform called RipplePay. This platform sought to facilitate peer-to-peer value transfer without relying on legacy banking rails. Chris Larsen, now Ripple’s Executive Chairman, later advanced the project. Bailey claims that Larsen took advantage of the growing hype around Bitcoin to steer Ripple in a cryptocurrency direction, despite the project’s original focus not being on a public crypto. In the email exchange, Jeffrey Cliff rubbished claims that Ripple was launched as a “copycat math-based currency” riding Bitcoin’s popularity. He stressed that “Ripple predates Bitcoin.” XRP Ledger Emerges In 2012 The timelines imply that Ripple’s concept emerged in 2004, while its cross-border payments cryptocurrency XRP was introduced in 2012, four years after Bitcoin’s public debut. This means that while Ripple might be technically older than Bitcoin, BTC is still the world’s first cryptocurrency, launched by Satoshi four years before XRP. Developers Jed McCaleb , Arthur Britto , and David Schwartz started creating the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2011. They aimed to create a more efficient system than Bitcoin, addressing its limitations, particularly its reliance on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. McCaleb convinced Fugger to transform RipplePay into a crypto network, leading to the creation of NewCoin in 2012, which was later renamed OpenCoin and then simply Ripple. The XRPL creators allocated 80 billion XRP to Ripple, with McCaleb personally receiving 9.5 billion XRP. After he departed from Ripple to create Stellar, McCaleb agreed to liquidate his XRP holdings gradually, with the last stash sold in 2022.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-26 09:44:58

For those deeply invested in the principles of decentralization, data ownership, and transparent governance—much like the cryptocurrency community—the news from Creative Commons resonates powerfully. This pioneering nonprofit, renowned for championing open access to creative works, is now stepping up to tackle one of the most pressing issues of our time: the responsible use of AI data . Their latest initiative, CC signals , aims to forge a path towards a sustainable and equitable future for AI, ensuring that the hunger for data doesn’t inadvertently destroy the very openness that fuels innovation. Why is Ethical AI Data Use Crucial Now? The explosion of AI technologies has created an insatiable demand for vast quantities of data to train sophisticated models. While this data is the lifeblood of AI, its unchecked extraction poses a significant threat. Many online entities, from individual creators to large corporations, are grappling with how their content is being used, often without clear consent or compensation, for AI training. This widespread, unmanaged data scraping could lead to a future where websites are walled off, content is hidden behind paywalls, and the collaborative spirit of the internet erodes. Consider the current landscape: Uncontrolled Scraping: AI models indiscriminately gather data, often disregarding existing terms of service or implicit wishes of content creators. Erosion of Openness: As a defensive measure, content providers might restrict access, thereby fragmenting the internet and limiting the “commons” of shared knowledge. Legal Ambiguity: The legal frameworks surrounding AI training data are still evolving, leading to uncertainty and potential disputes over intellectual property and fair use. This challenge highlights a critical need for a framework that respects creators’ rights while enabling the progress of AI. Without a clear mechanism for data licensing , we risk stifling innovation through legal battles or, conversely, undermining the very principles of open access that have defined the internet’s success. Introducing CC Signals: A Framework for an Open AI Ecosystem Recognizing this looming crisis, Creative Commons has unveiled CC signals , a groundbreaking project designed to provide a legal and technical solution for dataset sharing. The core idea is to empower dataset holders—the creators and custodians of online content—to clearly articulate how their data can or cannot be reused by machines for purposes like AI model training. This initiative isn’t about shutting down AI; it’s about building a reciprocal relationship between data providers and AI developers. Anna Tumadóttir, CEO of Creative Commons, eloquently summarized the vision: “ CC signals are designed to sustain the commons in the age of AI. Just as the CC licenses helped build the open web, we believe CC signals will help shape an Open AI Ecosystem grounded in reciprocity.” Unlike blunt instruments like robots.txt files or technical deterrents, CC signals proposes a nuanced approach. It’s a set of tools that offer a spectrum of legal enforceability, all underpinned by a strong ethical foundation. This echoes the success of the existing CC licenses, which have facilitated the open sharing of billions of creative works online by providing clear, standardized permissions. How Does CC Signals Aim to Facilitate Responsible Data Licensing? The project envisions a future where: Clear Permissions: Dataset holders can explicitly state the terms under which their data can be used for AI training, similar to how CC licenses specify reuse for human consumption. Ethical Weight: Beyond mere legal enforceability, the framework emphasizes an ethical understanding of data usage, encouraging responsible AI development. Standardization: By providing a common language and set of tools, CC signals aims to reduce ambiguity and streamline the process of obtaining and granting permissions. Balance: It seeks to strike a delicate balance between the need for vast datasets to advance AI and the imperative to protect creators’ rights and maintain an open digital environment. This approach offers a proactive solution, moving beyond reactive measures like blocking scrapers or charging for access, towards a collaborative model where data can be shared intentionally and responsibly. Industry’s Current Scramble: Why CC Signals Offers a Better Path for AI Data? The urgency for a solution like CC signals is underscored by the current scramble among major online platforms to adapt their policies regarding AI data usage. Companies are struggling to define their stance, often leading to confusion and public backlash. Here are a few notable examples: Platform Approach to AI Data Use Implications X (formerly Twitter) Initially allowed AI training on public data, then reversed course. Highlights policy instability and public concern over data exploitation. Reddit Using robots.txt to restrict AI bots from scraping data for training. A technical block, but doesn’t offer a legal framework for intentional sharing. Cloudflare Exploring solutions like charging AI bots for scraping or tools for confusing them. Focuses on deterrence and monetization, not collaborative data sharing. Open Source Developers Built tools to slow down and waste resources of non-compliant AI crawlers. Reactive, resource-intensive, and adversarial rather than cooperative. These examples illustrate a reactive, often adversarial, landscape. Platforms are either trying to block access entirely, monetize it, or simply create friction for AI trainers. While understandable from a protective standpoint, these methods do not foster an Open AI Ecosystem . CC signals , in contrast, offers a framework for consent and collaboration, providing a structured way for data to be shared, rather than simply taken or defended against. Shaping an Open AI Ecosystem: The Future Vision The vision behind CC signals extends beyond merely preventing misuse; it’s about actively fostering an environment where innovation thrives on shared resources, built on trust and reciprocity. Just as the original Creative Commons licenses democratized access to creative works, this new framework aims to do the same for the foundational datasets powering AI. It acknowledges that for AI to reach its full potential, it needs vast, diverse, and ethically sourced data, and that this data should come from a thriving “commons” rather than a series of isolated, protected silos. The project is still in its early stages, with initial designs available on the Creative Commons website and GitHub. The organization is committed to an open development process, actively seeking public feedback through various channels, including upcoming town halls. An alpha launch is tentatively planned for November 2025, marking a significant step towards real-world implementation. For anyone concerned about the future of the internet, digital rights, and the ethical trajectory of AI, CC signals represents a beacon of hope. It’s an invitation to participate in shaping a future where technological advancement and human values can coexist and flourish. Conclusion: A Crucial Step for Digital Rights and AI Development The launch of CC signals by Creative Commons marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse around artificial intelligence and digital rights. By offering a robust, ethically-driven framework for data licensing , it addresses the urgent need for clarity and consent in how AI data is collected and used for training. This initiative promises to be a game-changer, fostering an environment where creators retain control, innovation can thrive responsibly, and the dream of an truly Open AI Ecosystem can become a reality. It’s a testament to the power of thoughtful, collaborative solutions in navigating the complex ethical and technical challenges of the AI era, ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared broadly and equitably, without sacrificing the open principles of the internet.

This decision follows a routine evaluation by Binance, which checks projects for development activity, transparency, trading volume, and, increasingly, how well they hold up under regulatory scrutiny. The news, which came during Asia’s trading hours, triggered a sharp sell-off, with traders rushing to exit their positions. What This Means for Altcoin Holders Starting July 4 at 06:00 AM UTC, users will no longer be able to trade ALPHA, BSW, KMD, LEVER, and LTO on Binance. Open orders will be cancelled, and any leftover tokens will be returned to users’ spot wallets. Until then, traders still have time to shift their holdings, either by moving to other exchanges or storing tokens in private wallets. For users involved in derivatives or flexible earn products tied to these tokens, the impact will depend on the specific trading pairs, but most associated services will also be discontinued. This announcement has sparked concern in the affected token communities, many of which now face the challenge of moving trading activity elsewhere. For investors, it’s a moment to reassess positions and decide whether to hold or exit these projects entirely. Shortly after the announcement, all 5 tokens saw a mixed reaction. Many of them suffered losses, while some of them remained green. How Binance Made Its Decision Behind the scenes, Binance is tightening its listing standards to better align with global regulations and investor safety. The exchange now evaluates tokens using a more detailed framework, considering things like team engagement, technical progress, liquidity, network security, and ethical practices. Any major red flags, like team changes or sudden supply increases, can trigger a review and potential delisting. [post_titles_links postid=”473108″] By doing this, Binance is signaling that weak or non-transparent projects will no longer be tolerated. This approach not only protects users but also pushes the industry toward higher standards. And with regulators around the world watching closely, Binance’s updated rules are likely to influence how other major exchanges manage their listings too. Important Dates and What Users Need to Do Binance users should close any open trades involving the soon-to-be delisted tokens before July 4, 2025, and consider moving their assets to other available trading pairs. Since deposits for these tokens may be suspended without much notice, it’s important to stay updated through Binance’s official announcements. The exchange also confirmed it will keep refining its listing and delisting standards going forward.

Binance continues to dominate among crypto exchanges, especially when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC) trading. However, a report by CoinGecko, published on June 25, suggests that smaller exchanges can compete with Binance in the altcoin market. Specifically, Bitget (BGB) exchange leads in the key mid-spread band for altcoins, which is where most real trading occurs. CoinGecko’s report shows that Binance remains unchallenged in terms of Bitcoin liquidity. Binance controlled around 32% of all Bitcoin liquidity on exchanges, with deeper liquidity across all trading depths.

For instance, Bitget leads in the mid-range, where most of the trading happens. At the same time, the exchange actually outpaced Binance on several days, including April 15. Still, beyond the mid-range, Bitget’s liquidity tapers off. ETH daily liquidity on major centralized exchanges on April 15 | Source: CoinGecko The situation is similar for XRP, where Bitget retains dominance in the 0.3% trading range, after which it quickly declines. Bitget also leads in SOL liquidity, controlling 32% of the share at the 0.6% liquidity range. According to CEO Gracy Chen, Bitget has been working actively to partner with institutional liquidity providers. “Today, institutions drive 80% of our spot volume, futures activity from professional firms has doubled, and 80% of top quant funds trade on Bitget. Liquidity is infrastructure — and we’re building it where the market needs it most,” Gracy Chen, Bitget CEO. Finally, the CoinGecko report notes that liquidity is healthy across all major exchanges, particularly in realistic trading ranges. This indicates a healthy state of the crypto market as it continues to mature and attract more institutional players.

46815180,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72538,1750932005,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin (BTC) Holds at $104K After UK Jobs Drop — Micro Cap DeFi Token at $0.03 Gears for 20× Relist Move,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-holds-at-104k-after-uk-jobs-drop-micro-cap/,"After a disappointing UK labor report raised new concerns about the pace of economic recovery, global markets have shifted into observation mode. Central banks are signaling a temporary pause as policymakers assess long-term inflation risks against weaker job growth. Bitcoin (BTC) has remained steady near $104,000, indicating a broader appetite for digital assets as macro turbulence grows. But while BTC holds the spotlight, a lesser-known DeFi token priced at just $0.03 is building momentum for a much larger breakout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol currently in presale, is capturing growing attention from early-stage investors preparing for a shift in liquidity flows. With over $11.2 million raised so far and more than 12,450 unique holders already participating, this micro-cap project is entering a pivotal phase. The presale’s fifth round is already 50% sold out—and once it concludes, the price will climb, eliminating the current discounted entry. For those searching for the next 20× play, the window is open now—but not for long. A Presale Blueprint Geared for Massive Post-Launch Multiples What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its structured approach to both capital raising and utility buildout. Unlike speculative tokens that push out flashy promises, Mutuum has laid out a development timeline grounded in progressive technical delivery, including Layer-2 scalability, overcollateralized borrowing, and dual lending formats. Each presale phase has been carefully designed to scale both investment inflow and token price, starting at $0.01 and culminating at $0.06 by the final round. Those entering at today’s $0.03 level stand to gain a minimum 2x at listing price alone—excluding the compounding upside once the platform goes live and capital utilization takes off. Based on comparable DeFi growth paths, a 20x return is well within reach. The protocol has also undergone an extensive smart contract audit by CertiK, achieving a 75.56 Skynet Score and an 95.00 token scan rating—metrics that demonstrate serious attention to infrastructure quality. Meanwhile, investor trust continues to build as community milestones are achieved: a growing online presence, over 10K followers on social channels, and a $100,000 giveaway targeting long-term believers, where ten users will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t waiting for macro conditions to improve—it’s positioning itself as the protocol of choice for yield hunters looking for full autonomy. Deposits are made through smart contracts that issue mtTokens, which reflect not just your principal but also real-time earnings. These mtTokens can be sold, staked, or even reused as collateral for other DeFi positions—allowing users to remain active while earning passive income. Built for Real Yield in a Slow Market With stablecoin transfers exceeding $717 billion in Q2 2025, it’s clear that investors are already repositioning into decentralized environments in search of predictable income. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a decentralized stablecoin that stays anchored to $1, minted only when users borrow against solid collateral like ETH. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin is burned to regulate supply. This system works alongside a governance-driven interest model that adjusts borrowing costs to help maintain price stability. When demand is too high and price rises above $1, borrowing rates will drop. When it falls below peg, rates will be increased—supported by built-in arbitrage opportunities that keep equilibrium in place. Users will also be able to participate in Mutuum’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools, where they’ll earn adaptive yield from real-time borrowing activity. As demand increases, so does the interest paid to depositors. Unlike staking programs that rely on inflation, this yield is fully backed by borrower fees. For more active participants, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will unlock custom lending terms, allowing customized rates on popular tokens like BTC, ETH, or even smaller-cap coins that centralized platforms ignore. The passive dividend mechanism will further strengthen demand for the MUTM token itself. A portion of protocol revenue will be used to buy MUTM on the open market, which is then redistributed to stakers in designated contracts. This buyback structure adds persistent upward pressure to the token’s value while rewarding long-term contributors. All of this will be backed by Layer-2 technology for faster, cheaper transactions, and governed entirely on-chain. Once the current presale ends, the platform will move toward beta testing, with the listing of the MUTM token and the activation of mtToken claiming set to align with that launch window. Early holders will not just have price advantage—they’ll enter with an ownership stake in the protocol’s growth.

According to Bloomberg, WLFI announced plans to publish its stablecoin audit and launch a new app. Speaking at the Permissionless Conference in Brooklyn, New York, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zak Folkman noted that the WLFI token has received significant interest from public companies looking to use it as a treasury asset. At this point, Zak Folkman said the team is working to make WLFI transferable and listable. Folkman also noted that they plan to publish the first audit of their stablecoin USD1 in the coming days. ” You asked us to make WLFI transferable, and we heard you. The team is working behind the scenes to make it happen. Big news coming soon. Our governance token WLFI may soon be available for trading. We have also completed an accounting audit for the USD1 stablecoin and will be making it public soon.” Currently, WLFI is locked in users’ wallets. It grants voting rights to platform participants but is not traded in the market and is not traded on exchanges and cannot be bought or sold. However, Folkman's statement sparked speculation that the WLFI, which grants voting rights to its members, could be listed. WLFI, which has a total supply of 100 billion, has raised $550 million through public sales of more than 25 billion tokens in two fundraising rounds. *This is not investment advice.

For those navigating the world of cryptocurrency, understanding these pivotal moments in tech is crucial, as they often foreshadow shifts in data governance, privacy, and the very infrastructure of decentralized systems. From the moment Sam Altman stepped onto the stage at a packed San Francisco venue, it was clear this was no ordinary interview. What unfolded was a direct confrontation over the contentious OpenAI lawsuit with The New York Times, highlighting tensions that could redefine the future of digital content and user data. Why is Sam Altman So Adamant About the New York Times Lawsuit? The live recording of the ‘Hard Fork’ podcast, typically a platform for tech discourse, quickly transformed into a public battleground. Sam Altman , alongside COO Brad Lightcap, made an unexpected early entrance, immediately seizing the narrative. His opening gambit was a direct challenge to the New York Times, asking podcasters Kevin Roose and Casey Newton, ‘Are you going to talk about where you sue us because you don’t like user privacy?’ This bold move immediately redirected the conversation to the heart of the matter: The New York Times’ allegations that OpenAI and Microsoft improperly used its articles to train large language models. Altman was particularly irked by a recent development in the lawsuit, where The New York Times’ lawyers requested OpenAI to retain consumer ChatGPT and API customer data. This demand, even for private conversations or deleted logs, struck a nerve with the OpenAI chief, underscoring his strong stance on user privacy. What’s at Stake in the AI Copyright Battle? The core of the dispute revolves around AI copyright . Publishers argue that AI models, trained on their copyrighted works, could devalue or even replace their content, threatening their economic viability. This isn’t an isolated incident; multiple publishers have filed lawsuits against major AI developers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta for similar reasons. However, the legal tide may be shifting. A significant development occurred recently when OpenAI’s competitor, Anthropic, secured a partial victory in its own legal battle. A federal judge ruled that Anthropic’s use of books for training its AI models was permissible under certain circumstances. This ruling could set a crucial precedent, potentially emboldening other tech companies and altering the landscape of future AI copyright disputes, including the ongoing OpenAI lawsuit . How is ChatGPT Privacy Redefining User Rights? A particularly contentious point raised by Sam Altman was the New York Times’ demand for OpenAI to retain consumer ChatGPT and API customer data, even for users engaging in private mode or those who have requested data deletion. Altman articulated OpenAI’s strong stance on user privacy, stating, ‘The New York Times… is taking a position that we should have to preserve our users’ logs even if they’re chatting in private mode, even if they’ve asked us to delete them.’ This highlights a critical tension: the need for data for legal discovery versus the user’s right to privacy, especially in a world increasingly reliant on AI interactions. OpenAI asserts it takes steps to prevent harmful interactions and directs users to professional services, but acknowledges the difficulty in reaching users in ‘a fragile enough mental place’ with warnings. The ongoing debate around ChatGPT privacy underscores the complex ethical and legal challenges facing AI developers and users alike. What Are the Broader Challenges Facing the AI Industry? Beyond the legal skirmishes, OpenAI faces intense pressure from within the broader AI industry . Competition is fierce, with giants like Meta actively trying to poach OpenAI’s top talent, reportedly offering lucrative $100 million compensation packages. When asked about Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s true belief in superintelligent AI, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap quipped, ‘I think [Zuckerberg] believes he is superintelligent,’ underscoring the cutthroat nature of the talent war. Furthermore, OpenAI’s crucial partnership with Microsoft, once a major accelerant, is reportedly experiencing ‘points of tension’ as both ambitious companies increasingly compete in enterprise software and other domains. These internal and external pressures illustrate that OpenAI’s leadership is constantly navigating a complex web of legal challenges, competitive threats, and strategic partnerships, all while attempting to safely deploy highly intelligent AI systems at scale. The future direction of the AI industry will heavily depend on how these powerful entities manage their rivalries and collaborations. A Pivotal Moment for AI’s Future The dramatic encounter between Sam Altman and The New York Times journalists was more than just a public spat; it was a microcosm of the profound challenges and transformations sweeping across the AI industry . From the intricate legal battles over AI copyright and the critical importance of ChatGPT privacy to the relentless pursuit of talent and market dominance, OpenAI, under the leadership of Sam Altman , is at the epicenter of a defining era. The outcomes of the ongoing OpenAI lawsuit and similar legal challenges will undoubtedly set precedents for how AI models are trained, how user data is handled, and ultimately, how the relationship between technology and content creation evolves. As AI continues its rapid ascent, these foundational debates will shape not only its commercial trajectory but also its ethical framework and societal impact.

46815111,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=778238,1750932028,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/46815111.jpeg,"XRP Bulls On Alert—’This Trendline Is Everything,’ Says Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-this-trendline-is-everything-analyst/,"XRP spent the past forty-eight hours coiling into a textbook inflection zone, and the 15-minute chart published by independent analyst Casi makes it hard to miss where the battle lines now stand. Price is hovering at $2.18, clinging to a steeply rising trendline that has underpinned every impulsive thrust since the local swing low near the 0.618 retracement at $1.9824 on 23 June. That trendline intersects a horizontal shelf of former resistance-turned-support at the 1.618 extension measured from the same base move, labelled on the chart at $2.186. The confluence forms the geometric “apex of consolidation” Casi has been highlighting on X. XRP Price At Breaking Point “This trendline is everything right now,” Casi wrote. “We just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation… that’s the most critical level on the chart, short-term.” The most recent corrective pullback already tagged the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the advance, exactly at $2.145, before bulls forced a reaction. As long as candles continue to close above that retracement—effectively the floor of the micro-range—Casi argues that the underlying market structure remains constructive. A decisive break beneath $2.145, by contrast, would represent both a loss of the diagonal trendline and a surrender of the consolidation base, signalling short-term weakness and, in his words, “opening the door to a deeper flush.” Related Reading: XRP Pullback Nearly Complete—Next Stop: $8 To $12, Says Analyst Overhead, XRP must still reckon with layered resistance. The first ceiling sits at $2.20, but the level called out as “the next big test” is the thicker pink band at $2.25. That mark capped price repeatedly during yesterday’s U.S. session and coincides with a prior 1.272 extension of the late-May corrective leg. “If we can flip that level, we’ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test,” Casi noted, “and from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically!” If price can reclaim $2.25 on expanding volume and then retest it as support, the chart leaves an unobstructed lane toward the 2.618 extension at $2.296—effectively $2.30—and, by projection, the $2.69 Fibonacci target that would complete the measured-move roadmap Casi is tracking. Related Reading: XRP To $30 Beyond 2026? Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch Momentum, however, is not yet offering a clean green light. The lower pane shows a 14-period RSI capped by its own descending trendline that has compressed every rally since 24 June. With the oscillator printing 46.24 (signal) versus 43.59 (base line) at the time of the screenshot, the gauge is climbing but still mid-range. A marginal higher high in price paired with a lower high in RSI would etch a textbook bearish divergence—an outcome Casi told one follower he is “expecting to set up” if XRP pierces $2.25 before consolidating anew. “I think this next high will form a bearish div,” he added. “The RSI is telling me it’s about to set that up.” In short, the token is balanced on a knife-edge: the bull case hinges on the integrity of the $2.145–$2.186 support complex and a breakout through $2.25, while the bear case rests on trendline failure and an RSI divergence confirming upside exhaustion. With liquidity thinning into the weekend, the resolution of this narrow consolidation could shape the next wave—whether that proves to be the ignition of a larger third impulse or the start of a deeper corrective detour. As Casi put it, “This is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.19.

A wallet tagged as “Kewh32” placed a major limit order to offload 275,672 $TRUMP tokens worth $2.49 million. OFFICIAL TRUMP price is already down by 30% over the last 30 days. All this quiet offloading is unfolding just as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) officially went to bat for Trump’s proposed Truth Social ETF. It was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to greenlight a new rule allowing it to list. If approved, the ETF would launch within 90 days and mark a huge leap in Trump’s push into crypto finance. Trump meme whale dumps millions According to the data shared by Lookonchain, the whale who dumped $2.49 million worth of TRUMP tokens had already sold 100k TRUMPs (approx. worth $1 million) just 15 days ago. It still holds over 369,000 TRUMP, worth another $3.3 million. The whale is peeling off positions like it’s pre-election tax season. This gets even worse for the token as around the same time, the Trump Meme Team pulled liquidity. They removed 4.4 million USDC and 347,438 TRUMP tokens (approx. worth $3.12 million). Then comes the next move, they bridged the USDC to Ethereum and dropped $TRUMP into a fresh new wallet. It is being considered as a little wallet cleaning, but maybe it is a stealthy exit. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) to a new wallet. https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiA https://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 TRUMP price is on a decline lately, it is down by almost 40% in the last 60 days, while it dropped marginally over the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, TRUMP is still up by 645% on the year to date (YTD) basis, trading at an average price of $9 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume stood at $268 million. Its partner token, Official Melania Meme, has also witnessed a heavy dump since the launch. MELANIA price is now down by 98% from its all time high of $13.73. It is trading at an average price of $0.213 at press time. Trump plans $2.5B Bitcoin bet via Truth Social As the crypto market recovers, Trump Media has already proposed both a combined Bitcoin-and-Ethereum ETF and a standalone Bitcoin ETF. It has even teased a $2.5 billion fundraise to make Truth Social one of the largest Bitcoin holders on the planet. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs are still soaking up billions, and Trump’s play could turn DJT into a meme stock and a crypto giant in one MAGA-powered shot. But here’s the kicker, DJT is 52% owned by a Trump trust. This suggests that if these ETFs go live and if that meme coin liquidity mysteriously returns, Donald Trump could end up riding a Bitcoin-fueled redemption arc that’s equal parts ETF and meme magic. The global digital assets market surged marginally on Thursday, holding the $3.31 trillion cap. Bitcoin price rallied to hit $108k from below the $100k mark over the last 7 days. BTC is trading at an average price of $107,809 at press time.

Stablecoin volume on Ethereum is projected to grow 15x by 2030, driving significant fee (gas) revenue and supporting long-term price appreciation. Current on-chain metrics, including MVRV, indicate Ethereum is undervalued with substantial upside potential as network activity increases. I recommend long-term investment in Ethereum, either directly or via ETFs like ETHA, to capitalize on institutional adoption and DeFi leadership. Introduction Since my first update on Ethereum back in April of this year (buy recommendation), the asset has appreciated 52.82% compared to 12.89% for the S&P 500 YTD. Today, we will analyse the asset again from the perspective of stablecoin activity as a catalyst for value and price appreciation. On 4 February 2025, the GENIUS bill (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act of 2025) was presented to the US Senate. Basically, this law establishes a federal framework for action and best practices for ‘Payment Stablecoins’ assets. It requires stablecoin issuers to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, with the corresponding implementation of KYC procedures and transaction monitoring through the Travel Rule. The aim of this is to leverage blockchain technology at the transactional and transparency level to improve transaction efficiency and settlements, avoid surprises in collateral quality, and protect the end user. With this regulation, the cryptographic system has been provided with the ideal conditions for mass adoption based on trust and the entry of traditional financial players (see Visa , Mastercard , or JPMorgan ). In today's article, we will analyse Ethereum's asset from the perspective of stablecoin flow as a massive catalyst of value and compare it with other networks of the same type. Analysis - On - Chain With the GENIUS law currently in place, and also previously, the volume of tokenised money (stablecoins) has grown significantly to reach approximately USD 250 billion. With the approval of this law, it is estimated that between now and 2030 there will be exponential growth in the volume of stablecoins, multiplying the current amounts by 15 to reach USD 4 trillion in tokenised money. As we can see in the image below, the Ethereum network dominates the market in terms of this activity, far surpassing its main competitors (Tron, Binance, and Solana). This data is very important in terms of investment thesis, as the existence of a higher volume generates higher fees (revenue) for the protocol itself. With this and the network's configuration in terms of burning supply through L2 fees, conditions are often created for a sustained price increase. Node Analytica Secondly, we now turn to the volume of stablecoins flowing through the Ethereum network. As we can see in the graph, the current volume reaches 100 billion dollars on a weekly basis. This volume is mainly dominated by the USDT, USDC and DAI protocols. The companies that own these protocols, Tether, Circle and MakerDAO, collateralise liquid assets such as treasury bills or cash & equivalents with which they back their own stablecoins. As mentioned above, with the approval of the GENIUS Act, we will gradually begin to see players from the traditional financial industry entering this market. We can also see in the graph that, in recent times, the volume of stablecoins has grown significantly on the Ethereum network, rising from 70 billion USD to 100 billion. Among other things, this has led to a price increase, but not enough in my opinion, which is why I believe the asset is undervalued, although we will discuss this in detail in the last part of the article. Node Analytica The following image shows the amount of gas (revenue) generated by the different sectors operating within the Ethereum network. Readers should not be alarmed by the shape of the graph and the gas levels generated during 2022, as this was typical of the network when it operated under the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol. Current levels are actually normal. The information in this graph is crucial to our bullish thesis because greater gas generation by the different sectors leads to greater use of the network, ultimately resulting in greater utility, transactionality, and speed in the token that models the Ethereum economy. Node Analytica In this graph, we isolate the ‘Stablecoins’ sector and calculate the cumulative sum of Gas contributed to the Ethereum protocol throughout history to see how important the sector has been and to look at its growth potential. As we can see, the ‘Stablecoins’ sector has generated fees for the protocol of more than USD 1.4 billion over time and continues to trend upwards. If the scenario for 2030 mentioned above were to come to pass and the volume of stablecoins grew by 1,500%, this would translate into an increase in the same magnitude in the Gas generated by this sector and, therefore, a massive increase in the price of the asset. I firmly believe that we are facing unprecedented growth in Ethereum, which, accompanied by the flow of institutional capital already flowing into it, makes this asset a unique investment opportunity. Node Analytica Finally, we look at Ethereum's MVRV metric, which compares market value to realised value. It is currently around 0.4, a level that in previous cycles has coincided with moments of undervaluation. When the Market Value Realised Value has reached values between 1.5 and 2, Ethereum has marked local highs around USD 4,000 before entering an overbought zone from a technical point of view. Furthermore, if we look at the price ranges based on this ratio, the highs in this cycle are projected to be between USD 4,800 and USD 6,400. With the current price close to USD 2,500, the upside potential remains very significant, especially if activity on the network accelerates thanks to the volume of stablecoins operating on the network. This leads us to an important consideration: is the market underestimating the potential for commission income (gas) on Ethereum? A higher volume of stablecoins translates into more transactions, more fees, and a strengthening of the asset's role as a driver of the decentralised finance sector. This dual momentum—network usage fees and leadership in DeFi—could lead us to reconsider the fair value of ETH in the coming quarters. CryptoQuant Conclusion In conclusion, and to wrap up this article, I recommend investing in Ethereum for the long term, either by purchasing the asset itself on secure exchanges such as Coinbase or by investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) promoted by BlackRock. If you choose to gain exposure to the asset through the ETF, you will not incur the risks associated with custody, although you will pay a slightly higher commission than if you purchase it directly on a centralised exchange.",ETH-USD|ETH|ETHE|ETHT|ETHA,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-26 10:03:15

John Deaton Says It’s Decentralized,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-doesnt-control-xrp-john-deaton-says-its-decentralized/,"The post Ripple Doesn’t Control XRP? John Deaton Says It’s Decentralized appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the United States moves forward with clearer cryptocurrency regulations , one of the most debated topics — Is XRP centralized? — is finally finding resolution. Many critics have long argued that Ripple’s control over a large portion of XRP supply makes it centralized. But recent legal outcomes and technical facts prove otherwise. Why People Think XRP Is Centralized The confusion largely stems from Ripple holding around 40% of the total XRP supply. This has led many to believe Ripple controls the network. But this is a misunderstanding of how XRP works. On June 26, prominent crypto attorney John E. Deaton addressed this on X (formerly Twitter), stating: “75K XRP holders from 143 countries around the globe is pretty darn decentralized to me. People often conflate the token of the network with the network itself.” He clarified that owning a large number of tokens doesn’t equal controlling the protocol. Ripple’s Legal Win Clarifies XRP’s Status The debate around XRP’s centralization intensified due to the SEC lawsuit that began in 2020, accusing Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After nearly five years of legal proceedings, the case officially concluded on May 8, 2025 , with Ripple winning a favorable outcome and paying only a reduced penalty. Importantly, the court confirmed that XRP is not a security when traded in secondary markets, reinforcing its status as a decentralized digital asset. This decision provided legal clarity and boosted investor confidence. Why XRP Is Technically Decentralized Beyond legal clarity and community ownership, several technical aspects of the XRP Ledger support its decentralized nature: 1. Independent Validators The XRP Ledger runs on a consensus model with over 150 independent validators . Ripple controls only one validator , meaning it cannot force changes or manipulate the network. 2. No Centralized Mining XRP doesn’t use proof-of-work like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This avoids control by mining pools and ensures equal participation from validators. 3. 80% Consensus Required for Changes Any update to the XRP Ledger must gain 80% validator approval for two consecutive weeks. This strict requirement makes unilateral control by Ripple impossible. [post_titles_links postid=”475091″] Ripple CEO: Utility Over Ideology Even Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple , recently argued that decentralization shouldn’t be the only benchmark. He emphasized that what matters is the utility, transparency, and security of the network — not just ideology. While Ripple does hold a significant amount of XRP, it has no control over the XRP Ledger’s rules or validation process. That power lies with a diverse and global community. Final Thought The long-standing debate over XRP’s centralization is finally settling, thanks to facts, legal clarity, and growing global participation. With 75,000 XRP holders across 143 countries, over 150 validators, and a network that demands consensus for change, XRP is proving itself to be a decentralized asset at its core.Ripple may be the face of XRP, but it is not the hand behind the curtain.

The U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHHA) has issued a new directive that allows Americans to use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to qualify for a mortgage, without converting their crypto into dollars. This step could bring digital assets into the heart of the $20 trillion U.S. mortgage market, signaling a big moment for crypto’s role in everyday finance. Good news for the 55 million Americans who own crypto. @NatCryptoAssoc https://t.co/zUG8hWP1wk — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin Just Got Closer to the American Dream Under Director Bill Pulte, the FHFA has instructed mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to integrate cryptocurrency payments into mortgage eligibility assessments. This directive positions Bitcoin as a credible form of collateral in mainstream finance, a sentiment echoed by MicroStrategy cofounder Michael Saylor, who called it a “defining moment” for institutional adoption. “Future generations will remember this as the moment Bitcoin entered the American dream,” Saylor declared in a recent X post . Analyst Eric Coleman stated that this action might allow younger Americans, who are frequently excluded from the housing market will now secure their first mortgages through crypto assets. New Hope for First-Time Homebuyers Analyst Eric Coleman said the change could help younger Americans, especially those struggling to break into the housing market, use their crypto holdings to qualify for home loans. Treating Bitcoin as a reserve asset within the U.S. housing system may finally give digital-native investors a path toward owning property, something that’s long been out of reach for many. But Not Everyone’s Celebrating Despite the excitement, some experts are urging caution. Crypto remains a volatile asset class, and critics warn this move could carry risks similar to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Others in the Bitcoin community have raised concerns around self-custody. To qualify for a mortgage, crypto assets may need to be held on centralized platforms like Coinbase. This raises questions about privacy, ownership, and the trade-offs between regulation and decentralization. Ripple and the Bigger Picture As Ripple and other blockchain companies push for more crypto-friendly regulations, the FHFA directive marks a clear step forward. It blends traditional housing finance with digital innovation in a way that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. Is this the moment crypto truly goes mainstream?

He credited Michael Saylor’s Strategy as the trailblazer that led many corporations that previously never touched crypto to consider holding digital assets in their balance sheet and as part of their corporate reserves. As opposed to only holding fiat, more companies across the globe have been accumulating Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other major tokens as a hedge against inflation. Folkman claimed that companies are also eyeing World Liberty Financial’s token as a potential addition to their corporate reserves. “There has been a lot of interest from several public vehicles who want to use WLFI to be held in their treasuries as well,” said Folkman as quoted by Bloomberg.

New on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that miner revenue has dropped to just $34 million a day, the lowest since April. It’s the weakest miners have seen in more than a year – and one of the worst stretches since July 2022. “Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year,” CryptoQuant said in a post on X . For an industry that runs on thin margins and constant pressure, that’s a big red flag. What’s Behind the Crash? Two key factors are behind this sharp drop in miner income. First, Bitcoin’s transaction fees have fallen by 50%, cutting into what miners earn on top of block rewards. Second, Bitcoin’s price itself has dropped around 15%, which directly impacts miner revenue. When both fees and price take a hit, miners feel it fast. That’s exactly what we’re seeing now and it’s pushing profits close to their lowest point in two years. Margins are tight, rewards are down, and the pressure is building. If this continues, some miners may be forced to scale down or shut off rigs until things improve. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Whales Aren’t Moving the Same Way While miners are struggling, Bitcoin’s biggest holders, the whales, are showing mixed signals. According to Glassnode, there’s no clear pattern among whale wallets right now. Smaller whales, those holding 1 to 10 BTC, are redistributing their coins, possibly locking in profits or shifting strategies. But larger wallets holding 10 to 100 BTC are accumulating instead. That contrast is important. Bigger whales buying usually signals confidence and that might explain why Bitcoin is trying to break above $108,000, a level it’s been testing recently. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score supports this, rising from 0.25 to 0.57 – showing a noticeable uptick in accumulation by these mid-sized whale wallets. As $BTC attempts to reclaim $108K, the Accumulation Trend Score shows no unified cohort behavior. 1–10 #BTC wallets continue distributing, while 10–100 $BTC are net accumulators. Others show mixed signals, though the overall score has rebounded from 0.25 to 0.57 pic.twitter.com/qAivkvziK3 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 26, 2025 So, Where Does This Leave the Market? Right now, the market’s split. Miners are under pressure, but whales are stepping in. If Bitcoin can hold above $108K, it could ease some of the stress on miners and validate the recent accumulation. But if the price drops further, things could get worse before they get better. Either way, this is a moment to watch closely. The choices miners and whales make now could set the tone for what’s next in this cycle.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 10:08:17

Sounds intriguing, right? Now, imagine that same currency is a ruble-backed stablecoin , originating from a nation like Kyrgyzstan, and suddenly, those billions spark significant concerns about global financial integrity. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s the reality of the A7A5 stablecoin , and its rapid ascent is drawing the attention of financial watchdogs worldwide, raising critical questions about its potential role in circumventing international sanctions. What is the A7A5 Stablecoin and Why the Massive Discrepancy? At its core, the A7A5 stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value, pegged to the Russian Ruble. Like other stablecoins, it aims to offer the benefits of blockchain technology – speed, transparency (to a degree), and lower transaction costs – while mitigating the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies. However, the numbers surrounding A7A5 are anything but typical. Despite having a reported market capitalization of just $156 million, this digital asset has facilitated an astonishing $9.3 billion in transactions over a four-month period. This immense disparity between market cap and transaction volume is a glaring red flag. Why is this discrepancy so concerning? Velocity of Funds: Such a high transaction volume relative to market cap suggests an extremely rapid movement of funds. Money is flowing in, being used, and flowing out almost immediately, rather than being held within the stablecoin’s ecosystem for extended periods. Lack of Transparency: While blockchain transactions are pseudonymous, the sheer scale hints at concentrated activity rather than broad, organic adoption. This raises questions about who is moving these vast sums and for what purpose. Potential for Illicit Use: The speed and volume make it an attractive tool for those looking to move large amounts of money quickly and discreetly, potentially outside the purview of traditional financial systems. Reports, notably from BeInCrypto, indicate that the reserves backing A7A5 are held in a Russian state-owned bank. This connection immediately amplifies the existing concerns, especially given the current geopolitical climate and the extensive financial sanctions imposed on Russia. Unpacking the Billions: The Sanctions Evasion Hypothesis The most pressing concern surrounding the A7A5 stablecoin is its potential use in sanctions evasion . With many Russian entities and individuals facing stringent financial restrictions from the international community, finding alternative channels for transactions has become a priority for them. Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins that offer a peg to fiat currencies, present a tempting avenue. How could A7A5 facilitate sanctions evasion? Consider the following: Mechanism Explanation Relevance to A7A5 Off-Ramp/On-Ramp Services Converting traditional fiat currency into crypto and back again, often through less regulated exchanges. Reports link A7A5’s volume to Russian exchanges, suggesting it’s being used as a bridge for funds. Trade Finance Alternatives Using stablecoins to settle international trade, bypassing traditional banking channels that enforce sanctions. Could enable Russian businesses to continue international transactions. Asset Hiding/Transfer Moving wealth across borders discreetly, making it harder for authorities to trace and freeze assets. The high velocity of funds through A7A5 points to rapid transfers rather than long-term holding. The connection to Russian exchanges and a Russian state-owned bank for reserves strengthens the hypothesis that A7A5 might be serving as a crucial financial conduit for sanctioned entities. This not only undermines the effectiveness of international sanctions but also poses a significant threat to global financial stability and security. Is Kyrgyzstan a New Frontier for Kyrgyzstan Crypto Operations? The emergence of A7A5 from Kyrgyzstan brings the nation’s role in the broader Kyrgyzstan crypto landscape into sharp focus. While Kyrgyzstan has shown some openness to blockchain technology, its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains relatively nascent compared to more established financial hubs. This less stringent environment can inadvertently create fertile ground for operations that seek to exploit regulatory gaps. Why Kyrgyzstan? Geographic Proximity: Its proximity to Russia and other Central Asian states makes it a logical nexus for cross-border financial flows in the region. Developing Regulatory Landscape: A less mature regulatory environment might offer more flexibility, or even loopholes, for crypto operations that might face stricter scrutiny elsewhere. Economic Incentives: The potential for economic benefits from facilitating digital asset flows could also play a role in a developing economy. The sheer scale of A7A5’s activity suggests that it’s not merely a small-scale experiment but a significant operation. This places Kyrgyzstan under increased international scrutiny, urging its authorities to address these concerns proactively to prevent their financial system from being perceived as a haven for illicit activities. The Urgent Call for Robust Crypto Regulation The A7A5 saga underscores a critical, ongoing debate: the pressing need for comprehensive and internationally coordinated crypto regulation . As digital assets become increasingly integrated into the global financial system, the risks associated with their misuse – from money laundering to sanctions evasion – become more pronounced. Key Challenges in Crypto Regulation: Borderless Nature: Cryptocurrencies operate globally, making it difficult for individual nations to enforce regulations effectively without international cooperation. Anonymity/Pseudonymity: While transactions are recorded on a public ledger, identifying the real-world identities behind addresses remains a significant hurdle. Rapid Innovation: The crypto space evolves quickly, often outpacing the ability of regulators to understand and legislate new technologies. Varying National Approaches: Different countries adopt diverse regulatory stances, creating opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. The case of A7A5 serves as a stark reminder that gaps in regulation can be exploited, potentially undermining geopolitical stability and the integrity of the traditional financial system. It reinforces the argument for global standards, robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, and greater transparency in stablecoin operations. What Are the Broader Implications? The implications of a stablecoin like A7A5 operating under such suspicious circumstances are far-reaching: Erosion of Sanctions Effectiveness: If digital assets can consistently bypass sanctions, the very tool designed to exert economic pressure loses its efficacy. Increased Geopolitical Tensions: The perception of nations facilitating sanctions evasion through crypto can strain international relations. Reputational Damage for Crypto: Such incidents fuel negative narratives around cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to harsher, less nuanced regulatory responses that could stifle legitimate innovation. Financial System Instability: Unregulated large-scale flows can introduce systemic risks, making it harder to track and manage global financial health. This situation demands a vigilant response from regulators, financial institutions, and the crypto community itself. The future of digital finance hinges on its ability to operate transparently and responsibly, adhering to international norms and laws. Actionable Insights for a Safer Crypto Ecosystem For individuals and institutions alike, understanding the risks posed by entities like A7A5 is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: For Regulators and Governments: Enhance Monitoring: Implement advanced analytics to detect unusual transaction patterns in stablecoins, particularly those linked to high-risk jurisdictions. Foster International Cooperation: Share intelligence and coordinate regulatory responses across borders to close loopholes. Develop Clear Stablecoin Frameworks: Mandate robust reserve audits, transparency requirements, and stringent AML/KYC protocols for all stablecoin issuers. For Crypto Users and Businesses: Due Diligence: Research the stablecoins you use. Understand their backing, issuer, and regulatory compliance. Be Wary of High-Volume, Low-Transparency Assets: If a stablecoin shows massive transaction volume with a disproportionately low market cap, or if its backing is opaque, exercise extreme caution. Advocate for Responsible Innovation: Support projects and platforms that prioritize compliance and transparency. A Wake-Up Call for the Digital Age The story of the A7A5 stablecoin serves as a potent reminder of the dual nature of innovation. While cryptocurrencies offer immense potential for financial inclusion and efficiency, they also present new challenges that demand vigilance and robust governance. The staggering transaction volume, coupled with the explicit links to Russian entities and the ruble, paints a concerning picture of potential sanctions evasion . This situation is a critical test for the global financial community and for the evolving landscape of crypto regulation . It highlights the urgent need for international collaboration to ensure that digital assets are tools for progress, not for illicit activities that undermine global stability.

The exploit targeted cvcrvUSD, a wrapped version of Curve DAO’s ( CRV ) crvUSD token staked through Convex Finance. Analysts say the attacker manipulated the share price of cvcrvUSD by sending small donations, which artificially inflated its value. Because Resupply’s exchange rate formula relied on this inflated price, the system became vulnerable. You might also like: Hacken bridge exploited for $250k HAI token following private key leak The attacker then used Resupply’s smart contract to borrow 10 million reUSD, the platform’s native stablecoin, with just one wei of cvcrvUSD as collateral. The borrowed reUSD was quickly swapped into other assets on external markets, resulting in a net loss of nearly $9.5 million. Additional investigation revealed that the attacker exploited an empty ERC4626 wrapper that was serving as a price oracle in the CurveLend pair of the protocol. This allowed the price of cvcrvUSD to spike using just two crvUSD, bypassing the usual collateral requirements. This incident adds to a growing trend of price manipulation attacks in 2025. Similar exploits have recently affected protocols such as Meta Pool and the GMX/MIM Spell ecosystem, which were both compromised due to oracle vulnerabilities and low-liquidity token manipulation. Weak pricing mechanisms and flash loans remain common tools for attackers, who continue to target DeFi systems with thin trading volumes despite passing contract security audits. Resupply has not yet confirmed whether user funds will be reimbursed or if recovery efforts are underway.

Partly because of the tremendous success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs: $IBIT: iShares Bitcoin Trust, $70.6B Assets Under Management (AUM) $FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, $20.4B AUM $GBTC: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, $19.6B AUM $ETHA: iShares Ethereum Trust, $3.9B AUM $ETHE: Grayscale Ethereum Trust, $2.8B AUM It’s no surprise that more players are ready to enter the game, particularly as the realms of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) move ever-closer together. Only $BTC and $ETH currently have single-asset crypto ETFs, but the pile of pending filings includes everything from $XRP to $SOL to the first-ever NFT ETF, with Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU). And with single-asset crypto ETFs rolling along, institutions aren’t waiting around for the SEC. They’ve already started to move towards multi-asset ETFs. Converting Existing Funds to Multi-Asset ETFs One of the holdups so far has been that the SEC lacks a clear set of rules around crypto ETFs, even after the $BTC and $ETH approvals went ahead. The question now is, will the SEC hold approvals until they draw up new rules? Or will they approve first and develop the rule set as they go? There is some time pressure at work here. Grayscale wants to convert its Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) to an ETF, and the deadline for that is July 2. That fund already holds a number of crypto assets, including $XRP, $SOL, and $ADA. If the conversion is approved, look for others to follow. Investment managers from Bitwise to Hasdex have plans to convert other funds to multi-asset ETFs that include cryptos. The funds sit at the top of the financial and investment world, and every one that gets approved boosts Solana’s long-term outlook just slightly. But much, much farther down, there’s another reason to be excited for Solana. The frenetic, fast-paced world of Solana meme coin trading just got a tool that could bring much-needed clarity and make finding those 10x or 100x opportunities much easier. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – One Bot to Rule Them All for Meme Coin Trading on Telegram What do you need to find and trade memes on Telegram? You need: Lightning-fast transactions and swaps Automated sniping, to get in and out at the right time Protection from rug pulls, honeypots, and front-running trades Thankfully, traders now have Snorter Bot , the meme coin-styled trading bot designed specifically for trading low-cap Solana memes on Telegram.

In a major announcement on Wednesday, the company revealed it is rolling out crypto trading services and launching blockchain-based international remittances. The move marks a significant pivot for the firm, which had exited the crypto industry in November 2023 due to regulatory limitations tied to its bank charter. Customers will now be able to buy, sell, and hold various cryptocurrencies directly within their SoFi accounts. The company is also introducing on-chain remittance services, allowing users to convert fiat into crypto, transfer it over the blockchain, and reconvert it into local fiat currencies—streamlining cross-border payments. These new services are part of SoFi’s broader push into crypto finance, with plans to support stablecoin offerings and crypto-backed borrowing in the near future. SoFi CEO Sees Long-Term Potential in Blockchain and AI SoFi CEO Anthony Noto expressed strong enthusiasm about the firm’s renewed focus on digital assets. “This is just day one. We can make financial systems faster, safer, more accessible, and lower cost for our members,” he added . The announcement also included plans for staking features and expanded payment options, underscoring SoFi’s aim to become a one-stop-shop for modern financial services. Its Galileo platform, a core part of the company’s infrastructure, will additionally support third-party crypto services such as wallets and custody solutions—allowing SoFi to cater to both consumers and fintech developers in the digital asset ecosystem. SoFi’s timing aligns with bullish industry projections, with Insider forecasting that the fintech blockchain market could grow from $3.4 billion in 2024 to $49 billion by 2030. This potential surge provides fertile ground for SoFi to scale its crypto operations. Regulatory Climate Now More Favorable SoFi’s earlier withdrawal from crypto was a condition of securing a bank charter in 2023. However, recent regulatory shifts have opened the door for its return. With the Federal Reserve easing constraints like “reputational risk” and stablecoin legislation advancing in Congress , the environment now appears more accommodating. In response to the news and broader optimism, SoFi’s stock (SOFI) has risen approximately 12% over the past week.

After three years of steady development, the MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) is finally seeing mainstream adoption. Over 90% of nodes now validate MWEB blocks, and more than 150,000 LTC, about $12 million, has been locked into this confidential ledger. Wallets like Cake and Electrum LTC now support MWEB, offering privacy with efficiency, and making Litecoin more practical as a medium of exchange rather than just a legacy network. Qubetics , however, is currently leading market attention for all the right reasons. With a confirmed listing on one of the top 10 centralized exchanges and only few million tokens remaining, Qubetics offers one of the clearest entry points in today’s market. More than a liquidity event, this listing marks a strategic milestone, opening doors to institutional onboarding, cross-chain interoperability, and retail adoption. With demand surging, this project is being recognized as one of the best altcoins to invest in now for utility-driven growth and early-stage positioning. Meanwhile, Cronos has been trading near key support at $0.084, following a 5% weekly dip. Despite the correction, attention is shifting toward July’s anticipated network upgrade. This upgrade will introduce sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transactions, dramatically improving dApp performance and developer accessibility. With bullish patterns forming and technical momentum building, Cronos could become one of the best altcoins to invest in now as the second half of 2025 unfolds. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Transactions with Real-World Utility Qubetics delivers a solution that legacy projects have failed to resolve: seamless, low-cost cross-border transactions. The network enables businesses, freelancers, and individuals to bypass slow settlement systems and costly intermediaries. Through its native protocol, users can send and receive digital value across jurisdictions, with near-zero delays and stable on-chain execution. Its interoperability-first architecture ensures that enterprises are not locked into a single chain. By offering a decentralized financial network with global compliance potential, Qubetics aligns with future-facing blockchain models. This level of real-world usability is what continues to drive traction, and why many rank Qubetics among the best altcoins to invest in now. Stage 37 Presale and Tokenomics Overhaul Strengthen Fundamentals Qubetics has officially entered Stage 37, the final phase of its crypto presale . At $0.3370 per $TICS token, and with a confirmed listing at $0.40, current participants are guaranteed a 20% value boost on listing day. So far, over $18.1 million has been raised, more than 516 million tokens sold, and over 28,200 unique holders have joined the ecosystem. In addition, the protocol underwent a tokenomics transformation earlier this quarter. The total supply has been reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens, while the public allocation increased to 38.55%. This creates a more sustainable economic model, enhances scarcity, and supports community-led governance. Analysts closely monitoring token distribution and early performance have consistently ranked Qubetics among the best altcoins to invest in now based on presale fundamentals. Exchange Debut Imminent: Final Chance to Join Before Market Exposure Qubetics is now set for listing on one of the world’s top 10 centralized exchanges. The confirmed listing price of $0.40 ensures a 20% gain from the current presale entry of $0.3370. With fewer than 10 million tokens remaining, access is narrowing quickly. The listing represents a strategic shift into broader access, bringing in institutional market makers, enabling liquidity scaling, and triggering new deployments of Qubetics-powered applications. The network is now preparing for expanded developer activity, retail traction, and full market participation heading into Q3 and Q4 2025. At this trajectory, a $2,500 entry at the $0.3370 rate could grow into a $37,500 to $75,000 opportunity over time. With security validated through a CertiK audit scoring above 80%, Qubetics is entering the market with one of the most battle-tested rollouts seen in this cycle. These are the elements placing Qubetics at the top of many rankings for the best altcoins to invest in now. Litecoin: Privacy and Fungibility Driving New Demand Litecoin’s MWEB feature is drawing renewed attention as adoption metrics continue to grow. Enabled in 2022 and now validated by over 90% of miners and nodes, MWEB offers confidential transactions with native CoinJoin and stealth address integration. More than 150,000 LTC has been locked into the private extension layer, proving the demand for scalable privacy. What makes MWEB stand out is its optional design. Unlike Monero or Zcash, where privacy is either default or heavy on-chain, Litecoin provides a lightweight alternative. Wallet support is increasing, and analysts believe that the rising pool size will only enhance privacy further by obscuring flows. With low transaction costs and faster confirmations, Litecoin is becoming a practical digital medium of exchange once again. This renewed functionality places it back on the radar of serious buyers considering the best altcoins to invest in now. Cronos: Under-the-Radar Contender with July Upgrade Potential Cronos has quietly established a foothold within the DeFi and GameFi sectors. Backed by Crypto.com, the chain enables seamless app deployment and fast transaction finality. While its recent 5% decline may seem like a setback, the bigger story is the forthcoming July upgrade. Set to deliver sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transaction speeds, this upgrade is designed to supercharge Cronos’ performance. For developers, this means lower fees and improved on-chain responsiveness. For market participants, it points to growing network activity and better infrastructure performance. With CRO trading at around $0.084, analysts consider this a crucial support zone. If this level holds and the upgrade delivers, Cronos could reenter the spotlight and gain ground in rankings of the best altcoins to invest in now. Final Thoughts As market conditions begin shifting in favor of high-utility assets, several projects are rising to the top. Litecoin is proving that privacy can be optional and scalable. Cronos is building toward a high-performance future with its July upgrade. But Qubetics, with its confirmed CEX launch and presale momentum, is dominating attention. Only less than 10 million tokens remain at the $0.3370 price point. The listing at $0.40 locks in a rare 20% return from day one, positioning it as one of the most compelling entries in today’s digital asset market. Once public access begins, the value proposition shifts. Those seeking the best altcoins to invest in now are acting quickly. Between usability, tokenomics, security, and a strategic exchange debut, Qubetics delivers a full-stack value case unmatched in current presale offerings. Secure allocation now while the door is still open. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What is the best altcoin to invest in now with guaranteed listing ROI? Qubetics is offering a 20% ROI with a confirmed CEX listing at $0.40, making it a top pick for short-term value. How does Qubetics stand out from other crypto presales? Its real-world use case in cross-border transactions, tight tokenomics, and audited security give it strong market positioning. Why is Litecoin gaining traction again? Litecoin’s optional privacy layer via MWEB is seeing rapid adoption, boosting utility without sacrificing speed or cost-efficiency. Is Cronos still a viable altcoin despite recent dips? Yes. Cronos is preparing for a major July upgrade that could deliver sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transactions. How many Qubetics tokens are left in the presale? Fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens remain at the $0.3370 price before the confirmed exchange listing. Summary: This article identifies the best altcoins to invest in now, spotlighting Qubetics, Litecoin, and Cronos. Qubetics leads with a confirmed listing on a top 10 exchange at $0.40, offering a 20% return for current participants in its final presale phase. With under 10 million tokens left and over $18.1 million raised, it’s regarded as one of the top crypto presale opportunities of 2025. Litecoin gains momentum as its MWEB privacy layer surpasses 150,000 LTC locked, enabling scalable and optional privacy for everyday transactions. Cronos, meanwhile, is holding key support at $0.084 and preparing for a major July upgrade to enable sub-second, Ethereum-compatible transactions. Together, these altcoins offer strong fundamentals, utility-driven growth, and timely entry points, making them standout picks for strategic backers seeking value now.

According to the press release , the penalty marks the first enforcement action under the law, which took effect in 2023 to enhance oversight of digital asset companies. Coinme operates a network of cryptocurrency kiosks, also known as crypto ATMs, at various retail locations across California. These machines allow customers to buy and sell digital assets using cash or debit cards. However, according to DFPI, Coinme broke the rules by allowing transactions that exceeded the daily limit of $1,000 per customer, a clear breach of DFAL provisions. In addition to exceeding transaction limits, the DFPI found that Coinme failed to provide required transaction disclosures on customer receipts, another violation of the state’s digital finance regulations. California Regulators Send a Clear Message About Crypto ATM Under a consent order, Coinme agreed to pay the $300,000 fine, which includes $51,700 in restitution to an elderly California resident who was exploited in a crypto scam facilitated through one of the company’s kiosks. The company must also implement operational changes to ensure compliance and prevent future violations. DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni emphasized that the enforcement action aims to set a precedent. “This enforcement action should send a strong message to kiosk operators that California means business when it requires digital asset companies to follow the rules that help prevent scammers from taking advantage of unsuspecting Californians,” said Mohseni. The DFAL was specifically designed to address growing fraud involving crypto kiosks, which have become a tool for scammers targeting vulnerable groups, especially older adults. Victims are often tricked into transferring funds directly into scammers’ digital wallets via these machines. Meanwhile, this is not the first time the state will go after crypto service providers. In May, the California DFPI and Department of Justice teamed up to fight crypto fraud, shutting down 26 scam websites with the help of a widely used Crypto Scam Tracker tool. Based on consumer complaints, the tool has helped uncover $4.6 million in losses linked to fraudulent schemes. California regulators received 2,668 complaints from residents through its ‘Crypto Scam Tracker’ tool, that led to identify 7 new scam schemes. #CryptoScam #CryptoFraud #CaliforniaDFPI https://t.co/GEhyLAXURy — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 11, 2025 In 2023, Californians lost around $1.2 billion to crypto scams, according to the FBI. Notably, the DFPI received 2,668 complaints, leading to the discovery of seven new fraud cases. California Crypto Regulations and Licenses Take Shape California is moving closer to embracing cryptocurrency in public finance with the unanimous passage of Assembly Bill 1180. Approved by the State Assembly on June 2, the bill authorizes the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to launch a pilot program allowing state agencies to accept digital assets for fee payments. California Assembly unanimously approves crypto payments bill. AB-1180 now heads to the Senate. #crypto #California https://t.co/HCk96E5CxN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Introduced by Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, the bill also mandates that DFPI submit a detailed report by January 1, 2028, evaluating crypto transaction volumes, regulatory challenges, and recommendations. The program will sunset on July 1, 2031. In addition, AB-1180 establishes the Digital Financial Assets Law, requiring businesses to obtain a DFPI license by July 1, 2025, to operate in the crypto space. It also sets rules for consumer protection and stablecoin use. While the bill doesn’t mandate crypto adoption, it empowers DFPI to explore secure, efficient digital payment systems, positioning California as a potential leader in public-sector crypto integration.

Amid this speculation, hostilities in the Middle East escalated, which put further pressure on the crypto market. Most of the value was in Bitcoin contracts, which accounted for $3.5 billion, while Ethereum options were worth around $565 billion. The put-to-call ratio for BTC was 1.0, which suggested a neutral stance; meanwhile, ETH had a ratio of 0.69, which suggests a rise in bullish expectations. Crypto markets remain in a cautious mood amid fears that conflict in the Middle East could escalate, causing global economic problems. Despite the challenges, BTC has recovered to over $100k after briefly falling below the level over the weekend. While all of this is going on, investors are looking for opportunities for growth elsewhere, and one of their best options so far has been the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. Based on the current performance of the presale, MUTM tokens could be one of the biggest gainers of 2025. There are various factors driving the current performance, which include the project’s focus on utility. Additionally, the protocol’s design that ensures continuous growth has been pivotal to helping drive up participation in the presale. Details OF The MUTM Token Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. So far, over $11.2 million worth of tokens have been sold to around 12,450 buyers. In the upcoming phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The token price has attracted massive attention from the crypto market, which has led to 50% of the tokens set aside for phase sold less than a month after they went live. One of the main reasons for this fast pace is that tokens in the current phase are going for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. Analysts are extremely confident about the future of MUTM tokens, and they forecast the price could go up by 31x when the tokens go live. Based on this massive upside forecast, a $1,700 purchase in the presale now could grow to over $52,000. Coupled with the massive discount available right now, this is one opportunity that you do not want to miss. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Design A major reason for the high interest in MUTM tokens is the design of the protocol. It is built as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, they can deposit their assets in exchange for an annual percentage yield (APY) that is dictated by the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool and take loans, the utilization rate rises, which thus increases the interest rate. The rising interest rate prompts borrowers to repay loans in the pool, which incentivizes more lenders to deposit liquidity in a pool to benefit from the higher yields. Over time, this will boost the total liquidity in the pool, which will ensure a stable ecosystem. At the same time, this design ensures that the protocol achieves optimal capital efficiency on its own. By offering a system where the market forces set the optimal market rates, it could attract more users, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the biggest DeFi ecosystems by user numbers. A good example of how this system works is when a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDT into a pool. If the APY rises to 17% due to high utilization, the depositor stands to make $1,700 a year. That is a massive income that requires no trading expertise or complex trading strategies. On top of that, users of the protocol enjoy massive protection in the form of overcollateralization. That simply means that borrowers must deposit collateral worth more than the value of the loan they plan to take. The overcollateralization level varies based on the exact type of asset they use as collateral. For more volatile assets, more conservative overcollateralization is required due to the possibility of a sudden market movement. The requirement creates a buffer in which liquidators can act to stabilize the ecosystem. When a loan position falls below the liquidation threshold, a liquidation event is triggered, allowing the liquidators to purchase the collateral at a discount. This discount ensures that liquidators have a monetary incentive to act for the benefit of the protocol’s health. It can be increased as needed to incentivize liquidators to act faster to protect the solvency of the ecosystem. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect entry point to position yourself for the upcoming altcoin rally. With a generous 50% discount on the MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale, this is the best opportunity you have to make life-changing returns in the crypto sector.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. attracted over $547 million in inflows on Wednesday, extending their winning streak to 12 consecutive days, a bullish signal backed by institutional demand. But it’s not just ETF data fueling the rally. Crypto Gets Major Boost from U.S. Housing Policy In a landmark move, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to recognize crypto assets when evaluating mortgage eligibility. This unprecedented step toward mainstream crypto adoption is being hailed as a long-term bullish catalyst for the industry. Technical Setup Signals Bitcoin Breakout Technically, Bitcoin is showing a strong V-shaped recovery, with its price hovering near $107,383, a key resistance level. A breakout above this zone could flip the market structure and pave the way to a new all-time high (ATH). According to crypto analyst Ran Neuner, Bitcoin’s next ATH may arrive in just 42 days, driven by a steady upward climb rather than a sudden spike. He emphasizes that the recent global ceasefire has given financial markets the breathing room they needed, and Bitcoin is leading the charge. “The rally won’t be a single big green candle. It’s already happening gradually,” Neuner stated. Jerome Powell’s Testimony Fuels the Bull Case Another bullish driver? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent testimony. Powell noted that the Fed might have already begun rate cuts if not for inflation risks stemming from Trump’s proposed tariffs. Still, Powell confirmed that the Fed is on track for three interest rate cuts this year in July, September, and December. Lower rates often boost risk-on assets like Bitcoin, making this a critical green light for investors. Dollar Weakens, Wall Street Cheers Following Powell’s remarks, the U.S. dollar began to slide, another bullish signal for Bitcoin. Wall Street responded swiftly: the NASDAQ hit a new ATH, and the S&P 500 is on the verge of confirming a golden cross — a highly regarded bullish technical pattern. Interestingly, historical data shows that Bitcoin tends to hit a new ATH around 41 days after the S&P 500 does. That correlation is now catching the eye of analysts who view this as a signal that Bitcoin’s next major breakout is already in motion. Altcoin Season? Not So Fast While Bitcoin looks poised for liftoff, most altcoins may not follow — at least not right away.According to Neuner, the altcoin rally will be selective, favoring tokens backed by institutional interest.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for market sentiment, has recently climbed to a significant 74, firmly placing the cryptocurrency market in the ‘Greed’ zone. This eight-point jump from the previous day, as of June 26, signals a notable shift in investor psychology. But what does this rising tide of optimism truly mean for your investments, and how should you navigate these increasingly confident waters? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Pulse Check on Market Sentiment At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative.me, is designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It’s a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 100, where: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly concerned, often leading to selling pressure. 25-49: Fear – Uncertainty and anxiety prevail, but not to extreme levels. 50-74: Greed – A growing sense of optimism and a willingness to buy. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often signaling a potential market top as assets become overvalued. Why is this index so crucial? Because emotions often drive investment decisions, especially in volatile markets like crypto. By aggregating various data points, the index attempts to give a more objective view of collective market sentiment , helping investors avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on emotion. What Does a Score of 74 in the ‘Greed’ Zone Imply for the Cryptocurrency Market? A score of 74 is a clear indicator that optimism is running high. Investors are feeling confident, and there’s a strong appetite for buying. While this might sound universally positive, seasoned crypto enthusiasts know that periods of ‘Greed’ can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects strong momentum and potential for further price appreciation as more capital flows into the cryptocurrency market . On the other hand, extreme greed can sometimes precede market corrections, as assets become overbought and ripe for profit-taking. Historically, legendary investors like Warren Buffett have advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This contrarian approach suggests that times of widespread greed might be opportune moments for caution, perhaps even for trimming positions, rather than blindly chasing pumps. It’s about recognizing when the crowd might be getting ahead of itself. Dissecting the Drivers: The Six Pillars of the Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of six distinct factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market sentiment. Understanding these components is key to grasping the index’s movements: 1. Volatility (25% Weighting) What it measures: This component analyzes the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High volatility often indicates a fearful market (big price drops) or an extremely greedy one (rapid pumps). Stable, lower volatility might suggest calm before a storm or a period of consolidation. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25% Weighting) What it measures: It looks at the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing them with the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. What it means for sentiment: High buying volumes in a rising market indicate strong positive momentum and increasing greed. Conversely, high selling volumes suggest fear. 3. Social Media (15% Weighting) What it measures: This factor analyzes social media trends, specifically tracking hashtags and mentions related to cryptocurrencies, their volume, and sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). What it means for sentiment: A surge in positive social media mentions, particularly on platforms like Twitter (X), often correlates with rising excitement and greed. It’s a direct gauge of the public’s chatter. 4. Surveys (15% Weighting – Currently Paused) What it measures: Historically, this component gathered data from weekly polls, asking thousands of people about their perception of the crypto market. What it means for sentiment: Although currently paused, surveys offer a direct insight into investor confidence. Their reintroduction could provide another valuable layer of sentiment data. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10% Weighting) What it measures: This refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. What it means for sentiment: A rising Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors flock to the perceived safety and stability of Bitcoin during uncertain times. A falling dominance, on the other hand, suggests that investors are moving into altcoins, which typically happens during periods of higher risk appetite and greed (often called ‘altcoin season’). 6. Google Trends (10% Weighting) What it measures: It analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. What it means for sentiment: A sudden increase in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often signals fear, while a surge in general terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “crypto investment” can indicate growing public interest and potential greed. Here’s a quick overview of the index’s components: Factor Weighting Impact on Index (General) Volatility 25% High volatility can indicate fear or extreme greed. Market Momentum/Volume 25% High buying volume = Greed; High selling volume = Fear. Social Media 15% Positive sentiment = Greed; Negative sentiment = Fear. Surveys (Paused) 15% Direct investor opinion. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Rising dominance = Fear; Falling dominance = Greed (altcoin season). Google Trends 10% Search interest for buying = Greed; Panic searches = Fear. The Pivotal Role of Bitcoin in Shaping Market Sentiment It’s no secret that Bitcoin often acts as the bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency market. Its price movements and overall health significantly influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Given its dominant market capitalization and its status as the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the general mood of investors. When Bitcoin is rallying, optimism tends to spread across altcoins, pushing the index higher into the ‘Greed’ zone. Conversely, a sharp correction in Bitcoin’s price can quickly send the index plummeting into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, as investors become risk-averse. This strong correlation highlights why keeping an eye on Bitcoin’s fundamentals and technical analysis, alongside the sentiment index, is crucial for any comprehensive investment strategy . A rising Bitcoin price, coupled with high social media engagement and trading volume, directly contributes to the current ‘Greed’ reading of 74. Crafting Your Investment Strategy in a ‘Greedy’ Market So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashing ‘Greed’, how should you adjust your investment strategy ? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution: While it’s tempting to jump into a rising market, remember that ‘Greed’ often precedes corrections. Consider taking some profits if you’re holding significant gains, especially on assets that have seen parabolic increases. Rebalance Your Portfolio: Use this period to re-evaluate your portfolio. Are you over-allocated to risky assets? Perhaps it’s time to rebalance towards a more diversified mix, or even increase your stablecoin holdings. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): The higher the index, the stronger the FOMO. Don’t let emotional impulses drive your decisions. Stick to your pre-defined investment plan and risk tolerance. Research Thoroughly: Even in a bull market, not all projects are created equal. Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects that still have room to grow, rather than chasing speculative pumps. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your capital. If you’re entering new positions or holding existing ones, setting appropriate stop-loss orders can help mitigate potential losses if the market suddenly reverses. Look for Contrarian Opportunities: While most assets might be overvalued, there could still be gems that haven’t caught the market’s attention yet, or assets that are temporarily undervalued despite the overall optimism. Challenges and Limitations of Relying Solely on Sentiment While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to understand its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects current sentiment, which is often a reaction to past price movements. It doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Not a Trading Signal: It should not be used as a standalone buy or sell signal. A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash, nor does ‘Fear’ guarantee a bounce. Market Manipulation: Large institutional players or ‘whales’ can sometimes influence market sentiment, making the index less reliable for predicting short-term movements. Context is Key: The meaning of a particular score can vary depending on the broader macroeconomic environment, regulatory news, and technological advancements within the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster with Prudence The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 is a significant indicator of robust optimism within the cryptocurrency market. It reflects a period where confidence is high, and the appetite for digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , is strong. While this environment presents exciting opportunities, it also calls for heightened awareness and a disciplined investment strategy . By understanding the factors that drive this index and combining its insights with thorough fundamental and technical analysis, investors can make more informed decisions, mitigate risks, and potentially capitalize on the market’s emotional ebb and flow. Remember, true success in crypto often comes from maintaining a clear head when others are losing theirs.

What could it mean for crypto security? Using a quantum annealer from D‑Wave, a team of researchers at Shanghai University managed to factor a 22‑bit key using a novel method that translates the task into a form the quantum machine can handle, according to a report by Earth.com. RSA, which stands for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, is a public-key cryptosystem that is commonly used for secure data transmission. Systems that use the encryption system include online bank accounts, web browsers, email providers, messaging services, VPNs, and cloud services. Although 22-bit is still a small number compared to the larger 2,048‑bit keys or even 3072-bit used in real-world encryption, the breakthrough is significant because it proved that quantum computing can reach beyond the previous 19-bit record. By tweaking model parameters, the researchers raised success rates and showed how their approach could scale more bits in the future. This means that in the future, with more computational resources per bit, the unbreakable RSA could be decrypted. As a result, many institutions like NIST and the White House are already rolling out quantum-safe standards and urging agencies and companies to switch to post-quantum cryptography, warning of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. You might also like: Cisco Talos: New North Korean threat ‘PylangGhost’ targets crypto workers through fake job sites Does cryptocurrency use RSA encryption? Though RSA is widely used in many aspects of our digital systems, most modern cryptocurrencies do not use the encryption for signing transactions or wallet security. Instead, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) rely heavily on Elliptic Curve Cryptography or ECC, including Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ECDSA and the later model EdDSA in newer projects. Although this is the case, the crypto space does make use of the encryption model in other areas that are just as crucial to security. For instance, certain crypto exchanges, custody services and payment platforms may still use RSA encryption for SSL/TLS infrastructure. Additionally, some cold storage systems or older crypto projects and old wallets containing sensitive information may still rely on RSA for internal key storage or back-up encryption. The same applies for encrypted data archives and back-ups at crypto custodians or blockchain companies. You might also like: Chinese researchers claim 48-bit encryption cracked with quantum computing Why the RSA quantum breakthrough matters for ECC? Although the experiment applies to RSA, this does not mean that ECC is untouchable. Both RSA and ECC are vulnerable to quantum attacks via Shor’s algorithm. Shor’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently factor large numbers and solve discrete logarithm problems. The algorithm poses a significant threat to the security of many modern cryptographic systems. While this does not directly pose a threat to current more advanced crypto systems, it indicates that quantum progress not just a theoretical concept anymore. The deeper issue is that if quantum hardware can scale factoring algorithms, then the decryption of ECC is not far behind. A powerful enough quantum computer running Shor’s algorithm could bypass ECC by forging blockchain transactions, breaking encrypted communication between wallets and nodes, as well as gain access to private keys from public BTC or ETH wallets. In the meantime, crypto projects should stay alert and prevent security breaches by performing audits on vulnerable areas such as TLS certificates, API encryption, VPNs and off-chain key management.

This Trump-backed crypto project is reportedly drawing considerable attention from public companies looking to diversify their treasury holdings with digital assets. The news, first reported by Bloomberg and affirmed by WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman at the prestigious Permissionless conference in New York, signals a potentially groundbreaking shift in how traditional businesses view and utilize cryptocurrencies. What is the Buzz Around This Trump-Backed Crypto Initiative? The concept of a cryptocurrency project explicitly linked to a prominent political family like the Trumps immediately ignites curiosity and debate. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) aims to leverage this unique association to build a robust ecosystem around its native token. According to Zak Folkman, the co-founder, the project is designed to offer a new avenue for financial empowerment and digital asset utilization. The Trump family’s involvement, while not fully detailed in its scope, provides an undeniable spotlight, potentially attracting a demographic not typically immersed in the crypto space, alongside traditional institutional investors. The core proposition of WLFI appears to revolve around providing a stable, reliable digital asset that can serve various financial functions, including acting as a treasury reserve. This ambition places WLFI in a unique position, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy, with a distinct political flavor that sets it apart from other crypto ventures. The project’s narrative suggests a focus on liberty and financial freedom, themes that resonate strongly with its political affiliations. Why are Public Firms Eyeing the WLFI Token for Treasury? The interest from public companies in using the WLFI token as a treasury asset is a significant development. For years, corporate treasuries have primarily relied on traditional assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and money market funds. However, with inflation concerns and the search for higher yields, companies are increasingly exploring alternative assets. Bitcoin, pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, has shown the viability of digital assets for treasury management. The appeal of WLFI for these firms could stem from several factors: Diversification: Adding a crypto asset, particularly one with perceived stability or unique backing, can diversify a company’s treasury portfolio. Inflation Hedge: Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as potential hedges against inflation, preserving purchasing power in a volatile economic climate. Growth Potential: While aiming for stability, the inherent growth potential of a nascent crypto project could offer higher returns than traditional low-yield assets. Strategic Alignment: For some companies, aligning with a project backed by a prominent political figure might offer strategic benefits or appeal to a specific customer base. Zak Folkman’s statements suggest that WLFI is positioning itself as a credible and attractive option for corporate balance sheets, aiming to provide a digital asset that meets the stringent requirements of public companies for liquidity, security, and regulatory compliance. The Michael Saylor Connection: A Blueprint for Corporate Treasury Assets? One of the most intriguing aspects highlighted by Folkman is WLFI’s close relationship with Michael Saylor , the executive chairman of MicroStrategy. Saylor is widely recognized as a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption, having famously converted MicroStrategy’s treasury into a significant Bitcoin holding. His strategy has become a de facto blueprint for other public companies considering similar moves. The association with Saylor lends considerable credibility to WLFI’s treasury aspirations. It suggests that the project is not merely dabbling in the idea but is potentially consulting with, or learning from, one of the most experienced figures in the corporate crypto treasury space. Saylor’s insights could help WLFI navigate the complexities of regulatory frameworks, institutional onboarding, and the technical infrastructure required to support large-scale corporate adoption. This connection indicates a serious intent to position WLFI as a viable, institutional-grade asset for companies seeking to optimize their balance sheets in the digital age. For companies considering a digital asset for their treasury, the Saylor endorsement, even if indirect, provides a level of reassurance and a potential roadmap for implementation. It transforms WLFI from just another crypto project into one with a strategic vision for corporate integration. Insights from the Permissionless Conference : What’s Next for WLFI? The Permissionless conference in New York served as a crucial platform for Zak Folkman to share updates on WLFI’s progress and vision. Such industry events are vital for networking, attracting investors, and building community trust. Folkman’s comments at the conference underscore the project’s ambition to become a significant player in the institutional crypto space. While specific details about the tokenomics or technical architecture of WLFI remain somewhat under wraps, the focus on corporate treasury interest suggests a priority on stability, compliance, and scalability. Future developments for WLFI will likely include: Regulatory Engagement: Navigating the complex and evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies will be paramount, especially for attracting public companies. Technological Development: Ensuring the WLFI token and its underlying blockchain infrastructure are robust, secure, and scalable to handle large institutional transactions. Partnerships: Forming strategic alliances with financial institutions, custodians, and other blockchain service providers to facilitate corporate adoption. Transparency: Providing clear communication regarding the project’s roadmap, financial backing, and governance model to build investor confidence. The project’s success will largely depend on its ability to deliver on these fronts and to convince traditional finance players that a politically-backed crypto asset can be a secure and beneficial addition to their balance sheets. Navigating the Landscape of Digital Asset Adoption: Benefits and Challenges The increasing interest in digital assets for corporate treasuries, exemplified by WLFI, highlights a broader trend towards institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. This trend comes with both significant benefits and inherent challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Digital assets can offer 24/7 liquidity, unlike traditional markets. Lower Transaction Costs: Blockchain-based transactions can potentially reduce fees associated with traditional financial transfers. Faster Settlements: Near-instantaneous settlement times compared to traditional banking systems. New Revenue Streams: Opportunities for yield generation through staking, lending, or DeFi protocols. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global regulations remains a significant hurdle. Volatility: While some tokens aim for stability, the crypto market is inherently volatile, posing risks to treasury values. Security Risks: The threat of hacks, scams, and loss of private keys requires robust security protocols. Accounting and Tax Implications: Complexities in how crypto assets are treated for accounting and tax purposes. Public Perception: The association with a political figure could be a double-edged sword, attracting some while alienating others. For public companies, a meticulous due diligence process is essential before integrating any digital asset into their treasury strategy. This includes assessing the asset’s underlying technology, regulatory compliance, security measures, and the reputation of its backers. A Glimpse into the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors and Corporations The emergence of WLFI and its reported corporate interest provides several actionable insights: Monitor Institutional Trends: The move towards corporate treasury crypto indicates a maturing market. Keep an eye on which types of companies are adopting digital assets and why. Understand Project Backing: For investors, the backing of a project, whether by a political family or a prominent industry figure like Michael Saylor, can significantly influence its trajectory and perceived legitimacy. Assess Regulatory Readiness: Projects that actively engage with regulators and prioritize compliance are more likely to gain institutional trust. Diversify Smartly: For corporations considering crypto treasury, start small, understand the risks, and consult with experts in legal, accounting, and cybersecurity fields. The narrative around WLFI highlights a fascinating intersection of politics, finance, and technology. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, projects with unique value propositions and strong strategic backing will undoubtedly shape the future of corporate finance. Conclusion: A New Era for Corporate Treasury? The reported interest from public firms in the Trump-backed crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing institutional adoption of digital assets. With the WLFI token seemingly positioning itself as a viable corporate treasury asset , and the strategic alignment with figures like Michael Saylor , the project stands at the forefront of a potential paradigm shift. While challenges remain, particularly around regulation and market volatility, the discussions at the Permissionless conference confirm a growing appetite among traditional businesses to explore cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading.

Accordingly, Nasdaq-listed online banking platform SoFi Technologies announced that it has restarted its Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading service after a two-year hiatus. At this point, SoFi Technologies, which has made a big comeback in cryptocurrencies, said that it has revived cryptocurrency trading and on-chain money transfers. For SoFi, the move marks a major milestone following its November 2023 crypto exit. With this move, SoFi customers will now be able to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in their accounts. The statement also reported that they will launch a blockchain-based overseas remittance service as well as a lending and staking transaction service. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said: “With innovations in crypto, digital assets and blockchain in general, the future of financial services is being completely reinvented. We are accelerating our efforts to give our members more choice and more control, whether they are investing, sending money across borders or planning for their future. Crypto and blockchain innovations can and will be woven into every aspect of our business and capability, including buying, paying, saving, investing, borrowing and protecting. And as we do this, we will continue to stand alone in providing our members with unparalleled products and services as the only digital one-stop shop for their financial needs.” *This is not investment advice.

But the breach may have revealed more than just security flaws, as troubling on-chain history raises questions over the platform’s operations. According to BeInCrypto, an investigation by blockchain intelligence firm Global Ledger into the June 18 Nobitex hack has found that the platform may have been engaging in stealthy fund movements well before the cyberattack. Per the report, on-chain analysis has revealed a pattern of practices typically linked to money laundering, such as peelchains, one-use wallets, and systematic balance sweeps, deeply embedded in the exchange’s infrastructure. The attack on Nobitex affected multiple chains, resulting in the loss of over $90 million in assets. Shortly after the breach, Nobitex moved 1,801 BTC (worth around $187 million) from exposed wallets to new addresses. While the exchange described this as a protective measure, the investigation shows similar movement patterns had been occurring quietly for months. Hot Wallets, Cold Moves: Nobitex’s shady crypto shuffle Since as far back as October 2024, Nobitex has been using a stealth tactic known as peelchains, a method where funds are gradually split and passed through intermediaries or one-time-use wallets. This technique is used to quietly move large amounts of crypto, while obscuring their trail and making them difficult to trace. On multiple occasions, several hot wallets tied to Nobitex repeatedly passed exactly 30 BTC between addresses, often through one-time-use intermediaries. Funds in these flows were eventually sent to exchange addresses or, in some cases, destinations linked to illicit actors. You might also like: Nobitex hackers leak full source code after $100m crypto heist Additionally, the investigation traced funds moving in and out of a wallet cluster that behaved like a central mixing layer. Many of these wallets had a short lifespan and were used just once before being abandoned, suggesting an intentional scheme to avoid detection. Further evidence shows that Nobitex’s “rescue wallet,” which was supposedly deployed after the hack to safeguard the remaining funds, was found to have been active for months prior, consistently receiving chipped-off funds. The exchange has also continued similar asset movements post-hack and is said to still hold substantial reserves. Global Ledger’s findings now raise questions about Nobitex’s operational transparency, including possible ties to illicit activity such as money laundering. Gonjeshke Darande, the pro-Israel hacker group that claimed responsibility for the attack, previously accused Nobitex of being Iran’s “favorite sanctions violation tool.” The group also cited this as a key reason for targeting the exchange, claiming it as part of a broader retaliation effort tied to the Israel-Iran conflict.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 867,400 followers on the social media platform X that on the higher time frames, the Bitcoin trend is up and the day-to-day fluctuations in price are just “noise.” According to Pentoshi, the demand for Bitcoin is currently outstripping the new supply of Bitcoin and more demand is likely to come in amid potential currency debasement. “There is factually more BTC being bought on any given day than is being mined. Until that trend changes, try to just relax a bit and enjoy the ride. It increasingly looks like more debasing will occur. And BTC is a hedge against debasement.” Pentoshi, however, warns that there’s danger lurking for Bitcoin from the corporations accumulating the crypto king in their balance sheets. The widely followed analyst says some of these companies will “hurt” Bitcoin in a couple of years when they will be potentially forced to liquidate their BTC holdings to pay the debt they will have incurred for purposes of accumulating the flagship digital asset. “I think many will end up being forced sellers eventually. When some of the notes come due.” Bitcoin is trading at $107,875 at time of writing.

Riot Platforms’ expansion at Corsicana and the Rhodium acquisition may boost power and hash rate, but legal and market risks can potentially persist. The data center hosting market is highly competitive, with hyperscalers like Oracle dominating the market. Riot’s Bitcoin mining profitability may be pressured by rising power costs and Bitcoin price volatility, limiting near-term upside despite strong Bitcoin treasury holdings. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) is in the process of expanding its Corsicana facility from 400MW to 600MW in capacity with the intention of hosting third-party hyperscalers at its data center site. With the ambition of navigating into a new market opportunity, I believe Riot may face certain hurdles in hosted shared space given the current competitive market environment. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Riot Platforms Operations Corporate Reports Riot closed the acquisition of certain assets of Rhodium at the Rockdale Facility in Q1’25. The acquisition included Rhodium’s 125MW of power capacity, as well as its existing operating assets at the facility. The acquisition was valued at $185mm, inclusive of $49mm in Riot common shares. In addition to acquiring the facility, compute capacity, and power capacity, Riot and Rhodium entered into an agreement to conclude all litigation. Prior to the announced acquisition, Rhodium filed a $300mm suit against Riot as a result of Riot’s acquisition of Whinstone and the cancellation of Rhodium’s power supply agreement for 100MW of power. Years prior, in 2023, Riot filed a suit against Rhodium over an alleged $26mm in unpaid fees. Staying on the topic of litigation, investors filed a suit against Rhodium in December 2024, suggesting that Rhodium misled investors by concealing critical information and engaging in self-dealing. The suit also suggests that Rhodium failed to disclose the pending sale of the organization’s operating facilities to Riot, creating conflict over power contracts. Given that Rhodium’s sale was an asset sale as opposed to the company being absorbed by Riot, Riot may be somewhat shielded from the suit. Other legacy suits were filed in Riot’s March 2025 10-Q , bearing no mention of the investor suit. As a result of the acquisition, management is anticipating increased hash rates, reduced operating losses, and gained power capacity for future development. At the end of Q1’25, Riot had 33.7EH/s in capacity, producing a total of 1,530 Bitcoin in the quarter. Riot began purchasing Bitcoin in Q4’24 to bolster its treasury while leveraging its holdings for a collateralized $100mm credit facility through Coinbase . Accordingly, this credit facility will ideally provide Riot with adequate financing to slow the dilution of the float. Riot ended Q1’25 with 19,223 Bitcoin. Using $105k as the base price, Riot’s Bitcoin holdings amount to $2b. TradingView As part of its growth strategy, Riot invested a substantial proportion of its capital outlay for Q1’25 in the development of its 600MW substation expansion at the Corsicana facility in Navarro County, Texas. According to Riot’s website , the facility currently has 400MW in capacity, with the option to expand to 1GW. Using a like-for-like approach, the expansion to 600MW should get the facility to 23.55EH/s in capacity. The data center buildout may also involve sourcing data center tenants, primarily targeting hyperscaler customers. Though data center hosting may be an appealing market for Riot, Riot will be competing with Oracle Corp . ( ORCL ), which develops purpose-built data centers with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as well as engages in a MultiCloud strategy, developing data center sites for hyperscaler customers. The growth factor management mentioned was that the existing GenAI capacity calls for 5GW of capacity with the expectation of growing to 30GW by 2030. Though this may be the case, I suspect a significant proportion of capacity will derive from enterprises rather than consumers, potentially limiting the full, total addressable market to a narrower figure. In addition to this, hyperscalers are investing in developing their data center footprints given the size and scale of compute capacity needed to operate AI models on their infrastructure. Referencing Oracle’s data center developments, OpenAI has partnered with Oracle to develop its first 1.2GW site in Abilene, Texas , and will likely continue working with Oracle for new site developments. What makes Oracle’s data center business stand out above Riot is that Oracle develops modular, autonomously operating data center facilities. Though I have no doubt that Riot will be successful in enticing tenants for its AI/HPC data center site, I believe that the data center hosting business will be fierce, particularly when considering the total cost to operate. The area in which I can see Riot competing is in its engineering and manufacturing business with ESS Metron for critical switchgear. This business could potentially add value to third-party customers in the data center business and may help debottleneck the electrical equipment market. Riot Platforms' Financial Position Corporate Reports One of the biggest costs Riot must address in Bitcoin mining, net of machine depreciation, is the cost of power. In the organization’s FY24 presentation , Riot reported that the cost to mine a single Bitcoin was 96.9% of the value of the coin. Corporate Reports Granted, the price per Bitcoin is substantially higher today when compared to all of FY24; however, power consumption may be a persistent headwind, particularly as electricity prices are set to increase with power demand for growing data centers and industrial footprints. Net of Bitcoin price appreciation, increasing power costs can create significant headwinds for Riot in the coming quarters, particularly as more connected infrastructure is added to the grid. TradingView Looking to eQ2’25, I’m forecasting Riot to generate $152mm in net revenue, with a diluted EPS of -$0.23/share. This is predicated on strong Bitcoin mining growth and sales for the quarter as a result of the high value of Bitcoin quarter-to-date. Risks Related to Riot Platforms Bull Case The price of Bitcoin has created a more appealing operating environment for Riot, potentially leading to the organization delivering positive adjusted EBITDA for eQ2’25. With data center power capacity being widely constrained, the organization may be well-positioned to advantageously take on hosted customers, potentially expanding its brand beyond Bitcoin mining and engineering operations. Bear Case The data center environment is highly competitive, potentially creating certain challenges for Riot to enter the space. The organization has also faced legal challenges relating to contractual power distribution that may deter third-party hyperscaler customers. Bitcoin remains highly volatile and may not sustain its $105k+/- price range, potentially impacting Riot’s revenue stream going forward. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports RIOT currently trades at 1.61x price/BV BTC, assuming a $105k price per Bitcoin. This is relatively comparable to its competitor CleanSpark ( CLSK ), which trades at roughly 1.89x, considering its 12,502 Bitcoin holdings. Despite this factor, investors in RIOT must consider its other operating unit in engineering and its aim to act as a data center host, creating a certain operating complexity when compared to CleanSpark. Valuing RIOT as an organization, I believe shares should be priced at $9.09/share at 5.41x eFY26 price/sales. I am recommending RIOT shares with a hold rating. Corporate Reports Using the model: the valuation table above references my financial forecast in the firm’s “financial position” section and ties it to the stock’s historical trading premiums. The trading premium array is derived through the normal operating cycle, with the blue-sky scenario being the stock’s peak multiple and the gray-sky scenario being the lowest point. The target multiple aims for the midpoint, or the most likely trading range for the company’s stock. The trading multiples from there are set to a probability factor based on the likelihood of the stock trading at that premium based on its historical presence. From there, the trading multiple is tied to the probability factor to derive its relative market cap and relative multiple.",CLSK|RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-26 11:46:51

This is happening due to increased activity within the ecosystem and growing institutional support. For instance, this week, Social media buzz was on fire, with Cardano receiving over 200,000 mentions on X in just one week, largely sparked by the recent Midnight Glacier airdrop . Not just that, another factor changing the sentiment was the recent launch of Coinbase’s cbADA on its Layer 2 network, Base, which adds to the bullish outlook. This wrapped version of ADA could significantly enhance Cardano’s utility across decentralized finance protocols. As ADA continues to trade steadily near $0.57, the timing of this launch could be pivotal in propelling the asset into a new growth cycle. Keep reading to know more. Analyst Projects Cardano Price To Hit $2 As of now, ADA crypto is trading at $0.57, reflecting a 2% decline over the past day and nearly 24% over the last month. The cryptocurrency continues to follow a downward trend, confined within a descending channel. Yet, the Cardano price recently found support at April’s low, coinciding with the lower band of the Bollinger Bands. Interestingly, the Bollinger Bands have begun to narrow, suggesting that ADA price action is attempting to bounce off the lower band. If ADA price gains momentum, especially with the upcoming Midnight airdrop potentially boosting activity, it could test the resistance range of $0.60 to $0.62 towards the Bollinger band’s baseline. Should it break through this level, a move toward $0.70 might be on the horizon in the short term. On the contrary, if ADA crypto fails to sustain its price above $0.55, then the next significant support level lies near $0.52-$0.50. Despite the recent lower lows, some analysts remain optimistic and are projecting ambitious targets. In a recent YouTube video , crypto analyst Dan Gambardello projected a bold target for ADA price. Dan predicts that ADA could replicate its previous bull cycle, and could rally to $2 within weeks or months, contingent on broader market conditions. That said, if the overall market sentiment remains positive and ADA price can overcome key technical barriers, it may be poised for substantial gains in the coming months.

Arthur Hayes Reveals ‘Bull Market Checklist’,https://coinpedia.org/news/when-will-bitcoin-price-hit-new-ath-arthur-hayes-reveals-bull-market-checklist/,"The post When Will Bitcoin Price Hit New ATH? Arthur Hayes Reveals ‘Bull Market Checklist’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin could be heading for new all-time highs, at least if Arthur Hayes has it right. The BitMEX co-founder recently shared a bullish take on the market, pointing to key regulatory changes that he believes are setting the stage for a major crypto rally. From stablecoin reforms to broader shifts in global finance, Hayes sees the pieces falling into place for Bitcoin to surge. Bull market checklist: – UST SLR exemption progressing – Genius Act hands US stablecoin mrkt to banks, next essay will explain y +ve – Ignore the reality, Trump, Bibi, and Kahmenei are all pretending the conflict is finished so investors should too $BTC ATHs are coming — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 26, 2025 SLR Exemption Could Spark a Crypto Liquidity Boost Hayes highlights the U.S. Treasury’s Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption as a major factor. If reinstated, this policy would let banks free up more capital, allowing them to hold stablecoins and crypto-related assets with fewer restrictions. That means more liquidity, stronger support from big institutions, and a smoother path for crypto to integrate with the traditional financial system. For Hayes, it’s a clear sign that markets are preparing for a new bull cycle. The Genius Act: Giving Banks Control of Stablecoins Another big piece of the puzzle is the proposed Genius Act. This legislation could shift control of the U.S. stablecoin market to banks—a move Hayes believes is actually a good thing. Rather than slowing innovation, this could bring legitimacy and stability to stablecoins, making them a trusted part of the financial system. That kind of trust, in turn, can lift confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Hayes: Ignore the Drama, Watch the Market Hayes also pointed out how world leaders, like Trump, Netanyahu, and Iran’s Khamenei, are caught up in political and geopolitical tensions. But he urges investors to look past the headlines and focus on market signals instead. He points to a 22% surge in stablecoin market cap this year, now hitting $251 billion. To Hayes, that’s a strong sign that capital is flowing back into crypto and that investors are positioning for a run. Not His First Rodeo Hayes’s view ties into his past commentary, where he’s connected crypto market trends with global economic policy. He’s written before about the impact of central banks, like the Bank of Japan, on risk assets like Bitcoin. Now, as macro conditions shift and regulators appear more open to crypto, Hayes sees all signs pointing to another breakout moment. Bitcoin’s Setup for a New Rally? With policies like the SLR exemption and the Genius Act bringing crypto and traditional finance closer together, Hayes believes Bitcoin is primed for big gains. Stablecoins may be laying the groundwork—but Bitcoin, he argues, is the real beneficiary. If his call plays out, we could be entering a new phase of adoption, with Bitcoin leading the charge toward another all-time high.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 11:49:19

He stated that anyone holding 1,000 XRP could expect to earn a minimum profit of $50,000 by the end of 2025. At the token’s current price of approximately $2.19, 1,000 units are valued at $2,190. Layton’s claim implies that each token would need to reach at least $52.20 within the year, representing a 2,300% return on investment. Layton encouraged followers to save his post and revisit it in the future, emphasizing that the predicted profit is for 2025 alone. If you hold 1000 XRP in 2025, you will see $50,000 minimum in profit just this year alone. Bookmark this. — Time Traveler (@Traveler2236) June 24, 2025 Reaction from the Community The reaction to Layton’s prediction was mixed, with many expressing cautious optimism or outright skepticism. Some users, while hopeful, acknowledged that the estimate appears unrealistic. A user named Ellian Betan commented that such forecasts tend to overlook real-world limitations. Others questioned the practical implications of such growth. For instance, one user asked whether Layton would delete his account if XRP failed to reach the projected price. Another user, Tobias, observed that while significant profits might be attainable, the return is determined by the token’s future price, not the cost at which it was acquired. Therefore, whether an investor bought XRP at $0.07 or $2.00, the key factor remains the token’s price performance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Capitalization Implications of a $50 XRP If XRP were to exceed $50 per coin, its total market capitalization would surpass $3 trillion. For comparison, this would place XRP above Bitcoin’s current market value, making the target highly ambitious. Despite the boldness of Layton’s claim, he is not the only analyst proposing large price movements for XRP. In March, Elliott Wave analyst XForceGlobal predicted XRP could reach between $20 and $40 either this year or next, based on a 5-wave pattern. Similarly, a market analyst known as Steph suggested that if the global cryptocurrency market grows to $7 trillion and XRP captures a 30% share, the token could climb to $34.20. Other commentators have issued even more aggressive forecasts. Javon Marks, for example, has floated the idea that XRP could approach $99 during this market cycle, though he did not offer a specific timeline. Conservative Estimates Remain Cautious In contrast to these bullish views, some market analysts and platforms have adopted a more cautious stance. Forecasts from Changelly and Telegaon suggest that XRP may not reach the $50 milestone until at least 2035. These projections significantly diverge from Layton’s 2025 outlook, highlighting the divide between short-term optimism and long-term realism. While Layton’s prediction of a $50,000 profit from holding 1,000 XRP has generated considerable attention, it remains a speculative outlook. The wide range of price targets, from $34 to nearly $100, demonstrates the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future valuation.

If so, you’re not alone. A significant shift has just occurred that demands your attention: the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has plummeted to 97.48, marking its lowest point since February 2022. This dramatic movement isn’t just a headline for forex traders; it carries profound implications for the burgeoning crypto market, potentially reshaping investment strategies and the future trajectory of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this substantial DXY decline means for your crypto portfolio and the broader financial landscape. Understanding the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): What Just Happened? The U.S. Dollar Index , often simply referred to as the DXY, is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of six major world currencies. These currencies include the Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Swedish Krona (SEK), and Swiss Franc (CHF). It’s essentially a barometer for the dollar’s strength or weakness against its major trading partners. Recently, the DXY has been on a noticeable downward trajectory. According to MarketWatch data, it has fallen to 97.48, a level not seen since early 2022. This represents a significant 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline . To put this into perspective, consider these key points: Historical Context: The DXY had reached multi-decade highs in late 2022, driven by aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Its current level signifies a considerable reversal from those peaks. Magnitude of the Drop: A 10.1% year-to-date decline is not a minor fluctuation; it indicates a substantial shift in global investor sentiment towards the U.S. dollar. Key Currency Basket: The Euro holds the largest weight in the DXY basket (57.6%), meaning the dollar’s performance against the Euro heavily influences the index’s movement. This weakening of the dollar has ripple effects across various asset classes, and the cryptocurrency market is no exception. Understanding the drivers behind this dollar weakness is crucial for anticipating its future impact. Why the Dollar Weakness is Making Waves: Key Drivers What’s behind this significant dollar weakness ? Several macroeconomic factors are converging to push the DXY lower. The primary drivers include shifts in monetary policy expectations, evolving inflation outlooks, and changes in global economic growth projections. Is the Fed’s Stance Fueling Further Dollar Weakness? A major catalyst for the recent DXY decline is the changing narrative around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. For much of 2022, the Fed was aggressively raising interest rates to combat soaring inflation, making the dollar more attractive to investors seeking higher yields. However, the market is now increasingly pricing in an end to the Fed’s tightening cycle, with expectations of potential rate cuts in the near future. This shift in sentiment reduces the dollar’s yield advantage over other currencies, diminishing its appeal. Interest Rate Differentials: As other central banks (like the European Central Bank or Bank of Japan) potentially catch up or even surpass the Fed in hawkishness, the interest rate differential narrows, reducing the incentive to hold dollars. Inflation Expectations: While inflation remains elevated, there’s a growing belief that it has peaked and is on a downward trend. This lessens the urgency for the Fed to maintain an ultra-tight monetary policy, further contributing to dollar weakness . Economic Slowdown Concerns: Persistent concerns about a potential recession in the U.S. also weigh on the dollar. A weaker economy might necessitate more accommodative monetary policy, which typically leads to a weaker currency. The interplay of these factors creates a challenging environment for the dollar, directly influencing its standing on the global stage and, by extension, its relationship with risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The Profound Crypto Market Impact: A New Era? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, a weakening dollar often signals a potentially bullish environment. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the U.S. Dollar Index and the performance of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. How Does Dollar Weakness Reshape the Bitcoin Price Narrative? When the dollar weakens, assets priced in dollars, such as commodities and cryptocurrencies, can become more attractive. This is because it takes fewer units of other currencies to buy dollars, making dollar-denominated assets relatively cheaper for international investors. More importantly, a weaker dollar can signify a broader flight from traditional fiat currencies into alternative stores of value. Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: The narrative of Bitcoin as “digital gold” or an inflation hedge gains traction during periods of dollar depreciation. As the purchasing power of the dollar diminishes, investors may seek assets with a fixed supply and perceived scarcity, like Bitcoin, to preserve wealth. This can lead to upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar can also lead to more global liquidity, as central banks potentially ease monetary policies. This increased liquidity often flows into riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, boosting overall crypto market impact . Investor Sentiment: The psychological effect of a declining dollar can shift investor sentiment towards assets outside the traditional financial system. This encourages diversification into digital assets, viewing them as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. While the DXY decline doesn’t guarantee an immediate surge in the Bitcoin price or the broader crypto market, it certainly creates a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop. Many analysts are now closely watching how this sustained dollar weakness might catalyze the next phase of growth for digital assets. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Opportunities While the narrative of a weakening dollar benefiting crypto is compelling, it’s crucial to approach the current market with a balanced perspective. The relationship is not always straightforward, and other factors significantly influence the crypto market impact . What Should Crypto Investors Watch Out For Amidst This DXY Decline? The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the U.S. Dollar Index . Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and specific project news all play significant roles. For instance, a sudden regulatory crackdown or a major hack could overshadow any positive influence from a weakening dollar. Challenges to Consider: Correlation vs. Causation: While an inverse correlation often exists, it’s not always a direct causal relationship. Other macro factors, such as global economic growth or geopolitical events, can also drive both DXY and crypto movements. Regulatory Headwinds: Increased scrutiny from global regulators could dampen enthusiasm, regardless of the dollar’s performance. Market Liquidity: While a weaker dollar can imply more liquidity, a sudden tightening by other central banks or a global financial shock could still impact crypto negatively. “Risk-On” vs. “Risk-Off” Sentiment: Sometimes, the dollar weakens because investors are taking on more risk globally (risk-on), which can benefit crypto. Other times, it might be due to specific U.S. economic concerns that don’t necessarily translate to immediate crypto gains. Despite these challenges, the current environment presents opportunities. The ongoing DXY decline , combined with increasing institutional interest and technological advancements within the crypto space, could set the stage for significant long-term growth. Investors who understand these dynamics are better positioned to capitalize on potential shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Understanding the intricate relationship between the U.S. Dollar Index and the crypto market can empower you to make more informed investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Macroeconomic Indicators: Keep a close eye on the DXY, inflation reports, and Federal Reserve announcements. These traditional financial indicators provide valuable context for anticipating crypto market movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin often leads the charge, consider a diversified crypto portfolio that includes established altcoins and promising new projects. This can help mitigate risk and capture broader market gains. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the volatility, consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of market fluctuations, can be a prudent strategy. This helps average out your purchase price and reduces the impact of short-term swings. Stay Informed on Regulatory News: Regulatory clarity (or lack thereof) can significantly impact crypto prices. Keep abreast of developments in major jurisdictions. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term DXY movements can create trading opportunities, the long-term success of cryptocurrencies depends on their underlying technology, adoption, and utility. The current period of dollar weakness is not just a fleeting trend; it reflects deeper shifts in global finance. For those invested in or considering the crypto space, this moment offers a unique lens through which to view potential future growth and strategic positioning. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Digital Assets The dramatic drop in the U.S. Dollar Index to its lowest point since February 2022 signals a significant turning point in global finance. This 10.1% year-to-date DXY decline , driven by evolving monetary policies and shifting economic outlooks, directly impacts the perceived value and attractiveness of the dollar. For the cryptocurrency market, this period of sustained dollar weakness presents a compelling narrative, potentially bolstering the case for assets like Bitcoin as alternative stores of value. While the inverse correlation between the DXY and Bitcoin price is not absolute, the current macroeconomic environment certainly offers a more favorable backdrop for digital assets. As we navigate these dynamic shifts, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be key to unlocking the opportunities that this unprecedented financial recalibration presents for the future of money.

IRS Letters Signal Start of 1099-DA Enforcement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued a new wave of warning letters to crypto investors, signaling a crackdown ahead of the upcoming 1099-DA regulation, which is set to take effect in 2026. This aggressive move has sparked anxiety across the crypto community, especially as many investors face confusion over reporting requirements. Crypto Tax Anxiety Surges After IRS Letters According to David Kemmerer , Co-founder and CEO of CoinLedger, crypto investors across the U.S. have received various types of IRS letters urging them to review and update their crypto tax filings. If left unaddressed, these warnings could lead to serious investigations. “We’re seeing a wave of confusion and fear among everyday crypto investors, many of whom made their best effort to report taxes accurately,” Kemmerer explained. Why Is the IRS Sending Crypto Warning Letters? The IRS is stepping up its visibility into digital asset transactions as the U.S. continues its push for financial transparency in the crypto space. This includes matching reported income with blockchain data, third-party records, and new forms like the 1099-DA. Kemmerer emphasized the urgency of proactive compliance: “With Form 1099-DA on the horizon, this kind of enforcement is only going to accelerate. The IRS has more visibility into crypto than ever before, but without accurate cost basis data, even compliant investors can get mistakenly flagged.” [post_titles_links postid=”475048″] Types of IRS Warning Letters Sent to Crypto Investors Here are the key letters crypto investors are receiving: Letter 6174 : A reminder that investors must report taxable crypto activity and update previous filings. Letter 6173 : A more serious notice demanding a response by a set deadline and requiring investors to file missing tax returns involving crypto. Letter CP2000 : Indicates that the IRS has already calculated underreported income or tax owed. Investors are given 30 days to respond. Form 1099-DA: What’s Coming in 2026? Starting in 2026, all crypto trades conducted in 2025 through digital asset brokers will be reported directly to the IRS using Form 1099-DA. This marks a major shift in how the IRS collects crypto tax data—and it will likely trigger widespread audits and possible criminal investigations for non-compliant taxpayers. Kemmerer warns: “If crypto investors fail to report their taxes accurately, especially after the rollout of 1099-DA, they could receive a CP2000 letter or face severe action.” Final Word: A Crucial Grace Period for Crypto Users The current wave of warning letters serves as a wake-up call for investors. This is a grace period —a final opportunity to get crypto tax filings in order before the IRS enforces stricter penalties. Investors are urged to: Organize transaction history Track cost basis and taxable events File or amend returns proactively Avoiding action now could lead to audit risks , fines, or worse once 1099-DA becomes mandatory.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

As Bitcoin trades above $107K, new data suggest that the leading crypto asset is approaching a critical juncture as on-chain and macroeconomic signals converge. Market Fundamentals Warn of Possible Correction On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, which happens to be an indicator of buying and selling pressure, exceeded $100 million for the first time since June 9. While this spike may suggest increased bullish momentum, CryptoQuant stated that such surges often stem from aggressive retail participation or the liquidation of over-leveraged short positions rather than sustainable investor demand. At the same time, the total stablecoin net outflows from derivative exchanges have topped $1.25 billion, the largest exodus since mid-May. This trend points to weakening structural support for long positions and reflects a broader withdrawal of capital from risk-on environments. Interestingly, the latest market movement coincided with growing speculation about a shift in US monetary policy. During his semiannual testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted that future commercial and economic conditions could warrant interest rate cuts. The statement is a significant change in tone from the central bank, which indicates a possible pivot toward monetary easing. Further validating this narrative, the US 2-year Treasury yield has entered a clear downtrend, a pattern typically interpreted as the market pricing in future rate cuts. Investors are increasingly seeking safety in short-duration government bonds, which evidences rising caution. Elsewhere in the global currency markets, the Swiss Franc surged past 1.24 against the US dollar for the first time in several years, which, again, depicts an increased demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Together, these indicators suggest a rising risk-off sentiment in financial markets. While the Net Taker Volume spike may fuel short-term volatility, the significant outflow of stablecoins from derivative platforms raises concerns about the ability of Bitcoin’s price to sustain upward momentum. With macro uncertainty intensifying and liquidity thinning, the market could be nearing a near-term correction. Binance Open Interest Spikes; Long-Term Holders Trim Exposure As volatility returns and structural support wanes, Bitcoin’s internal market indicators are flashing additional cautionary signals worth close attention. In fact, data from Binance shows the 24-hour Open Interest (OI) percentage change has exceeded 6% for the third time in two months. Previous surges, observed around May 26 and June 10, were followed by price dips or periods of consolidation. This recurring trend could mean that increased inflows into leveraged positions may precede short-term profit-taking and de-risking by market participants. Additionally, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap has sharply declined from over $57 billion to just $3.5 billion. This significant drop indicates that long-term holders are reducing exposure and are likely capitalizing on recent price gains and reacting to evolving macroeconomic conditions. While these developments do not necessarily point to an immediate bearish reversal, CryptoQuant said that it does highlight a rising market sensitivity. As such, the market may be entering a profit-taking phase, where short-term pullbacks or sideways movement are more likely as speculative interest builds and long-term conviction wanes.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-supply-shock-or-12-4-billion-outflows-glitch-you-need-to-see-this/,"A wave of excitement recently swept through the XRP community following reports that $12.4 billion worth of XRP had suddenly disappeared from major crypto exchanges like Binance and Upbit. The supposed “supply shock” led to a flurry of bullish predictions, with many expecting a dramatic price rally. But the facts tell a different story, one rooted not in real liquidity shifts but in likely data errors. The Origin of the $12.4B Shock Claim The speculation began when blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged what appeared to be massive XRP outflows from centralized exchanges. The data showed a sharp decline in XRP reserves, suggesting billions of tokens had been withdrawn in a short period. This triggered widespread speculation that large investors were accumulating XRP and moving funds to private wallets, a scenario often seen as bullish because it reduces the circulating supply on exchanges. XRP “Supply Shock” Outflows? Not so fast. Reports claimed $12.4B in XRP vanished from exchanges like Upbit & Binance—sparking major bullish speculation. But on-chain data tells a different story: No massive withdrawals recorded Likely a data glitch or mislabeling by… — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) June 26, 2025 However, Jungle Inc Crypto News, a well-known voice in the XRP community, quickly pushed back on the claims. In a post on X, he stated: “Reports claimed $12.4B in XRP vanished from exchanges like Upbit & Binance, sparking major bullish speculation. But on-chain data tells a different story: No massive withdrawals recorded… likely a data glitch or mislabeling by analytics platforms like CryptoQuant.” On-Chain Reality Paints a Different Picture Cross-referencing on-chain data from tools like XRPScan and Ledger. Exposed reveals no matching transactions to support such a large-scale exodus of XRP. The blockchain shows no significant withdrawals from the wallets tied to Upbit or Binance. Upbit wallets still hold close to 6 billion XRP, indicating no real change in holdings. This strongly suggests that the alarm over a $12.4 billion supply shock is the result of a reporting error, likely due to mislabeling of wallets or syncing issues on the part of the analytics provider. A Familiar Pattern of Data Glitches This isn’t the first time blockchain analytics platforms have reported questionable data. Similar incidents in the past, across various assets, have been traced back to incorrect wallet tagging, API delays, or temporary syncing problems. While these tools are invaluable, they’re not infallible, and raw blockchain data remains the ultimate source of truth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Verification Matters A genuine supply shock where a significant amount of XRP leaves exchanges could indicate long-term holding by whales or institutions, potentially triggering price increases due to reduced market liquidity. But acting on inaccurate data can lead to poor decisions, especially in a market as fast-moving and sentiment-driven as crypto. Jungle Inc.’s warning serves as a crucial reminder to investors: always verify data using the XRP Ledger before jumping to conclusions. Hype without confirmation can be costly. The reports of a $12.4 billion XRP outflow are not supported by any on-chain evidence. All indications point to a data glitch or misinterpretation, not a real supply shock.

Recently, SharpLink Gaming , a Nasdaq-listed technology firm, has once again made headlines with a substantial ETH acquisition , adding nearly 6,000 Ethereum to its already impressive portfolio. This latest move, valued at $14.47 million, signals a continued conviction in the second-largest cryptocurrency, even as the company faces an unrealized loss on its overall Ethereum investment . Unpacking SharpLink Gaming’s Latest ETH Acquisition: What Does It Mean? The digital asset space is constantly evolving, and institutional interest remains a powerful indicator of maturity and long-term potential. According to on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X, SharpLink Gaming has bolstered its Ethereum reserves by an additional 5,989 ETH, facilitated through Galaxy Digital, amounting to a significant $14.47 million injection into the crypto market. This isn’t their first foray; the company has been steadily accumulating Ethereum, bringing their total holdings to an impressive 194,000 ETH. This massive accumulation represents a total expenditure of $507 million, with an average acquisition price of $2,611 per ETH. Such a consistent strategy from a publicly traded company highlights a strategic decision to allocate a substantial portion of its treasury to digital assets. It raises several questions: What drives this sustained conviction in Ethereum? How do companies manage the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency? What are the long-term implications for their balance sheet? Understanding the Unrealized Loss : A Common Investor Hurdle? While SharpLink Gaming’s total Ethereum holdings are substantial, the current market dynamics mean the company is navigating an unrealized loss of approximately $36 million. But what exactly does ‘unrealized loss’ signify in the context of large-scale investments? An unrealized loss occurs when an asset’s current market value is lower than its purchase price, but the asset has not yet been sold. It’s a paper loss, not a realized one, meaning it only becomes concrete if the asset is sold at that lower price. For institutional investors like SharpLink Gaming, who often operate with long-term horizons, an unrealized loss might not be an immediate concern but rather a temporary fluctuation in market value. It reflects: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their rapid price swings. Long-Term Strategy: Many institutional players invest with the expectation of future growth, looking past short-term dips. Treasury Management: Companies might view these assets as a strategic reserve or a hedge against inflation, rather than a short-term trading position. This situation isn’t unique to SharpLink Gaming; many companies and individuals who invested during bull markets have faced similar unrealized losses. The key lies in their conviction and the strategic intent behind the investment. Why the Continued ETH Acquisition ? The Institutional Perspective Despite facing an unrealized loss, SharpLink Gaming’s continued ETH acquisition strategy suggests a strong belief in Ethereum’s fundamental value and future potential. Why would a Nasdaq-listed tech firm continue to pour millions into a volatile asset like Ethereum? Several factors likely play into this calculated risk: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Dominance: Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its network effect is unparalleled in the smart contract space. Deflationary Mechanism (EIP-1559): The implementation of EIP-1559, which burns a portion of transaction fees, has introduced a deflationary aspect to ETH, potentially increasing its scarcity over time. Scalability and Upgrade Path (Ethereum 2.0/Serenity): The transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge, Shanghai, Cancun-Deneb upgrades) aims to make Ethereum more scalable, secure, and energy-efficient, addressing some of its past limitations and paving the way for wider enterprise adoption. Institutional Interest and Adoption: Beyond SharpLink, other major players are exploring or holding Ethereum, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. This validates ETH as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. Diversification and Inflation Hedge: For some companies, holding crypto assets like ETH can be a way to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional fiat currencies and potentially hedge against inflation. These reasons collectively paint a picture of a sophisticated investment strategy, focusing on the long-term growth trajectory of the Ethereum network rather than short-term price movements. The Broader Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption SharpLink Gaming’s significant Ethereum investment is not an isolated incident but rather part of a growing trend of institutional crypto adoption. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a paradigm shift, with more corporations, hedge funds, and traditional financial institutions entering the digital asset space. This trend is driven by several factors: Maturing Infrastructure: The emergence of regulated custodians, prime brokers, and institutional-grade trading platforms (like Galaxy Digital, used by SharpLink) has made it safer and easier for large entities to engage with crypto. Regulatory Clarity (Evolving): While still a work in progress, increasing discussions and frameworks around crypto regulation are providing more confidence for institutions. Performance Potential: Despite volatility, the long-term returns of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have outperformed many traditional asset classes, attracting capital looking for growth. Technological Innovation: Institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized networks across various industries, from finance to supply chain. This institutional influx brings significant capital, liquidity, and legitimacy to the crypto market, paving the way for broader mainstream integration. Companies are increasingly viewing digital assets not just as speculative plays, but as strategic components of their balance sheets and future business models. Navigating the Nuances of Ethereum Investment for Corporations For a company like SharpLink Gaming , an Ethereum investment involves more than just buying ETH. It requires a comprehensive strategy that addresses risk management, accounting, and compliance. Here are some key considerations: Risk Management: Developing robust strategies to mitigate volatility, including potential hedging or dollar-cost averaging approaches. Custody Solutions: Utilizing secure, institutional-grade custodians to protect large holdings from hacks or loss. Galaxy Digital’s involvement here is a testament to this. Accounting and Reporting: Navigating the complexities of accounting for digital assets on balance sheets, which can vary by jurisdiction. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving regulations in different markets to ensure adherence and avoid penalties. Market Analysis: Continuous monitoring of market trends, technological developments (like Ethereum upgrades), and macroeconomic factors that could impact the value of their holdings. SharpLink Gaming’s repeated purchases suggest they have a well-defined strategy and a team capable of managing these complexities. Their approach could serve as a case study for other companies considering similar moves into the digital asset space. Conclusion: A Long-Term Vision Amidst Volatility SharpLink Gaming’s continued substantial ETH acquisition , even in the face of an unrealized loss , underscores a profound long-term conviction in Ethereum’s potential. This strategic move by a Nasdaq-listed firm is a powerful indicator of the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption, signaling a maturation of the digital asset market. While short-term price fluctuations are inherent to this nascent asset class, companies like SharpLink appear to be looking beyond the immediate horizon, focusing on the foundational strength and future growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. Their bold Ethereum investment highlights a belief that despite temporary dips, the long-term trajectory for decentralized technologies remains upward.

According to the latest data , the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP has hit an all-time high of 2,850, a record in XRP’s 12-year history. Wallets with 10,000+ XRP have surged too, up 6.2% year-to-date, now totaling around 306,000 wallets. The strong accumulation among whales shows growing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. Some have also pointed to a recent drop in XRP exchange reserves as a bullish sign. But experts like Dom caution that on-chain data can be misleading, as tokens moved off exchanges are not always newly purchased, and wallets are often misclassified. Over $915M in XRP Bought in Just One Week In the past week, XRP whales have bought over 420 million tokens, worth more than $915 million, which shows strong confidence in XRP’s recovery. But while big investors are buying, the number of new XRP wallets has dropped to a two-month low. Fewer users are entering the market, which shows hesitation despite the whale activity. XRP Surged 6% on Heavy Volume XRP recently saw a 6% surge, climbing from $2.19 to $2.23 before settling around $2.20. The rally was driven by a huge spike in trading volume, over 108 million XRP in one hour, nearly four times the usual. Whales made big moves during the rally. One transfer sent $58 million to Coinbase, and Ripple moved $439 million to an unknown wallet. But XRP held strong with strong buying support. Retail Interest Is Picking Up Retail interest in XRP is rising fast as Google searches for “XRP to $3” are climbing, and many traders expect a breakout between July and September.

At the moment, BTC is trading around $107,300, the cryptocurrency is up nearly 10% in just three days, driven by a combination of short liquidation, technical breakouts, and easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Traders widely anticipated the move past $108K. The level represented a significant liquidity zone, and its breach forced aggressive short positions to unwind. BTC 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass Data from CoinGlass confirms that this rally absorbed much of the high-leverage short interest built around recent price consolidation, effectively clearing the path for a potential breakout toward higher resistance levels. Popular analysts, such as Matthew Hyland , describe the current environment as “bulls in control,” while others, like the Titan of Crypto, highlight a recent breakout above the Ichimoku Cloud, signaling further upside potential. #BTC past $106.5k $109k next Bulls are in control https://t.co/mp3zBsQwX9 pic.twitter.com/Ibsaupn3YE — Matthew Hyland (@MatthewHyland_) June 25, 2025 Technical models now indicate $110,448 and $111,944 as potential upside targets, provided BTC can maintain its traction above $108,251. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Setup Signals Possible Acceleration From a charting perspective, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bullish after BTC recently formed a three-bar bullish pattern, similar to a modified “three white soldiers” setup, indicating strong buyer commitment. However, price action is stalling just below a long-standing descending trendline, suggesting that $108,251 remains a critical inflection point. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Support levels: $106,237 (Fib 0.236), $105,081 (50-EMA), and $103,984 (Fib 0.5) Resistance targets: $110,448 and $111,944 MACD status: Bullish crossover, but histogram momentum flattening Candlestick signal: Spinning top forming under trendline, indicating potential hesitation If BTC closes above $108,251 with high volume, we could see a quick move to $111K. If not, we could see a short-term pullback to $105,000-$103,900. Macro Outlook: Russia is Back in Focus Middle East tensions have eased, but geopolitical risk remains. Market sentiment has shifted back to Eastern Europe as tensions between NATO and Russia escalate. According to QCP Capital, the risk premium on global assets is evolving from a short-term hedge to a long-term assumption. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced a slight bounce, a temporary calm, but macroeconomic uncertainty remains a headwind. For BTC, any increase in global volatility, especially from traditional markets, could bring in safe-haven flows into crypto assets. However, BTC’s structure remains bullish. With on-chain data indicating lower realized profits and technical indicators suggesting a continuation, the path to new all-time highs remains open if $ 108,000 holds. Conclusion: BTC is at a crossroads. A close above $108,251 could signal a quick move to $111K and beyond. If not, we could see a pullback to key support zones. Traders are watching – this level will define the next move.

Bitcoin dominance is approaching historical peak levels, which is often a sign of an upcoming shift in favor of altcoins. The Altcoin Season Index has also hit its lowest in two years, indicating that altcoins may be due for a breakout. If the market starts to turn around, small AI-focused altcoins could rally hard, similar to the surge seen in April during the tariff-related uncertainty. Here are some promising AI tokens to watch for the next altcoin season. GRIFFAIN An AI Agent on Solana, Griffain rose from a $30 million to $130 million market cap in May, delivering a 6x return in a short period. Although it has cooled off since then, if the AI hype returns, it could be a strong contender again. It is currently trading at $0.03956, down 7.2% in the past day. June looks bearish for the token, and it could trade between $ 0.028372 and $ 0.040441. In July, the outlook improves, and prices may rise to an average of $0.0318. TARS AI This is another Solana-based AI agent marketplace that surged from $0.025 to $0.14 in April, which is a 6–7x increase. TARS offers a unified platform where users and businesses can access AI tools and services, helping them smoothly move from Web2 to the Web3 world. With a market cap of over $50 million, the token may see renewed interest if broader sentiment improves. It is currently trading at $0.08612, down over 3% in the past day. RAI (Reploy) This token climbed from $0.24 to $1.50 in May, but its recent inactivity on social platforms has raised concerns. Investors should approach with caution and monitor for project updates. It is currently priced at $0.6183, down 4.6% in the past day. AIOZ Network This token doubled from around $0.22 to $0.50 in May. It is not as volatile as others, but is still showing potential. It is currently trading at $0.3171, down 1.5% in the past day. Its 24-hour trading volume is $10,513,924, representing a 6.40% increase. Render (RNDR) Render is a more established AI coin with a large market cap of around $1.7B. It went from $3.30 to $5 in May, and recently bounced again from $2.60 to $3.25. This is one of the go-to options for retail investors interested in AI and GPUs. It is currently trading at $3.08, down 4.8%. In June 2025, Render is expected to trade around $3.94, with a potential range between $3.07 and $4.35. The outlook remains positive for July, and it could range from $3.81 to $4.13. Creator Bid Since April, the token rose from $0.035 to $0.12. Although it is less volatile than others, it continues to show upward movement. It is currently trading at $0.1195, up 6%. In July, Creator Bid could see its prices ranging between $0.0788 and $0.0864, and an average of around $0.0834. Virtuals Protocol Virtuals is also an AI agent ecosystem that jumped from $0.45 to $2.50 between April and May. The team remains active with ongoing developments and product launches. It is currently trading at $1.45, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. June may be rough for Virtual Protocol, with prices expected to dip to around $1.21. However, July brings a more optimistic outlook. Many of these coins are still trading close to their recent lows and well below their previous highs, which could present early opportunities. Even though the market is uncertain, the AI trend could regain strong momentum.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|AIOZ,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 12:03:25

This article explores essential cryptocurrencies poised to capitalize on the next rebound. Delving into these top picks, readers will discover which coins are set to deliver strong returns, positioning portfolios for success. Kaspa Price Analysis: Recent Decline and Key Levels Kaspa saw a significant pullback over the past month and six months. Prices were recorded within a range from $0.065 to $0.116, with a one-month drop of nearly 29% and a six-month decline of approximately 34%. The coin experienced a short-term recovery, with a modest weekly gain of about 6%, but over the longer term, prices have trended downward. These movements indicate that the token has struggled with persistent negative pressure and investor caution. Price softness over the half-year signals lower buying strength while volatility remains evident. Currently, Kaspa trades between a nearest support at $0.047 and a key resistance at $0.15, with a second resistance looming around $0.201. The technical indicators reflect a mixed scene: the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.015 and the momentum indicator hovers just above zero, while the RSI at 44.56 hints at mild bearish bias. Bulls and bears continue to contest these levels, though the current clear trading range leaves little evidence of a dominant trend. Trading within the established zone offers opportunities; a bounce near $0.047 could invite short-term buys, whereas a sustained move above $0.15 might spark renewed bullish interest. Caution remains advisable as resistance near $0.201 may cap upward movement and prolong the market’s overall indecision. Ondo: A Rocky Journey with Support Levels and Bearish Momentum Ondo has experienced notable swings over recent months, with a one-month decline of nearly 18% and an over 46% drop over the past six months. The coin's price has fluctuated within a trading range of about $0.70 to just over $1.00, showing volatility and susceptibility to sharp downturns. A brief weekly increase of 5% indicates short-term recovery efforts amid prolonged weakness, marking a period of uneven momentum and uncertainty. At present, Ondo is trading within the defined range of $0.70 to $1.05, anchored by a clear support level at $0.57 and facing initial resistance at $1.27. A secondary support is visible at $0.21, while an additional resistance looms at $1.62. The current technical indicators show that bears still exert a degree of influence. Price movement appears indecisive with no clear prevailing trend, leaving traders to weigh short-term opportunities against lingering risks. An approach may involve aiming for a potential bounce at the support level of $0.57 and testing further resistance around $1.27, while remaining cautious of false breakout signals. Injective (INJ) Market Shifts and Key Price Levels Signal Trading Opportunities Injective recorded a one-week gain of 4.31% but faced a one-month decline of nearly 13% and a six-month drop of 46%. The historical price movement indicates a pattern of brief recoveries followed by prolonged downtrends, highlighting market volatility. The coin's performance fluctuates between short-term upticks and long-term challenges, exposing it to external pressures and inconsistent trading conditions. Currently, Injective is trading between $8.82 and $15.47, with immediate resistance at $18.81 and support near $5.50. A secondary resistance level is set at $25.47 if buyers become active. The market shows bearish tendencies, evidenced by a summary recommendation of -0.34 and an Awesome Oscillator reading of -1.65, indicating that bears dominate the market. The lack of a clear trend suggests traders consider buying on dips and exiting near resistance levels while monitoring market volatility closely. Conclusion KAS , ONDO , and INJ each show strong potential in the market. Their unique features and growth prospects make them worthy additions to any portfolio. KAS is noted for its rapid transaction capabilities. ONDO stands out for its innovative financial solutions. INJ offers exciting possibilities in the realm of decentralized finance. Including these coins could enhance portfolio performance in the upcoming market rebound. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric tracked by CoinMarketCap, indicates a strong move into what’s known as Bitcoin Season . At a modest 18 as of June 26, this index score is a clear signal for investors to re-evaluate their strategies in the dynamic crypto market . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a proprietary metric developed by CoinMarketCap (CMC) to provide a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency market’s health and sentiment. It serves as a compass, guiding investors through the often-turbulent waters of digital assets. Unlike simple market capitalization comparisons, this index delves deeper, analyzing the relative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. The methodology behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet insightful. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The core principle is simple: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during the specified 90-day period. This signifies a broad rally across the altcoin spectrum, often driven by speculative interest, technological advancements, or a general ‘risk-on’ sentiment in the crypto market . Bitcoin Season: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in Bitcoin Season . This suggests that capital is primarily flowing into Bitcoin, or that altcoins are struggling to maintain their value relative to the leading cryptocurrency. The current index reading of 18 clearly places us in this latter category. The index score itself ranges from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a stronger lean towards altcoin dominance and lower numbers signaling Bitcoin’s ascendancy. A score of 18, as reported, is a definitive indicator of Bitcoin’s current reign. Decoding Bitcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 isn’t just a number; it’s a declaration that we are firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor, and why does Bitcoin often take the lead in the broader crypto market ? Bitcoin Season signifies a period where Bitcoin (BTC) not only outperforms most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) but also often dictates the overall market sentiment. During such times, capital tends to flow primarily into BTC, either from fiat currencies or from altcoins, as investors seek relative safety or anticipate Bitcoin-specific rallies. Several factors contribute to the onset and persistence of Bitcoin Season : Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or broader economic downturns, investors often view Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or a safer haven compared to the more volatile and less established altcoins. Its larger market cap and longer track record make it a more trusted asset. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events, known as halvings, historically precede significant bull runs. The anticipation leading up to and immediately following a halving often draws immense attention and capital into BTC, temporarily overshadowing altcoin performance. Institutional Interest: With the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, large capital inflows from these entities tend to concentrate on BTC due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity compared to the vast array of altcoins. Dominance Cycle: The cryptocurrency market often moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin accumulation and price appreciation are frequently followed by an ‘altcoin catch-up’ phase. The current Bitcoin Season could be seen as part of this natural market ebb and flow. Market Consolidation: After periods of rapid altcoin growth, the market may consolidate, with capital rotating back into Bitcoin as profits are taken or as investors seek more stable ground before the next speculative wave. Impact on Altcoin Performance: What Investors Need to Know For those holding a diverse portfolio of digital assets, the shift to Bitcoin Season directly impacts altcoin performance . When Bitcoin takes center stage, altcoins typically struggle to keep pace, often seeing their value decrease relative to BTC, even if their fiat value remains somewhat stable or sees minor gains. Key observations regarding altcoin performance during Bitcoin Season include: Underperformance Against BTC: Even if an altcoin sees a modest price increase in USD terms, it’s likely losing value when measured against Bitcoin. This means your portfolio’s Bitcoin weighting naturally increases if you hold both, simply because BTC is outperforming. Reduced Liquidity: Capital tends to consolidate in Bitcoin, leading to thinner trading volumes for many altcoins. This can result in larger price swings on smaller trades and makes it harder to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. Narrative Shift: The market narrative during Bitcoin Season often revolves around Bitcoin’s price movements, adoption, and upcoming events. Altcoin-specific news or developments may get less attention, hindering their individual price action. Psychological Impact: Seeing your altcoin holdings lag behind Bitcoin can be frustrating. It tests investor conviction and often leads to premature selling or ‘altcoin fatigue’. While some strong fundamental altcoins might still show resilience or even modest gains, the broad trend for altcoin performance during this period is one of relative weakness against Bitcoin. Navigating Current Cryptocurrency Trends: Strategies for Success Understanding the prevailing cryptocurrency trends , especially the current Bitcoin Season , is paramount for informed decision-making. Rather than panic, investors can adopt strategic approaches to navigate these market conditions effectively. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Assess your current exposure to Bitcoin versus altcoins. During Bitcoin Season , it might be prudent to increase your BTC weighting, or at least ensure your altcoin positions are in projects with strong fundamentals that you believe will survive and thrive long-term. Focus on Research: This period offers an excellent opportunity to deep-dive into projects. Identify altcoins that have genuine utility, strong development teams, active communities, and clear roadmaps. These are the ones most likely to recover and outperform when altcoin season eventually returns. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider implementing a DCA strategy. Regularly investing a fixed amount into Bitcoin or select altcoins can average out your purchase price over time, reducing the risk of buying at peaks. Risk Management is Key: Set clear stop-loss orders or establish profit-taking targets, especially for more speculative altcoin holdings. Volatility can be extreme, and protecting your capital should be a priority. Patience and Long-Term Vision: Market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. A Bitcoin Season is often followed by an Altcoin Season . Those with a long-term perspective and the patience to hold through quieter periods are often the ones who reap the greatest rewards. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s dominance chart. A rising dominance suggests capital is flowing into BTC, while a declining dominance could signal the beginning of a shift back towards altcoins. Challenges and Opportunities in a Bitcoin-Led Market While the current cryptocurrency trends lean heavily towards Bitcoin dominance, this period presents both distinct challenges and unique opportunities for savvy investors. Challenges: Underperforming Altcoins: The primary challenge is the potential for significant underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, leading to ‘opportunity cost’ if your capital is tied up in lagging assets. Increased Volatility: While Bitcoin might be seen as ‘safer,’ the overall crypto market remains highly volatile. Altcoins can experience sharper drops during downturns. Psychological Strain: Watching your portfolio stagnate or decline while Bitcoin soars can be emotionally taxing, leading to impulsive decisions. Opportunities: Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, Bitcoin Season can be an excellent time to accumulate high-conviction altcoins at discounted prices against Bitcoin. This allows for a stronger position when the tide eventually turns. Learning and Research: With less frenetic price action in altcoins, this period provides an ideal environment to educate yourself, research new projects, and refine your investment thesis without the pressure of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Focus on Fundamentals: The ‘noise’ of speculative altcoin pumps often quiets down, allowing fundamental analysis to come to the forefront. Projects with real utility and strong development continue to build, regardless of the immediate market sentiment. Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe in the cyclical nature of the market, increasing your Bitcoin exposure during Bitcoin Season can position you well for potential future gains as BTC solidifies its position or makes new all-time highs. When Will the Altcoin Season Index Signal a Change? The burning question for many is: when will the Altcoin Season Index signal a return to more favorable conditions for altcoin performance ? While no one can predict the future with certainty, historical patterns and prevailing cryptocurrency trends offer some clues. A shift back towards Altcoin Season typically requires one or a combination of the following catalysts: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Often, after a significant Bitcoin rally, BTC enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Major Altcoin-Specific Developments: Significant upgrades (like Ethereum’s upcoming advancements), successful mainnet launches, or major adoption news for prominent altcoins can trigger individual or sector-wide rallies, pulling the index higher. Broader Market Bull Run: A general ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global financial markets, coupled with increasing institutional and retail interest in crypto, can lift all boats, including altcoins. Declining Bitcoin Dominance: Monitoring the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) is crucial. A sustained downtrend in BTC.D, particularly when Bitcoin’s price is stable or rising modestly, often precedes or accompanies an Altcoin Season. The Altcoin Season Index serves as a lagging indicator to some extent, confirming trends rather than predicting them. Therefore, continuous monitoring of market sentiment, technological developments, and macro-economic factors is essential to anticipate when the scales might tip back in favor of altcoins. The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 18 is a clear testament to the ongoing Bitcoin Season . This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a crucial piece of information for navigating the complex crypto market . Understanding these cyclical shifts, from Bitcoin Season to eventual Altcoin Season , empowers investors to make more informed decisions regarding their altcoin performance and overall portfolio strategy. By focusing on strong fundamentals, practicing diligent risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can transform periods of Bitcoin dominance into opportunities for strategic accumulation and growth. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and staying abreast of key cryptocurrency trends like the Altcoin Season Index is vital for long-term success.

The contract is build on the Aztec network, combining zero-knowledge proofs and compliance. According to a press release sent to crypto.news, what sets the token apart from the mainstream legacy stablecoins is its private contract which encrypts all balances and transfers. Apart from the user, the smart contract only allows authorized parties like issuers and regulators. The feature prevents third parties from monitoring crypto wallets , reverse-engineering investment strategies, or physically targeting users for their high-valued holdings. Private stablecoin contracts enable financial institutions to issue stablecoins for payment and treasury applications while also ensuring security and compliance. Chief Security Officer at Taurus , JP Aumasson said that the launch of private contracts mark a major step in advancing security and anonymity for stablecoins. The token feature is able to address long-held concerns from banks and regulators looking to issue stablecoins. “We showed that it’s possible to protect the privacy and security of stablecoin users while retaining the features of industry-standard stablecoins,” said Aumasson.

Audit Report Incoming Speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn on Wednesday, co-founder Zak Folkman confirmed that the project has received its first attestation report from a third-party accounting firm. He stated that the report would be made public on the company’s website “within the next few days,” marking a step toward increasing transparency. Folkman also hinted at upcoming changes to WLFI, which currently grants holders governance rights but cannot be traded or transferred. While withholding details, he said that the next few weeks would likely bring welcome news to the WLFI community. On social media platform X, World Liberty Financial acknowledged growing user demand for WLFI transferability, posting, “You asked to make $WLFI transferable — we heard you,” and teasing “big news coming soon.” Mixed Reactions, Major WLFI Backers The response from the crypto community has been mixed. Some users expressed excitement at the prospect of finally being able to trade WLFI tokens, while skeptics questioned the motives behind the move. One user on X speculated it was a setup for insiders to liquidate their holdings, while another warned that retail investors might be left “holding the bag.” Despite the criticism, World Liberty Financial continues to draw high-profile support. Since its launch in September 2024, the project has raised $550 million through two public token offerings. It positions itself as a DeFi platform centered on stablecoins, aiming to disrupt traditional financial systems. According to his 2025 financial disclosure, Donald Trump earned $57.4 million from the project , largely from token sales. He currently holds more than 15 billion WLFI tokens, giving him significant governance power. Notable crypto figures have backed the venture, including Tron’s Justin Sun with a $30 million investment, Web3Port with $10 million, and Oddiyana Ventures joining in early 2025.

According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain, they have already sold more than 8% of the total MELANIA supply. The #Melania meme team sold 82.18M $MELANIA(8.22% of total supply) over the past 4 months across 44 wallets, cashing out 244,934 $SOL ($35.76M). Most of the $MELANIA tokens were sold through adding and removing liquidity. https://t.co/EJYWtbB5aE pic.twitter.com/gtmRdkNq1y — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 25, 2025 The post indicates that the team has cashed out over $35 million in MELANIA over the past four months from 44 wallets related to them. Within this timeframe, the meme coin related to the FLOTUS experienced a massive price dump. It peaked at $8.5 hours after its launch but quickly started to lose value. In the past 24 hours, the asset has plunged to $0.2, which represents a 98.4% price dump within just several months. Thus, the MELANIA team has followed the example set by those operating the TRUMP token. CryptoPotato reported numerous times in the past that wallets linked to the POTUS meme coin had disposed of enormous portions of the token. The most recent example was quite controversial as it came just hours before the US launched a missile attack against Iran, after which the entire crypto market turned red, including the TRUMP meme coin.

Previously, ZachXBT investigated the whale for aggressively trading MELANIA and other tokens. One of the high-profile whales, previously identified by ZachXBT as William Parker, is back with high-profile positions on Hyperliquid. The whale is also known for his social media handle @qwatio , with no live posts after deleting most of its content since 2015. The whale joined the league of James Wynn and Aguila Trades in a new trend of high-profile traders in recent weeks. MELANIA has a track record The same trader has returned multiple times with new wallets, causing havoc on Hyperliquid with some of the most destructive trades, especially linked to draining liquidity pools. @qwatio’s trading practice informed a subsequent deliberate manipulation of the JELLY token, again with the goal of draining the liquidity pool. In the past few months, @qwatio used four known addresses. Three of the previous ones are inactive, with no new positions. The whale, known as William Parker, or @qwatio, opened two new short positions on BTC and ETH. | Source: Hyperliquid The latest known address is $436K underwater, based on its short positions for BTC and ETH. This time around, the positions had a notional value above $210M, with no clear signs of deliberate counter-trading. The unrealized profit and loss may change, though the trader has shown readiness to keep the positions. On-chain data shows he posted $4.5M USDC collateral to extend his short positions and avoid liquidation. The whale is now considered to be in gambling mode, after six liquidations in the past three days. Hyperliquid becomes top crypto summer venue The stories of high-profile whales added to Hyperliquid’s fame as the go-to chain for derivative trading. It often competes with some of the biggest centralized exchanges in terms of volumes and open interest. In June, Hyperliquid activity slowed down a bit, with open interest of $7.2B. Hyperliquid remains a leader in 24-hour fees, surpassing Ethereum, Solana and other top apps and networks. Based on Artemis data, Hyperliquid generated $2.1M in fees. The perpetual futures DEX also carries $6.8B in 24-hour volumes, with over 500K daily active users. The market shows a mix of organic traffic and activity that aims to tap an eventual second airdrop of HYPE tokens, based on user activity. Since its launch, Hyperliquid has allowed whales to withdraw over $81B, with over $46B in liquidated positions. As of June 2025, Hyperliquid still carried over 60% of decentralized perpetual swaps traffic. The success of the platform inspired other attempts to copy its success. The perps DEX uses more than 64% of all USDC on Arbitrum for its liquidity purposes. The DEX drew in a total of $3.56B USDC, with around $2.91B remaining as available liquidity. HYPE took a step back in June, after peaking above $45. HYPE retains open interest above $1.5B, of which $1.1B is on the Hyperliquid exchange. Currently, short positions make up about 38% of the open interest, on expectations of further correction from peak prices. The native token currently trades around $37 and is closely watched for a rebound, based on recent whale activity. HYPE rallied after the inclusion of high-profile trades, which some consider deliberate attempts to draw attention to Hyperliquid. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While this situation has cast a shadow on the token launches of projects, Eclipse Labs has taken some precautions for the upcoming ES token airdrop. Eclipse Labs has banned its team members from participating in the upcoming ES token airdrop, The Block reported. Airdrop Ban Has Arrived! Eclipse Labs, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum (ETH), has banned its team members and employees from participating in the upcoming ES token airdrop. It was reported that this move by Eclipse Labs was planned to prevent insider selling that has been affecting the market recently. Eclipse Labs stated that every employee signed an agreement prohibiting airdrop requests and requested to exclude all wallet addresses, including test wallets. “Eclipse Labs employees signed a document prohibiting them from requesting any ES airdrops and providing all addresses (regardless of whether they were used for testing) to exclude the possibility of participating in airdrops.” Eclipse also noted that the ES tokens allocated to its team and investors will be subject to a one-year lock-up period after its IPO, followed by a three-year vesting period. “All employee and investor allocations will be locked for one year after public listing and will be gradually unlocked over 3 years.” The project has raised around $65 million in total funding so far, but has yet to set a specific date for its ES token airdrop. *This is not investment advice.

Amp ( AMP ) token dropped to a low of $0.00293 this week, its lowest level since April. This retreat has brought its market cap to $286 million, down from its all-time high of $3.5 billion. Here are the top three reasons why the coin may rebound soon. Amp crypto has formed a double-bottom pattern The first reason Amp may bounce back is that it has formed a double-bottom pattern on the daily chart. This pattern consists of two distinct lows and a neckline. In this case, the bottom section is at $0.0029, while the neckline is at $0.00578. The profit target in a double-bottom is established by subtracting the lower side from the neckline. In this case, the calculation gives the pattern’s height as $0.00288. Adding this figure to the neckline gives a target of $0.0086, up 155% from the current level. Amp price chart | Source: crypto.news Whales are buying Amp Another reason the Amp token may rebound is that whales are actively accumulating AMP. These large holders are increasing their token holdings, signaling expectations of a price recovery. One reason for this accumulation is the belief that Amp is highly undervalued, as the MVRV ratio has plunged to -1.78. An MVRV ratio below 1 typically indicates that a token is trading at a discount. The chart below shows that wallets holding between 100,000 and 1 million AMP have increased their holdings to 1.1 billion from the year-to-date low of 1.05 billion. Similarly, whales holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens now hold over 1.97 billion coins, while those with 10 million to 100 million now hold 10.7 billion. Amp whale activity and MVRV | Source: Santiment Supply on exchanges is falling Meanwhile, there are signs that investors are not dumping AMP even as its price declines. Nansen data shows that exchange balances have dropped to 15.35 billion tokens, down 15% in the last 30 days and 20% in the last 90. There were nearly 20 billion AMP on exchanges in April.

GameStop Completes $2.7 Billion Fundraise Video game retailer GameStop has concluded a major fundraising effort, securing a total of $2.7 billion through the sale of zero-coupon convertible senior notes. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, the latest $450 million raised came via a greenshoe option exercised in full by the original purchaser. This follow-on sale arrived just a week after GameStop’s initial $2.25 billion private placement. The convertible notes, maturing in 2032, are priced to convert into GameStop Class A common stock at $28.91 per share, which is a 32.5% premium over the company’s volume-weighted average share price on June 12, the day of the original offering. Potential Bitcoin Allocation on the Table In its official statement, GameStop confirmed that proceeds from the offering would be deployed for general corporate purposes. Notably, this could include further Bitcoin acquisitions under its updated Investment Policy. The firm first adopted the Bitcoin treasury strategy in May, when it acquired 4,710 BTC, valued at $512 million at the time of purchase and approximately $506 million at current prices. With Bitcoin trading near $107,175, GameStop’s treasury strategy places it within a growing cohort of public companies turning to the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and a long-term reserve asset. Following, Not Copying, the Bitcoin Treasury Playbook GameStop’s pivot toward Bitcoin has drawn comparisons to Strategy’s high-profile crypto accumulation model. The connection was further highlighted when GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen appeared in a widely circulated photo alongside Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in March, shortly before GameStop hinted at its Bitcoin intentions. However, Cohen has been careful to distance his firm from replicating any specific strategy, stating in a recent interview, “We’re not going to call our shots in advance, we’re not following anyone else's strategy.” While Strategy continues to announce regular Bitcoin purchases, GameStop’s future moves in the crypto space remain deliberately opaque, with no confirmed timelines for further acquisitions. Market Reaction Muted Despite Strategic Moves Despite the headline-making Bitcoin purchases and significant capital raises, GameStop’s stock performance has not reflected investor enthusiasm. The company’s share price fell over 10% to $30.73 following its initial Bitcoin purchase announcement in May. A further dip followed the disclosure of its second convertible notes offering, even as the fundraising total increased through the greenshoe exercise.

Hong Kong is making a bold and strategic move, positioning itself at the forefront of the next generation of the internet. The city’s government-backed business hub, Cyberport, has just launched a groundbreaking initiative: a pilot funding program specifically designed to ignite and accelerate Hong Kong Web3 and blockchain development. This isn’t just about financial support; it’s about fostering an ecosystem where innovation can truly thrive. Understanding the Cyberport Pilot Funding Program: A Gateway to Innovation At its core, this initiative is a direct response to the burgeoning potential of decentralized technologies. Cyberport, known for nurturing tech startups, is now extending a crucial lifeline to projects building on blockchain and Web3 foundations. The program is straightforward yet impactful: Open for Applications: The application window is currently open, with a crucial deadline of August 1. This limited timeframe emphasizes the urgency and importance of getting involved quickly. Generous Funding Per Project: Each eligible company has the opportunity to secure up to HK$500,000, which translates to approximately $63,705 USD, per pilot project. This substantial blockchain funding can be a game-changer for early-stage ventures or established companies looking to explore new avenues. Multiple Project Submissions: To maximize impact and encourage diverse innovation, companies can submit up to three distinct pilot projects. This flexibility allows for broader exploration and development across different Web3 verticals. This pilot funding program isn’t just a handout; it’s an investment in the future, designed to catalyze real-world applications and solutions built on distributed ledger technology. Why Hong Kong Web3 Development is Crucial for Global Leadership Hong Kong has long been a global financial hub, and its embrace of Web3 signifies a strategic pivot towards the digital future. The city aims to become a leading international virtual asset center, and initiatives like Cyberport’s program are fundamental to achieving this vision. Why is this so significant? Regulatory Clarity: Unlike many jurisdictions still grappling with how to regulate crypto and Web3, Hong Kong has been proactive in establishing a clear regulatory framework. This certainty attracts businesses and investors who seek stability and compliance. Talent Attraction: By offering funding and a supportive ecosystem, Hong Kong can draw top-tier blockchain developers, entrepreneurs, and researchers from around the world, creating a vibrant talent pool. Gateway to Asia: Its unique position as a bridge between mainland China and the rest of the world makes Hong Kong an ideal launchpad for Web3 projects targeting diverse markets. Economic Diversification: Investing in Web3 helps diversify Hong Kong’s economy beyond traditional finance, fostering new industries and job opportunities. This concerted effort in Web3 development is not just about local growth; it’s about cementing Hong Kong’s position as a global leader in the digital frontier. The Impact of Robust Blockchain Funding on Innovation The availability of dedicated blockchain funding is a critical accelerator for innovation. Many promising Web3 projects struggle to move past the conceptual stage due to a lack of initial capital. This pilot program directly addresses that bottleneck. Benefits for Innovators: Prototyping and MVP Development: Funds can be used to build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) or prototypes, proving the concept and attracting further investment. Talent Acquisition: High-quality talent is expensive. This funding allows projects to hire skilled developers, designers, and business strategists. Research and Development (R&D): Complex blockchain solutions require significant R&D. The funding can support exploratory work into new consensus mechanisms, scaling solutions, or privacy-enhancing technologies. Market Entry and User Acquisition: Pilot projects need resources for initial marketing, community building, and acquiring early users to test their solutions in a real-world environment. Potential Project Examples: Imagine projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with real-world utility, GameFi, metaverse infrastructure, supply chain transparency solutions, or even decentralized identity systems – all benefiting from this crucial injection of capital. The possibilities are vast, and this program is set to be a catalyst for their realization. Navigating the Cyberport Blockchain Application Process: Actionable Insights For companies eager to tap into this opportunity, understanding the application process for the Cyberport blockchain funding is paramount. While specific details will be on Cyberport’s official channels, here are some actionable insights to consider: Key Elements of a Strong Application: Clear Problem Statement: Articulate the problem your project solves and why a blockchain or Web3 solution is the most effective approach. Innovative Solution: Highlight the unique aspects of your technology or business model. How does it stand out in the crowded Web3 landscape? Viable Business Model: Even for a pilot, demonstrate a clear path to sustainability and scalability beyond the initial funding. Strong Team: Showcase the experience, expertise, and commitment of your team members. This is often as important as the idea itself. Impact and Alignment: Explain how your project aligns with Hong Kong’s vision for Web3 development and its potential impact on the local and global ecosystem. Detailed Project Plan: Provide a clear roadmap for how the funds will be utilized, with realistic timelines and deliverables. Remember, the goal of a pilot funding program is to test hypotheses and demonstrate viability. Focus on measurable outcomes and a clear path to scaling if successful. The Broader Vision: Hong Kong’s Strategic Embrace of Web3 The Cyberport initiative is just one piece of Hong Kong’s comprehensive strategy to become a leading Web3 hub. The city has been actively engaging with the crypto industry, hosting major conferences, and consulting on regulatory frameworks to ensure a robust and responsible growth environment. This strategic approach positions Hong Kong favorably against other aspiring global Web3 centers. By providing both regulatory clarity and financial incentives through programs like this pilot funding program, Hong Kong is creating a compelling proposition for blockchain and Web3 companies worldwide. The city understands that attracting innovation requires a multi-faceted approach, combining capital, talent, and a supportive policy environment. A New Era for Digital Innovation Hong Kong’s Cyberport pilot funding program for blockchain and Web3 is a powerful statement of intent. It signifies a proactive and forward-thinking approach to embracing the digital revolution. For entrepreneurs and developers in the Web3 space, this presents an unparalleled opportunity to secure crucial early-stage funding, gain legitimacy, and contribute to building the future of the internet from one of the world’s most dynamic cities. The race to define the next generation of digital infrastructure is on, and with initiatives like this, Hong Kong is clearly in the lead, paving the way for groundbreaking innovation and economic growth.

Crypto ATMs enabling shoppers to swap coins for Bitcoin, beauty salons accepting digital assets at a discount, and Binance accounts getting you meals. Bolivia is facing one of its most serious economic crises in decades. Dollar reserves in the country are nearly depleted. The result is the highest inflation in 40 years. According to a Reuters story, the city is congested with gas station lines due to a lack of fuel. The official exchange rate is more detached from reality, with the boliviano losing half of its value on the illegal market this year alone. Amid the instability, an increasing number of Bolivians are turning to cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, stablecoins like Tether, and platforms like Binance, as a hedge against the country’s collapsing currency. Crypto adoption surges amid Dollar scarcity Despite the scarcity of exact statistics, there are numerous signals of rising cryptocurrency use. Until recently, digital currencies were prohibited in Bolivia. But by October of last year, the central bank had reported $24 million in digital asset transactions. Analysts believe that figure has climbed dramatically in recent months, as trust in the boliviano has dwindled. Bolivia’s rate of adoption is also being compared to economically distressed neighbours such as Argentina and Venezuela. Nonetheless, the overall volume of cryptocurrency activity is low. Daily Tether (USDT) transactions are expected to be around $600,000, which is much lower than the volume flowing through traditional banks and the country’s informal cash-based economy. Binance is the preferred platform for many Bolivians due to its low costs and peer-to-peer capabilities. However, global controversies loom large: in 2023, Binance paid a $4.3 billion settlement for breaking US anti-money laundering regulations. According to Mauricio Torrelio of the Bolivian Blockchain Chamber, the country’s adoption rate is now comparable to that of Argentina and Venezuela. The overall scale of the market, however, lags well behind its South American counterparts and other domestic activities. According to Jose Gabriel Espinoza, the former president of Bolivia’s central bank, daily USDT volumes average roughly $600,000, a fraction of the $18-$22 million in the legal financial sector and $12-$14 million in the cash-based criminal market. “While crypto is growing, it’s still a nascent market,” he said to Reuters. Everyday payments go digital Despite the hazards, several firms in Cochabamba have adopted digital currencies as an alternative to the national structure that is on the point of collapsing. At Bros Steakhouse, patrons can have a payment option through Binance or an ATM linked to Blink, a crypto wallet developed in El Salvador—the first country that makes Bitcoin legal. Meanwhile, across town, Carla Jones, owner of a spa that gives Bitcoin discounts to customers. She tells clients, “Three tanning sessions for less when you pay in crypto.” Rather, it is to attract younger clients and keep funds in a currency that could have a better store value than the boliviano. These innovations are not just typical tech-savvy marketing, but rather, are indicative of a deep-seated financial anxiety. Cryptocurrencies, in turn, are filling a vacuum as banks run out of dollars and the official exchange rate reaches irrelevance. A reflection of decline, not growth Despite the enthusiasm, experts warn against seeing Bolivia’s cryptocurrency development as a sign of modernisation. Many analysts believe it suggests desperation rather than a digital revolution. The huge drop in gas exports has reduced Bolivia’s access to hard cash, forcing it to rely on costly fuel imports and creating a parallel economy for dollars. On the streets, a US dollar buys more than 16 bolivianos, greatly exceeding the official rate of 6.9. Some perceive cryptocurrency as a risky gamble in an already volatile market. Vulnerable communities may be enticed to shift real-world money into volatile assets. In some situations, cryptocurrency has been marketed as a cure-all in Bolivia’s poorest districts, only to backfire when coin prices fall and shops quit taking it. According to Reuters, Bitcoin supporters like Andree Canelas see the transition as a sensible response to economic decline. He is assisting with the installation of cryptocurrency ATMs at shops and cafes throughout Cochabamba. The message is that holding Bolivians in a till is no longer secure. Despite the risk, cryptocurrency may provide a better future. “People see the volatility,” according to him, “but they also see the alternative: guaranteed loss.” The post Cryptocurrencies replace cash as Bolivia’s economic crisis deepens appeared first on Invezz",Central Banks|Crypto|Crypto business|Economic|South America|Binance|Bitcoin|Crypto Picks & Tips|Tether,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-06-26 13:22:41

Driven by new political interest and a global trend, India’s ruling party, the BJP, signals towards forming a Bitcoin Reserve. National spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari argued that India could benefit from adopting a BTC reserve. BJP Urges to Establish Bitcoin Reserve in India Recently, Pradeep Bhandari, the spokesperson of the BJP, urged that India’s financial policies must evolve to adapt more flexible and innovative framework. This method will aim to bring financial growth and prosperity to the country, according to Bhandari. He stated – “India stands at a pivotal juncture. A measured Bitcoin strategy—perhaps a reserve pilot—could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity. As the US advances and nations like Bhutan adapt, India has a unique opportunity to lead.” Bhandari’s Argument for the Possibility of BTC Reserve in India Bhandari points out several significant points that signal the possibility of a future Bitcoin reserve in India. Renewable Energy Capacity He noted that India has the full capability to mine Bitcoin, following Bhutan’s mining initiative. Bhutan mines Bitcoin, using hydropower, building a reserve exceeding $1billion by Q1 2025. Bhandari suggests that India could follow this framework, as India has even bigger renewable energy potential than Bhutan. US Model Bhandari noted that the US benefited by launching its Bitcoin Reserve and now holds over $20 billion in value. India could benefit from a pilot reserve strategy based on the US model, he proposed. [post_titles_links postid=”475206″] Urged India to Step Up While BRICS nationals and other countries are showing interest in crypto agendas, India still hesitates in the crypto space. Bhandari urged India to launch a Bitcoin reserve as it will help increase the global competition. Support From Crypto Leaders For BTC Reserve CoinDCX CEO, Sumit Gupta , thanked Bhandari for bringing this proposal of BTC reserve. He stated– “For years, many of us in the industry have advocated that crypto is more than just a financial instrument; it’s geopolitical, economic, and strategic. Seeing our policymakers engage with this reality is both validating and encouraging!” Final Note While urging the nation to build a BTC reserve, Pradeep Bhandari ensures that this is not a reckless pivot but a calculated step to embrace digital assets. While crypto experts suggest India to test Bitcoin as a sovereign asset, the central question remains unanswered– Will India establish a Bitcoin reserve? After encountering multiple crypto updates, the possibility of a BTC reserve speaks volumes.

According to a June 24 report by the derivatives giant, nearly half of the trading activity, approximately 45%, originated outside North America. The May 19 launched contracts generated $19.3 million in volume on the first day alone, with involvement from 15 institutional firms and four retail trading platforms. Per CME’s records, participants came from several financial companies, including exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers, professional trading desks, and individual investors. Global participation and open interest surge CME Group’s latest product additions seemingly found a market in a more “receptive” mood. Open interest in the contracts, outstanding positions that have not been settled, has reached $70.5 million. Since launching on May 19, XRP and Micro XRP futures have shown demand across institutional and retail participants, highlighting interest in regulated tools to access one of the most watched crypto assets. Get the full breakdown ➡️ https://t.co/nmVRaXqUTO pic.twitter.com/JZG2Bnnjll — CME Group (@CMEGroup) June 24, 2025 Analysts say such numbers suggest market participants are using these contracts to hedge or speculate on longer-term price trends in XRP, and not merely riding the initial wave of publicity. CME’s XRP futures are available in two contract sizes to cater to different segments of the market. The standard XRP futures feature a contract multiplier of 50,000 XRP, while the Micro XRP (MXP) contracts are structured with a multiplier of 2,500 XRP. The varying sizes provide traders and institutions with the flexibility to manage exposure, according to their risk tolerance and strategy. Both futures are financially settled, removing any need for physical delivery of the underlying cryptocurrency. This design lowers the entry barrier for institutional investors who may face regulatory, security, or custodial constraints when dealing with digital assets directly. The contracts settle on the last Friday of each month based on the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate, which is calculated by CF Benchmarks. The benchmark aggregates pricing data from crypto exchanges to provide a reliable daily US dollar valuation for XRP. Financial settlement is the preferred format among institutional market participants looking for simpler ways of managing digital wallets or custody arrangements. It gives investors exposure to crypto price action, in compliance with internal policies or regional regulations. XRP contracts boost Ripple market activity The first month of the CME futures follows several developments within the XRP ecosystem. In early 2025, Ripple made a high-profile acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. The purchase helped XRP increase its presence in institutional finance, particularly by improving its liquidity provisioning on over-the-counter (OTC) business structures. Last year, Ripple introduced RLUSD , a new US dollar-backed stablecoin native to the XRP Ledger. The coin is expected to boost XRP Ledger activity and expand the use of XRP as a bridge asset between traditional fiat and digital currencies. On June 21, the stablecoin issuer minted 14 million RLUSD on the Ethereum blockchain in a single day, the largest daily issuance since April 25, according to data from Ripple’s Stablecoin Tracker. The issuance brings the total RLUSD minted in June to 42 million, with all tokens deployed exclusively on Ethereum rather than Ripple’s XRPL. Earlier this month, RLUSD secured regulatory approval in Dubai and partnered with AlchemyPay to extend its stablecoin support for several fiat payment methods, including Visa and Apple Pay.

The decentralized entertainment platform BORA has just dropped a bombshell announcement that promises to reshape the landscape of Web3. In a recent Medium blog post, BORA unveiled an ambitious roadmap for the second half of 2025 (H2), signaling a significant leap forward for its ecosystem. This isn’t just an update; it’s a strategic overhaul designed to enhance user experience, bolster the platform’s infrastructure, and drive mass adoption in the burgeoning world of decentralized entertainment. For anyone following the pulse of crypto gaming and blockchain technology, this BORA platform update is a development worth diving into. What Does the BORA Platform Update Entail? A Closer Look at the H2 2025 Roadmap BORA’s strategic roadmap for H2 2025 is comprehensive, touching upon several core aspects of its platform. The goal is clear: to solidify BORA’s position as a leading force in the digital entertainment space by making its ecosystem more accessible, efficient, and appealing to a wider audience. The key pillars of this update include a brand new BORA brand, an upgraded BORA Portal, the introduction of BORA Gas Abstraction, and crucial tokenomics updates. A Fresh Identity: The New BORA Brand A brand is more than just a logo; it’s the identity and promise of a platform. The planned launch of a new BORA brand signifies a fresh chapter for the platform. This rebrand is likely aimed at modernizing its image, enhancing its appeal to both existing users and new entrants, and better reflecting its expanded vision for decentralized entertainment . A strong, clear brand identity is crucial for standing out in the competitive Web3 landscape and attracting mainstream adoption. It could involve a new visual language, messaging, and a more streamlined narrative that communicates BORA’s value proposition effectively. Enhanced User Experience: The Upgraded BORA Portal The BORA Portal serves as the gateway to the entire BORA ecosystem. An upgraded portal suggests a significant focus on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) improvements. This could mean a more intuitive design, faster loading times, enhanced security features, and perhaps new functionalities that streamline interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) and games. A smoother, more user-friendly portal is vital for onboarding new users who may not be familiar with the complexities of blockchain technology, making the journey into Web3 gaming future less daunting. Simplifying Transactions: The Power of BORA Gas Abstraction One of the biggest hurdles for mainstream adoption of blockchain applications has been the complexity and cost of gas fees. BORA Gas Abstraction is a game-changer in this regard. This innovation aims to abstract away the need for users to directly manage and pay gas fees for every transaction. Imagine playing a game or using a dApp on BORA without constantly worrying about transaction costs or needing to hold specific cryptocurrencies just for gas. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry, making the user experience seamless and comparable to traditional online services. It’s a critical step towards achieving true mass adoption in decentralized entertainment, as it removes a major point of friction for users. Sustainable Growth: Unpacking BORA’s Tokenomics Updates The tokenomics of a platform dictate its economic model, sustainability, and value proposition for token holders. BORA’s planned tokenomics updates are crucial for ensuring the long-term health and growth of its ecosystem. While specific details are yet to be fully revealed, such updates often involve adjustments to token distribution, staking mechanisms, utility, and reward structures. The aim is typically to create a more robust, equitable, and deflationary or value-accruing model for the BORA token, incentivizing participation and investment within the platform. These changes are vital for the platform’s ability to attract and retain developers, content creators, and users, fostering a vibrant and self-sustaining economy. Revolutionizing Decentralized Entertainment: How BORA Aims to Lead BORA’s roadmap isn’t just about technical upgrades; it’s about setting a new standard for decentralized entertainment . By focusing on user-centric design, simplified transactions, and a robust economic model, BORA is positioning itself to address the core challenges preventing Web3 from reaching its full potential. The vision is to create an ecosystem where content creators, game developers, and users can interact seamlessly, share value, and truly own their digital assets. Consider the impact of gas abstraction. For casual gamers or new users, the concept of paying for every in-game action can be bewildering and off-putting. By removing this friction, BORA makes its platform feel more like a traditional gaming experience, while retaining the benefits of blockchain ownership and transparency. This move alone could significantly expand BORA’s user base beyond crypto enthusiasts to include a broader audience of gamers and digital content consumers. Furthermore, a refreshed brand identity will allow BORA to communicate its unique value proposition more effectively to a global audience. In a rapidly evolving space, clarity and appeal are paramount. BORA aims to cultivate an environment where creativity flourishes, and digital assets truly belong to their owners, setting a precedent for how future entertainment platforms could operate. The Future of Web3 Gaming: BORA’s Strategic Play The gaming industry is a massive market, and Web3 gaming future holds immense promise for innovation. BORA has always had a strong focus on gaming, and these updates will undoubtedly strengthen its appeal to both developers and players. For developers, a platform with streamlined gas fees, an improved portal, and clear tokenomics offers a more attractive environment to build and deploy their games. It reduces development complexities and increases the potential for user engagement. For players, the promise of true ownership of in-game assets, verifiable scarcity, and the potential to earn through gameplay (Play-to-Earn or Play-and-Earn models) remains a powerful draw. BORA’s updates enhance these core Web3 gaming tenets by making them more accessible and enjoyable. Imagine trading unique in-game items without high transaction fees or navigating complex blockchain wallets – this is the future BORA is building. In the competitive landscape of Web3 gaming, platforms like BORA are vying for mindshare and market share. By addressing pain points such as high gas fees and complex user interfaces, BORA differentiates itself as a platform committed to practical, real-world utility for gamers. This strategic focus on usability could be the key to unlocking the next wave of adoption in blockchain gaming, moving beyond early adopters to a more mainstream audience. Blockchain Innovation Driving Growth: The Technical Backbone of BORA’s Ambition At the heart of BORA’s ecosystem lies robust blockchain innovation . While the specific underlying blockchain technology (e.g., Klaytn, its own chain, or a layer-2 solution) wasn’t detailed in the snippet, the focus on features like gas abstraction implies sophisticated technical development. Gas abstraction often involves meta-transactions or account abstraction techniques, where a third party (or the protocol itself) covers the gas fees on behalf of the user, making the process invisible to them. This is a significant technical feat that requires careful engineering to ensure security, scalability, and efficiency. BORA’s commitment to such innovations suggests a strong technical team dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on a blockchain. Scalability is paramount for entertainment platforms, which need to handle millions of transactions and users simultaneously. Security is non-negotiable, protecting user assets and data. Interoperability, allowing assets and data to move seamlessly between different blockchain environments, could also be a future focus, enhancing the overall utility of the BORA ecosystem. By investing in core blockchain infrastructure and features like gas abstraction, BORA is not just building applications; it’s enhancing the underlying technology to support a vast and complex digital economy. This focus on foundational innovation is what distinguishes long-term players in the blockchain space from fleeting trends, laying the groundwork for sustainable growth and a truly decentralized future for entertainment. What This Means for Crypto Gaming News & Investors: Navigating the Horizon For enthusiasts and investors following crypto gaming news , BORA’s H2 2025 roadmap presents a compelling narrative. The planned updates could significantly impact the utility and demand for the BORA token. Improved user experience and broader adoption, driven by gas abstraction and a new brand, could lead to increased network activity and, potentially, a more robust ecosystem that benefits token holders. Investors will be keen to see the specifics of the tokenomics updates. Changes that introduce more utility, staking rewards, or burning mechanisms could positively influence the token’s value proposition. As the platform grows and attracts more users and developers, the intrinsic value of the BORA token, which powers transactions and participation within the ecosystem, could see an uplift. It’s important for potential investors to conduct their own due diligence, staying informed about the detailed implementation of these roadmap items. However, the strategic direction indicates a strong commitment to addressing market needs and positioning BORA for long-term success in the competitive decentralized entertainment and Web3 gaming sectors. This could represent a significant opportunity for those looking to invest in platforms that are actively solving real-world blockchain challenges and targeting mass adoption. Conclusion: A New Chapter for BORA and Decentralized Entertainment The decentralized entertainment platform BORA’s roadmap for H2 2025 is more than just a series of updates; it’s a bold declaration of intent. By focusing on a new brand identity, an upgraded portal, revolutionary gas abstraction, and refined tokenomics, BORA is strategically positioning itself to overcome the existing barriers to Web3 adoption. These planned enhancements promise a more intuitive, accessible, and economically sustainable ecosystem for games, content, and digital assets. As the digital world continues its shift towards decentralization, BORA’s commitment to innovation and user experience sets a compelling precedent, potentially ushering in a new era where decentralized entertainment truly flourishes and reaches a global audience. The future looks bright for BORA, and its journey will be a fascinating one to watch for anyone invested in the evolution of digital ownership and entertainment.

Judge Torres ultimately denied this request, instructing the Clerk of Court to terminate the motion accordingly. JUST IN: Judge Torres has denied @Ripple and the @SECGov joint motion for an indicative ruling. pic.twitter.com/iPzD4aMG1H — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 26, 2025 Background of the Legal Dispute The legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the SEC began in December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple. The SEC alleged that Ripple had violated the Securities Act of 1933 by offering and selling XRP without proper registration as a security. According to the SEC’s claims, Ripple’s failure to register deprived investors of the necessary information to make informed investment decisions. The SEC’s complaint was grounded in Section 5 of the Securities Act, which requires entities that offer or sell securities to register those securities with the SEC or qualify for an exemption. In July 2023, Judge Torres issued a summary judgment that partially favored the SEC, determining that Ripple had indeed offered XRP as a security in certain institutional sales without registration. This decision formed part of the broader Summary Judgment Order in the case titled SEC v. Ripple Labs Inc., 682 F. Supp. 3d 308 (S.D.N.Y. 2023). We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Details of the Joint Motion In March 2024, the SEC filed a motion requesting a permanent injunction to prevent Ripple from further violating Section 5 of the Securities Act. The motion also sought a significant financial penalty. Following further litigation, both Ripple and the SEC jointly filed a motion requesting an indicative ruling from the court. The motion specifically asked whether the court would dissolve the earlier injunction requiring Ripple’s compliance with securities laws and whether it would consider reducing the monetary penalty imposed on Ripple. Judge Torres’s recent order explicitly states that this joint motion is denied. The court’s decision means that, at this stage, there will be no change to the existing injunction or the financial penalty unless further legal action modifies those terms. Conclusion of the Ruling In the formal conclusion of the order, Judge Torres wrote, “For the foregoing reasons, the parties’ motion for an indicative ruling is DENIED.” The judge also directed the Clerk of Court to officially close the motion. The order is dated June 26, 2025, and signed by Judge Analisa Torres, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York. Eleanor Terrett’s report highlights a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, reaffirming that the court maintains its earlier stance on the case’s remedies and penalties. The denial of the motion ensures that the summary judgment and the injunction previously imposed on Ripple remain in effect unless further court proceedings lead to a different outcome.

A tweet from Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer last month made it sound like the SEC had dropped its appeal. Some even said the SEC has now stopped going after every crypto company in the U.S. But XRP lawyer Bill Morgan stepped in to clear the air — and his message is clear: The case isn’t over yet. Community Confusion Over SEC Appeal It all started when XRP_CRO, a popular voice in the XRP community, highlighted a tweet from Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, last month. The tweet stated that the SEC had completely dropped its fight with Ripple.

Bill Morgan: “The Appeal Is Still on Foot” Bill Morgan, however, responded with a reality check . He explained that the appeal is not over—it is simply “in abeyance,” or on hold. What happens next depends on Judge Torres, who must give a clear signal, called an “indicative ruling.” If the judge gives a positive ruling, the settlement can move forward. If not, Ripple may continue with its cross-appeal, and the SEC could revive its own appeal, keeping the case alive. Meanwhile, the SEC is scheduled to file a status report by August 15, 2025 . Don’t Celebrate Too Early Bill Morgan warned the XRP community not to celebrate too soon. He said the lawsuit has been unfair from the start, calling it a “horrible anti-retail investor” case.

But is it just hype, or is something real driving the momentum? PI Price Action: A Rollercoaster Start Pi Network (PI) launched with a bang on February 20 , starting at just $0.0991. Within six days, the price rocketed by 2,812.41%, setting off a wave of excitement across the crypto community. But the hype didn’t last forever. From February 27 to April 4 , PI crashed by 81.51% . February still ended strong with a 222.5% gain . In March and April, PI declined by 66.5% and 13.9% , respectively. May brought a 6.39% rebound , showing some market recovery. However, June has been rough , with a 17.4% drop so far. Weekly Surge: PI Up 5% Amid Stability Despite the volatile ride, PI has risen 5% in the last 7 days, currently trading at $0.5639 . Most notably, PI has consistently maintained an average price of $0.60 over the past 3 months—a rare feat for new tokens in a bear-biased market. Analyst: “PI’s Growth Is Organic, Not Hype” According to crypto analyst Dr Altcoin, this price consistency isn’t fueled by hype or manipulation. In a recent post on X (Twitter) , he explained: “PI’s price action is being shaped by organic market demand and long-term support—not speculation.” Dr Altcoin believes real investor confidence is behind the token’s price strength. Pi Network’s $100M Ecosystem Fund Is a Game-Changer The analyst highlights a crucial factor supporting this stability— Pi Network Ventures’ $100 million fund , aimed at developing the ecosystem. This fund incentivizes developers to build real-world apps using PI. It drives tangible utility , bringing new users and real use cases to the platform. The focus is on slow, steady, and sustainable growth , not overnight pumps. PI Price Prediction: What’s Next? Dr Altcoin says no major price spike is expected this week unless a big announcement drops. However, he remains bullish on long-term stability, stating that: “PI is unlikely to fall below its all-time low of $0.40.” The coin has tested the $0.40 low only twice—April 5 and June 13—but quickly bounced back. Currently, PI sits 41.47% above its low, signaling strong support. Final Thoughts: Is PI the Dark Horse of 2025? While many still dismiss PI as a hype-driven token, the data and ecosystem funding tell a different story. With real-world utility growing and investor confidence holding steady, PI might just be the most underrated crypto of the year.

On June 25 alone, $547.7 million inflows were made. Bitcoin ETFs 12-Day Net Inflow Series: Total Inflows Near $4 Billion, BTC Strengthens on Dollar Weakness BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the day’s top ETF with net inflows of $340.3 million. Fidelity’s FBTC fund followed with $115.2 million. Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL funds took in $70.2 million, $12.9 million and $9.1 million, respectively. Other ETFs closed with zero net inflows. IBIT continues to lead the pack by accounting for 86% ($3.3 billion) of the 12-day total net inflows. “12 consecutive days of inflows, $4 billion in fresh capital. The ETF category is approaching $50 billion since January 2024. That’s really incredible,” said Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store. To date, there have been a total of $48.4 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January 2024. Total assets under management in these funds currently stand at approximately $125 billion. Positive Mood Continues for Ethereum ETFs Spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded net inflows of $60.4 million on the same day, with $55.2 million of the inflows also going to BlackRock’s ETHA fund. This is the third consecutive positive day for Ethereum ETFs, with total inflows over the last three days reaching $232.4 million. In total, $4.2 billion has flowed into these funds to date, which were launched in July 2024. Bitcoin is trading at $107,445, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours and 2.9% on the week. After falling to $98,000 on Sunday, BTC tested the $108,000 level again on Thursday morning. Timothy Misir, BRN Research Director, said that the dollar index falling to its lowest level since March 2022 created a strong headwind for crypto assets: “The weakening dollar and the World Bank’s downgrade of its 2025 US growth forecast to 1.4% from 2.3% are sending economic signals in favor of uncorrelated assets like Bitcoin.” Misir also emphasized that government institutions have openly begun accumulating Bitcoin and companies continue to rapidly adopt Bitcoin, expressing that BTC is maturing as an institutional asset class. K33 Research President Vetle Lunde stated in his assessment earlier this week that ETF flows directly affect the BTC price, while treasury companies have a more limited impact. Considering the combination of increasing institutional demand, the weakening dollar and concerns about an economic slowdown, it is thought that Bitcoin's upward momentum may continue in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

On June 25, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a remarkable total net inflow of $60.16 million. This significant movement signals a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and marks a pivotal moment for the broader digital asset landscape. Understanding the Latest Spot Ethereum ETFs Performance The daily tracking of these new financial products offers crucial insights into market sentiment and investor behavior. According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the $60.16 million in net inflows on June 25 demonstrates a strong start for these recently launched investment vehicles. While the overall figure is impressive, a closer look reveals a clear leader in this initial phase. Here’s a breakdown of the performance: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund dominated the inflows, attracting a substantial $54.93 million. BlackRock’s strong presence and reputation in traditional finance likely played a significant role in drawing such a large portion of the capital. Bitwise’s ETHW: Following BlackRock, Bitwise’s ETHW secured $5.23 million in inflows, indicating a healthy, albeit smaller, interest from its investor base. Other Spot Ethereum ETFs: Interestingly, the remaining spot Ethereum ETFs reported no changes in their holdings for the day. This suggests that initial institutional capital is highly concentrated in a few key players, particularly those with established track records and brand recognition. This concentrated inflow into a select few ETFs highlights the importance of trust and accessibility for investors entering the crypto space through regulated financial products. What Do These Ethereum Inflows Signify for the Market? The consistent positive Ethereum inflows into these ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent a significant shift in how mainstream finance views and interacts with digital assets. These inflows can be interpreted in several ways, each with profound implications for Ethereum and the wider crypto ecosystem. Increased Institutional Adoption: The primary takeaway is the accelerating pace of institutional adoption. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are now gaining a regulated, familiar pathway to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This reduces operational complexities and regulatory hurdles, making it a more attractive option for traditional investors. Validation of Ethereum’s Value Proposition: Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and its role in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) sectors, is increasingly being recognized as a foundational technology. The inflows suggest that institutional investors are buying into Ethereum’s long-term potential as a programmable blockchain. Potential for Price Impact: While daily inflows might not immediately cause drastic price movements, sustained inflows over weeks and months can create significant buying pressure. As more capital flows into these ETFs, the underlying ETH needs to be purchased to back the shares, potentially driving up the price of Ethereum. This creates a positive feedback loop, attracting even more interest. Market Maturity: The launch and subsequent performance of these ETFs contribute to the overall maturity of the cryptocurrency market. It moves crypto from a niche, speculative asset class to a more legitimate and accessible investment option within traditional financial portfolios. BlackRock ETHA: A Dominant Force in the New ETF Landscape The sheer volume of inflows into BlackRock ETHA is a testament to BlackRock’s immense influence and strategic positioning in the financial world. As the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock brings unparalleled trust and reach to any product it launches. Their entry into the crypto ETF space, first with Bitcoin and now with Ethereum, is a game-changer. Why is BlackRock’s ETHA leading the pack? Brand Recognition and Trust: BlackRock is a household name in finance. Investors, particularly institutional ones, are more comfortable allocating capital to a fund managed by a firm with such a long-standing reputation for reliability and expertise. Extensive Distribution Network: BlackRock has a vast network of clients and advisors, making it easier for them to distribute their new ETF products to a wide range of investors, from large pension funds to individual wealth management accounts. Proven Track Record: The success of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has set a precedent. Investors who saw the rapid growth and adoption of IBIT are likely to feel confident in allocating capital to their Ethereum counterpart. Liquidity and Market Depth: A larger fund often attracts more liquidity, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the market price of the ETF shares. The performance of BlackRock’s ETHA will likely serve as a benchmark for other Ethereum ETFs and could encourage more traditional financial players to explore similar offerings. The Broader Impact of the ETH ETF on Crypto Adoption The introduction and success of an ETH ETF marks a crucial milestone for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. For years, direct investment in crypto was seen as complex, risky, and largely unregulated. ETFs bridge this gap by offering a familiar, regulated, and easily accessible investment vehicle. Benefits for Investors: Simplicity: Investors can gain exposure to Ethereum through their existing brokerage accounts, just like they would with stocks or other ETFs. Security: The custody of the underlying Ethereum is handled by professional, regulated custodians, reducing the risk of hacks or self-custody errors for individual investors. Liquidity: ETF shares are traded on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity and ease of trading during market hours. Diversification: For traditional portfolios, adding an ETH ETF provides diversification into a rapidly growing digital asset class. Challenges and Considerations: Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns over time compared to direct ownership. Indirect Ownership: Investors own shares in a fund that holds Ethereum, not the Ethereum itself. This means they cannot use their ETH for staking, DeFi, or other on-chain activities. Market Volatility: While ETFs provide regulated access, they are still exposed to the inherent volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency market. Despite these considerations, the net positive inflows suggest that the benefits currently outweigh the challenges for a significant portion of the investor community. What’s Next for Crypto ETFs and the Digital Asset Market? The success of the U.S. Crypto ETFs , both Bitcoin and now Ethereum, paints a promising picture for the future of digital asset investment. This trend is likely to continue, potentially paving the way for ETFs based on other major cryptocurrencies, provided they meet regulatory requirements and demonstrate sufficient market demand. Future Outlook: Increased Competition: As more funds enter the market, we can expect increased competition, potentially leading to lower fees and more innovative product offerings. Global Adoption: The U.S. market often sets a precedent. The success here could encourage other countries to approve similar crypto ETF products, further legitimizing digital assets on a global scale. Impact on Spot Price: Continued institutional buying through ETFs could provide a stable demand floor for Ethereum, potentially mitigating some of the extreme volatility seen in previous market cycles. Evolution of Investment Products: We might see more complex crypto-linked financial products emerge, such as options or futures on these ETFs, offering even more sophisticated ways for investors to gain exposure or hedge risk. The journey of spot Ethereum ETFs has just begun, but the initial $60.16 million net inflow is a strong indicator of the significant role they are poised to play in the ongoing integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The robust $60.16 million in total net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on June 25, heavily led by BlackRock’s ETHA, marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. It underscores a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, validates its long-term potential, and offers a clear pathway for broader investor adoption. While challenges remain, the current trajectory suggests a promising future where digital assets are increasingly accessible and integrated into traditional investment portfolios. This surge of capital is not just a daily statistic; it’s a powerful signal of evolving market confidence and the dawning of a new era for Ethereum investment.

This signals growing market maturity, Harz argues. The recovery shows increasing liquidity and the coin’s deeper integration into mainstream portfolios, with both institutions and retail investors entering the space. US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen 12 consecutive days of positive flows – the longest streak since December 2024. “Bitcoin now sits at the intersection of institutional adoption, retail momentum, regulatory clarity, and integration into the foundations of the global financial system,” Harz says. “What comes next is the final piece of the puzzle: a technological leap forward to enable true Bitcoin DeFi. That breakthrough is closer than ever. As infrastructure advances catch up to capital inflows, Bitcoin is ready to move into its utility phase and lay the foundation for the next era of finance and payments.” Speaking of ETFs, Andrejs Balans, Risk Manager at YouHodler , notes that “the momentum behind Bitcoin ETFs has been impossible to ignore,” with billions of dollars flowing in. “This tells us that institutions are no longer standing on the sidelines. They’re treating Bitcoin like a long-term asset, similar to gold or government bonds. Thanks to ETFs, they can do it through familiar, regulated channels. It’s not flashy, but it is one of the strongest signs yet that crypto has earned a seat at the financial table,” Balans writes. Moreover, total assets under management are at all-time highs, with more sophisticated strategies built around BTC, ETH, and diversified crypto baskets. “That’s a clear signal that this market is no longer just about chasing short-term gains. It is about long-term positioning, risk management, and belief in the future of digital assets,” Balans argues. “We’re not in the early days anymore, and we’re not just in it for the memes. With clear rules, growing trust, and institutional adoption, crypto is becoming part of the financial mainstream.” He also discussed Ethereum’s role, arguing that it’s “quietly becoming the infrastructure layer of the digital economy.” It offers yield through staking, which institutional investors are increasingly exploring. “Earning yield on digital assets in a secure, compliant way is precisely the kind of offering that could bring traditional finance even deeper into crypto,” Balans says. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $107,827. The chart shows the price gradually rising from the intraday low of $106,170. It briefly hit the daily high of $108,117 before slightly correcting back to the mid-$107,000 territory. That said, BTC managed to break another level the investors were waiting to see, the $107,500 mark. It also started retesting the $108,100 level, creating paths for additional rises. With this, it also hit a weekly high, recovering from the lows of $98,974. Next targets are $110,490 and $112,080. Bitcoin Price Chart.

The new policy statement cements the country’s commitment to establishing Hong Kong as an international center for digital asset innovation. Hong Kong’s new policy statement amplifies the foundational measures outlined in the initial policy statement released in October 2022. The SAR also said the new statement establishes a vision for a trusted and innovative DA ecosystem that prioritizes risk management and investor protection. Hong Kong puts focus on regulating the DA ecosystem The Special Administrative Region announced that the government is establishing a regulatory framework for DA service providers, covering DA exchanges, stablecoin issuers, DA dealing service providers, and DA custodian service providers. The statement disclosed that the Securities and Futures Commission ( SFC ) will take the lead in the upcoming licensing regimes for DA dealing service providers and DA custodian service providers. The SAR also revealed that the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will be overseeing a legal review to allow the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and financial instruments. According to the region, the new policy statement will consider distinct features of tokenized bond issuance and transactions, including settlement, registration, and record requirements. “The framework set out in the Policy Statement 2.0 helps us ‘LEAP’ towards a trusted, sustainable and deeply integrated DA ecosystem embedded within the real economy. It also keeps Hong Kong at the forefront of digital transformation, offering a clear roadmap for businesses and investors to thrive in a secure and vibrant DA market.” – Christopher Hui , Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury in Hong Kong. The policy statement revealed that the government wants to regulate the issuance of tokenized government bonds and propel the tokenization of RWAs. The SAR said the initiative aims to enhance liquidity and accessibility by clarifying the stamp duty statement for tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Hong Kong government also welcomed the introduction of secondary market trading of the tokenized funds on licensed DA trading platforms. The government added that it will promote the tokenization of a flurry of assets and financial instruments to illustrate the adaptability of the technology across sectors such as precious metals, non-ferrous metals, and renewable energy. The SAR said that implementing the licensing regime for stablecoin issuers on August 1 would allow the development of real-world use cases. The government also highlighted its partnerships among regulators, law enforcement agencies, and technology providers for the development of DA infrastructures. Hong Kong has welcomed suggestions from market participants on how the government may test the usage of licensed stablecoins. SAR also announced that Cyberport will establish a funding channel for blockchain and DA, which will offer funding to high-impact applications with the potential to serve as a benchmark for future use cases. Hong Kong partners with industry and academia for international cooperation The SAR revealed that Hong Kong is working on nurturing talent through partnerships with industry and academia. The government believes the initiative is positioning Hong Kong as a center of excellence for DA knowledge-sharing and international cooperation through joint research initiatives and global regulatory collaboration. The government also wants to build a sustainable talent pool by cultivating a new generation of entrepreneurs, researchers, and technologists. The finance secretary, Paul Chan, argued that digital assets hold great development potential that is significant to fintech. He believes that by adopting blockchain technology in Hong Kong, more efficient financial transactions at a lower cost can be realized to bring in more inclusive financial services. Chan said Policy Statement 2.0 propels Hong Kong’s vision for DA development and showcases the practical use of tokenization through application. According to the finance secretary, the country strives to build more DA ecosystems that will integrate the real economy with social life through a regulatory regime and encouragement to market innovation. He believes it will benefit both the economy and society while consolidating Hong Kong’s leading position as an international financial center.

Render is powering the visual layer of AI, with its Solana upgrade setting the stage for breakout performance. ASI is merging AI ecosystems with scalable tech and bold execution, backed by a major token buyback. With agent frameworks outperforming all AI sectors, these tokens are shaping the next phase of crypto evolution. We all know AI is evolving fast. From autonomous bots managing logistics to generative models crafting real-time narratives, the technology is no longer just a backend tool—it’s reshaping how humans and machines interact. But when you merge that with crypto infrastructure, you get something more powerful than just “faster systems.” You get adaptive, self-improving networks —environments where value, logic, and behavior evolve on-chain. Coinpedia Markets According to Messari , AI mindshare across the crypto space has surged by 178% in the past 90 days ranking 2nd Best performing Sector . But it’s not general compute or LLM tokens leading the charge—it’s Agent Frameworks , which are up 86% , outperforming all other AI-related sectors. That’s not just hype—it’s a signal. The market is waking up to the idea that the future of blockchain isn’t just about executing code. It’s about embedding autonomous intelligence directly into smart contracts, protocols, and on-chain economies. This shift—toward AI agents that think, adapt, and act in real-time —is where the next wave of crypto innovation is forming. And the tokens building that layer? They’re not just riding the trend—they’re defining it. Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL): The Modular Backbone of AI Agents Launched in October 2024, Virtual Protocol quickly positioned itself as the go-to infrastructure for deploying autonomous AI agents on-chain. While most AI tokens remain stuck in ideation or closed beta, Virtual has gone live, processing millions in fees, onboarding creators, and scaling through Base and Ethereum integrations. Its standout innovation? Ribbita (TIBBIR) , a stealth-launched agent framework that went viral, surging over 8,800% in 2025. In contrast, it captured meme energy; the real value lies in showcasing modular AI personas that can operate independently, monetise through usage, and evolve within digital ecosystems. Think of it as a working AI app store for Web3. Meanwhile, IRIS , Virtual’s utility-grade agent launched on Ethereum, is providing real-time smart contract auditing using social and code signals—no hype, just utility. It debuted with no team allocation and was oversubscribed 1,500%, making it one of the most transparent launches in the AI-token space. On-chain data supports the momentum behind Virtual Protocol, with the project generating over $8.3 million in cumulative protocol fees and maintaining a robust $5.6 million in annualized revenue. Liquidity has surged past $140 million, while daily trading volumes consistently exceed $250 million, placing it among the most actively engaged AI tokens in the market. From a technical view, the token is currently holding the 200-day EMA near $1.39, a historically strong long-term support. A clean flip of $1.70 could ignite upside momentum toward $2.80–$3.00 in Q3 2025, while a breakdown below $1.39 might see short-term retests at $1.10. However, its utility, volume, and developer traction suggest Virtual is not a trend—it’s infrastructure. Render Network (RNDR): Powering the Face of AI Let’s face it—AI agents are getting smarter, faster, and more autonomous. But for them to truly connect with people, they need something more than just intelligence. They need a presence. They need to be seen, animated, and responsive in real-time. That’s where Render Network steps in— the GPU backbone powering the visual side of AI . Render doesn’t build AI brains; it builds the canvas where those brains come to life . Its decentralized network of NVIDIA GPU providers enables everything from photorealistic 3D rendering to real-time animation and generative visuals. As AI agents move toward lifelike avatars and digital humans, Render is the infrastructure making it all visually possible—efficiently and on-chain. Consider what’s happening in China: in a now-viral livestream, two AI avatars sold over $7.6 million worth of products in just six hours , to an audience of 13 million viewers. Neither host was real. Instead, these AI presenters were powered by high-fidelity animation, real-time response models, and emotional simulation. This wasn’t science fiction. It was a retail experience run entirely by synthetic personas —and it slashed costs by 80% while increasing sales by 62%. The platform’s momentum didn’t stop there. In 2025, Render migrated from Ethereum to Solana , a move that massively improved performance and cut costs. This allowed for faster transactions and real-time rendering at scale—crucial for applications like avatar interaction and microtransactions between agents and users. With the launch of Render Compute (RNP-019) , it also expanded beyond visuals into general AI computation , pushing the boundaries of what decentralized GPU networks can support. Technical Outlook Render ( RNDR ) is currently consolidating just above the key $4.00–$4.20 support zone , which aligns closely with its 100-day EMA —a historically reliable accumulation level. Despite recent broader market weakness, this zone has consistently attracted mid-term buyers, especially following the protocol’s migration to Solana , which enhances network efficiency and cost optimization. The immediate resistance stands at $5.80 . A confirmed breakout above this level could activate a bullish leg toward $7.50 , with further upside potential extending to $8.80 if volume and broader sentiment continue to improve. Momentum indicators support this setup. The RSI is neutral around 52 , but showing signs of a bullish uptrend. Meanwhile, the MACD has just crossed above the signal line, indicating a potential shift in short-term momentum in favor of the bulls heading into Q3 2025 . Notably, Render’s expanding utility—now including general AI compute via RNP-019—adds weight to its bullish setup. If the project lands new integrations or institutional partnerships, especially post-Solana migration, it could serve as the spark for a major rally. On the downside, a drop below $4.00 could see RNDR retest the $3.30–$3.50 range , a previous accumulation zone. However, current technical indicators lean bullish, supported by strong fundamentals and increasing demand for decentralized GPU power. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI): From Vision to Execution with On-Chain Intelligence Born from the unification of Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) isn’t just another AI narrative—it’s a convergence of three of the most research-backed AI initiatives in Web3. With the token merger finally complete, ASI now serves as the unified economic layer powering decentralized AI agents, data marketplaces, and machine learning infrastructure. But what elevates ASI beyond tokenomics is its early 2025 rollout of ASI‑1 Mini —a compact, Web3-native LLM designed for real-time agent communication. Unlike traditional large language models that demand expensive hardware, ASI‑1 Mini runs on just two GPUs , enabling efficient, decentralized intelligence at scale. This breakthrough significantly lowers the barrier for developers to deploy autonomous agents across various blockchains, making the ASI tech stack not only futuristic but also immediately accessible. Backing this technical momentum is a $50 million token buy-back initiative by the Fetch.ai Foundation. This isn’t just a price stabilization measure—it’s a bold signal of internal confidence and long-term commitment to ASI’s roadmap. In an environment where many projects live and die on sentiment, this financial reinforcement makes ASI stand out as both serious and sustainable. From a charting perspective, ASI (FETUSD) is currently showing early signs of recovery. The token is attempting to reclaim the 50-day EMA near $0.69, with next key resistance lying at the 100-day EMA around $0.73. A confirmed flip above this zone could pave the way toward $0.85–$1.00, especially if momentum aligns with broader AI sector rotation. However, strong horizontal support at $0.56 remains critical—any breach below this level could invalidate bullish momentum in the short term. Technicals aside, RSI currently reads 45.8—hovering in the neutral zone but ticking higher. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram shows early signs of a bullish crossover, suggesting growing positive momentum. AI Agents Are the Next Crypto Meta—And These Coins Are Building the Rails The narrative is no longer theoretical. As AI frameworks begin merging with real-world blockchain deployments, a new layer of infrastructure is emerging—one where intelligence isn’t just processed off-chain, but lives, evolves, and monetizes directly within decentralized environments. Virtual Protocol is turning modular agents into plug-and-play ecosystems. Render Network is giving those agents a visual body and real-time interactivity. ASI is pushing the limits with efficient on-chain large language models and a unified economic layer across data, logic, and compute. Each of these projects isn’t just reacting to trends—they’re architecting the foundations of intelligent blockchains . As we head deeper into Q3 2025 and beyond, AI agents will go from narrative hype to daily utility. The tokens building that shift? They won’t just perform—they’ll define the next dominant cycle of crypto evolution. In a world where smart contracts now learn and avatars outsell humans, these AI infrastructure coins aren’t optional—they’re inevitable.",Price Analysis|Crypto news|Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 13:44:43

The former, it argues, combines the zero-knowledge proofs’ confidentiality and key compliance elements. Therefore, it provides confidentiality, untraceability, and anonymity while allowing access to parties such as issuers, regulators, and law enforcement. Hence, only these authorized parties can read the encrypted balances and transfers. “This prevents unauthorized parties from monitoring wallets, reverse-engineering investment strategies, or physically targeting high-value users,” the team says. To work as real digital cash, a stablecoin must hide your transactions and account balance from friends & foes while complying with the law. That doesn't exist today. But we've just built the first building block: a private stablecoin program on @aztecFND . https://t.co/rSkW3hiGyZ pic.twitter.com/979QjK4Mnq — Taurus (@taurus_hq) June 26, 2025 Moreover, the team has built the stablecoin contract atop the zero‑knowledge Layer-2 Aztec Network . According to Arnaud Schenk, Executive Director of the Aztec Network board, enforced transparency of public blockchains hampers the real-world adoption of stablecoins worldwide. “Practical adoption for payroll, intra-company transfers, or day-to-day payments simply can’t happen if every transaction remains visible to all and immutably inscribed on a widely available ledger,” Schenk says. Taurus’ novel stablecoin contract supports USDC’s core features. Notably, these include centralized, admin-controlled mint and burn, as well as the pause and unpause capabilities. This allows for transfers to be halted should the need arise. Other key features include address blacklisting to “enforce sanctions and other compliance needs,” and events logging for a verifiable audit trail. All this allows financial institutions to issue stablecoins in payment or treasury applications while ensuring privacy and regulatory observability, the announcement argues.

Taurus Makes “Major Step Forward for Stablecoins” The team notes that the private stablecoin contract complements their open-source private security token. Taurus launched this token in February 2025. The announcement describes it as a confidential token standard for debt and equity tokenization, which allows financial institutions to issue tokenized versions of financial instruments on public blockchains while maintaining privacy. This latest move “marks a major step forward for stablecoins,” said JP Aumasson, Chief Security Officer at Taurus. “We showed that it’s possible to protect the privacy and security of stablecoin users while retaining the features of industry-standard stablecoins. This addresses concerns that we’ve repeatedly heard from banks looking at issuing stablecoins, central banks, and regulators.” How do you ensure that a token transfer only proceeds after human approval?

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act requires issuers to fully back their stablecoins with US dollars, makes licensing dependent on the total market capitalization of their digital assets, provides safeguards for consumers (who would be paid first in the event of a bankruptcy), and tightens rules to prevent money laundering and terror financing. On Wednesday, Senator Cynthia Lummis urged US lawmakers to advance both the GENIUS Act and broader crypto market structure asap. “I’m not saying combine them, but they both need to pass this year,” she said.

As of June 26, 2025, XLM price trades around $0.238, down by 28% from mid-May following a descending channel. Despite the weak price action and falling XLM market cap, its TVL has grown inversely proportional. Even the derivatives data suggest rising investor confidence as XLM’s funding rate turns positive, and the weighted sentiment turning positive, clearly indicates something big is brewing in the XLM price. Recently, Scopuly, a stellar-based DeFi wallet, posted on its official X post that the time for a breakout has arrived and projects a target of $0.46. Keep reading to know more. On-Chain Metrics Signals A Pump Coming In XLM Price The rise in TVL in Stellar over time reflects the increase in the demand for the project and the changing dynamics of market participation. The total TVL of Stellar was $86.7 million as per Defilama, and the surge from 2024’s low of $7.2 million displays nearly 11x in just 4 months. Source: DeFiLlama Meanwhile, from 2025’s low, it has nearly doubled, which shows that investors’ trust is rising in the project. However, its price and market cap are on a decline in the entire H1 2025. The growth in TVL is exactly opposite to its market cap, and it seems a rise is pending for the XLM price. Source: Coinglass Moreover, another bullish sign for XLM has developed with its funding rates data turning positive. CoinGlass’s OI-Weighted Funding Rate data reflects that the traders expecting XLM to decrease are lower than those anticipating a price increase. Generally, a positive rate (longs pay shorts) reveals bullish sentiment, while a negative rate (shorts pay longs) indicates bearishness When funding rates have flipped from negative to positive and have remained positive, the odds of XLM price rising in the short term have jumped. This bullish sentiment is further supported by Santiments’ weighted sentiment, which has turned bullish when XLM price took support at a level based on the “FR volume profile” tool near $0.225. Clearly highlighting that the intensity of negative emotion is also relatively lower than positive emotions, as a result, it has spiked. Additionally, Dune analytics reveals that it has been utilized a lot lately, which could be seen by its active addresses that highlight that active addresses MoM is rising, where active users by May were 263.25K, while recurring addresses were 173.67K, and new addresses were 89.59K. Can XLM Price Break Bearish Structure? The XLM price has been trapped in a falling channel, which has drained investor morale. However, it has reached a critical level where it previously rallied in Q4 2024. Rising on-chain data and XLM’s ability to hold multi-month support suggest a potential price rally is on the horizon. Currently, XLM is trading near the channel’s upper border for nearly 45 days, indicating that the pattern is strongly followed and its breach will trigger a breakout. If the upper border is breached, XLM could retest the $0.40 mark in the short term. Conversely, if support is lost, the price may decline to the $0.15 level.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 13:49:05

When trust is broken, the consequences can be devastating, not just for individual investors but for the entire ecosystem. Recently, a significant legal development in South Korea has sent a clear message across the global digital asset landscape. The Korea Supreme Court has delivered a powerful verdict, upholding a substantial prison sentence in a case that directly impacted thousands of crypto users. This ruling isn’t just about one individual; it’s a pivotal moment for accountability in the volatile crypto market, particularly concerning the infamous Haru Invest and Delio incidents. What Does the Korea Supreme Court’s Decision Mean? In a move that underscores South Korea’s commitment to tackling financial malfeasance in the digital realm, the Korea Supreme Court has affirmed a 10-year prison sentence for Mr. Bang, a key shareholder of B&S Holdings. This decision is not merely a formality; it represents the highest court’s definitive stance on the severe repercussions of crypto-related fraud. Mr. Bang was found guilty of orchestrating a scheme that led to the devastating suspension of withdrawals at Haru Invest, a prominent digital asset management platform, and the subsequent collapse of crypto lender Delio. This final judgment from the Supreme Court closes a significant chapter in a saga that left countless investors in distress, highlighting the judiciary’s resolve to bring justice to victims of large-scale financial crimes within the cryptocurrency space. The ruling sends a strong signal to anyone operating within the crypto industry: fraudulent activities will be met with severe penalties. It also provides a measure of closure for those affected by the Haru Invest and Delio incidents, reinforcing the idea that even in the complex world of digital assets, legal frameworks are evolving to protect consumers. Unpacking the Haru Invest Delio Collapse: How Did We Get Here? The story of the Haru Invest Delio collapse is a complex web of interconnected failures and alleged deceptions that began to unravel in the wake of the FTX exchange’s dramatic downfall in November 2022. Haru Invest positioned itself as a leading digital asset management platform, promising attractive yields on crypto deposits through sophisticated trading strategies. Delio, on the other hand, operated as a crypto lending platform, facilitating loans against digital assets. The two entities became intertwined through their dealings with B&S Holdings, a third-party service provider. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how events unfolded: Promises of High Yields: Both Haru Invest and Delio attracted users by offering competitive interest rates on deposited cryptocurrencies, often through strategies like arbitrage and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Reliance on Third Parties: A critical vulnerability emerged from their reliance on external partners, including B&S Holdings, to manage or deploy client funds. Mr. Bang, as a major shareholder of B&S Holdings, allegedly played a central role in diverting funds. FTX Contagion: The implosion of FTX created a ripple effect across the crypto market, exposing liquidity issues and questionable practices at various firms. While not directly linked to FTX’s internal fraud, the market downturn and increased scrutiny following FTX’s collapse put immense pressure on Haru Invest and Delio. Withdrawal Suspensions: In June 2023, both Haru Invest and Delio abruptly suspended withdrawals, citing issues with a service partner (later identified as B&S Holdings). This move immediately triggered panic among users, who feared losing their investments. Bankruptcy and Investigations: Delio subsequently filed for bankruptcy, and both platforms faced intense scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement, leading to the charges against Mr. Bang and others. The collapse highlighted the inherent risks of centralized crypto platforms, particularly those that offer high yields without full transparency on their underlying strategies and risk management. The Anatomy of a Crypto Fraud Sentence: What Was the Crime? The crypto fraud sentence handed down to Mr. Bang is directly tied to the alleged defrauding of Haru Invest and Traum Infotech, a blockchain-based trading system developer. The core of the accusation revolves around the misappropriation of approximately 60 billion won, equivalent to about $44.22 million. This significant sum was allegedly siphoned off following the market turmoil ignited by the FTX collapse. While the exact modus operandi of the fraud has not been fully detailed in public reports, it typically involves a breach of trust where funds entrusted to a platform or service provider are diverted for unauthorized purposes. In this case, Mr. Bang, through his position at B&S Holdings, was accused of mismanaging or outright stealing client assets that were supposed to be invested or managed by Haru Invest and Traum Infotech. This type of fraud erodes confidence in the entire digital asset ecosystem, making regulatory oversight and stringent due diligence by investors even more critical. The severity of the 10-year sentence reflects the significant financial damage inflicted upon victims and the broader impact on the credibility of the crypto industry. It underscores that even in a nascent and rapidly evolving sector, established laws against fraud and embezzlement apply with full force. Navigating the Future of the Digital Asset Management Platform Landscape The repercussions of the Haru Invest and Delio collapses extend far beyond the immediate victims, casting a long shadow over the entire digital asset management platform sector. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of transparency, robust risk management, and regulatory compliance for any entity handling client funds in the crypto space. For platforms that promise high returns, the pressure to deliver can sometimes lead to taking excessive risks or, in the worst cases, engaging in fraudulent activities. What lessons can the industry take from this? Enhanced Due Diligence: Platforms must conduct rigorous due diligence on their partners, ensuring they are trustworthy and financially sound. Transparent Operations: Users demand greater transparency regarding how their funds are managed, where they are invested, and the risks involved. Proof-of-reserves audits and clear reporting are becoming essential. Robust Security Measures: Beyond financial security, platforms must invest heavily in cybersecurity to protect against hacks and unauthorized access to funds. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to existing and emerging financial regulations is no longer optional but a necessity for long-term viability and trust. For investors, this case highlights the critical need to research any platform thoroughly before committing funds. If something sounds too good to be true, it very likely is. Diversification and avoiding over-reliance on a single platform are also key strategies for mitigating risk. Strengthening South Korea Crypto Regulation and Investor Protection The South Korea crypto regulation landscape has been steadily evolving, and cases like the Haru Invest and Delio collapse only accelerate the pace of change. South Korea has historically been a significant hub for cryptocurrency trading and innovation, and its regulators have been keen to balance fostering innovation with safeguarding investors. This landmark ruling by the Supreme Court will undoubtedly embolden regulatory bodies to pursue stricter enforcement actions against illicit activities. It signals a clear intent to: Increase Oversight: Expect greater scrutiny of digital asset management platforms, crypto lenders, and exchanges, particularly concerning their internal controls, risk management, and third-party relationships. Develop Clearer Legal Frameworks: The case provides a precedent that can inform the development of more specific laws and guidelines for crypto-related financial services, closing loopholes that fraudsters might exploit. Enhance Investor Protection Mechanisms: Regulators may introduce new requirements for consumer protection, such as clearer disclosure rules, mandatory insurance, or compensation funds for victims of fraud. Foster International Cooperation: As crypto fraud often crosses borders, South Korea will likely continue to collaborate with international agencies to track down perpetrators and recover stolen assets. For investors in South Korea and globally, this means a potentially safer environment, but it also places a greater responsibility on them to stay informed about regulatory changes and to choose platforms that prioritize compliance and security. The message is clear: the era of unregulated ‘Wild West’ crypto operations is drawing to a close, at least in jurisdictions like South Korea that are committed to a more mature and secure digital asset market. Challenges and Key Takeaways The Haru Invest and Delio saga illustrates several critical challenges facing the crypto industry: Interconnected Risks: The collapse of one entity (FTX) can trigger a cascade of failures due to interconnectedness within the ecosystem. Lack of Transparency: Opacity in how funds are managed and invested remains a significant risk factor for centralized platforms. Regulatory Lag: Regulations often struggle to keep pace with rapid technological advancements, creating windows for illicit activities. Investor Vulnerability: The allure of high returns can sometimes override sound judgment, making investors susceptible to scams. Key Takeaways for Investors: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand the platform’s business model, team, and underlying technology. Assess Risk: Be skeptical of excessively high, guaranteed returns. Understand that all investments carry risk, and crypto is no exception. Diversify: Do not put all your funds into one platform or asset. Prioritize Security: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and industry news, especially regarding the platforms you use. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Beyond individual investor actions, the broader crypto community—developers, exchanges, and service providers—also has a role to play. Fostering a culture of accountability, building truly decentralized solutions where appropriate, and actively participating in regulatory discussions can help shape a more secure and trustworthy future for digital assets. Implementing industry best practices, such as regular third-party audits and transparent reporting, can significantly mitigate risks and restore public confidence. A Defining Moment for Crypto Accountability The Korea Supreme Court ‘s decision to uphold a 10-year prison sentence for Mr. Bang in the Haru Invest and Delio fraud case marks a defining moment for accountability in the global cryptocurrency market. It sends an unequivocal message that those who exploit the trust of investors and engage in fraudulent activities will face severe consequences, regardless of the complexity of the digital assets involved. This ruling not only brings a measure of justice to the victims of this particular incident but also sets a significant precedent for how financial crimes in the crypto space will be prosecuted. As the digital asset landscape continues to mature, such decisive legal actions are crucial for building a more secure, transparent, and trustworthy ecosystem for all participants. It reinforces the notion that while innovation is vital, it must always be balanced with robust investor protection and unwavering legal enforcement.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $107,115 on Thursday, June 25, up 8.65% from its lowest point this week. A potential catalyst for Bitcoin is the ongoing decline in the U.S. dollar index (DXY), as Donald Trump considers candidates for the next Federal Reserve Chair. The DXY, which measures the dollar’s performance against a basket of currencies, plunged to 96.98—its lowest level since 2022. The index has slumped nearly 12% from its highest level this year, and Morgan Stanley analysts anticipate another 9% crash . This pullback followed Trump’s brokered a truce between Israel and Iran , which ended 12 days of hostilities. It also came after reports indicated Trump is weighing options for replacing Jerome Powell as Fed Chair in 2026, when Powell’s term ends. Leading candidates include Scott Bessent, Kevin Hassett, and Kevin Warsh. You might also like: MSTR stock vs. MSTY stock: Which offers better returns in a Bitcoin bull run? Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell, urging him to cut interest rates. In a statement this week, Powell reiterated the Federal Reserve’s wait-and-see stance. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin echoed that sentiment on Thursday, stating : “There is little upside in heading too quickly in any one direction. Given the strength in today’s economy, we have time to track developments patiently and allow the visibility to improve.” The dollar’s weakness has deepened as investors anticipate that a new Fed Chair could move quickly on interest rate cuts. In a note on Wednesday, Morgan Stanley projected the Fed would implement seven rate cuts in 2026, representing an outlook that could benefit Bitcoin and other risk assets. Bitcoin price technicals signal a breakout is coming BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Bitcoin price has remained above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average, which has provided substantial support since April. Bitcoin has formed a bullish flag pattern, consisting of a vertical line and a descending channel. This channel is part of the handle in a broader cup-and-handle formation. The cup has a depth of about 31%, and projecting the same distance from the upper edge of the handle yields a target price of $143,780. A drop below the 200-day moving average at $94,000 would invalidate the bullish thesis.

For crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, the news from this publicly listed Japanese firm is nothing short of electrifying: Metaplanet has significantly boosted its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves, solidifying its position as a major player in the institutional Bitcoin landscape. What’s Driving Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Strategy? Metaplanet, a name increasingly synonymous with strategic digital asset accumulation, recently announced on X (formerly Twitter) a substantial acquisition of an additional 1,234 BTC. This latest move brings their total Bitcoin treasury to an impressive 12,345 BTC. This isn’t just a simple purchase; it’s a clear statement of intent, echoing the pioneering moves made by companies like MicroStrategy in the West. But what exactly is propelling this Japanese firm’s audacious Bitcoin investment strategy? Inflationary Pressures: Many corporations are seeking robust hedges against persistent inflation in traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin, with its finite supply, presents a compelling alternative. Long-Term Value Proposition: Metaplanet likely views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, similar to digital gold, capable of appreciating significantly over time. Corporate Treasury Diversification: Diversifying treasury assets beyond traditional instruments like cash and bonds can reduce risk and potentially enhance returns. Non-Sovereign Asset: Bitcoin offers a decentralized, censorship-resistant asset, free from the direct control of any single government or financial institution. How Does Japan Bitcoin Adoption Compare Globally? While the United States has seen significant institutional interest in Bitcoin, particularly with the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Japan has its own distinct regulatory landscape. Historically, Japan has been a leader in cryptocurrency regulation, recognizing Bitcoin as legal property as early as 2017. However, institutional adoption, especially among publicly traded companies, has been slower to materialize compared to some Western counterparts. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation therefore marks a significant milestone, potentially paving the way for broader crypto adoption within the nation’s corporate sector. Consider the contrasting approaches: Region Key Institutional Drivers Pace of Corporate Adoption United States Spot Bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy’s pioneering strategy, strong venture capital interest. High, with increasing public company engagement. Japan Early regulatory clarity, but more cautious corporate entry until recently. Growing, with Metaplanet leading the charge for publicly listed firms. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation The consistent accumulation of Bitcoin by publicly traded entities like Metaplanet sends a powerful signal to the global financial markets. This isn’t speculative trading; it’s a deliberate long-term treasury strategy. Such substantial moves by institutional Bitcoin holders lend immense credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. It demonstrates a growing confidence among sophisticated investors that Bitcoin is here to stay, not just as a niche digital currency but as a significant store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. Key benefits of this trend include: Increased Market Legitimacy: Corporate adoption helps Bitcoin shed its speculative image and mature into a recognized asset class. Potential for Price Stability: Large, long-term holdings by institutions can reduce volatility and provide a more stable demand floor. Encourages Broader Adoption: As more companies succeed with Bitcoin treasury strategies, others are likely to follow suit, creating a positive feedback loop. Validation as “Digital Gold”: Reinforces Bitcoin’s narrative as a robust alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. What Does This Mean for Future Crypto Adoption and BTC Investment ? Metaplanet’s bold move could be a catalyst, sparking a domino effect across the corporate world, particularly in Asia. As more companies witness the successful integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets, the hesitancy surrounding BTC investment may dissipate. This progressive approach by a Japanese firm underscores a growing global trend: Bitcoin is transitioning from a fringe asset to a foundational component of modern financial strategy. It suggests a future where holding digital assets becomes as commonplace as holding traditional bonds or equities for corporate treasuries. Actionable insights for readers: Monitor Corporate Announcements: Keep an eye on other publicly traded companies, especially in Asia, for similar announcements regarding Bitcoin acquisitions. Understand the Shifting Narrative: Recognize that Bitcoin’s primary narrative is evolving from purely retail speculation to serious institutional allocation and treasury management. Consider Long-Term Implications: The increasing demand from institutions, coupled with Bitcoin’s fixed supply, has significant long-term implications for its value proposition. Metaplanet’s strategic decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 12,345 BTC is more than just a news headline; it’s a powerful testament to the evolving perception of digital assets in the global financial landscape. As a publicly listed Japanese firm, their commitment highlights Bitcoin’s growing role as a vital component of corporate treasury management and a hedge against economic volatility. This bold step by Metaplanet not only reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy but also sets a compelling precedent for other institutions considering their foray into the world of cryptocurrency. The future of finance is clearly embracing digital assets, and companies like Metaplanet are leading the charge.

Tokenized real-world assets are one of the biggest trends in crypto this year. On Thursday, RedStone published a report on the state of on-chain finance in the first half of 2025. The report notes that RWAs have become one of the fastest-growing categories. RWAs reached an estimated value of more than $24 billion in June 2025, up from $5 to $10 billion in 2022. This growth was second only to stablecoins, which have seen even stronger performance during the same period. According to Marcin Kaźmierczak, Co-founder of RedStone, the primary driver behind this RWA growth is private credit. This refers to loans made outside the traditional banking system, often issued directly to private companies. “Private credit has emerged as the foundation for tokenization’s real-world impact. What we’re seeing now is institutional finance actively moving into blockchain—not just exploring, but deploying capital in meaningful ways and innovating with RWA looping strategies,” Marcin Kaźmierczak, RedStone.

This meant lenders had to wait a long time to realize a profit. Still, their high yields, typically 8% to 12%, made them worthwhile. With RWAs, traders can sell these loans, giving them significantly more flexibility. In addition, these assets can be packaged into institutional-grade private credit funds, such as Apollo’s ACRED, making private credit more accessible to a broader range of investors.

The guideline will prevent young content creators, who are mostly gaming streamers beginning their digital careers in early adolescence, from broadcasting live without adult supervision. According to a help center post published on Wednesday, the policy update dictates that “creators will need to be 16 or older to be able to livestream on YouTube.” Those aged 13 to 15 will only be permitted to live stream if they are “visibly accompanied by an adult.” “ Livestreams featuring 13–15-year-olds who are not visibly accompanied by an adult may have their live chat disabled and the account may temporarily lose access to live chat or other features, ” the platform told content creators. Live streaming restriction: Minors must stream with adults In its statement, YouTube said it now requires underage users to comply with the new age rules by streaming through an adult-managed account, or at least have an adult present during the livestream, if they are using their own accounts. “ If you’re under 16 and would like to participate in a livestream from an account owned by an adult, that adult must be visibly present in the livestream . You can give the adult access to your channel as an editor, manager or owner ,” YouTube added. “ This allows the adult to start the livestream from your account while still reaching your audience through your own channe l.” In tandem with the rule change, Google reiterated its safety guidelines for minors engaging with the platform’s live features. Children and teenagers are urged not to disclose personal information such as full name, age, address, or school. “ Be careful about what’s in the background of your stream ,” it advised. “ Don’t show anything that could give away where you are, like your house number or a street sign outside your window. ” The company also asked users to appoint adults or guardians as moderators for chat interactions. “ Consider designating a trusted adult as a moderator to help filter out unwanted chats . If anything like that happens, stop your stream immediately and tell a trusted adult straight away ,” the help page read. Australia, France pressure YouTube into policy change Just two days before the new policy was announced, Australian lawmakers had started congressional discussions on whether YouTube should be added to the country’s incoming under-16 social media ban. The 2024 legislation prevents anyone under the age of 16 from registering on platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and X. YouTube was excluded from the list because of its purported role in education and child-friendly entertainment. Last Tuesday, Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, called for that exemption to include YouTube. In a letter to the government this month, Inman Grant cited a survey to make her case that YouTube is where children are likely to experience the most online harm. According to the research, of the 2,600 children aged 10 to 16 surveyed by the regulator, nearly 40% reported encountering harmful content on the platform. Speaking in Canberra on June 24, Grant said YouTube’s algorithms were partly to blame. “ These algorithms drive users down rabbit holes that they are powerless to fight against ,” she said, bashing the company for reportedly downsizing its online safety teams. Responding to the queries, YouTube-owner Google dismissed the commissioner’s findings, stating that the data “ignored” evidence from teachers and parents supporting the platform’s access for young users.

With cutting-edge technology and a growing list of institutional partnerships, IOTA is delivering real-world results that promise to reshape how international commerce operates. As highlighted by X Finance Bull, the network is slashing transaction costs by up to 80%, enabling cross-border transactions to settle in seconds, and receiving backing from major global organizations like the World Economic Forum and the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. A New Standard in Trade Digitization IOTA’s approach begins with fully digitizing trade data. Using its feeless, scalable distributed ledger, known as the Tangle, IOTA eliminates the inefficiencies of traditional paper-based systems. This leads to a 50% reduction in the global trade finance gap, a 35% improvement in small and medium enterprise (SME) efficiency, and a dramatic decrease in cross-border processing times, from weeks to just days. These gains come from automating verification processes and enabling real-time, tamper-proof data exchange between all parties in a supply chain. Instant, Secure Transactions Built for speed and security, IOTA’s core technology underpins both its Mainnet and Digital Identity infrastructure. Every transaction on the network is verified cryptographically and executed almost instantly, without fees. By replacing manual document verification with digital certificates that are authenticated in real time, IOTA removes costly delays and streamlines operations across borders. This not only boosts efficiency but also significantly reduces the risk of fraud and error. Document Tokenization for Data Sovereignty IOTA also enables the tokenization of electronic documents using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These serve as verified digital identities, giving users full control over access to their sensitive trade documents. Certificates of origin, bills of lading, and compliance records can now be issued, stored, and transferred securely, ensuring transparency, auditability, and data sovereignty throughout the trade lifecycle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Backed by Global Institutions What truly distinguishes IOTA is the strength of its strategic partnerships. The project’s Trade and Logistics Information Network (TWIN) initiative customizes its open-source tools for real-world government and logistics applications. The TWIN Consortium includes prominent global institutions such as the World Economic Forum, Trademark Africa, the Tony Blair Institute, the Institute of Export and International Trade, and the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation. Together, they are piloting and deploying IOTA’s technology in real-world trade corridors—moving beyond theory into production-level implementation. These collaborations are evidence that IOTA’s model is not just viable but essential for the future of global trade. The Future Is Already Here X Finance Bull’s statement that “IOTA is rewriting global trade” is no exaggeration. The technology is live, the partnerships are in place, and the results are measurable. IOTA is not waiting for the future, it’s building it now. For those still overlooking its progress, the message is clear: while old systems strain under the weight of inefficiency, IOTA is quietly laying the rails of a faster, smarter, and more inclusive global trade system.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57%, or over 200 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 gained 0.38%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.23% at the open, as investors bet on increased odds of interest-rate cuts by the U.S. central bank. Trump close to naming Fed chair pick Much of the market enthusiasm stems from U.S. President Donald Trump , who has increased his criticism of Powell amid the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady in recent months. Powell testified before lawmakers in Washington this week, and reports following his comments suggest Trump is getting closer to selecting a new Fed Chair. Trump is reportedly down to four candidates for Powell’s replacement, and The Wall Street Journal noted the president could name his pick as soon as this summer. Powell’s current term is scheduled to end in May 2026. Despite this, stocks are up as markets react to Trump’s move.

Easing tensions in the Middle East further contributed to the market’s buoyant mood. On the economic front, data released Thursday showed the U.S. economy shrank by 0.5% in Q1. Initial jobless claims for the past week came in at 236,000, below the expected 244,000.

Bithumb, a major player among South Korean crypto exchanges, has officially revealed its plans to introduce the SAHARA/KRW spot trading pair. This isn’t just another listing; it represents a significant milestone for Sahara AI, bringing its native token, SAHARA, into the mainstream of one of the world’s most active crypto markets. Investors are already looking forward to the opportunities this new crypto spot trading option will present. Understanding Sahara AI: What is the SAHARA Token? Before diving into the specifics of the Bithumb listing , it’s crucial to understand the innovation behind the SAHARA token itself. Sahara AI is at the forefront of developing decentralized artificial intelligence solutions, aiming to create a more secure, private, and equitable AI ecosystem. In an era where data privacy and AI ethics are paramount, Sahara AI seeks to empower users with control over their data and AI models. Decentralized AI: Sahara AI leverages blockchain technology to build decentralized AI networks, moving away from centralized control. Data Privacy: A core tenet of Sahara AI is ensuring user data remains private and secure, even when used for AI training. Token Utility: The SAHARA token is the native utility token of the Sahara AI ecosystem. It’s used for various purposes, including governance, staking, and accessing premium AI services within the platform. Its utility underpins its value, making the upcoming SAHARA/KRW trading pair all the more interesting for those looking to participate in the AI economy. This focus on AI, a rapidly expanding sector, positions SAHARA as a token with significant long-term potential, especially as more users and developers seek decentralized alternatives for AI development and deployment. Bithumb’s Prominence: A Leading South Korean Crypto Exchange Bithumb is not just any exchange; it stands as one of the largest and most influential South Korean crypto exchanges . Its decision to list SAHARA carries substantial weight, immediately granting the token immense exposure to a vast and highly engaged investor base. Bithumb’s robust infrastructure, high liquidity, and stringent listing process make it a preferred platform for many traders in the region. The impact of a listing on an exchange of Bithumb’s caliber can be transformative for a token. It provides: Increased Liquidity: More traders mean more buying and selling activity, leading to healthier liquidity for the SAHARA token. Enhanced Visibility: Being listed on Bithumb puts SAHARA in front of millions of potential investors who might not have been aware of the project previously. Credibility and Trust: A listing on a regulated and reputable exchange like Bithumb often signals a level of legitimacy and security to the broader market. For projects like Sahara AI, securing a Bithumb listing is a critical step towards global adoption and market penetration, especially within the dynamic Asian crypto landscape. The Significance of the SAHARA/KRW Trading Pair The announcement specifies the listing of a SAHARA/KRW trading pair , which is particularly vital for the South Korean market. KRW, the Korean Won, is the national currency of South Korea, and direct trading pairs against local fiat currencies are highly sought after by domestic investors. This eliminates the need for multiple conversions, simplifying the trading process and often reducing transaction fees. Why is a direct KRW pair so important? Ease of Access: Korean investors can directly deposit KRW and purchase SAHARA without first converting their fiat into stablecoins like USDT or BTC. Reduced Friction: A seamless on-ramp and off-ramp experience encourages more participation from retail and institutional investors alike. Market Depth: Direct fiat pairs often attract more significant trading volumes, contributing to better price discovery and stability for the token. The availability of the SAHARA/KRW trading pair is a clear indicator of Bithumb’s commitment to serving its local user base while also integrating innovative global projects like Sahara AI into its platform. Navigating Crypto Spot Trading: What Investors Need to Know For those new to the concept, crypto spot trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery. Unlike futures or options, spot trading deals with the actual asset. When Bithumb lists the SAHARA/KRW pair, traders will be able to buy SAHARA directly with their Korean Won or sell SAHARA for KRW at the current market price. If you’re considering trading SAHARA on Bithumb, here are some actionable insights: Mark Your Calendar: The listing is set for June 26 at 12:30 UTC. Be aware of your local time zone conversion. Account Setup: Ensure your Bithumb account is fully verified and funded with KRW well in advance of the listing time. Research: Beyond the initial announcement, delve deeper into Sahara AI’s whitepaper, roadmap, and community to understand its fundamentals. Risk Management: Crypto markets are volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to manage potential downsides. The launch of this new pair offers a fresh opportunity for diversification, especially for those interested in the burgeoning AI crypto sector. Market Outlook: What Does This Listing Mean for SAHARA and AI Crypto? The addition of SAHARA to Bithumb’s offerings, particularly with a direct KRW pair, is expected to generate significant buzz. For the Sahara AI token , this could translate into increased demand, higher trading volumes, and potentially a positive price movement as more investors gain access and confidence in the project. More broadly, this listing reinforces the growing trend of artificial intelligence intersecting with blockchain technology. As AI continues to evolve, the need for decentralized, transparent, and private AI solutions will only grow. Projects like Sahara AI, gaining traction on major exchanges, validate this emerging narrative within the crypto space. The South Korean market, known for its tech-savviness and high crypto adoption rates, is an ideal proving ground for such innovative tokens. Conclusion: A New Horizon for SAHARA on Bithumb The upcoming Bithumb listing of the SAHARA/KRW spot trading pair on June 26 marks a pivotal moment for Sahara AI and its community. It signifies increased accessibility, enhanced liquidity, and a stronger foothold in one of the world’s most dynamic cryptocurrency markets. For investors, this provides a compelling new avenue for crypto spot trading , particularly for those looking to diversify into the promising AI sector. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, Bithumb’s commitment to bringing innovative projects like Sahara AI to its users reinforces its position as a leading South Korean crypto exchange , paving the way for future growth and adoption of the SAHARA/KRW trading pair .

But I will not cancel the court’s orders unless the legal standards are truly met.” Judge Torres denies joint motion.

46826987,https://cryptonews.com/?p=375324,1750947155,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/46826987.jpeg,EU Stablecoin Interchangeability Under MiCA—What’s Next?,https://cryptonews.com/news/eu-stablecoin-interchangeability-under-mica-whats-next/,"The European Commission is preparing to issue new guidance clarifying how stablecoins are treated under the EU’s crypto regulation framework, known as MiCA. The update is expected in the coming days, as pressure builds for clearer rules on cross-border stablecoin use. At the core of the guidance is a rule that would allow stablecoins issued by the same company to be treated as interchangeable, regardless of whether the tokens were minted inside or outside the EU. This would apply only if the issuing company holds a license to operate under MiCA within the EU. Commission Prepares Stablecoin Clarification After Ethena Exit Highlights Gaps According to a report from Reuters, the commission intends to formally clarify this in response to mounting industry uncertainty. One specific issue has been the lack of clarity around whether tokens issued in different jurisdictions by the same company can be used interchangeably, also referred to as “fungibility.” According to Reuters, the European Commission will issue guidance clarifying that stablecoins issued by EU-licensed entities can be treated as interchangeable with those issued by their non-EU affiliates, under the MiCA framework. The move responds to a query from French… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 25, 2025 The guidance comes as the European crypto sector adjusts to MiCA, which came into effect in December 2024. Under the law , stablecoins classified as e-money tokens (EMTs) must be backed by reserves held mostly in EU-based banks and issued only by licensed firms. The Commission’s position follows a March incident involving Ethena, a stablecoin issuer that was denied a MiCA license in Germany and subsequently exited the EU market. The Commission is now expected to confirm that such companies could treat their tokens as fungible across jurisdictions, as long as the EU-licensed entity is involved. Not everyone agrees with the approach. The European Central Bank has voiced concern, warning that allowing this type of interchangeability could create stress in the EU’s financial system. The ECB argued that EU-held reserves could be used to meet redemption requests from non-EU holders, a scenario that could “risk undermining EU strategic autonomy.” Despite that, a European Commission spokesperson said the risks of such a scenario were low. “A run on a well-governed and fully collateralized stablecoin is very unlikely,” the spokesperson said. The Commission also said that non-EU holders of such jointly issued stablecoins would have to direct their redemption requests to the non-EU entity that issued the token. To prevent mismatches between reserves and redemptions, the Commission plans to require stablecoin issuers to introduce re-balancing mechanisms. These would ensure that the reserves held in the EU match the amount of tokens circulating within the region. This clarification follows a request from France’s banking regulator in April, which asked the Commission whether identical tokens issued by separate arms of the same company, one licensed in the EU and the other abroad, could be treated as fungible. The ECB remains cautious. In internal communications, the central bank warned that shared reserves could be drained under financial stress. It also emphasized that redemption flows should be kept separate to avoid regulatory loopholes. Still, the Commission maintains that clear separation between EU and non-EU redemption channels, combined with robust reserve tracking, will reduce risk. A formal statement from the Commission is expected soon, as regulators seek to strike a balance between market innovation and financial safeguards under MiCA. MiCA Faces Early Resistance as Europe Weighs Stablecoin Future and Pushes Digital Euro As the EU rolls out its comprehensive MiCA framework, early responses to its stablecoin rules suggest a rocky start. While MiCA has provided clarity for crypto firms operating in Europe, its strict conditions, like requiring issuers to hold reserves in European banks and banning interest on tokens, have slowed stablecoin adoption. Tether, the world’s most-used stablecoin, has already opted out , while Circle, Crypto.com, and a handful of others have gained approval under the framework. However, adoption remains sluggish. Fabio Panetta, former ECB board member and now Governor of the Bank of Italy, noted that MiCA has not triggered any notable wave of stablecoin activity in Italy, one of the EU’s largest markets. On Friday, the Bank of Italy warned that growing crypto ties to traditional finance risk financial stability. #Italy #Cypto https://t.co/BZyYWt8f14 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 Instead, user interest is gravitating toward custodial and trading services rather than issuance. Panetta stressed that while MiCA improves transparency and oversight, regulation alone won’t neutralize systemic risks. He argued for accelerating the digital euro project, which could provide a more secure and central-bank-backed alternative to private stablecoins. At the same time, other major jurisdictions like the U.S. are racing to finalize their own stablecoin laws , adding urgency to Europe’s efforts to lead on global crypto standards. The stablecoin race is far from settled, and MiCA’s impact is still being tested.

While many assets remain in recovery mode, a handful of tokens are flashing signs of strength, resilience, and upside potential. From overlooked layer-2s to meme coins with cult followings, these five altcoins are emerging as strong candidates for a Q4 rebound. Arbitrum (ARB): Oversold and Ready for a Reversal? Source: tradingview Arbitrum (ARB) is trading in a compressed range between $0.25 and $0.33 after a 60% drop over the past six months — but that steep correction may offer a prime reentry point. With resistance just below $0.40, a breakout could open the path to $0.49 — offering over 50% upside. Although the RSI remains low, this oversold condition hints at a possible bullish reversal if momentum returns. As Ethereum layer-2s gain renewed traction, ARB could be a surprise performer heading into Q4. Raydium (RAY): Solana Ecosystem Gem Setting Up for a Rally Source: tradingview Raydium (RAY) has been under pressure, but with prices between $1.51 and $2.40 and support holding at $1.18, a late-year bounce could be forming. A move past the $2.96 resistance may spark a rally of over 44%. RAY remains a vital DeFi player in the Solana ecosystem, and as TVL across Solana surges, capital rotation into ecosystem-native assets like RAY is increasingly likely. With the RSI near neutral, Raydium may be coiling for a sharp upside move. Sui (SUI): A Comeback Candidate With Growth Infrastructure Source: tradingview SUI is navigating a consolidation phase between $2 and $3 after a recent cooling-off period. The next major resistance at $3.50 is within reach, and a push to $4.36 would mark a 45% climb from current levels. While the short-term RSI sits below 40, indicating cautious sentiment, SUI’s robust developer activity and expanding ecosystem give bulls plenty of long-term reasons to remain optimistic. Pepe Coin (PEPE): High-Risk, High-Reward Play With Meme Power Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is trading near the lower end of its range, between $0.0000076 and $0.0000108 — and with meme coin season never far away, PEPE could be due for a strong rebound. A rally back to its first resistance would require a move of over 70%, making it one of the highest-upside plays on the list. The RSI under 40 suggests bears have overextended, setting the stage for a speculative recovery if sentiment flips. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Oversold but Not Out — Setup for a Q4 Surge Source: tradingview SHIB is hovering between $0.00000966 and $0.00001193, deep in oversold territory based on both RSI and stochastic indicators. This could mark a bottoming zone, especially with strong community backing and exchange liquidity intact. If SHIB climbs past its immediate resistance at $0.00001326, a further 30% move to secondary resistance becomes possible. As meme coin narratives reemerge and ETF decisions energize the market, SHIB remains a key name to watch. Conclusion With market sentiment gradually improving, late 2025 could offer a second wind for battered but promising altcoins. Whether it’s infrastructure-driven names like SUI and ARB or high-volatility plays like PEPE and SHIB, each of these tokens presents a unique comeback story. For investors tracking rotation plays and rebound setups, these five coins may be well worth a spot on the watchlist as the year winds down.

The altcoin space remained mixed, with tokens flashing possible reversal as upside momentum fades. While most assets displayed eye-catching performances, Convex Finance and Biswap dominated daily trends for different reasons. Let’s check what influenced CVX and BSW as cryptocurrencies remained relatively calm over the past 24 hours. CVX slides as hackers drain Convex and Yearn’s subDAO CVX led the downside today as fraudsters accessed Resupply, a subDAO designed to complement Convex Finance and Yearn Finance blockchains. The incident resulted in the loss of assets worth around $9.5 million. CVX and YFI plunged hours after BlockSec confirmed the news on X as the incident reignited fears among DeFi enthusiasts. Convex’s native token saw a swift fall to $2.45 minutes after the announcement. It has extended the decline to trade at $2.40 during this publication, highlighting surging selling pressure. Chart by CoinMarketCap Short-term technical indicators reveal CVX’s deteriorated structure. The 4H Moving Average Convergence Divergence forms red histograms after a bearish crossover with the signal line. The Relative Strength Index suggests a weakening momentum as sellers resurfaced. Thus, Convex Finance’s coin will likely dip further before a possible rebound. Enthusiasts wait for a full post-mortem as the team analyses the magnitude of the attack. However, they guaranteed system stability after pausing the hack. The team stated : The affected contract has been identified, and the protocol continues to function as intended. A full post-mortem will be shared as soon as a complete analysis of the situation has been conducted. BSW jumps as Binance announces imminent delisting While today’s headlines screamed “sell,” Biswap’s native token defied the trends. The altcoin staged a remarkable rally after Binance announced it would remove BSW, alongside Stella (ALPHA), Komodo (KMD), LTO Network (LTO), and LeverFi (LEVER) on July 4.

However, BSW skyrocketed, possibly amid increased speculative trading as users capitalized on the existing liquidity. The exchange cited various factors behind its decision, including deteriorated developer activity, declining community engagement, liquidity issues, and team dedication concerns. Users should close their current BSW positions and withdraw their assets before specific deadlines. BSW jumped from the daily low of $0.017 to $0.03709 intraday peak, translating to a 118% upswing. Chart by CoinMarketCap It trades at $0.03318 after correcting from the 24-hour peak. BSW’s daily trading volume has increased by over 1,600%. Nevertheless, Biswap’s current structure demands caution. The altcoin exhibits significant volatility, making it susceptible to immense price swings. The altcoin might plunge further in the upcoming hours as hacking sentiments outweigh the prevailing bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continued to determine the market tone. Breaching the resistance zone at $109.7K could shift short-term trends to bullish, with $113,000 as the next target. Nevertheless, magnified bearish pressure at BTC’s current price could catalyze substantial declines to the support barrier at $102,000 – $103,000. A Bitcoin plunge would trigger considerable selling momentum in the altcoin space.

46830086,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=172531,1750951221,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46830086.jpeg,MicroStrategy: Crucial Implications of $40.3M Executive Stock Sales,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microstrategy-stock-sales-implications/,"BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy: Crucial Implications of $40.3M Executive Stock Sales The cryptocurrency world often buzzes with news of major corporate moves, and when it involves a titan like MicroStrategy , ears perk up. Recently, a significant development caught the attention of many: MicroStrategy executive stock sales totaling a staggering $40.3 million over the past 90 days. This news, involving top brass like the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, naturally sparks questions. Is this a sign of waning confidence in their bold Bitcoin strategy, or simply routine financial management? Let’s unpack the details and understand what these moves truly signify for the company and the broader crypto market. What’s Behind the MicroStrategy Executive Stock Sales? The headline itself can sound alarming: key executives offloading millions in company stock. However, a closer look at the specifics reveals a more nuanced picture. According to reports, the vast majority of these sales were conducted through pre-scheduled plans. This is a critical distinction. Executives often receive a significant portion of their compensation in the form of stock options or other equity-based awards. To realize the value of these awards, they must sell shares, and to avoid accusations of insider trading, these sales are typically set up well in advance through mechanisms like 10b5-1 plans. Who Sold? The sales involved high-ranking officials, including the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Their positions give them deep insight into the company’s operations and strategy. How Much? A cumulative total of $40.3 million worth of MSTR stock was sold over a 90-day period. How Were Sales Conducted? Primarily through pre-scheduled plans, often involving the exercise of stock options and the subsequent sale of the acquired shares. This is a common practice for executive compensation. Understanding the MSTR Stock Movement For investors tracking MSTR stock , any significant insider selling can be a cause for concern. However, in the context of pre-scheduled plans, these sales are often less about a lack of confidence in the company’s future and more about personal financial planning, diversification, or tax obligations. Executives, like anyone else, need to manage their personal finances, and converting equity compensation into liquid assets is a standard part of that process. It’s important to differentiate between opportunistic, reactive sales and planned, systematic divestments. Historically, MicroStrategy’s stock performance has been heavily correlated with the price of Bitcoin, given its aggressive strategy of accumulating the cryptocurrency. Therefore, any analysis of MSTR stock movement must always consider the underlying Bitcoin price action. While these executive sales are notable, they don’t necessarily indicate a shift in the company’s core strategy or a negative outlook from within, especially if they align with established compensation structures. The Broader Picture: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy cemented its reputation as a pioneer in corporate crypto adoption under the leadership of Michael Saylor. The company famously began accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020, positioning itself as the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. This strategy transformed the company’s identity and financial profile, making its stock a proxy for Bitcoin exposure for many traditional investors. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin has been unwavering, with continuous purchases even during market downturns. This aggressive accumulation strategy has defined MicroStrategy and made it a bellwether for institutional interest in Bitcoin. The recent executive stock sales, therefore, are being scrutinized not just for their financial implications but also for what they might signal about the long-term commitment to this unique corporate strategy. Implications for Corporate BTC Holdings and the Market The news of executive stock sales at a prominent firm like MicroStrategy inevitably raises questions about the broader trend of corporate BTC holdings . As more companies consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, the actions of early adopters like MicroStrategy are closely watched. If these sales were indicative of a strategic pivot or a loss of faith in Bitcoin, it could send ripples through the market. However, as established, the pre-scheduled nature of these sales suggests otherwise. The market generally reacts more strongly to unexpected insider selling, which can signal a lack of confidence. Planned sales, however, are often priced in or understood as part of regular executive compensation cycles. For the wider cryptocurrency market, the primary focus remains on MicroStrategy’s continued commitment to its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has not shown any signs of wavering despite these executive transactions. Is This a Red Flag or Business as Usual? When high-profile executives sell a substantial amount of company stock, it’s natural to wonder if it’s a “red flag.” Is it a sign that those closest to the company see trouble ahead? In this specific case, the consensus, supported by reports, points towards “business as usual” rather than a dire warning. The key differentiator is the pre-scheduled nature of the sales. Consider these points: Planned vs. Reactive: Sales executed through 10b5-1 plans are set up months, sometimes years, in advance. They are not a reaction to recent news or a sudden shift in company outlook. Diversification: Executives often have a large portion of their wealth tied up in company stock. Selling some shares is a prudent way to diversify their personal portfolios. Tax Obligations: Exercising stock options can trigger significant tax liabilities, necessitating the sale of some shares to cover these costs. While any insider selling warrants attention, the context is paramount. For MicroStrategy, a company whose identity is now deeply intertwined with Bitcoin, any perceived shift in strategy or confidence would be monumental. These executive sales, however, appear to be a routine aspect of compensation and financial management, not a signal of retreat from their bold Bitcoin conviction. Conclusion: Navigating Executive Moves in the Crypto Age The $40.3 million in executive stock sales at MicroStrategy might have initially raised eyebrows, but a deeper dive reveals a more standard explanation rooted in executive compensation and personal financial planning. Far from signaling a retreat from their pioneering corporate BTC holdings , these transactions appear to be largely pre-scheduled and part of routine financial management. For investors in MSTR stock and the broader Bitcoin market, the focus should remain on MicroStrategy’s stated strategy and continued actions regarding its significant digital asset portfolio. Understanding the nuances of insider trading regulations and executive compensation plans is crucial to interpreting such news accurately and avoiding unwarranted panic.

Bitcoin is down slightly in the past 24 hours against the dollar, following a period of intense upward price action that saw it reach an intraday high of $108,310 today. While the asset has shown bullish momentum, particularly from a scare over the weekend that saw it drop below $100,000, some still believe BTC remains a bubble that will burst soon.Bitcoin’s Demand Would Decline in Europe: SchiffParticularly, in a tweet today, staunch critic Peter Schiff made another claim about Bitcoin and its long-term trajectory, especially outside the United States. He argued that the demand for the pioneering cryptocurrency would continue to decline in Europe alongside the demand for the US dollar.For context, he cited that while Bitcoin is only 4% away from its all-time high of $112,000 attained on May 22, it is 14% away from its peak of €105,951 against the euro. Interestingly, BTC reached this peak on January 20, failing to find much joy against the euro as with the dollar, where it has hit two new ATHs since Inauguration Day.Meanwhile, Schiff claims that this disparity is due to Bitcoin's lesser popularity in Europe compared to the United States. While the European Union debuted a crypto market framework before the US, the latter still has more users and processes more crypto-related transactions than the former.Notably, the Bitcoin critic expects this trend to continue. He emphasized that the global de-dollarization trend is ongoing, and Bitcoin’s adoption is likely to decline in Europe alongside the dollar. “European demand for both will keep falling,” Schiff added. Mere Forex Difference?Meanwhile, Schiff’s comments drew the attention of the crypto community, with a reaction emphasizing that the acclaimed lack of interest is merely a forex disparity. Salomondrin highlighted that this was due to the US dollar index (DXY) dropping, which led to other cryptocurrencies appreciating against the USD.For perspective, Donald Trump’s tariff war led many institutions to lose interest in the US dollar as they sought alternative means of cross-border trading. The DXY crashed on this development and remains in a downtrend, dropping to 97 today.As a result, during the period, Bitcoin surged against the US dollar to new highs but failed to replicate a similar feat against the more stable euro. As a result, Schiff’s claim that the price difference suggested a lack of interest lacked logic.Moreover, Salomondrin stated that a similar price difference is seen in gold’s price against the dollar and the euro. Gold sells at $2,880 per ounce against the euro and $3,300 against the dollar; hence, Schiff’s comments are based on relative all-time highs rather than Bitcoin’s real value.Remarkably, top market watchers have tipped Bitcoin to continue growing both in price and adoption. Recall that Tim Draper tipped BTC to increase infinitely against the US dollar, with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong arguing that nations will hold more Bitcoin than gold in the future.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Peter Schiff News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-26 15:22:35

Now, it has caught the attention of OpenAI, one of the top AI firms in the United States. Even though DeepSeek grabbed headlines with its R1 model debut in January, Zhipu, together with other Chinese unicorn startups, armed with large language models, is at the core of Beijing’s ambition to challenge the US and wean itself off foreign tech. AI tigers are central in Beijing’s strategy OpenAI’s recent blog post points out that Zhipu is not just another domestic player. State media reports indicate the startup has netted over $1.4 billion from regional governments across China. The firm’s leadership supposedly meets often with Chinese Communist Party officials, Premier Li Qiang among them. That kind of political capital, OpenAI warns, might steer Zhipu into the heart of Beijing’s “Digital Silk Road” push, embedding Chinese AI frameworks in emerging markets before Western rivals can move in. “The goal is to lock Chinese systems and standards into emerging markets before US or European rivals can, while showcasing a ‘responsible, transparent and audit-ready’ Chinese AI alternative.” OpenAI. Beyond China’s borders, Zhipu has planted flags from London to Kuala Lumpur, and from Dubai to Singapore. Joint “innovation centers” now operate in places like Indonesia and Vietnam, further extending its reach. The startup has raised funds from several local governments, according to state media. “Zhipu AI leadership frequently engages with CCP officials, including Premier Li Qiang,” OpenAI claimed , pegging the value of state-backed investments in the startup at over $1.4 billion. The promise is to deliver a “responsible, transparent and audit-ready” AI stack, one that could lock governments into Chinese data standards and infrastructure. Recently the AI startup introduced its new agent known as AutoGLM Rumination, which it claimed is capable of deep research, web searches, and travel planning. Zhipu AI sets eyes across the globe despite the US ban This expansion sets up a direct challenge to OpenAI’s own global ambitions. In May, during a trip to the UAE, President Donald Trump championed a $200 billion slate of tech deals, including a Stargate UAE AI campus slated for 2026. That project brings together OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco in an attempt to cement US-led AI influence in the Middle East. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s Stargate initiative, a $500 billion private-sector fund launched with Abu Dhabi’s MGX and Japan’s SoftBank, was unveiled earlier this year. Back home, OpenAI also scored a $200 million contract with the US Defense Department and rolled out “OpenAI for Government,” targeting public-sector deployments across America. Not all of Zhipu’s collaborations are civilian. The startup has reportedly been tapped by China’s military to modernize forces through advanced AI, a connection that landed it on the US Commerce Department’s Entity List in January. OpenAI is also cautious about the Chinese AI startups and has explained that: “Because we’re fully aware of the power of this technology – hence our incessant red-teaming and other safety/security work.” “Because while we believe most will use AI for good, we’re not naive about some trying to misuse and abuse the technology. And because we know a world built on democratic AI isn’t a guarantee given China’s ambitions.” OpenAI. Despite that blacklisting, Zhipu presses on, it’s taking preliminary steps toward an IPO and has been pegged at a 20 billion yuan (roughly $2.78 billion) valuation by local press. Whether Zhipu AI ultimately rewrites the rules of global AI competition remains to be seen. What’s clear is that both sides, East and West, are marshalling resources , forging political ties, and pursuing partnerships to shape the next generation of intelligent systems.

In a move that has sent ripples across both the tech and cryptocurrency worlds, UK-based web development powerhouse, The Smarter Web Company , has announced a monumental funding round, securing approximately $56.45 million. But this isn’t just another funding story; it’s a profound declaration of intent. This substantial capital injection isn’t merely for expanding their core web development services; a significant portion is earmarked for an ambitious and long-term Bitcoin investment strategy . With a current holding of over 543 BTC and a commitment to acquiring more over the next decade, The Smarter Web Company is setting a compelling precedent for corporate crypto adoption , signaling a new era where digital assets become a cornerstone of corporate treasury management. Unpacking the Funding Success: A Boost for Web Development Funding The announcement from The Smarter Web Company details a highly successful accelerated bookbuild and subscription, drawing in a diverse group of institutional and qualified investors. This fundraising method, known for its efficiency, allowed the company to swiftly raise £41.2 million, translating to roughly $56.45 million at the time of the announcement. This significant influx of capital underscores robust investor confidence not only in The Smarter Web Company’s established expertise in web development but also in its innovative financial foresight. What does this mean for the broader web development sector? This substantial web development funding highlights a continued appetite among investors for companies that are not only delivering cutting-edge digital solutions but are also adapting to the evolving financial landscape. It suggests that firms integrating advanced technologies with shrewd financial planning, particularly in the realm of digital assets, are increasingly attractive. For The Smarter Web Company, this funding provides the necessary leverage to: Accelerate product development and innovation in web technologies. Expand market reach and acquire new talent. Strengthen its balance sheet and operational capabilities. Execute its bold Bitcoin investment strategy with greater conviction. The success of this funding round is a testament to the company’s strong fundamentals and its ability to articulate a clear vision for growth, both within its traditional business and its progressive approach to asset management. Why a Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy is Key for The Smarter Web Company In a world grappling with economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, companies are increasingly seeking alternative asset classes to preserve and grow their capital. For The Smarter Web Company, Bitcoin has emerged as the asset of choice for its long-term treasury management. Their commitment to purchasing Bitcoin over the next decade, building on their existing holding of more than 543 BTC, is a clear indication of a strategic and long-term conviction in the digital gold narrative. But why Bitcoin? Several factors likely underpin this audacious Bitcoin investment strategy : Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a deflationary asset, offering a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Often referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets, providing a store of value in the digital age. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, attracting investors looking for substantial capital appreciation. Transparency and Decentralization: The transparent and decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain appeals to companies seeking alternatives to traditional, centralized financial systems. Innovation Alignment: For a web development firm, investing in a leading decentralized technology like Bitcoin aligns with their ethos of innovation and embracing the future of the internet. This proactive approach to asset management positions The Smarter Web Company not just as a tech innovator, but also as a pioneer in modern corporate finance, adapting to a rapidly changing global economy. It’s a strategic move that could inspire many other companies to reconsider their treasury strategies. The Growing Trend: Corporate Crypto Adoption Takes Center Stage The Smarter Web Company’s move is not an isolated incident but rather part of a burgeoning global trend of corporate crypto adoption . While early adopters like MicroStrategy paved the way, an increasing number of publicly traded and private companies are now allocating a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This shift signifies a growing recognition of digital assets as legitimate, long-term components of a diversified corporate portfolio. What drives this wave of corporate interest in cryptocurrencies? Driver Explanation Macroeconomic Concerns Rising inflation, quantitative easing, and low-interest rates in traditional banking systems push companies to seek alternative stores of value. Technological Advancement Understanding of blockchain technology and digital assets is maturing, leading to greater confidence in their underlying value. Competitive Edge Companies that embrace digital assets are often seen as forward-thinking and innovative, attracting talent and customers. Investor Demand A growing segment of investors expects companies to explore new avenues for value creation, including digital assets. While the benefits are clear, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, price volatility, and security concerns remain. However, companies like The Smarter Web Company are demonstrating that with careful planning and a long-term outlook, these challenges can be navigated. Their commitment to a decade-long Bitcoin accumulation plan highlights a belief in the fundamental strength and future potential of the asset, moving beyond short-term speculative plays. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Holdings ? The significant funding raised by The Smarter Web Company, coupled with its explicit Bitcoin strategy, provides a fascinating case study for the broader trend of institutional crypto holdings . When institutional investors commit capital to a company that openly embraces Bitcoin as a treasury asset, it sends a powerful signal to the market. It suggests a growing acceptance and even demand for exposure to digital assets, albeit indirectly, through traditional equity investments. This scenario creates a unique investment proposition: Indirect Crypto Exposure: Investors who might be hesitant to directly purchase cryptocurrencies can gain exposure through equity in companies with significant crypto holdings. Validation of Strategy: The success of the funding round validates the corporate Bitcoin strategy, potentially encouraging other institutional players to consider similar approaches. Market Maturation: As more traditional companies integrate crypto into their operations and balance sheets, it contributes to the overall maturation and legitimization of the cryptocurrency market. New Investment Vehicles: This trend could pave the way for new financial products and investment vehicles designed to track companies with substantial digital asset reserves. The Smarter Web Company’s move is a clear indicator that institutional crypto holdings are no longer a niche concept but are becoming an integral part of diversified investment portfolios and corporate strategies. It marks a crucial step in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. The Road Ahead for The Smarter Web Company : A Decade of Bitcoin With $56.45 million in fresh capital and a clear commitment to accumulating Bitcoin for the next ten years, The Smarter Web Company is charting an ambitious course. This dual strategy – excelling in web development while building a substantial Bitcoin treasury – positions them uniquely in the market. Their journey will be closely watched by industry analysts, investors, and other corporations contemplating similar moves. Actionable insights for companies considering a similar path, inspired by The Smarter Web Company’s bold steps: Define a Clear Strategy: Understand your “why” for crypto adoption. Is it an inflation hedge, a growth asset, or an innovation play? Start Small and Scale: You don’t need to go all-in immediately. A phased approach allows for learning and adaptation. Prioritize Security: Implement robust security measures for storing digital assets, potentially using multi-signature wallets and cold storage solutions. Understand Regulatory Landscape: Stay informed about evolving regulations in your jurisdiction regarding corporate crypto holdings. Communicate Transparently: Clearly articulate your strategy to investors, employees, and the public to build trust and manage expectations. The Smarter Web Company’s journey over the next decade will not only define its own future but also serve as a blueprint for how traditional businesses can successfully navigate and thrive within the emerging digital asset economy. Their story is a powerful narrative of foresight, strategic planning, and a deep belief in the transformative power of Bitcoin. Conclusion: Pioneering a New Era of Corporate Finance The announcement from The Smarter Web Company marks a pivotal moment, showcasing a progressive integration of traditional business growth with innovative digital asset management. Their successful $56.45 million funding round is a testament to their prowess in web development, but their commitment to a long-term Bitcoin investment strategy truly sets them apart. This bold move underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic corporate asset and highlights the accelerating trend of corporate crypto adoption and institutional crypto holdings. As The Smarter Web Company embarks on its decade-long Bitcoin accumulation journey, it stands as a beacon for other enterprises, illustrating how embracing the future of finance can lead to unprecedented growth and resilience in an ever-changing global economy. Their story is a compelling example of how strategic foresight can unlock new dimensions of corporate value.

The update introduces new features designed to support institutional adoption, regulatory compliance, and tokenization use cases—all critical in Ripple’s broader strategy to expand beyond cross-border payments into full-scale decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure. Source: RippleXDev Escrow for Tokenized Assets The upgrade has been introduced in the XRP Ledger blog . One of the most notable additions is XLS-85, which extends escrow functionality beyond XRP to trustline-based IOUs and multi-purpose tokens (MPTs). This allows developers to lock and release tokenized assets based on time or conditions, a capability widely used in Ethereum-based vesting contracts and stablecoin issuance. The enhancement could prove valuable for firms issuing digital dollars or bonds on-chain, offering more control over distribution schedules and compliance. Streamlined Execution with Batch Transactions XRPL now supports atomic batch transactions under XLS-56. The feature enables multiple operations—such as payouts, token swaps, and dApp logic—to be executed in a single on-ledger transaction. That structure is already commonplace in Ethereum smart contracts and Solana’s programs, where efficient transaction bundling is vital for throughput and user experience. For enterprises and infrastructure providers, the feature could reduce friction in settlement workflows, especially for multi-party payouts or staking reward systems. Tools for Regulatory Alignment In a move tailored to regulators and enterprise blockchain adopters, the new XLS-81 amendment introduces permissioned decentralized exchanges. The change lets developers gate access to market pairs and enforce trading restrictions, providing an on-chain compliance layer in contrast to Ethereum’s typically permissionless DEX model. This could help Ripple and the XRPL ecosystem pitch the ledger as a platform for regulated DeFi, particularly in jurisdictions exploring tokenized asset markets under strict KYC and AML regimes. Enhanced Account Controls The upgrade also brings XLS-75, allowing users to delegate specific permissions—such as signing or submitting transactions—to other accounts. The feature supports more complex account setups and is a prerequisite for enterprise wallet delegation and managed custody services. Infrastructure-Level Safeguards Additional changes target XRPL’s emerging support for NFTs and automated market makers. The new EnforceNFTokenTrustlineV2 fix closes a loophole that allowed some NFT transactions to bypass trustline rules. AMM enhancements add invariant checks to ensure pool stability and prevent manipulation, similar to measures seen on Ethereum’s Uniswap v3 and Curve. Market Implications: XRP Price Outlook The 2.5.0 release is viewed by some analysts as a pivot point in XRPL’s technical maturity. While XRP has largely been sidelined in the DeFi boom due to the ledger’s limited programmability, the introduction of escrow for tokenized assets and controlled DEX environments positions XRPL as a more viable base layer for regulated finance applications. XRP rallied over 12% in the days surrounding the upgrade, peaking at $2.23 on June 26. Daily active addresses rose nearly tenfold, from 35,000 to nearly 295,000. Whale wallet accumulation also hit an all-time high with 2,700 wallets now holding more than 1 million XRP. With this upgrade, Ripple is clearly signaling that XRPL isn’t just a remittance rail anymore. It’s going after the same enterprise and DeFi market that Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche are fighting to lead.

Bitcoin (BTC) has shown renewed strength over the past week, recovering from a mid-week low and maintaining an upward trajectory. BTC reached a recent high of around $107,980 by June 25–26. As of today, it trades at $106,952, continuing to hover near local highs.Bitcoin Completed Cup and Handle PatternFollowing the recent recovery, a chart analysis from TradingView analyst TradingShot indicates a potential technical breakout. The analyst reports that Bitcoin appears to have completed a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily (1D) timeframe. This formation began in January, with BTC initially surging to $109,400 on January 20. A decline followed, bottoming near $74,000 on April 9, forming the base of the cup. Bitcoin Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction The rebound that extended into May reached as high as $111,800 around May 22, which marked the right edge of the cup. After that, price action ranged between $98,300 and $110,700, shaping the handle. This period of consolidation coincided with Bitcoin dipping below its 1D MA50. After this, it rebounded at the 1D MA200, a move noted by the analyst as significant for the technical setup.Technical Indicators Signal Building MomentumAccording to TradingShot, Bitcoin not only reclaimed its 1D MA50 following the rebound but also posted a bullish signal on the MACD. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator printed a Bullish Cross, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. This development typically points to strengthening bullish momentum and supports the possibility of further gains.The MACD crossover aligns with Bitcoin regaining its MA50, reinforcing the bullish outlook based on the completed chart pattern. Importantly, the handle segment of the cup and handle pattern has formed what the analyst refers to as an “isolated” Bull Flag. The chart projects a technical target at the 2.0 Fibonacci extension, situated at approximately $169,000.To meet the projected level of $169,000, Bitcoin would require a 57.47% increase from the current pivot level of $107,316.Bitcoin Has Room for UpsideMeanwhile, Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), shared an updated chart on June 25 showing Bitcoin’s historical correlation with global M2 liquidity, which now stands at $94.3 trillion. The chart highlights that Bitcoin has generally followed M2 trends with a 12-week lag, maintaining a broad alignment since 2023 despite occasional deviations. Currently, Bitcoin appears to be trailing the growth in global liquidity, creating a divergence that analysts are watching. This macro backdrop, paired with bullish technical signals such as the MACD crossover and the recovery of key moving averages, suggests Bitcoin may still have room to follow global M2’s upward path and approach projected cycle targets.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-26 15:38:57

News from South Korea suggests a significant development that could reshape how we view digital currencies, particularly the South Korea stablecoin market. The Democratic Party of Korea (DPK)’s chief policymaker, Jin Sung-joon, recently revealed that the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOEF) and the Bank of Korea (BOK) are actively working on legislation for a won-pegged stablecoin. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a foundational step towards integrating digital assets more deeply into the nation’s financial fabric. What Does Won-Pegged Stablecoin Legislation Mean for South Korea? This pivotal announcement, reported by Money Today, signals South Korea’s serious intent to embrace digital currencies while maintaining financial stability. A won-pegged stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, directly tied to the Korean Won. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to minimize price fluctuations, making them suitable for everyday transactions, remittances, and even as a safe haven during market volatility. The drafting of this legislation by key financial bodies like MOEF and BOK indicates a top-down approach to ensuring regulatory clarity and consumer protection. This move could pave the way for a more secure and efficient digital payment ecosystem within the country. The core idea behind a won-pegged stablecoin is simple yet powerful: Stability: Its value remains consistent, mirroring the Korean Won. Utility: Ideal for payments, cross-border transfers, and as a settlement layer. Trust: Backed by the nation’s central bank and finance ministry, enhancing user confidence. This initiative isn’t just about creating a new digital asset; it’s about establishing a robust regulatory framework that supports innovation without compromising financial integrity. It represents a forward-thinking approach to the evolving digital economy. How Will This Impact Crypto Regulation in Korea? The development of specific legislation for a won-pegged stablecoin is a game-changer for crypto regulation Korea . Currently, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea has been a patchwork, with various guidelines and pronouncements rather than a single, cohesive legal framework for all digital assets. This new bill aims to provide much-needed clarity and legitimacy, especially for stablecoins. It signifies a shift from a cautious, sometimes restrictive, stance to one that seeks to actively integrate certain types of digital assets into the formal financial system. This could lead to a more defined operational environment for crypto exchanges, blockchain companies, and individual investors. Key impacts on regulation could include: Clearer Definitions: Establishing legal definitions for stablecoins and their issuers. Enhanced Oversight: MOEF and BOK will likely have direct oversight, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. Consumer Protection: Regulations will likely focus on safeguarding users’ funds and ensuring the stablecoin’s reserves are adequately managed and audited. Innovation with Guardrails: Providing a framework that encourages blockchain innovation while mitigating systemic risks. This proactive regulatory step could position South Korea as a leader in responsible digital asset adoption, potentially influencing other nations considering similar moves. What Are the Broader Implications of Digital Currency Legislation? The push for comprehensive digital currency legislation extends beyond just stablecoins. It reflects a global trend where nations are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and regulating private digital assets. South Korea’s approach, focusing on a won-pegged stablecoin, could serve as a model for how countries can leverage the benefits of digital currencies while addressing concerns about financial stability and monetary policy. This legislation will likely define the roles of various financial institutions, technology providers, and market participants in the digital asset ecosystem. It’s not merely about creating a digital won; it’s about establishing the legal and operational infrastructure for a future where digital payments are seamless and secure. Consider the potential ripple effects: Aspect Potential Impact of Legislation Financial Inclusion Easier access to digital financial services for unbanked or underbanked populations. Cross-Border Payments Faster, cheaper, and more transparent international remittances and trade settlements. Monetary Policy New tools for the central bank to implement monetary policy and manage liquidity. Economic Growth Stimulating innovation in fintech and blockchain sectors, creating new economic opportunities. This legislative push demonstrates South Korea’s commitment to staying at the forefront of financial innovation, adapting its legal framework to accommodate the digital age. What Role Will the Bank of Korea Stablecoin Play in the Economy? The involvement of the Bank of Korea stablecoin initiatives is crucial. As the nation’s central bank, the BOK’s participation ensures that any won-pegged stablecoin aligns with broader monetary policy objectives and financial stability mandates. While the current focus is on a private sector-issued won-pegged stablecoin under central bank oversight, this could also lay the groundwork for a potential future central bank digital currency (CBDC), or a “digital won,” issued directly by the BOK. The BOK has been actively researching CBDCs for years, conducting pilot programs and exploring various technological architectures. This stablecoin legislation could be seen as a stepping stone, allowing the nation to gain practical experience with regulated digital currencies before potentially launching its own. The BOK’s role will likely encompass: Oversight and Supervision: Ensuring that stablecoin issuers maintain adequate reserves and comply with regulatory standards. Risk Management: Mitigating risks related to financial stability, illicit finance, and consumer protection. Policy Alignment: Ensuring the stablecoin’s operations are consistent with national monetary policy and financial system stability. This collaboration between the MOEF and BOK highlights a coordinated effort to harness the benefits of digital currencies while managing inherent risks, paving the way for a robust and secure digital financial future. What Are the Next Steps for South Korea’s Stablecoin Journey? The announcement that the MOEF and BOK are drafting this bill marks a significant milestone in South Korea’s journey towards a regulated digital asset landscape. While the exact timeline for the bill’s introduction and passage remains to be seen, the fact that a ruling party policymaker has made this public indicates a strong political will to advance this agenda. The legislative process will involve various stages, including public consultations, debates, and amendments, ensuring that all stakeholders’ perspectives are considered. This comprehensive approach is vital for building a resilient and adaptable framework for the South Korea stablecoin market. For businesses and individuals in the crypto space, this development offers a glimpse into a future with greater regulatory certainty. It could encourage more institutional participation and foster innovation within a regulated environment. As the bill progresses, it will be essential to monitor its specifics, particularly regarding licensing requirements, reserve management, and consumer protection mechanisms. Actionable Insights for the Reader: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from MOEF and BOK regarding the bill’s progress. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between private stablecoins and potential future CBDCs, as their regulatory treatments may differ. Prepare for Change: Businesses operating in the Korean crypto space should begin assessing how potential new regulations might impact their operations and compliance requirements. This legislative effort underscores South Korea’s commitment to being a pioneer in the digital economy, balancing innovation with robust regulatory oversight. In conclusion, South Korea is on the cusp of a transformative period for its financial landscape. The joint effort by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Bank of Korea to draft legislation for a won-pegged stablecoin is a powerful statement about the nation’s proactive stance on digital currency adoption. This landmark bill promises to bring clarity, stability, and enhanced consumer protection to the burgeoning digital asset market, setting a precedent for responsible innovation. As the world watches, South Korea’s journey into regulated stablecoins could very well provide a blueprint for other nations navigating the complexities of the digital financial future.

While regulatory clarity may attract major players in the industry, the local crypto community fears that some provisions suggested by Polish politicians threaten the survival of smaller domestic companies. Polish government renews push to regulate crypto Poles may have been frustrated by delayed efforts to regulate the crypto space in their country, but what’s in store for them now does not necessarily bring a change for the better, Polish crypto media has noted. The government in Warsaw approved a draft law prepared by the finance ministry, the basic purpose of which is to implement the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) package in Poland, the Bitcoin.pl portal reported. But that’s not all. Certain texts added by local politicians are making Polish crypto companies think about moving abroad, the news outlet warned. If adopted, the legislation will assign regulatory oversight to Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), which is not particularly popular among members of the country’s crypto industry. The agency will be tasked to control the operations of platforms such as cryptocurrency exchanges and token issuers, which will be required to share detailed information about their activities. The KNF will also be entitled to impose heavy fines on crypto firms, which can reach 22 million złoty annually (over $6 million). The penalties are harsher than those for banks, the report points out. According to the FinTech Poland Foundation for Financial Innovation, the regulations contain overly rigorous provisions regarding reporting obligations and supervisory powers. Bill raises entry barriers for crypto startups Poland is obliged to apply the rules introduced by the MiCA law, which seeks to unify regulatory frameworks across the EU. However, many Poles are concerned that the rules proposed by their own government, which the industry describes as “draconian,” go too far. Besides exaggerated regulatory scrutiny, it also includes higher entry barriers for new crypto businesses. Obtaining a crypto asset service provider (CASP) license will cost about half a million zlotys, noted Polish economist Prof. Krzysztof Piech. “Then 30 – 40,000 zlotys of monthly costs, in addition to which you have to prepare about 1,000 pages of documentation and wait two years for the regulator’s decision,” he told the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza, adding: “From my conversations with entities in the market, everyone will try to obtain a license abroad. It is therefore possible that the Polish act will not cover any entity, except for those already regulated.” The comments of the academic, who specializes in finance, were quoted in an article titled “Government Grabs Bitcoin by the Throat.” The same report revealed that Poland’s president-elect Karol Nawrocki, who will assume office in August, intends to veto the law, which, in his view, proposes “murderous” solutions. The Sejm and the Senate, the upper and lower house of Polish parliament, are likely to adopt the bill. If Nawrocki makes good on his promise not to sign it in its current form, attempts to regulate the crypto space in Poland are expected to continue. “I notice that more and more people and companies are investing in cryptocurrencies. What is my attitude to this? Innovations must be created in Poland, not regulations,” Nawrocki was quoted as stating during the election campaign . “As the president of the Republic of Poland, I will guarantee that the murderous regulations that will limit your freedom will not be implemented,” he insisted in a post on X at the end of May. 🟦 Zauważam, że coraz więcej osób i firm inwestuje w kryptowaluty. Jaki jest mój stosunek do tego? W Polsce muszą powstawać innowacje, a nie regulacje. Jako Prezydent RP, będę gwarantem, że nie wejdą w życie zamordystyczne przepisy, które ograniczą Waszą wolność. #Nawrocki2025 pic.twitter.com/pHoJ03Gg3K — #Nawrocki2025 (@Nawrocki25) May 28, 2025 While the upcoming regulatory clarity may attract major industry players that can afford the high costs of licensing, smaller crypto firms will have to either leave Poland or continue to operate there via registration in another jurisdiction. “This will happen at the expense of the state budget. It is hard to understand the logic of the legislator,” the crypto news outlet noted. A previously discussed controversial proposal envisaged imposing a 0.5% fee on the revenues of Polish crypto exchanges while charging foreign-based platforms only a one-time fee of around $5,000.

Hyperliquid, XRP, and Pi Network are showing signs of quiet momentum, technical recovery, and growing narrative support—positioning themselves as potential breakout candidates. As volatility cools and volume rebuilds, these altcoins may lead the next leg upward. This curated market outlook is powered by Outset PR , a crypto-native PR agency that helps projects capture visibility at critical moments, turning market setups into media traction and attention into momentum. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Quiet Momentum Building Beneath the Surface Source: tradingview Hyperliquid (HYPE) is entering July with a stealthy setup: while currently trading between the high $20s and mid-$40s, its long-term trajectory looks promising. Despite short-term fluctuations, HYPE has posted a solid 6-month gain nearing 40%, hinting at underlying strength. If bulls can push it past the key resistance in the low $50s, the next leg higher could offer over 70% upside. RSI and stochastic readings suggest a balanced market — ideal conditions for a surprise breakout. Keep an eye on HYPE as it builds pressure for a potential July move. XRP (XRP): Holding Strong Above Key Averages With DeFi Potential in Focus Source: tradingview XRP is holding its ground near the $2 mark, with price action showing quiet resilience despite market headwinds. The asset remains above both the 10-day and 100-day moving averages — a bullish sign amid broader volatility. A successful push past the $2.50 resistance could trigger a breakout with over 30% upside potential. With the XRPL 2.5.0 upgrade unlocking native stablecoin support, XRP’s fundamentals are stronger than ever. July could mark a turning point as Ripple strengthens its DeFi narrative. Pi Network (PI): Oversold Territory Sets Stage for Recovery Source: tradingview Pi Network (PI) enters July in a compressed range between $0.50 and $0.58 — but technicals suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is nearing oversold levels, hinting at a recovery opportunity as selling pressure eases. If PI breaks above the $0.66 resistance, it could rally over 20% from its current top range. While the past month showed a decline, the solid support at $0.39 may provide the base needed for a summer turnaround. Traders watching undervalued plays might find PI worth a closer look.

Accordingly, Bitget, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has recently emerged as the best platform for altcoins, leaving Binance and Coinbase behind. According to Coingecko's research, Bitget has become the leader in altcoin liquidity, leaving Binance behind. While analyzing the liquidity of the largest cryptocurrencies, Coingecko determined that Bitget dominates for Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and XRP. While Bitget led the way for top altcoins, Binance remained the top platform for Bitcoin liquidity across all market depths. “Binance offered the most liquidity for Bitcoin, while Bitget was the most liquid platform for altcoins, ranging from 0.3% to 0.5%.” Speaking to Coindesk, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen commented on the Coingecko research and said that Bitget’s leadership stems from its infrastructure. “Altcoin liquidity is a measure of market depth and this ranking shows how far Bitget has come. Today, institutions drive 80% of our spot volume, futures activity by professional firms has doubled, and 80% of top funds trade on Bitget.” In XRP, Bitget dominated with a depth range of 0.3% (with a variance of $0.006), while Binance and Coinbase lagged behind with a depth level of 1% (with a variance of $0.006). A similar situation was true for Solana, while Bitget led other major exchanges with a 32% share in the 0.6% range in liquidity for SOL. According to the report, Bitget also led other exchanges by small margins in ETH and DOGE, but Binance maintained its leading position for Bitcoin.

Pradeep Bhandari, a national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has openly advocated for recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a profound statement that could signal a monumental shift in how India views and potentially integrates cryptocurrencies into its national financial framework. The implications of a major global power considering a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve are far-reaching, sparking conversations about financial sovereignty, technological innovation, and India’s position in the evolving global financial landscape. Why is a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Being Considered for India? To understand the significance of Bhandari’s statement, it’s crucial to grasp what a ‘strategic reserve asset’ truly entails. Traditionally, nations hold reserves of gold, foreign currencies (like the U.S. dollar), and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the IMF. These assets serve as a nation’s financial bedrock, providing stability during economic crises, facilitating international trade, and bolstering confidence in the national currency. They are crucial for managing exchange rates and external debt. So, why Bitcoin? Proponents argue that Bitcoin possesses several unique characteristics that make it an attractive candidate for a modern strategic reserve: Decentralization and Censorship Resistance: Unlike traditional assets controlled by central banks or governments, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, making it resistant to political interference or seizure. This offers a level of financial sovereignty that traditional assets cannot. Scarcity and Predictable Supply: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it a truly scarce asset. This fixed supply contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which can be inflated at will by central banks, potentially eroding their value over time. This predictability offers a hedge against inflation. Global Liquidity and Portability: Bitcoin is a globally traded asset, accessible 24/7. Its digital nature allows for easy, rapid, and cost-effective transfer across borders, potentially streamlining international transactions and reducing reliance on traditional, slower banking rails. Protection Against Sanctions and Geopolitical Risks: In an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, holding a non-sovereign asset like Bitcoin could offer a nation an alternative means of conducting transactions and preserving wealth, particularly if faced with economic sanctions. For a nation like India, which aims for greater economic autonomy and global influence, exploring a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve could be a forward-thinking move to diversify its financial holdings and embrace the future of digital finance. How is India Crypto Regulation Evolving? India’s journey with cryptocurrencies has been a rollercoaster of caution, skepticism, and gradual openness. For years, the prevailing sentiment from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government leaned towards a ban, citing concerns about financial stability, money laundering, and investor protection. There were even proposals for a blanket prohibition on private cryptocurrencies, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty for millions of Indian crypto users and businesses. However, recent times have seen a noticeable shift. India’s presidency of the G20 in 2023 brought cryptocurrency regulation to the forefront of international discussions. India actively pushed for a globally coordinated framework for crypto assets, recognizing that unilateral bans are ineffective in a borderless digital world. This G20 initiative, spearheaded by India, resulted in a synthesis paper from the IMF and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) offering recommendations for a comprehensive regulatory approach. This marked a significant pivot from outright prohibition to a more nuanced, regulatory stance. Pradeep Bhandari’s statement, therefore, isn’t an isolated incident but rather a public manifestation of this evolving mindset within the ruling party. It suggests that the discussion around crypto in India is moving beyond mere regulation of trading and usage, towards considering its fundamental role in national finance. This indicates a growing recognition that digital assets, and Bitcoin in particular, cannot be ignored but must be understood and potentially integrated into the broader economic strategy. The direction of India Crypto Regulation is clearly shifting from one of apprehension to one of strategic consideration. What Does Broader Digital Asset Adoption Mean for India? Beyond its potential as a strategic reserve, broader Digital Asset Adoption holds immense promise for India across various sectors. India, with its vast, tech-savvy youth population and a rapidly expanding digital infrastructure, is uniquely positioned to leverage blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Potential Benefits: Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies can provide financial services to India’s unbanked and underbanked populations, offering access to savings, credit, and investment opportunities without traditional banking intermediaries. Remittances: India is the world’s largest recipient of remittances. Blockchain-based systems can significantly reduce the cost and time involved in cross-border money transfers, benefiting millions of families. Technological Innovation and Job Creation: A supportive regulatory environment for digital assets can foster a thriving blockchain industry, attracting investment, nurturing startups, and creating high-skilled jobs in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 development. Smart Contracts and Supply Chain Efficiency: Beyond Bitcoin, the underlying blockchain technology can revolutionize various industries through smart contracts, enhancing transparency and efficiency in areas like land records, healthcare, and supply chain management. Challenges to Overcome: Despite the immense potential, the path to widespread Digital Asset Adoption is not without hurdles: Regulatory Clarity: While the sentiment is shifting, a clear, comprehensive, and consistent regulatory framework is still needed to provide certainty for businesses and investors. Public Education: There’s a significant need to educate the general public about the risks and opportunities associated with digital assets to prevent scams and foster responsible participation. Infrastructure: Ensuring robust and secure digital infrastructure, including reliable internet access and cybersecurity measures, is crucial for mass adoption. Energy Consumption: The energy consumption of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin remains a concern, especially for a country like India committed to sustainability goals. Addressing these challenges proactively will be key to unlocking the full potential of digital assets for India’s growth story. How Could Bitcoin Impact the Indian Economy ? The potential integration of Bitcoin into India’s strategic reserves, or even just a more open stance towards digital assets, could have profound effects on the Indian Economy . This isn’t just about a new asset class; it’s about potentially reshaping economic policies and investment flows. Opportunities for the Indian Economy: Diversification of Reserves: Adding Bitcoin could diversify India’s foreign exchange reserves, reducing reliance on a single currency or commodity and potentially hedging against global economic volatility. Attracting Foreign Investment: A progressive stance on digital assets could make India a more attractive destination for global blockchain and crypto businesses, leading to increased foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital inflows. Innovation Hub: By embracing digital assets, India could solidify its position as a global innovation hub, particularly in fintech and blockchain technology, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of startups and talent. Inflation Hedge: As a scarce asset with a fixed supply, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, offering a potential tool to preserve purchasing power for the national treasury. Potential Risks for the Indian Economy: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern. Holding a volatile asset in national reserves could expose the economy to considerable fluctuations. Regulatory Arbitrage: Lack of clear global regulations could lead to regulatory arbitrage, where illicit activities might flow through jurisdictions with weaker oversight. Systemic Risk: Uncontrolled growth and integration of digital assets without proper oversight could introduce new systemic risks to the financial system. Careful consideration and a phased approach would be essential to mitigate these risks while harnessing the opportunities for the Indian Economy . Could Bitcoin Redefine India’s Role in the Global Financial System ? India’s consideration of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is not just an internal policy matter; it carries significant weight for its standing in the Global Financial System . Historically, the U.S. dollar has dominated as the world’s primary reserve currency, alongside gold. Any move by a major economy like India to diversify its reserves into a non-sovereign digital asset could have ripple effects globally. If India were to proceed with accumulating Bitcoin, it would join a small but growing list of nations and entities exploring this path. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, and various corporations have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. However, a major G20 economy doing so for its national reserves would be a game-changer, potentially accelerating the global legitimization of Bitcoin as a serious financial asset. Such a move could: Influence Other Nations: India’s decision could inspire other developing and even developed nations to re-evaluate their reserve strategies and consider digital assets. Challenge the Dollar’s Hegemony: While unlikely to dethrone the dollar overnight, a widespread adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve asset could gradually reduce global reliance on a single fiat currency, fostering a more multipolar financial world. Promote Financial Multilateralism: By embracing a decentralized asset, India could champion a more inclusive and resilient global financial architecture, less susceptible to the whims of individual national policies. Enhance India’s Soft Power: Taking a pioneering role in digital asset integration could boost India’s image as a technologically advanced and forward-thinking nation on the world stage. The conversation around Bitcoin’s place in the Global Financial System is no longer theoretical; it’s becoming a tangible policy debate in key economies like India, potentially paving the way for a new era of international finance. The Road Ahead: Actionable Insights for India’s Crypto Future Pradeep Bhandari’s endorsement of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset is a significant moment, but it’s just the beginning of a complex journey. For India to effectively navigate this path, several actionable insights come to the fore: Develop a Clear Policy Roadmap: The government needs to move beyond statements to formulate a detailed, transparent policy framework for digital assets, covering taxation, regulation, and potential reserve integration. Foster Public-Private Dialogue: Engaging with industry experts, blockchain developers, and the crypto community is crucial to crafting informed and effective policies. Invest in Research and Development: India should invest in research into blockchain technology, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and the broader digital asset ecosystem to stay at the forefront of innovation. International Collaboration: Continuing to advocate for global regulatory harmonization, as initiated during the G20 presidency, is vital to manage the cross-border nature of digital assets. Pilot Programs: Consider small-scale pilot programs for Bitcoin integration or other digital asset initiatives to gather data and learn before full-scale implementation. The path forward requires a balanced approach, weighing the immense opportunities against the inherent risks, and building robust frameworks to ensure financial stability and protect investors. Conclusion: India’s Digital Dawn? The statement from BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari is more than just a headline; it’s a powerful signal that India, a nation poised to become a global economic powerhouse, is seriously considering a revolutionary shift in its financial strategy. The idea of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for India moves the discussion from mere speculation to a tangible policy debate. While the journey of India Crypto Regulation has been cautious, this endorsement highlights a growing recognition of digital assets’ potential. Embracing broader Digital Asset Adoption could unlock significant opportunities for the Indian Economy , from financial inclusion to technological leadership. Moreover, such a move could redefine India’s influence within the Global Financial System , positioning it as a pioneer in the digital age of finance. The road ahead will undoubtedly be challenging, requiring careful planning and robust regulatory frameworks. However, if India successfully integrates Bitcoin into its national strategy, it could set a powerful precedent, paving the way for a new era of economic resilience and digital sovereignty.

Hyperliquid (HYPE), Pi Network (PI), and Ondo (ONDO) are emerging as long-term contenders—backed by infrastructure growth, undervalued setups, and real-world use cases. With institutional interest building and market sentiment stabilizing, these tokens are quietly becoming magnets for patient capital. This capital rotation spotlight is presented by Outset PR —crypto’s premier performance-focused agency. Outset PR turns momentum milestones into precision-timed campaigns that amplify visibility, credibility, and reach for long-term growth-stage projects. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Quiet Accumulation With Strong Long-Term Upside Source: tradingview Despite short-term fluctuations, Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to attract attention from strategic investors. The token remains in a range between the high $20s and mid-$40s but boasts a robust 6-month gain nearing 40%, signaling underlying momentum. A breakout above the low $50s resistance could open the door to a 70% rally. The current RSI and stochastic levels suggest a balanced market — potentially a calm before the next wave of growth. With institutional-grade capital showing interest in emerging DeFi infrastructure, HYPE remains a compelling long-term play. Pi Network (PI): Oversold Levels May Signal Early Reentry Opportunity Source: tradingview Pi Network (PI) is trading near oversold territory, caught in a compressed range between $0.50 and $0.58. While recent price action shows a monthly dip, strong support at $0.39 provides a sturdy base for a potential reversal. If bulls reclaim momentum and break the $0.66 resistance, PI could deliver a +20% move — an attractive entry point for long-term capital eyeing undervalued Web3 utility tokens. With broader market rotation into mid-cap altcoins expected this quarter, PI may be quietly setting up for recovery. Ondo (ONDO): Undervalued With Asymmetric Upside Potential Source: tradingview Ondo (ONDO) is currently trading between $0.58 and $0.80, consolidating after a multi-month cooldown. Though its 6-month performance reflects a pullback, long-term investors are watching closely as ONDO builds support above $0.49. A breakout past $0.93 — and potentially to $1.15 — could generate gains of over 20%. The project’s real-world asset (RWA) narrative and institutional interest remain intact, making ONDO a candidate for long-term capital rotation as macro conditions stabilize and tokenized finance gains traction.

The UAE fund’s investment underscores the growing institutional appetite for governance rights in blockchain-based finance. According to a June 26 announcement , UAE-registered Web3-native fund Aqua 1 acquired $100 million worth of governance tokens from World Liberty Financial, the Trump-linked decentralized finance platform known for its focus on real-world asset tokenization and dollar-backed stablecoin issuance. The sizable acquisition positions Aqua 1 to directly influence WLFI’s on-chain governance, just as the protocol scales global infrastructure for its USD1 stablecoin and prepares a cross-border asset marketplace. Both parties framed the deal as a long-term alignment aimed at integrating tokenized RWAs into mainstream institutional flows. You might also like: Dow Jones climbs as Trump eyes Powell replacement at Federal Reserve Inside Aqua 1’s realignment with WLFI Aqua 1’s $100 million WLFI token purchase is a strategic move to shape the future of institutional DeFi. By acquiring governance rights, the UAE-based fund gains direct influence over WLFI’s roadmap, particularly its USD1 stablecoin expansion and RWA tokenization initiatives. “Aligning with Aqua 1 validates our blueprint for global financial innovation, as we have a joint mission to bring digital assets to the masses and strengthen our nation’s standing as a champion and leader of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology,” Zak Folkman, Co-Founder of World Liberty Financial, stated. The partnership aims to accelerate WLFI’s institutional adoption, leveraging Aqua 1’s compliance expertise to navigate regulatory hurdles in emerging markets. A key priority will be integrating USD1 into commercial payment systems, supporting WLFI’s bid for stablecoin dominance as global regulators increase scrutiny of dollar-pegged alternatives. Beyond governance, the deal enables cross-border synergies. Aqua 1 will assist WLFI’s expansion into South America, Europe, and Asia, while WLFI will support the launch of Aqua Fund, a UAE-domiciled investment vehicle focused on blockchain infrastructure and AI-powered Web3 projects. The fund’s planned listing on an ADGM-regulated secondary market could provide a liquidity framework for other tokenized investment vehicles. The collaboration also includes the joint development of BlockRock, an institutional RWA platform targeting high-value traditional assets. If successful, it could position WLFI as a leader in the $16 trillion RWA market—competing with legacy players like BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s OnChain funds. Aqua 1’s investment marks a pivotal shift in crypto’s evolution. Governance tokens, once the domain of retail participants, are now instruments for institutional players steering DeFi toward TradFi compatibility. WLFI’s Trump-era branding adds a political layer, but the core story is the fusion of Middle Eastern capital, U.S.-centric stablecoin infrastructure, and global RWA ambitions.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a fan favorite in Musk’s orbit, it’s a little-known DeFi token called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s catching unexpected attention. Currently in presale and priced at just $0.03, Mutuum Finance is generating serious traction among early adopters. Mutuum Finance remains in presale stage 5 which has already sold 40% of it due to huge demand. Over $11.2 million has been generated so far and over 12,500 investors have joined. As DOGE holds steady with minimal volatility, analysts and retail investors alike are looking deeper into new crypto coins that can deliver meaningful upside. Grok’s mention has only added fuel to the speculation that Mutuum Finance could be among the next crypto coins to explode. Presale Heats Up: Mutuum Finance Moves to Phase 5 at $0.03 per Token Mutuum Finance is quickly making waves in the DeFi market, and its presale is now on Phase 5, where tokens are only $0.03. With a launch value of $0.06, early investors have the luxury of doubling their investment on launch. But wait, there’s more, the estimated return after launch is an outrageous 12,000%, making this one of the most widely discussed DeFi prospects available today. Over $11.2 million has been raised, and over 12,500 investors are registered or waiting to join. Once the presale moves into Phase 6, the token price will increase to $0.035, offering any stage 5 buyer an immediate 16.67% gain. Wonders like these don’t come by every day, and it’s clear that shrewd investors already are making their entrance. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Is Live To commemorate its early momentum and to give back to the community Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a huge $100,000 giveaway . A total of 10 fortunate early investors will be chosen to win $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. Through its unique leaderboard system the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will be incentivized. As the users climb up the ranks they will be given bonus tokens token thus holding becomes fun and competitive one. The mechanism drives both excitement and loyalty and kick-starts ecosystem growth in high-gear. Long Term-built and Audited Mutuum Finance is building credibility from its hype. Certik has done a tight audit of its smart contracts which reassure investors that the code is secure and transparent. And to make its ecosystem even more robust Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a fully collateralized, USD-pegged algorithmic stablecoin on Ethereum that will introduce long-term liquidity, stability, and reliability to institutional and retail customers. Elon Musk’s Grok has amplified the spotlight on both Dogecoin (DOGE) and the rising DeFi star Mutuum Finance (MUTM), sparking a fresh wave of investor interest. DOGE remains stable, but it’s Mutuum Finance that’s drawing real momentum, over $11.2 million raised and more than 12,500 investors already onboard. Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale, MUTM offers an immediate gain before the increase to $0.035 in Phase 6, along with a projected 12,000% return after launch. A full CertiK audit, a $100,000 token giveaway, and plans for a fully collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum are adding major credibility to the project.

Last weekend, ETH briefly dipped below the $2,200 mark as panic selling swept across global markets following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The sell-off triggered a sharp fakeout that briefly pushed ETH out of its multi-week trading range. However, bulls are regaining control, and Ethereum’s price action now signals the early stages of a potential recovery rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a technical analysis highlighting that Ethereum is reclaiming the key $2,444 resistance level — a zone that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout May and June. If bulls maintain momentum above this threshold, it could open the door for a bullish continuation toward the higher end of the established range. While uncertainty remains due to lingering macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, Ethereum’s current structure shows renewed strength. Market participants are watching closely, as ETH often serves as a leading indicator for broader altcoin performance. Holding above $2,400 could become a catalyst for a broader rally, especially if Bitcoin continues to stabilize and approach new all-time highs. Ethereum Battles For Breakout As Market Awaits Direction Ethereum is trading at a critical juncture after a turbulent week of price action driven by geopolitical instability and macroeconomic uncertainty. Following a sharp drop below $2,200 amid panic selling over the Middle East conflict escalation, ETH has recovered significantly, now hovering around the $2,444 level. This price zone is key, not only as a technical resistance but also as a sentiment marker for traders watching for signs of a trend reversal or confirmation of a deeper pullback. Analysts remain divided on what comes next. Some believe Ethereum’s recent recovery could signal the beginning of a bullish continuation, especially if price action holds and pushes above the upper range levels near $2,600. A breakout from this zone would indicate renewed strength and could set the tone for a broader altcoin rally, particularly as Ethereum often leads sector momentum. Others, however, warn that the recovery might be short-lived, and a retreat to lower demand zones could occur if macro conditions worsen. Ted Pillows notes that Ethereum is currently reclaiming the $2,444 resistance level. He emphasizes that bullish continuation into the range highs is necessary to confirm breakout strength. Until then, traders are watching closely, as any rejection at this level could shift momentum back to the downside. With global tensions and monetary tightening from central banks continuing to influence markets, the coming weeks may determine whether ETH enters a new uptrend or retreats further into its long-standing consolidation range. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure – Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25–$30 Surge ETH Faces Long-Term Resistance The weekly chart of Ethereum (ETH/USD) shows a strong recovery from the $2,189 low, with ETH currently trading at $2,463 — a 10.5% gain so far this week. This sharp bounce comes after a fakeout below the $2,200 level and suggests renewed buying pressure following recent geopolitical volatility. However, price is now testing a major confluence zone formed by the 50-week ($2,660), 100-week ($2,625), and 200-week ($2,437) simple moving averages. This cluster of moving averages is acting as resistance, capping ETH’s upside momentum. Historically, when Ethereum breaks through these long-term trend lines, a significant trend continuation follows. But for now, bulls must decisively clear this $2,450–$2,660 zone to confirm a breakout and open the door toward the $3,000 psychological level.

In a stark reminder of the inherent risks, the stablecoin exploit on the Resupply protocol has sent ripples through the crypto community, siphoning off a staggering $9.5 million. This latest breach underscores the critical need for robust security measures and vigilance in the rapidly evolving Web3 landscape. What Happened: The Resupply Protocol Breach Unpacked Just recently, news broke that Resupply protocol , a vital component within the lending market liquidity space, fell victim to a sophisticated attack. According to reports from The Block, approximately $9.5 million was drained from the protocol. This wasn’t a brute-force attack but a more insidious form of exploitation, leveraging a clever manipulation of exchange rates. The attacker managed to inflate the value of cvcrvUSD – a wrapped version of Curve USD that is staked in Convex Finance – before causing a sudden and dramatic collapse in its rate. This calculated move then enabled the perpetrator to borrow a massive 10 million reUSD, effectively walking away with the substantial sum. Anatomy of the Attack: How Exchange Rate Manipulation Led to Disaster Understanding the mechanics behind this particular exchange rate manipulation is crucial for grasping the sophistication of modern crypto exploits. In essence, the attacker didn’t directly steal funds but rather tricked the protocol into believing they had more collateral than they truly did. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Step 1: Value Inflation: The attacker artificially drove up the perceived value of cvcrvUSD. This is often achieved by executing carefully timed, large-volume trades or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how a protocol calculates asset prices, particularly if it relies on a single, manipulable oracle or a thin liquidity pool. Step 2: Collateral Overvaluation: With the inflated cvcrvUSD, the attacker deposited it as collateral into the Resupply protocol. Because the protocol’s internal pricing mechanism was deceived, it registered this collateral as being worth far more than its true market value. Step 3: Massive Borrowing: Armed with this ‘overvalued’ collateral, the attacker then proceeded to borrow a significant amount of reUSD – 10 million, to be precise. This amount was far greater than what would have been possible with the actual, unmanipulated value of their cvcrvUSD. Step 4: Rate Collapse & Profit: Once the borrowing was complete, the manipulated exchange rate of cvcrvUSD inevitably collapsed back to its true market value (or even lower), leaving the protocol with undercollateralized loans and the attacker with the borrowed reUSD as pure profit. Broader Implications for DeFi Security: Lessons Learned The Resupply incident is not an isolated event; it’s another stark reminder of the ongoing challenges in DeFi security . These exploits erode user trust and highlight systemic vulnerabilities that still plague the decentralized finance ecosystem. What can we learn from this? Oracle Dependency Risks: Many DeFi protocols rely on external price feeds (oracles) to determine asset values. If these oracles can be manipulated or if a protocol doesn’t use robust, decentralized oracle solutions, it creates a critical single point of failure. Complex Interdependencies: DeFi protocols often build upon each other, creating intricate webs of dependencies. An exploit in one protocol (like cvcrvUSD’s interaction with Convex Finance and Resupply) can have cascading effects across the ecosystem. The Need for Rigorous Audits: While audits are common, they are not foolproof. This incident stresses the need for continuous, multi-faceted security assessments, including formal verification, bug bounties, and red team exercises, to uncover subtle logic flaws. Rapid Response Protocols: For protocols that do get exploited, a swift and coordinated response, including pausing contracts, alerting users, and collaborating with white-hat hackers, is crucial to minimize losses and prevent further damage. Safeguarding Your Assets: Navigating the World of Crypto Hacks Given the persistent threat of crypto hacks , what can individual users and projects do to better protect themselves? While no system is entirely risk-free, adopting best practices can significantly mitigate exposure: For Users: Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into a single protocol, especially newer or unaudited ones. Research Thoroughly: Before interacting with any DeFi protocol, research its team, audit history, and community sentiment. Look for transparency and a track record of security. Understand Risks: Be aware of the specific risks associated with different DeFi activities, such as impermanent loss in liquidity pools or oracle manipulation risks in lending protocols. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, always store your crypto on a hardware wallet. For Developers & Protocols: Decentralized Oracles: Implement robust, decentralized oracle solutions that aggregate data from multiple sources to prevent single-point manipulation. Circuit Breakers & Pausability: Build in mechanisms to pause contracts or limit operations in the event of suspicious activity or an exploit. Community Involvement: Foster active community participation in security reviews and bug bounty programs. Formal Verification: Explore formal verification methods for critical smart contract logic to mathematically prove their correctness. The Path Forward: Strengthening Web3 Vulnerability Defenses The ongoing saga of exploits, including the recent Resupply incident, serves as a powerful catalyst for innovation in addressing Web3 vulnerability . The industry is constantly learning and evolving, with significant efforts being channeled into creating more secure and resilient decentralized systems. From advanced cryptographic techniques to more sophisticated auditing tools and collaborative security initiatives, the future of DeFi hinges on its ability to proactively identify and neutralize threats. While challenges remain, the commitment to building a safer, more robust decentralized financial future is unwavering. This incident, while painful, contributes to a collective understanding that will ultimately make the ecosystem stronger. The $9.5 million stablecoin exploit on Resupply protocol is a stark reminder that even innovative DeFi projects are not immune to sophisticated attacks. It underscores the critical importance of continuous security vigilance, robust auditing, and a deep understanding of potential vulnerabilities, especially those related to price oracle manipulation. As the decentralized finance landscape continues to mature, every incident, painful as it may be, provides invaluable lessons that contribute to the collective effort of building a more secure and trustworthy Web3 future. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and always prioritize security in your crypto journey.

According to respected crypto analyst Cryptoinsightuk, if XRP closes the week at its current level or higher, it will mark the first bullish engulfing candle on a higher low since its local top in January. This technical formation could signal the end of the recent consolidation phase and the start of a renewed uptrend. Bullish Engulfing at a Higher Low A bullish engulfing candle occurs when a larger green candle completely engulfs the previous week’s red candle, indicating strong buying pressure. This pattern, especially when formed on a higher low, is often seen as a reliable indicator of a shift in market sentiment. In XRP’s case, this could be the clearest sign yet that the downtrend has run its course and accumulation is nearing completion. $XRP weekly showing promising signs. If we close here or above for $XRP on the weekly, it will be the first time we've seen a Bullish Engulfing candle on a higher low since our local top back in January. This could suggest that we are finishing our recent consolidation /… pic.twitter.com/gn0eYvyI2O — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) June 26, 2025 Cryptoinsightuk believes this pattern is especially significant because it follows a period of sideways movement and lower volatility. If the weekly close confirms the bullish engulfing setup, it may lay the foundation for a sharp breakout in the near term. Critical Resistance Ahead XRP currently sits just below a long-standing descending trendline. A move of roughly +8% from current levels would push the price above this resistance—a key technical milestone. Breaking through the trendline could unleash significant upside momentum, as XRP has historically made aggressive moves once major resistances are cleared. While an 8% gain may seem like a sizable jump, Cryptoinsightuk notes that such a move is well within XRP’s typical volatility range. Once bullish momentum kicks in, price action could accelerate quickly. RSI and Stochastic RSI Crossovers Could Confirm Strength Momentum indicators are also aligning with the bullish case. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic RSI are on the verge of a bullish crossover on the weekly timeframe. These crossovers are often used to confirm shifts in market momentum and can serve as early signals of sustained bullish trends. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If both indicators cross in the coming days, it would add further credibility to the idea that XRP is preparing for a breakout. Momentum would likely build rapidly, drawing increased attention from traders and short-term investors. Consolidation May Be Ending XRP has spent months trading within a tight range, frustrating both bulls and bears. However, this extended period of low volatility and accumulation often precedes explosive moves. Recent price action shows that buyers are gradually stepping in, and the structure of higher lows suggests growing confidence. With key technical patterns and indicators pointing in the same direction, XRP may be gearing up for a significant breakout. The next few days could prove critical in confirming this shift. In summary, if XRP can secure a strong weekly close and push above the descending trendline, it could mark the start of a major bullish phase. Cryptoinsightuk’s analysis suggests that the conditions are aligning—and if a breakout occurs, it could happen fast.

The motion requested the judge to reduce Ripple's $125 million civil penalty to $50 million and the permanent injunction against institutional XRP sales. Judge Torres ruled that the parties had failed to establish ”exceptional circumstances” required to alter a final judgment as stipulated in Rule 60. This decision maintains the original sanctions and reinforces the court's commitment to procedural integrity. Background of the Motion The motion, filed on June 12, 2025, was a second attempt following an earlier application being turned down in May. The settlement would ”obviate appeals” and end the 4.5-year case, the two parties contended. Despite being in consensus, the court pointed out that final orders cannot be overturned unless there is robust public interest. Case Settlement and Resolution Status Settlement in Limbo The settlement reached—where Ripple was to remit $50 million to the SEC while retaining $75 million in escrowed funds—now hangs precariously. While the two parties had made a deal in April-May 2025, its implementation is subject to the approval of the judiciary, which Judge Torres' ruling effectively delayed. Appeals Process Paused Until August 15 The Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to a joint request to hold appeals in abeyance until August 15, 2025. Ripple and the SEC are obligated to submit a status report detailing future action by the deadline. Subject to other disposition, appeals can be reinstated, prolonging the case. Financial Penalties and Remedies $125M Penalty and Injunction Upheld The original penalties remain: $125 million civil penalty (with $125M held in escrow). Permanent injunction against Ripple's institutional XRP sales. The court's refusal to lower the fine or suspend the injunction continues regulatory pressure on Ripple and delays market relief. Escrow Funds Locked Ripple's monthly XRP escrow releases (e.g., 1B XRP unlocked in June 2025) continue, but the $125M tied to the fine cannot be redistributed without court approval. Appeal Proceedings and Delays Procedural Delays and Next Steps Rule 60 Motion is Denied . The denied motion asked for an ”indicative ruling” to speed up settlement. Deadline of August 15 . The Second Circuit should be filed with a joint status report by this date. Unless Judge Torres ruled by then, appeals are allowed. Remedies Briefing Discovery . The process was delayed due to ongoing disputes about remedies briefing and accounting records. Legal Tactics and Arguments Ripple's Defensive Strategies Fair Notice Defense : Ripple alleged that the SEC did not sufficiently indicate whether XRP sales were a securities law violation. Cross-Appeal : Ripple protested against the definition of institutional sales as securities and the injunction's validity. Rule 62.1 vs. Rule 60 : Procedural mistakes by the SEC and Ripple (filing under Rule 62.1 instead of Rule 60) led to the denial of the motion. SEC's Position The SEC contends that every sale of XRP constituted an unregistered security offering, citing Ripple's marketing campaigns and investor profit expectations. Industry and Community Reactions Legal Authorities Get Involved Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan called the ruling a ”procedural setback” but noted the settlement agreement itself isn’t void. Crypto analyst John Squire emphasized the decision’s symbolic weight: ”Torres’ ruling prioritizes legal finality over industry convenience” Market Sentiment The crypto community was anguished at what it viewed as regulatory overreach victory in the denial. Some investors fear that prolonged ambiguity could erode institutional participation in XRP-based ETFs. Market Influence and XRP Price Action Price Volatility and Technical Outlook Following the ruling, XRP dipped with minor volatility but held strong support at $2.13. Analysts report: Robust selling pressure near $2.20. A positive settlement or ETF approval has the ability to break the consolidation. A ”head and shoulders” pattern on the 4-hour chart shows bearish momentum in case of break in support. Factor Impact on XRP Price Settlement Progress ⬆️ Bullish (if resumed) ETF Approval ⬆️ Major catalyst Regulatory Clarity ⬆️ Institutional interest Continued Litigation ⬇️ Bearish pressure Conclusion: What's Next for Ripple and XRP? Judge Torres' denial pushes back the XRP lawsuit timeline, upholding the $125M penalty and institution sale prohibition. Parties now have until Aug. 15 to report to the Second Circuit on settlement prospects. Without an agreement, unguaranteed appeals could push the battle into 2026. For XRP traders, the ruling indicates the weakness of regulatory progress—while spot ETF submissions and Ripple's cross-border payment efforts hold long-term hope. The case remains an essential bellwether for United States crypto regulation and its ruling will affect anything from token classifications to ETF approvals.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-26 16:08:40

It’s the lifeblood of any healthy market, determining how easily and efficiently assets can be bought and sold without significantly impacting their price. A recent analysis from CoinGecko, a leading cryptocurrency data aggregator, has shed fascinating light on the current landscape of liquidity across major centralized exchanges (CEXes). Their “Crypto Liquidity on CEXes 2025” report offers crucial insights, particularly highlighting the strengths of industry giants like Binance and emerging powerhouses such as Bitget. The Unrivaled Strength of Bitcoin Liquidity on Binance When it comes to the king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), one exchange stands head and shoulders above the rest in terms of liquidity: Binance. According to the CoinGecko report, which analyzed data from March 19 to May 18, Binance commanded a staggering 32% of the total BTC liquidity among the eight leading centralized exchanges. This dominance is not just a statistic; it reflects a deep and robust market where large orders can be executed with minimal slippage. The report revealed that the median market depth for BTC across these top exchanges hovered between $20–$25 million within a $100 range of Bitcoin’s price. Binance, however, significantly outpaced its competitors, demonstrating an impressive $8 million in depth on both the buy and sell sides. This means that a substantial amount of Bitcoin can be traded on Binance without causing a noticeable ripple in its price, making it an ideal venue for large-volume traders and institutions. Key Bitcoin Liquidity Figures (March 19 – May 18): Binance: $8 million (32% of total BTC liquidity) Bitget: $4.6 million OKX: $3.7 million This concentrated Bitcoin liquidity on Binance reinforces its position as the go-to platform for BTC trading. For traders, this translates into tighter spreads, faster execution, and overall more efficient trading experiences. For the broader market, it signifies a healthy and stable environment for Bitcoin, as large movements are less likely to destabilize its price. Bitget’s Ascendancy in Altcoin Liquidity While Binance reigns supreme in Bitcoin, the CoinGecko report brings another exciting development to the forefront: Bitget’s remarkable leadership in the altcoin liquidity market. For cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitget has carved out a dominant position, surpassing even established players like Binance and OKX. This is a significant achievement for Bitget, indicating its growing influence and specialized focus on providing robust trading environments for a diverse range of alternative cryptocurrencies. Altcoins, by their nature, can be more volatile and have shallower markets than Bitcoin. Therefore, strong liquidity in these assets is even more crucial to prevent price manipulation and ensure fair trading conditions. Why Bitget Excels in Altcoins: Diverse Offerings: Bitget has consistently expanded its altcoin listings, attracting a wider range of traders. Targeted Campaigns: The exchange likely employs strategies to incentivize altcoin trading, fostering deeper markets. User Experience: A focus on seamless trading for a variety of assets can draw in altcoin enthusiasts. For traders specializing in altcoins, Bitget’s strong altcoin liquidity offers significant advantages. It means they can enter and exit positions more easily, with less concern about price impact, even for less common tokens. This fosters a more dynamic and accessible altcoin market, benefiting both individual traders and project developers. Understanding Market Depth : Why It Matters for Crypto Exchanges The CoinGecko report frequently refers to “market depth,” a critical concept in understanding liquidity. So, what exactly is it, and why is it so important for crypto exchanges ? Market depth refers to the ability of a market to absorb large buy or sell orders without significantly affecting the price of the asset. It’s essentially a measure of the volume of buy and sell orders at various price levels. A market with good depth has many orders on both sides of the order book, indicating strong demand and supply. This translates to: Reduced Slippage: When you place a large order, it gets filled at or very close to your desired price. Tighter Spreads: The difference between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price is smaller, meaning lower transaction costs. Price Stability: Less susceptible to large price swings from significant trades. Easier Entry/Exit: Traders can enter and exit positions quickly and efficiently. For crypto exchanges , cultivating deep markets is a competitive advantage. It attracts more traders, especially institutional players who require reliable execution for large volumes. The CoinGecko report’s focus on market depth provides a quantitative measure of how well exchanges are serving their users by providing these crucial conditions. The Broader Implications of the CoinGecko Report The findings of the CoinGecko report offer more than just a snapshot of current liquidity; they provide valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. The report underscores the growing maturity of the CEX landscape, where specialization and strategic focus are becoming increasingly evident. Key Takeaways for Traders and Investors: Choose Your Exchange Wisely: Depending on whether you primarily trade Bitcoin or a diverse portfolio of altcoins, your choice of exchange can significantly impact your trading efficiency and costs. Binance remains king for BTC, while Bitget is emerging as the leader for altcoins. Liquidity Drives Efficiency: Always prioritize exchanges with strong liquidity for the assets you trade. This minimizes slippage and ensures better execution prices. Market Maturation: The presence of deep markets, even for altcoins, signals a maturing industry. This increased liquidity can attract more institutional capital and reduce overall market volatility. Data-Driven Decisions: Reports like CoinGecko’s are invaluable tools for making informed decisions. They move beyond anecdotal evidence to provide concrete data on market health. The report also highlights the ongoing competition among crypto exchanges to attract and retain users by providing superior trading conditions. As the market continues to expand, liquidity will remain a critical factor in determining an exchange’s success and reputation. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Liquidity The insights from the CoinGecko report set the stage for future developments in the crypto market. As institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies grows, the demand for even deeper and more reliable liquidity will intensify. Exchanges that can consistently provide this will solidify their positions as industry leaders. We can anticipate a continued focus on improving market depth across a wider range of assets, not just BTC and major altcoins. Furthermore, advancements in trading technology, such as improved order matching engines and increased API capabilities, will likely contribute to even more efficient markets. The battle for liquidity among crypto exchanges is far from over, and it’s a battle that ultimately benefits the end-user through better trading experiences. Conclusion: A Liquid Future for Crypto The CoinGecko “Crypto Liquidity on CEXes 2025” report offers a compelling look into the current state of cryptocurrency liquidity.

For those observing the cryptocurrency space, understanding these broader macroeconomic currents is crucial, as they often dictate the flow of capital and investor sentiment. Recently, the US Dollar Slump sent ripples across global markets, demonstrating just how sensitive currency valuations are to perceived political interference in monetary policy. This shift highlights a fundamental truth: stability in traditional finance can be surprisingly fragile, impacting everything from trade balances to the appeal of alternative assets like digital currencies. Understanding the Genesis of the US Dollar Slump The recent weakening of the US Dollar Slump can be directly traced back to escalating tensions between then-President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump repeatedly voiced strong disapproval of the Fed’s interest rate hikes, arguing they were detrimental to the US economy and hindering his administration’s growth objectives. This unprecedented public pressure on an independent central bank created significant uncertainty among investors. Here’s a breakdown of the core issues: Undermining Independence: The Federal Reserve’s independence from political influence is considered a cornerstone of sound monetary policy. When a sitting president publicly criticizes the Fed’s decisions and even suggests replacing its chairman, it eroded confidence in the institution’s ability to make unbiased economic decisions. Interest Rate Policy Disagreement: Trump advocated for lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth and reduce the national debt’s servicing cost. Powell, conversely, pursued a path of gradual rate hikes, aiming to prevent inflation and normalize monetary policy after years of ultra-low rates post-2008 financial crisis. Investor Uncertainty: The conflict created a dilemma for market participants. Would the Fed succumb to political pressure, or would it maintain its independent stance? This uncertainty made the US Dollar less attractive, as its value is intrinsically linked to the perceived stability and predictability of US economic policy. This dynamic led to a sell-off in the dollar, as traders sought more stable havens or currencies with clearer policy outlooks. The implications extended beyond mere exchange rates, affecting global trade dynamics and commodity prices. Navigating the Turbulent Forex Market Volatility The immediate consequence of the Trump-Powell spat was a surge in Forex Market Volatility . Currency markets are highly sensitive to news and sentiment, and political commentary from a major global power like the United States can trigger rapid and significant movements. Volatility, while offering opportunities for some traders, also increases risk and uncertainty for businesses engaged in international trade and investment. Key aspects of this volatility included: Rapid Price Swings: The dollar experienced sharp declines against major currencies, often within hours of new comments or reports regarding the conflict. This made it challenging for businesses to hedge their currency exposures effectively. Increased Hedging Costs: As volatility rises, the cost of currency hedging (using financial instruments to protect against adverse currency movements) typically increases. This can eat into the profit margins of companies with significant international operations. Shift in Capital Flows: Investors began to reallocate capital away from dollar-denominated assets. This shift wasn’t just about currencies; it also impacted US Treasury bonds and equities, as the perceived risk of holding US assets increased. Understanding these dynamics is vital for anyone participating in financial markets, as the ripple effects can be far-reaching, even influencing the demand for digital assets as alternative stores of value. The Trump Powell Conflict: A Deeper Dive into Political Influence The persistent Trump Powell Conflict brought to the forefront the delicate balance between political oversight and central bank autonomy. While presidents often comment on economic conditions, direct and sustained criticism of the Fed’s operational decisions is highly unusual and can be seen as an attempt to politicize monetary policy. This particular episode underscored a fundamental tension in modern governance: how to ensure accountability without compromising the independence necessary for effective economic management. Historically, central banks are granted independence to make decisions based on economic data, free from short-term political pressures. This is believed to lead to more stable prices and sustainable economic growth. When this independence is questioned or attacked, it can have several negative consequences: Loss of Credibility: If markets believe the Fed’s decisions are politically motivated, its credibility in managing inflation and employment can diminish. Unpredictable Policy: Political interference introduces an unpredictable element into monetary policy, making it harder for businesses and investors to plan for the future. Reduced Investor Confidence: Global investors look for stability and rule of law. A perceived breakdown in the institutional independence of a major central bank can deter foreign investment. This situation was a stark reminder that even in developed economies, political factors can significantly sway financial markets, creating uncertainty that investors often seek to mitigate by diversifying their portfolios, sometimes into non-traditional assets. Analyzing Euro Sterling Gains: Beneficiaries of Dollar Weakness As the US Dollar Slump unfolded, the Euro and Sterling emerged as notable beneficiaries, recording significant gains against the greenback. This wasn’t necessarily due to overwhelming strength in the Eurozone or the UK economies themselves, but rather a relative strength derived from the dollar’s weakness. When one major currency faces headwinds, capital often flows to other liquid alternatives. Let’s consider the factors contributing to these gains: Relative Stability: Compared to the political noise surrounding the Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) maintained a more predictable stance, even amidst their own challenges (like Brexit for the UK). This relative calm made their respective currencies more appealing. Repatriation of Capital: Some investors might have moved funds from dollar-denominated assets back into Euro or Sterling assets, contributing to their appreciation. Technical Trading: In a highly interconnected Forex market, a sell-off in one major currency often triggers a corresponding buy-side for others, especially those that are highly liquid and frequently traded against the weakening currency. While the gains for the Euro and Sterling were a direct consequence of the dollar’s troubles, it’s important to remember that their long-term trajectories depend on their own economic fundamentals, including inflation, growth, and central bank policy decisions. Assessing the Broader Global Currency Impact and Future Outlook The weakening of the US Dollar, driven by the Trump Powell Conflict , has a profound Global Currency Impact . As the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant currency for international trade and finance, changes in the dollar’s value reverberate across economies. A weaker dollar generally makes US exports cheaper, potentially boosting American competitiveness, but it also makes imports more expensive, which could contribute to inflation. Consider the broader implications: Commodity Prices: Many commodities, like oil and gold, are priced in US Dollars. A weaker dollar makes these commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially increasing demand and pushing up prices in dollar terms. Emerging Markets: Many emerging market countries hold significant dollar-denominated debt. A weaker dollar can ease the burden of servicing this debt, as it becomes cheaper to repay in their local currencies. However, a volatile dollar can also create instability for these economies. Trade Balances: A weaker dollar can help reduce the US trade deficit by making American goods more competitive abroad and foreign goods more expensive domestically. Cryptocurrency Appeal: In times of significant traditional currency instability and political interference, some investors may increasingly look towards decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies as a hedge or an alternative store of value, though this is a long-term trend rather than an immediate direct consequence for most. Looking ahead, the relationship between political leaders and central banks will remain a critical factor for currency markets. Investors will continue to monitor any signs of political pressure on monetary policy, as it directly impacts confidence in a currency’s stability and its role in the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Navigating Currency Shifts For investors and businesses, understanding these currency shifts is paramount. While the specific catalysts for the US Dollar Slump might fade, the underlying principles of market reaction to political and economic pressures remain constant. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on central bank communications, government policies, and geopolitical developments. These are often the primary drivers of currency movements. Diversify Portfolios: Do not put all your eggs in one currency basket. Diversifying across different currencies, asset classes (including potentially digital assets for a portion of your portfolio), and geographical regions can mitigate risk. Consider Hedging Strategies: Businesses with significant international transactions should explore currency hedging strategies to protect against adverse exchange rate movements. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market noise driven by sentiment and long-term trends driven by fundamental economic shifts. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on temporary volatility. Consult Experts: For complex currency exposures or investment decisions, consider seeking advice from financial advisors or Forex market specialists. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions, particularly those influenced by political discourse, is a key determinant of success in the global financial landscape. Conclusion: The Enduring Impact of Political Rhetoric on Global Finance The period marked by the US Dollar Slump and the resulting Forex Market Volatility , largely triggered by the Trump Powell Conflict , served as a powerful reminder of how deeply intertwined politics and economics are. The Euro Sterling Gains , while beneficial for those holding those currencies, highlighted the reactive nature of global markets when confidence in a major currency is shaken. Ultimately, the episode underscored the fragility of market sentiment when faced with uncertainty regarding institutional independence and the potential for a significant Global Currency Impact . As we move forward, market participants will continue to scrutinize the relationship between governments and central banks, recognizing that stability and predictability are highly valued attributes in the financial world. The lessons learned from this turbulent period emphasize the importance of robust institutions and clear communication in maintaining market confidence and fostering a stable global economic environment. These macro trends continue to shape the financial world, influencing decisions across all asset classes, including the burgeoning digital asset ecosystem.

46832603,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=755904,1750954401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46832603.jpeg,Meta closes on new green energy deals to power data center locations,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-signs-energy-deals-with-invenergy/,"Social media giant Meta Platforms has signed four deals with renewable energy firm Invenergy to supply 791 MW of combined solar and wind energy capacity to power AI data centers. This comes as energy needs for data centers continue to skyrocket because of increased demand for AI services as the market turns to the tech to optimize their operations. Clean energy is essential to support AI workloads Last year, Meta inked four separate agreements with Chicago-based Invenergy, securing 760 MW of solar power, and these initial deals laid the groundwork for Thursday’s announcement, which adds another 791 MW of renewable energy. With the fresh accords, the two companies have now amassed a total of 1,800 MW under their partnership umbrella. Under the new arrangements, Invenergy will channel electricity from projects in Ohio, Arkansas and Texas into the respective local grids. Meta, in turn, will claim the renewable energy credits tied to that output as the facilities come online. Financial details of the transactions remain under wraps, though both parties described the agreements as long-term commitments aimed at spreading risk evenly while delivering value on both sides. This extension follows Meta’s broader drive to power its ever-expanding data centers, vital for AI workloads, using clean energy sources. Beyond Invenergy, Meta has sealed deals with several major solar ventures, backed a geothermal developer, and is openly soliciting bids from nuclear suppliers. The strategy underscores the firm’s dual goal: meet surging electricity needs and slash carbon footprints at once. In December last year, the social media giant was looking for a nuclear energy developer to support its innovation and sustainability objectives. The company has acknowledged the need for sustainable energy supply to keep the world connected and maintain innovations. Meta signs two EAPAs with Adapture Renewables Meta has also agreed two Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreements (EAPAs) with Adapture Renewables, set to supply 360 MW from two Texas solar parks. Unlike a straightforward power purchase agreement, an EAPA covers only the environmental benefits, renewable energy credits, while the electricity itself flows into ERCOT’s shared network. “By structuring long-term agreements that balance risk and value for both parties, we’re helping to scale meaningful projects while enabling our partners to meet their clean energy goals,” said Jesse Tippett, VP of origination at Adapture . Both solar arrays aim to begin operations in 2027. This latest move builds on a late-2023 pact, when Meta procured 333 MW AC across three Adapture-developed sites in Arkansas and Illinois. Combined, the firm has now secured nearly 700 MW from the California-based solar and storage specialist, which operates 38 projects in a dozen states with over 344 MW of capacity. Meta’s growing reliance on EAPAs highlights a trend; the tech giant favors purchasing environmental attributes to decarbonize its data center portfolio, even as it broadens its clean-energy footprint. Earlier this year, Meta signed an EAPA with Cypress Creek Renewables for 505 MW at the Hanson Solar farm in Coleman County, Texas. In January, it forged four EAPAs with Spain’s Zelestra for upcoming solar parks, and in November, it tapped Engie North America for 260 MW from the Sypert Branch project in Milam County, Texas. “Meta is always looking for opportunities to bring new renewable energy to the grid, and partnerships like this help make that possible.” Amanda Yang, co-head of clean and renewable energy at Meta. “We are excited to expand our relationship with Adapture Renewables and continue supporting projects that move the energy transition forward.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|Meta,EN,0,0,MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-26 16:13:21

Because something historic is unfolding. Each of these chains is rolling out updates and real-world use cases that finally offer a pathway to scaled adoption and a shift in how digital finance and blockchain utility are being defined. While headlines focus on token prices and short-term charts, the real momentum is forming behind the scenes: low supply mechanics, high-utility protocols, and well-capitalized development treasuries poised for the next breakout. The best crypto to buy now is about technology that serves real-world needs with precision. Qubetics ($TICS) is drawing strong interest not simply for its final-stage crypto presale, but because it directly addresses real-world problems in asset tokenization where traditional chains have stalled. From identity verification lags to fragmented real estate digitization and lack of liquidity in physical assets, past blockchains lacked the infrastructure to scale with trust. Qubetics is engineered to resolve these constraints, serving as a launchpad for tangible utility where ownership, liquidity, and access converge into a secure, on-chain experience. Qubetics ($TICS): Fixing Real World Asset Tokenization The core challenge with Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization has always been reliability, liquidity, and accessibility. Too many chains introduced half-built ecosystems that couldn’t tokenize physical assets like real estate, commodities, or art with the level of security and transparency needed. Manual verification processes, non-compliant smart contracts, and market friction have blocked wide-scale adoption. Qubetics ($TICS) approaches this differently. With a proprietary Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, it integrates verified digital ID systems, legal smart contract templates, and cross-chain bridges to tokenize assets like land deeds, precious metals, and even logistics contracts. For example, a property title can now be fractionalized, traded instantly, and locked under a compliance-ready smart contract, all verified on-chain and interoperable with major wallets and dApps. Only 9M Tokens Left: Qubetics Presale Ends Soon with $18.1M Raised Qubetics is down to its final crypto presale stage, and only 9 million tokens are still available at $0.3370. Since the presale began at just $0.01, early adopters have already seen gains of over 3,000%. Now, with over $18.1 million raised, more than 28,300 holders onboard, and 516 million tokens sold, momentum is building fast. The project recently cut its total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, creating real scarcity. At the same time, it increased public allocation to 38.55%, giving more power to the community. If you invest $10,000 in Qubetics at the current presale price of $0.3370, you would receive approximately 29,674 $TICS tokens. With the token scheduled to list at $0.40 on June 30 at 11:00 AM UTC, this offers an immediate potential return of around 20%, or a profit of $1,870. If the price reaches $5 in the medium term, the value of your investment could rise to $148,370. In a more optimistic scenario, if $TICS reaches the analyst target of $15, your $10,000 investment could grow to $445,110, representing a gain of over 4,350%. Early investors who joined at the starting price of $0.01 have already seen returns exceeding 3,000%. With only 9 million tokens remaining, a significantly reduced total supply of 1.36 billion, and the listing date approaching, this may be the final opportunity to secure Qubetics tokens before they become available on the open market. Analysts are now forecasting a post-mainnet price between $10 and $15, especially with Qubetics set to launch on a top 10 exchange on June 30 at 11 AM UTC, with a listing price of $0.40. That’s an easy 20% ROI for last-minute buyers, with long-term potential returns as high as 4,350% if $TICS hits $15. The presale ends for good on June 30 at 8 AM UTC, so this could be your final chance to buy in before Qubetics hits the open market.

Below, we explore why a six-figure BTC is plausible and highlight eight altcoins under $10 that could potentially return 20x or more in such a scenario. Why $150,000 Bitcoin is no longer a fantasy There are a few things that support the bullish thesis: Post-Halving Supply Shock: The 2024 Bitcoin halving cut new supply by half. Because of tightening supply dynamics, this has led to a 12–18-month rally in the past. Spot ETFs and Institutional Capital: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has given institutions more exposure than ever before. Companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are making it easy to invest in BTC, and a significant amount of money is still flowing into the market. Global Macro Trends: As central banks move toward looser monetary policy, risk-on assets like BTC are again appealing. This situation sets the stage for Bitcoin to aim for $150,000, potentially marking the start of one of the best altcoin seasons ever.

Strong Narratives: Tokens linked to popular areas, such as AI, gaming, DeFi, or Layer-2 solutions, can perform better when the market turns bullish. Let’s explore eight tokens under $10 that could deliver 20x returns if Bitcoin (BTC) reaches $150,000. Little Pepe: Memecoin with real Infrastructure Little Pepe, currently priced at $0.0012 in Stage 3 of its presale, is one of the market’s most technically ambitious memecoins today. Unlike traditional memecoins that rely solely on community hype, LILPEPE is backed by real infrastructure — its own Layer 2 blockchain, designed exclusively for memecoin launches. With ultra-low fees, sniper bot resistance, zero-tax trading, and lightning-fast transactions, the project delivers both meme culture and high performance. Led by anonymous developers with a track record of success in top memecoin cycles, LILPEPE is gaining serious traction. As of now, 1,664,536,298 tokens have been sold out of the 2.25 billion allocated for Stage 3, representing 73.98% progress. The team has already raised $1,822,444 out of a $2,525,000 target. The price will soon rise to $0.0013 in the next stage, ahead of the final presale price of $0.0028. In addition to its technical edge, LILPEPE is running a $777,000 giveaway campaign, where 10 lucky winners will each receive $77,000 worth of tokens. The token is confirmed for listings on two major centralized exchanges at launch, with hints of a future debut on the world’s largest exchange. Although the final listing price is yet to be disclosed, analysts speculate an initial range between $0.0035 and $0.0055. Based on the current presale price, a return of 20x or more is plausible if LILPEPE reaches its $1 billion market cap target, highlighting the asymmetric upside potential for early adopters. Render: Infrastructure for AI and metaverse growth Render is trading at approximately $2.87 and sits at the crossroads of several explosive sectors, including artificial intelligence, virtual production, and the metaverse. RNDR’s decentralized rendering network connects creators to idle GPU resources, solving a major bottleneck in digital content creation. As AI and web3 content generation scale, Render’s unique offering could gain serious traction. A 20x surge would place RNDR around $57, reflecting the explosive growth in GPU demand. Injective Protocol: Scalable DeFi layer-1 Injective (INJ) currently trades at $9.88 and has positioned itself as a powerhouse for building high-performance DeFi applications, especially derivatives. Its Layer-1 architecture features fast finality, interoperates with other chains, and enables trading without gas fees. INJ could grow rapidly as decentralized finance evolves with new applications and more institutions adopt it. A 20x price move would bring it to nearly $200, in line with previous DeFi breakouts from smaller valuations. Sui: High-speed layer-1 with object-oriented architecture Sui, priced at $2.51, is a relatively new entrant quickly gaining attention due to its unique object-based storage and programming model. Built using the Move language, initially developed by Facebook’s Libra team, SUI enables parallel transaction execution for massive scalability. It’s attracting developers who are building advanced dApps in DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Should its ecosystem continue expanding and Bitcoin catalyze another L1 narrative, SUI reaching $50 is well within the realm of possibility. VeChain: Enterprise blockchain for supply chain and RWAs VeChain is priced at a modest $0.019 but offers strong fundamentals with an enterprise-first approach. VET’s blockchain is being utilized for logistics, anti-counterfeiting, and carbon tracking across various industries. As the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) becomes a major trend in the crypto world, VeChain’s partnerships with companies like Walmart China and BMW may provide the credibility and utility needed for a breakout. A 20x rally would bring VET close to $0.40, which is still a reasonable price, considering its historical price. Conclusion: The time for strategic exposure is now It’s now more possible than ever for Bitcoin to reach $150,000 because of lower supply, growing institutional demand, and better overall economic conditions. If this happens, altcoins that cost less than $10 could see huge gains. A mix of infrastructure tokens, such as Injective and Render, as well as speculative plays like Little Pepe and Dogecoin, could provide the most exposure to various sectors. XRP and ADA provide regulatory and academic strength, respectively, while SUI and VeChain highlight novel and enterprise-level use cases.

This achievement not only surpassed its initial $150 million target but also signals a robust confidence in the evolving landscape of crypto-finance startups . For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, this development isn’t just news; it’s a beacon, illuminating the path forward for innovation at the critical intersection of traditional finance and groundbreaking digital technologies. Galaxy Digital’s Strategic Vision: Powering the Future of Finance Under the visionary leadership of Michael Novogratz, Galaxy Digital has consistently positioned itself as a pivotal player in the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem. This latest fundraising success for their venture arm underscores their strategic commitment to fostering the next generation of financial innovation. The oversubscription of the fund, exceeding its target by $25 million, speaks volumes about investor appetite for exposure to nascent yet disruptive technologies that promise to reshape global finance. It’s a clear indicator that institutional capital is increasingly recognizing the long-term value and transformative power inherent in the digital asset space. Galaxy Digital’s approach isn’t merely about capital deployment; it’s about identifying and nurturing companies that are building the foundational layers and innovative applications for a decentralized future. Their comprehensive suite of services, spanning trading, asset management, investment banking, and principal investments, provides them with a unique vantage point to identify promising opportunities and add significant value beyond just funding. This integrated strategy positions Galaxy Digital not just as an investor, but as a strategic partner in the growth journey of these emerging ventures. Fueling Innovation: Investing in Cutting-Edge Crypto-Finance Startups The core focus of this new venture fund is to invest in companies operating at the nexus of traditional finance and crypto. This isn’t just a buzzword; it represents a critical frontier where established financial paradigms are being reimagined and enhanced by blockchain technology. Think about the potential for more efficient cross-border payments, tokenized real-world assets, decentralized lending platforms, and new forms of digital identity verification. These are the areas where true disruption can occur, bridging the gap between legacy systems and the promise of Web3. Galaxy Digital has already begun deploying capital from this fund, with approximately $50 million already invested in two notable projects: Monad: An EVM-compatible blockchain project that aims to significantly enhance transaction throughput and efficiency. By offering a high-performance alternative, Monad could unlock new possibilities for complex decentralized applications (dApps) that require speed and scalability. Their focus on parallel execution for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a game-changer for developers and users alike, promising a smoother and more responsive blockchain experience. Ethena (ENA): A stablecoin protocol that introduces a synthetic dollar, USDe, backed by staked Ethereum and corresponding short perpetual positions. Ethena offers a censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable digital asset that is independent of traditional banking infrastructure. This innovative approach to stablecoins provides a crucial building block for the broader DeFi ecosystem, offering stability without reliance on fiat reserves. These early investments highlight Galaxy Digital’s commitment to supporting both infrastructure-level innovations (like Monad) and application-layer protocols (like Ethena) that are essential for the maturation and widespread adoption of the crypto-finance landscape. The Anatomy of a Successful Venture Fund: Beyond the Numbers Raising a venture fund of this magnitude, especially in the often-volatile crypto market, is a testament to strong investor confidence and a compelling investment thesis. While the $175 million figure is impressive, understanding the ‘why’ behind its success offers deeper insights. Investors are increasingly seeking exposure to high-growth sectors, and crypto-finance, despite its inherent risks, offers unparalleled potential for returns for those with a long-term vision. Key factors contributing to the fund’s success likely include: Experienced Leadership: Michael Novogratz and the Galaxy Digital team bring a wealth of experience from both traditional finance and crypto, instilling confidence in potential limited partners. Clear Investment Thesis: A well-defined focus on the intersection of traditional finance and crypto provides clarity and targets a massive addressable market. Proven Track Record: Galaxy Digital’s previous investments and market activities likely contributed to a positive track record, attracting further capital. Strategic Network: Access to a vast network of entrepreneurs, developers, and institutional players within both the traditional and digital finance realms. For the recipient startups, securing funding from a firm like Galaxy Digital offers far more than just capital. It provides validation, access to a deep pool of industry expertise, strategic guidance, and invaluable networking opportunities that can accelerate their growth trajectory and navigate complex market dynamics. Impact on the Digital Assets Landscape: A Catalyst for Growth? The infusion of $175 million specifically targeting digital assets and crypto-finance ventures is poised to have a significant ripple effect across the entire ecosystem. This capital injection will: Accelerate Innovation: Funding enables startups to hire top talent, invest in research and development, and bring their products to market faster. Foster Market Maturity: As more robust and compliant solutions emerge, the digital asset market becomes more appealing to a broader range of institutional and retail investors. Bridge Traditional Finance: Investments in companies that aim to integrate crypto with traditional financial systems are crucial for mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity. Attract Further Investment: Success stories from this fund can attract even more venture capital and institutional money into the digital asset space. In a market still finding its footing after recent volatilities, such a substantial investment signals a renewed institutional confidence. It suggests that despite the cyclical nature of crypto, the underlying technological revolution and its potential to transform finance remain a compelling long-term bet for sophisticated investors. Beyond Capital: The Strategic Value of Blockchain Investment When a firm like Galaxy Digital makes a blockchain investment , it’s not just about writing a check. It’s about a strategic commitment to the foundational technology that underpins the entire digital asset space. Blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency, security, and efficiency, and its applications extend far beyond cryptocurrencies to areas like supply chain management, digital identity, and intellectual property rights. Galaxy Digital’s deep engagement with its portfolio companies means providing strategic guidance on everything from product development and market fit to regulatory compliance and scaling operations. This hands-on approach is particularly valuable in the rapidly evolving blockchain sector, where navigating technological shifts and regulatory uncertainties requires specialized expertise. Their investment decisions are not merely financial bets but strategic moves to shape the future direction of decentralized technologies and their integration into the global economy. Benefits and Challenges of Investing in Crypto-Finance Startups Investing in the nascent crypto-finance sector comes with both immense opportunities and unique challenges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for all stakeholders. Benefits Challenges High Growth Potential: Early-stage crypto companies can offer exponential returns if successful, capitalizing on a rapidly expanding market. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving and often unclear regulatory landscape poses significant risks for new ventures. Disruptive Innovation: Opportunity to back technologies that fundamentally change traditional financial systems. Market Volatility: Crypto markets are notoriously volatile, impacting valuations and investor sentiment. First-Mover Advantage: Supporting pioneering projects can establish leadership in emerging sub-sectors. Technological Risks: The rapid pace of innovation means some technologies may become obsolete quickly. Diversification: Offers a unique asset class for portfolio diversification, distinct from traditional equities. Talent Acquisition: Finding and retaining top talent with specialized blockchain and crypto expertise can be challenging. Global Reach: Crypto projects inherently have a global user base, expanding market opportunities. Security Risks: Vulnerabilities in smart contracts or platforms can lead to significant financial losses. Actionable Insights for Entrepreneurs and Investors For aspiring entrepreneurs in the crypto-finance space, Galaxy Digital’s fund is a clear signal: build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto. Focus on regulatory compliance, scalability, and security from day one. For investors, this development highlights the continued institutional interest in digital assets, suggesting that strategic, long-term investments in well-vetted projects can yield substantial rewards. Diversify your exposure and prioritize projects with strong teams, clear use cases, and robust technology. A New Era of Digital Finance Dawns Galaxy Digital’s successful raise of $175 million for its venture fund is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of the trajectory of crypto-finance startups and the broader digital assets ecosystem. By strategically deploying capital into promising ventures like Monad and Ethena, Galaxy Digital is not only backing individual companies but is actively contributing to the infrastructure and applications that will define the next generation of global finance. This substantial blockchain investment serves as a critical bridge, connecting the established world of traditional finance with the revolutionary potential of decentralized technologies. It signals a new era of growth, innovation, and institutional confidence, propelling the industry towards greater maturity and widespread adoption.

Attention is shifting from the familiar blue-chip altcoins to under-the-radar assets that offer fresh momentum and narrative-driven potential. Avalanche (AVAX), Ripple’s XRP, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are top of mind—but an emerging contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is beginning to steal the spotlight among low-cap gems. AVAX: Battling Resistance, Backed by Ecosystem Growth AVAX surged over 8% in late June, touching $18.64 before pulling back to $18.03. Despite this rally, the technical picture remains cautious, with 71% bearish sentiment and stiff resistance just under $18.50. A breakout could carry it to $22.14, but failure to hold current support risks a retreat to $15.50—or even $10.50. Still, Avalanche remains a strong contender in the DeFi and gaming sectors, supported by growing real-world asset tokenization efforts. Institutional holders are staying put, while retail sentiment wavers. Key challenges include a high staking threshold and security concerns around validator penalties. XRP: Regulatory Clarity Drives Institutional Confidence XRP is trading near $2.18 following an 8.9% surge tied to its legal clarity in the U.S.—a major advantage in today’s regulatory climate. With courts confirming XRP is not a security in secondary markets, institutional adoption is on the rise. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) just rolled out a major upgrade, introducing features like token escrows, permissioned decentralized exchanges, and batch transaction support. These developments, showcased at the recent APEX 2025 summit, bolster XRP’s enterprise positioning. Analysts are eyeing a potential breakout above $2.60, which could open the door to $3.30 and beyond. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community Resilience and Layer-2 Innovation SHIB has bounced back 17% from recent lows and is currently consolidating around $0.00001168. The rebound was powered by massive whale accumulation—over 10.4 trillion SHIB in one day. A breakout above $0.00001175 could push prices toward $0.0000120, while support holds around $0.0000110. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is picking up serious momentum. Shibarium, its Layer-2 network, is already making waves by delivering faster and more affordable transactions—a big win for users diving into DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. Meanwhile, the recent launch of the Shib Alpha Layer brings a cutting-edge twist with encrypted smart contracts, pushing the project deeper into privacy and scalability. On top of that, the rollout of ShibDAO gives the community real decision-making power, turning holders into active participants in the project’s future. Strategic moves like teaming up with DeLorean Labs are also helping SHIB bridge the gap between crypto and real-world utility. Despite market volatility, SHIB’s growing utility and strong community foundation make it a token to watch. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Star of 2025? As traders look beyond saturated markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum as a breakout candidate in the low-cap altcoin space. The crypto community is quickly interacting with MAGACOIN FINANCE, and forums and social media feeds are overflowing with enthusiasm. Analysts are also paying attention, and many see its unique approach, close-knit community, and growing visibility as signs that something big might be on the horizon. What really sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its commitment to doing things right—prioritizing transparency, rock-solid security, and a truly community-driven model. The fact that it’s already been fully audited by HashEx gives it an added layer of trust in a space where that matters more than ever. With new product launches just around the corner, interest is building fast. The project’s bold branding, thoughtful design, and strong early support are creating serious momentum—and a growing sense that traders don’t want to miss out. Unlike many other altcoins that are slow to adapt or overly dependent on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is backed by tangible developments and a clear roadmap. As capital continues to rotate out of legacy altcoins in search of agility and upside potential, many believe MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself for a major breakout in Q3 and Q4 of 2025.

Markets are up, with the S&P 500 near record levels, as traders are betting on rate cuts. On Thursday, June 26, Dow Jones led the market rally, up 343 points, or 0.80%. At the same time, the S&P 500 was up 0.65%, trading at 6,132 points, approaching the February record high of 6,144 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.70%. Dow Jones Industrial Average heatmap | Source: TipRanks Nvidia continues to rally after reaching an all-time high on Wednesday. The company reclaimed the top spot among all global firms by market cap, surpassing Microsoft at $3.77 trillion. The stock’s surge had also triggered a rally among other semiconductor firms across Asia. Stock markets have largely absorbed the end of Middle East tensions, and are now looking at the Federal Reserve for cues. In this context, Thursday’s labor market data was seen as a good sign, especially for risk stocks. The Department of Labor’s survey showed that insured unemployment claims were at 1.974 million. The figure rose by 37,000 from the revised levels of last week. What is more, this was the highest level of insured unemployment since November 2021, at the height of the pandemic. Fed to finally cut rates? Weak labor market statistics, while bad for the economy in general, may push the Fed to cut interest rates. This news comes after continued pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Trump stated that he was close to picking a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump openly criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates. Still, the President shied away from directly stating that he would replace Powell before the end of his term in 2026. In any case, Powell consistently resisted pressures from the White House, defending the Fed’s independence.

According to an announcement on June 26, crypto exchange Kraken has rolled out Krak, a peer-to-peer global money app designed to handle cross-border payments across 110 countries using over 300 fiat and digital assets. The move signals Kraken’s most aggressive push yet beyond crypto trading, positioning it as a direct competitor to fintech giants that have long dominated cross-border transactions. You might also like: Zilliqa transitions to 2.0 with full EVM support and protocol overhaul Can Krak be the first real crypto-fintech hybrid? Kraken’s decision to launch Krak stems from a long-simmering frustration with the frictions baked into modern finance. The timing is strategic. As regulators crack down on opaque crypto services, Kraken is leveraging its existing compliance infrastructure to offer something most crypto startups can’t: a seamless, regulated way to move value globally. “We built and launched the Krak app because the financial system has been stuck in the past, and we think it’s time to do something about it. With Krak, we’re taking a bold step toward rebuilding what we consider to be the most important layer of the global economy: How people move and use money,” Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-CEO, said. Unlike traditional fintech apps, Krak eliminates two major friction points: bank details and wallet addresses. Instead, users can send funds via “Kraktags, “personalized identifiers that function like a crypto-friendly Venmo handle. This sidesteps the risk of mistyping a 42-character Ethereum address or sharing sensitive IBAN details. At launch, users can also open two distinct types of accounts: one for spending and another for earning. Eligible balances in USDG, a stablecoin tied to the Global Dollar Network, will accrue up to 4.1% annually, with additional yield opportunities across 20+ digital assets. But the real differentiator is asset flexibility. Where PayPal and CashApp silo fiat and crypto, Krak treats them interchangeably. A user in Nigeria can receive euros from a German friend, convert them to USDT within the app, and pay a local vendor in naira, all without intermediary fees eating into the transaction. For markets with volatile currencies or capital controls, this could be transformative. For PayPal and CashApp, that’s a problem. For users tired of paying $5 to send $50 across borders, it might just be the solution.

The individuals were recruited through social media and dating platforms and persuaded to send money under false pretenses, such as medical emergencies or legal fees. Authorities said one Massachusetts victim unknowingly received funds from five others and then transferred the money to Nwadavid via cryptocurrency. The transactions were processed through LocalBitcoins, an online peer-to-peer platform. Nwadavid allegedly directed the transfers while abroad using online access credentials. He was indicted in January 2024 and arrested in April 2025 upon arrival at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport from the United Kingdom. Security Company Accused of Moving $123M via Crypto Australian authorities recently charged four people in connection with an alleged A$190 million (~US$123 million) laundering scheme involving cryptocurrency and a Gold Coast security firm. The group moved illicit funds through courier services and converted them into crypto, blending them with legitimate business revenue. The network used dead drops in multiple cities and air transport to move cash into Queensland. Some of the funds were funneled through a car dealership and a sales promotion company. Authorities seized around A$21 million (~US$13 million) in assets, including 17 properties and several vehicles, and carried out 14 search warrants in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Law enforcement agencies are expanding cross-border coordination and blockchain surveillance to track crypto-linked fraud. Peer-to-peer platforms and foreign exchanges often limit recovery, especially when victims are used to move funds unknowingly. Authorities warn that enforcement tools are still catching up. While blockchain data offers visibility, gaps in regulation and technical capacity continue to hinder timely intervention. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How was the scam structured across multiple victims? Victims were recruited separately, but one was used to channel funds from others. This layering technique helped obscure the source and destination of the money. What sentencing could Nwadavid face? He faces up to 20 years for each count, as well as fines, restitution, and deportation following any sentence. Are romance scams increasingly linked to crypto? Yes. Law enforcement has observed a growing trend of using cryptocurrency to launder proceeds from relationship-based fraud.

However, it has delivered mixed results for its community since its launch. Once a major focus for speculative trading, it has been under a lot of selling pressure in recent weeks, which has seen the price dip over 26% in the past month alone. Despite this selling pressure, small PEPE investors remain hopeful. Meanwhile, the whales have been dumping their tokens amid the bearish conditions in the current market. That has made the dream of a rise to $1 an even more distant one. Amid this drop in the price of PEPE, investors are looking elsewhere for growth. According to analysts, a good number of PEPE whales are streaming into the next source of growth in the crypto sector. Their focus right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project that is packed full of utility. The project is forecast to deliver some massive gains for its community, with analysts projecting gains of 22x or higher when the tokens go live. So far, the MUTM token presale has been a massive success, which has bolstered analysts’ confidence in their predictions. The MUTM Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $11.2 million in its ongoing presale so far. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03 each, which is a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The presale price has been going up since phase 1, when tokens were selling for $0.01. This gradual price increase is expected to continue until the listing price of $0.06. It is designed to ensure that the earliest supporters of the project get the biggest gains. Tokens in the current phase are going for a 50% discount on the planned listing price, which has been a major driver of participation. So far, around 12,450 buyers have secured their MUTM tokens in the presale. Due to the massive discount, 50% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, less than a month after they launched. Another major catalyst for the presale is the expected launch of a beta version of the platform on day one of the token listing. This beta version launch is forecast to generate a lot of organic discussions on social media, which will boost visibility for the MUTM tokens. As people explore the beta platform and discover all the wonderful features that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has to offer, it will inspire them to add to their piles. Additionally, it will convince doubters that this is a genuine project, and they will finally get their tokens, minus the 50% discount that is available in the current phase of the presale. Besides the beta version launch, the fact that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is CertiK audited has been a critical factor in the success of the presale so far. The project has received a Token Scan Score of 95 from CertiK, which continues to drive presale participation numbers to new heights. Details Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a blockchain-based lending protocol where users can participate as borrowers, lenders, or liquidators. As lenders, they deposit their funds in the protocol to earn interest as passive income. The interest, or annual percentage yield (APY), is based on the pool utilization rate. As the activity in a given pool rises due to borrowers taking loans, the interest rate in that pool starts to rise. That pushes borrowers to repay their loans, while also incentivizing lenders to deposit more assets in the pool to benefit from the rising yields in the pool. The process raises liquidity in the pools, which ensures the long-term stability of the ecosystem. At the same time, it lowers the interest rate, which attracts borrowers to take affordable loans. This process creates a positive feedback loop that ensures optimal capital efficiency. The protocol features numerous protections for lenders’ capital. One of these protections is overcollateralization, which entails borrowers depositing assets of a higher value than the loan they take. The exact level of the overcollateralization is based on various factors individual to each asset. For instance, when USDT is used as collateral, 1 USDT may be allowed to borrow up to 75% of its actual value. The reason for this is that USDT is known to be stable and poses no challenges for the protocol’s stability. For another asset that has higher volatility, that level might be placed at around 40%. This ensures that there is enough of a buffer to deal with any sudden dips in the value of collateral by liquidators. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an awesome project, and the MUTM tokens could be your best bet at massive gains in 2025. With a 50% discount available right now, this is one opportunity you should not miss.

With both tokens aiming to surpass their all-time highs, a thrilling race is unfolding. This article delves into the current trends and potential for each coin, offering insights into which might dominate the market first. Uniswap Price Dynamics Show Volatility in Recent Months Uniswap experienced a notable rebound over the past month with prices climbing by 10.54%, contrasting with a steep drop of 46.06% over the last six months. Prices ranged between $4.62 and $7.58 recently, suggesting a fast recovery phase following a prolonged downturn. The overall price movement over these periods reflects sharp shifts in market sentiment without settling into a consistent pattern, highlighting the coin's volatile behavior in its recent history. Current trading levels show solid support at $3.20 and first resistance at $9.12, with a second support at $0.239 and higher resistance at $12.08. The coin is trading in a price corridor that hints at a lack of a clear long-term trend. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator (-0.0483) and Momentum (-0.238) lean mildly negative, while the relative strength index at 53.19 and moving average recommendation of 0.4 point to some resilience amid uncertainty. The market appears unsettled, with bears showing strength to dampen momentum, yet bulls are ready to capitalize on the support zone. Traders could aim for smaller gains by buying near support and watching for a breakout near the $9.12 resistance level, while setting stops just below key supports to manage risks. Aave Price Snapshot: Past Trends and Key Levels Aave 's trading activity over the recent month shows a slight drop of 2.51%, while the half-year performance reflects a more significant decline of 19.49%. The price range has been contained between approximately $179 and $299, indicating relatively stable, albeit downward, behavior. The past observations suggest that the coin experienced steady pressure, with lower ranges forming a base over time. The historical performance hints at persistent bearish behavior, as the decline over six months underscores the influence of sustained selling pressure. Current trading conditions display a price still confined within key levels. Immediate support appears at nearly $112, while the main resistance is found around $350; a second resistance level is set near $470. Oscillator tools indicate a lack of strong bullish drive, even though the Relative Strength Index remains neutral. The market currently shows no clear long-term trend, leaving bulls and bears in a cautious stand-off. Aave traders may consider buying close to the support level, aiming for small gains on upward moves toward the initial resistance, while being mindful of the risk of a breakdown if the price falls further. Conclusion Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) both have strong potential for growth. UNI's innovative features and growing user base give it an edge in the decentralized finance space. AAVE's robust lending platform and loyal community support its continued success. Both coins show promise but face different market dynamics. UNI could break its all-time high with continued upgrades and broader adoption. AAVE has its own strengths positioned to regain its peak with consistent development and strategic partnerships. Both are poised for significant gains, and either could outperform based on future market conditions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

After a period of consolidation, price action is tightening, and technical indicators are flashing signals of an impending move. Whether it’s a surge to the upside or a sharp reversal, the setup is in place, and momentum is building. XRP looks loaded and ready to make its next move. Volume Remains Subdued — Calm Before The Storm? XRP price remains trapped inside a long-standing triangle, a pattern known for building pressure before sharp directional moves. The chart shows that sellers continue to push lower highs, compressing price action toward a support level. Related Reading: XRP Price Trades Sideways — Bulls Preparing for Next Push? Parshwa Turakhiya pointed out on X that the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) cluster between $2.17 and $2.23 is the key breakout zone capping any upward momentum. A clean break above this range could trigger a bullish reversal. On the other hand, $2.09 is the last line of defense for the bulls. If this level fails, the structure breaks down, and XRP could swiftly drop to $1.85. Despite the building tension, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, which Parshwa Turakhiya describes as “the calm before the volatility storm.” The chart structure suggests that a move is imminent. With early July just ahead, Parshwa Turakhiya warns that a breakout or breakdown is coming, and it won’t be subtle. XRP is on the edge of eruption. Fabio Zuccara stated that Dr. Profit, known for his sharp and historically accurate calls on XRP at $0.15, $0.38, and $0.50, has now projected a new mid-term target of $4.00. In a weekly chart shared via social media, XRP is forming a bullish structure, with a green arrow projecting a continuation move to the upside. Zuccara outlined a crucial level for maintaining the bullish trajectory. This rebound adds strength to the outlook, suggesting that momentum is building in favor of the bulls. In the same vein, SquirtleCharts revealed that XRP’s 4-hour chart has mapped out a precise path toward $3.00 target, with several resistance levels standing in the way, and each level varies in difficulty. The first is $2.22, the easy one, a weak resistance point that XRP could clear without much effort. Next is $2.33, which SquirtleCharts labels as “a lot harder,” signaling a barrier that may require volume and conviction to break. The $2.48 level is “not too bad,” a moderate resistance area that might slow the rally but not be a roadblock. Finally, the $2.65 is the “pretty hard,” a zone where bulls may face challenges. Perfect Technical Structure Sets Stage For Explosive Breakout Massive move incoming for XRP. After a clean bounce off the $2.00 support level, the setup is aligning perfectly on the daily chart. Related Reading: XRP Pullback Nearly Complete—Next Stop: $8 To $12, Says Analyst Sara emphasizes that the chart structure looks flawless, with price action respecting critical zones and now coiling for an explosive breakout, with momentum building and bulls defending the support zone.

In a significant move, Swedish-listed firm Bitcoin Treasury Capital has announced a substantial purchase, signaling a growing trend of institutional players embracing the digital gold. Bitcoin Treasury Capital: A Bold New Era of Corporate Strategy Unveiled In an exciting development shared via their official X account, Bitcoin Treasury Capital has officially embarked on what they term a “long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy.” This strategic initiative kicked off with the acquisition of 66 Bitcoin (BTC). The total value of this BTC purchase stands at approximately $7 million USD, or 66 million Swedish kronor (SEK), with an average price per coin around $105,270. This initial investment marks a clear commitment from the Swedish firm to integrate digital assets into its core financial planning, setting a precedent for others in the European market. What exactly does a “long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy” entail? It typically involves a company holding Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, similar to how traditional companies might hold cash, gold, or bonds. The rationale often includes: Inflation Hedge: Protecting capital against the eroding effects of fiat currency inflation. Potential for Appreciation: Believing in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential for significant returns. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the corporate balance sheet to reduce overall portfolio risk. Why This BTC Purchase Matters for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The decision by Bitcoin Treasury Capital is more than just a single transaction; it’s a powerful statement in the ongoing narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption . For years, Bitcoin was primarily seen as a retail investment or a speculative asset. However, the landscape has dramatically shifted. Major corporations, investment funds, and even sovereign nations are now exploring or actively engaging with Bitcoin. This growing trend underscores a maturing market and increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Consider the impact of other companies that have adopted similar strategies: MicroStrategy: Perhaps the most vocal advocate, MicroStrategy has amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin, turning its corporate strategy into a de facto Bitcoin holding company. Their commitment has often influenced market sentiment. Tesla: While their holdings have fluctuated, Tesla’s initial purchase brought immense mainstream attention to corporate Bitcoin holdings. These examples illustrate that holding Bitcoin is no longer a fringe idea but a legitimate consideration for forward-thinking companies. The move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital adds another reputable name to this growing list, particularly from the European financial sector. Navigating the Bitcoin Strategy Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities While the prospects of a robust Bitcoin strategy are appealing, companies embarking on this journey must also contend with various challenges. The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market is often cited as a primary concern. Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, which can impact a company’s financial statements and investor perception. Other challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential risks related to compliance and future policy changes. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large sums of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks or theft. This often involves partnering with specialized custodians. Accounting and Reporting: Integrating Bitcoin into traditional accounting frameworks can be complex, requiring careful consideration of how to value and report these digital assets. Despite these hurdles, the opportunities presented by a well-executed Bitcoin strategy are compelling. Companies that strategically allocate capital to Bitcoin may position themselves for substantial long-term growth, tap into new investor bases, and demonstrate innovation in their treasury management practices. The potential for Bitcoin to act as a hedge against global economic instability or as a store of value continues to attract corporate interest. What Does This Mean for Your Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The strategic move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital offers valuable insights for other corporations contemplating or expanding their corporate Bitcoin holdings . It highlights the importance of a clear, long-term vision rather than short-term speculation. Before making such a significant investment, companies should conduct thorough due diligence, which includes: Risk Assessment: Understanding and mitigating the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility and security. Custodial Solutions: Exploring reputable third-party custodians that offer institutional-grade security for digital assets. Legal and Tax Implications: Consulting with legal and tax experts to navigate the complex regulatory environment in their respective jurisdictions. Stakeholder Communication: Clearly articulating the rationale and strategy to investors, employees, and the public to ensure transparency and build confidence. This strategic step by a Swedish-listed firm serves as a powerful example of how traditional businesses are adapting to the digital asset revolution. It underscores a growing conviction that Bitcoin is not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in how value is stored and managed globally. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Bitcoin Treasury Capital ‘s decisive $7 million investment in Bitcoin marks a significant milestone, not just for the company itself, but for the broader acceptance of digital assets within corporate finance. This bold move signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. As more institutions follow suit, the landscape of global treasury management is set to evolve, with Bitcoin increasingly taking center stage. This development reinforces the idea that strategic corporate Bitcoin holdings are becoming an essential component of a forward-thinking financial strategy.

According to Bhandari, the US's establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve and Bhutan's national mining initiatives present a significant window of opportunity for India. The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, launched under the administration of US President Donald Trump in January 2025, brought digital assets to the global economic agenda. The reserve, which reached over $20 billion as of June 2025, shows that Bitcoin is increasingly positioned as a store of value. Within the scope of the reserve, the US evaluates the approximately 200,000 BTC seized as a buffer against inflation. At the Crypto Summit held at the White House last month, it was announced that Bitcoin purchases would continue with budget-friendly methods to expand this reserve. Three states have already enacted laws allowing Bitcoin purchases with public funds. These developments reveal that Bitcoin has begun to be evaluated as a financial resistance tool. Related News: While Everyone Expects a Rate Cut in September, Morgan Stanley Makes a Surprise Prediction! Announces 2025 and 2026 Forecasts! Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin with hydroelectric resources since 2021, has accumulated a reserve of over $1 billion as of May 2025. This reserve helps the country finance public services and contributes to its sustainable development goals. India is far ahead of Bhutan in terms of renewable energy capacity and has the potential to implement a similar mining model at scale, but regulatory infrastructure and institutional readiness remain a challenge. India is currently among the countries that tax cryptocurrencies but do not regulate them clearly. India, which led the crypto working group established under the leadership of the IMF during its 2023 G20 presidency, has played an important role in the formation of global standards, but is cautious about domestic regulations. The classification of Bitcoin as a capital asset by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) further strengthens the need for a clear legal framework in India. Regulations will both boost investor confidence and pave the way for institutional adoption. *This is not investment advice.

Speaking with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang, Marc said, “All of us have to get our head around this idea that AI could do things, that before, we were doing, and we can move on to do higher value work.” According to CNBC, tech firms across the board are doing the same thing. Companies are slashing headcount, cutting costs, and letting AI fill the gaps. Klarna’s CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, said the company has shrunk its workforce by 40%, pointing directly to AI investments. Over at Amazon, Andy Jassy also said roles will disappear as the company leans into automation. CrowdStrike is heading in the same direction. Everyone’s chasing speed and savings, even if it means clearing out human employees. Marc says AI is 93% accurate but not flawless Marc calls this a “digital labor revolution.” He claims Salesforce’s in-house models are now running with 93% accuracy, but he’s not pretending they’re perfect. “It’s pretty good,” he said, but “it’s not realistic” to expect 100%. He also said rival firms are nowhere near that level because they don’t have the kind of data and metadata Salesforce does. That’s his not-so-subtle flex that volume wins in the AI race. Still, there’s a catch. Not all AI is built equal. And not all projects are going well. Research firm Gartner is already predicting that over 40% of “agentic AI” projects will be canceled by the end of 2027. The reasons? Projects are expensive, the results are foggy, and risk controls are weak. Some of these tools are just hype wrapped in buzzwords. Anushree Verma, who’s a Senior Director Analyst at Gartner, didn’t hold back. She said, “Most agentic AI projects right now are early stage experiments or proof of concepts that are mostly driven by hype and are often misapplied.” She warned that this obsession with experimenting is stalling deployments and blocking production. The problem, she says, is people jumping into AI without knowing what the heck they’re doing. Agentic AI gets hype but low investment and even lower results During a Gartner webinar in January 2025, 3,412 people were asked how much they’ve put into agentic AI. Only 19% had made serious investments. 42% had gone in cautiously. 8% haven’t touched it at all. The other 31% are either unsure or sitting back to watch. Not exactly confidence-inspiring. Part of the problem is what Gartner calls “agent washing.” Vendors are rebranding their old junk—chatbots, RPAs, AI assistants—and slapping the agentic AI label on it. Out of the thousands of vendors, Gartner says only 130 are the real deal. The rest are noise. Verma said: “Most agentic AI propositions lack significant value or return on investment (ROI), as current models don’t have the maturity and agency to autonomously achieve complex business goals or follow nuanced instructions over time.” Translation: it’s mostly fluff. Gartner says even the stuff that’s technically agentic doesn’t always belong there. A bunch of the current use cases being paraded around don’t even require agents. It’s marketing, not engineering. And most companies are just pouring money into undercooked tech. Despite that, Gartner predicts that by 2028, 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously through agentic AI. It was literally 0% in 2024. Gartner also thinks 33% of enterprise software will come packed with agentic AI features by that same year, a huge surge from less than 1% today. But to get there, tech teams have work to do. Integrating agents into old platforms is messy. It breaks workflows and costs a ton to patch up.

The venture fund will be utilized to invest in early-stage companies that are working on the stablecoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) segments. Tangible Blockchain Use Cases Focus Mike Giampapa, general partner at Galaxy Digital, said the fund will invest in projects that bridge traditional finance and crypto. “You’re seeing this fundamental shift from more speculative use cases of blockchains to something that’s much more tangible,” he explained. The firm has already deployed $50 million from the fund, including investments in Monad, a high-performance blockchain, and Ethena, a stablecoin protocol offering yield-bearing dollar assets. Galaxy Expands Its Crypto Footprint Galaxy Digital, founded by Mike Novogratz, continues to further its involvement in various facets of the crypto universe, from venture capital to mining and asset management. The firm had $7 billion in assets under management as of May, most of which was linked to crypto start-ups. In addition to the new fund, Galaxy is also looking for conventional financial products derived from crypto. On June 25, the company, in partnership with Invesco, filed an S-1 with the SEC on behalf of the Invesco Galaxy Solana Trust, reflecting the growing interest in approved crypto investment products. Institutional Confidence in Crypto Grows Positive developments in the regulation of U.S. crypto are also encouraging more financial institutions and venture capital funds to commit to blockchain technology. Galaxy Digital’s aggressive expansion positions it at the forefront of shaping the future of the financial industry. As institutional demand for blockchain technologies is increasing, Galaxy’s strategic investments in stablecoins and DeFi speak volumes of solid belief in up-and-coming crypto infrastructure alongside fundamental technological advancements.",Blockchain|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-26 17:34:00

In this piece, we highlight three top tokens that could outpace ETH: Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) , Chainlink (LINK), and Ripple’s XRP. Let’s explore why. Ethereum’s March Toward $5,000: A 2025 Comeback Story After hitting a cycle high of $4,100 in January, Ethereum has followed the general market trend: small bounces, followed by a notable dip. This has made its price action unimpressive. However, the launch of its Pectra Upgrade earlier in May kick-started a strong rally above $3000. After the rise, ETH fell below $2,500, but experts noted that it stayed above critical support levels, which is a sign of a positive trend on the way. Analysts said that the bounce back above $2,200 shows a strong structure. If bulls can regain the $2,400 region in the next few weeks, it may initiate a new upward trend. Ethereum Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Moreover, capital inflows have been on the horizon with whale activities and Ether ETF inflows hitting impressive heights since May. As macro conditions improve and institutional capital flows back into crypto, projections for Ethereum to test the $5,000 mark by Q4 2025 are gaining traction. However, with ETH’s gains potentially limited to 3x and delayed, lesser-cap tokens may offer higher upside with less capital. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Meme Layer 2 With Serious Utility What started as a meme coin is now one of 2025’s most serious Layer 2 contenders. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) isn’t just riding the popularity of its frog appearance; it’s building its own chain to power the meme economy. Unlike other meme coins that feast on hype, $LILPEPE is launching a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain, optimized for ultra-low gas fees, lightning-fast transactions, and for the first time, anti-sniper bot architecture. This innovation is a game-changer for meme launches, protecting communities from bots during liquidity events. The presale, which launched at $0.001 on June 10, has already raised over $3.5 million, with Stage 3 nearly sold out. Stage 4 will soon begin at $0.0014, and with two top-tier CEX listings confirmed at launch, the price action could accelerate quickly. $LILPEPE’s roadmap also includes a memes Launchpad, allowing other meme tokens to be created, launched, and scaled entirely on its chain. This adds real utility to the ecosystem, a rarity in the meme coin space. Given the hype, tech backing, and viral brand identity, $LILPEPE could easily surge 30x to 50x post-launch, with analysts eyeing price targets above $0.02 as Layer 2 adoption increases. Chainlink (LINK): Whale Activity and On-Chain Revival Fuel Optimism Chainlink has exhibited renewed volatility and upside momentum, with the price retesting the $12 mark after an intraday surge of over 6%. Whale activity has surged, with 17.85 million LINK tokens (worth approximately $149 million) transferred to Binance as part of its unlock scenario, which has often been a bullish trend.. Meanwhile, LINK has formed a descending channel since May, with $11.50 acting as a strong support base. If it breaks resistance levels at $13–$15, it could confirm a bullish reversal pattern. Chainlink Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The Stochastic RSI has dipped into oversold territory, while showing signs of convergence, another hint that a strong upward move is brewing. Should this pattern hold, LINK could reclaim higher levels, with targets around $40–$50 by the end of Q3 2025. With increased utility in oracle networks, rising DeFi integration, and smart contract adoption, LINK continues to position itself as a critical infrastructure token for the blockchain economy. Ripple (XRP): Legal Clarity and Breakout Signals Ahead XRP fell below $2 earlier this week but has since recovered and is now trading near $2.18. Bulls are protecting the $2.00 support zone. Analysts are cautiously bullish as XRP tries to break above its primary resistance levels of $2.20 and $2.35. XRP Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The coin is above the Gaussian Channel on the weekly chart, indicating that long-term bullish movements are likely to occur. If XRP rises above $2.33, it could initiate a more substantial climb toward $3 and beyond. The legal resolution with the SEC continues to gain momentum, and there is high hope for spot XRP ETFs in October. Moreover, XRP’s partnerships with major banks and payment corridors are expanding. Some traders using Elliott Wave theory have even projected that XRP will reach $9–$10, provided bullish macroeconomic conditions persist. Conclusion: Ethereum May Rise, But the Real Gains Are Elsewhere There’s no denying Ethereum’s potential to reclaim $5,000 by Q4 2025. However, for investors seeking substantial upside, smaller-cap tokens with utility, narrative, and community momentum offer significantly better risk-reward ratios. Little Pepe stands at the top of that list as a meme coin that is building real infrastructure, disrupting Layer 2s, and has already attracted millions in presale interest. Combined with LINK’s DeFi momentum and XRP’s institutional push, these tokens are poised to outperform Ethereum in the next bull cycle.

A Beginner’s Guide to Trading Platforms,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/what-is-a-crypto-exchange-a-beginners-guide-to-trading-platforms/,"Cryptocurrencies have rapidly gained popularity over the past decade, evolving from a niche concept to a global phenomenon. As digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum become increasingly mainstream, more people are looking to participate in this exciting market. At the heart of this participation are crypto exchanges—platforms that serve as gateways for buying, selling, and trading digital currencies. Whether you’re interested in investing, trading, or simply exploring the world of crypto, understanding these exchanges is crucial. This guide is designed to help beginners navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges, providing a clear and straightforward explanation of what they are, how they work, and what features to look for when choosing the right platform. By the end of this guide, you’ll have the foundational knowledge needed to confidently engage with the cryptocurrency market. What is a Crypto Exchange? A crypto exchange is an online platform that facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. These exchanges act as intermediaries, matching buyers with sellers and enabling transactions in various digital currencies. Unlike traditional financial exchanges, which deal with stocks, bonds, or commodities, crypto exchanges exclusively handle digital assets. They offer users the ability to convert fiat currency (like USD or EUR) into cryptocurrency and vice versa, as well as trade one cryptocurrency for another. This makes them essential tools for anyone looking to participate in the cryptocurrency market. Types of Crypto Exchanges Crypto exchanges come in various forms, each offering unique features and catering to different user needs. Understanding the types of crypto exchanges is essential for choosing the right platform for your trading or investment goals. Centralized Exchanges (CEX) Centralized exchanges (CEX) are the most common type of crypto exchange, operated by a central authority or company. These platforms, such as Binance and Coinbase, act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, providing a user-friendly interface and robust security features. Users trust the exchange to manage their funds, which often includes fiat-to-crypto conversions and advanced trading tools. While CEX platforms are known for their ease of use and high liquidity, they come with drawbacks such as potential security risks due to centralization and the need to comply with regulatory requirements, which may limit privacy. Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) In contrast, decentralized exchanges (DEX) operate without a central authority, relying on blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peecr transactions . Platforms like Uniswap and PancakeSwap allow users to trade directly from their wallets, ensuring greater privacy and control over their assets. DEX platforms eliminate the need for intermediaries, reducing the risk of hacks and censorship. However, they often lack the liquidity and user-friendliness of centralized exchanges, making them more challenging for beginners to navigate. Hybrid Exchanges Bridging the gap between CEX and DEX platforms, hybrid exchanges combine the benefits of both. These exchanges offer the security and decentralization of DEX platforms while maintaining the liquidity and user experience of CEX platforms. By integrating the strengths of both types, hybrid exchanges provide a balanced approach, catering to users seeking a secure yet accessible trading environment. Understanding these types of exchanges helps you choose the one that aligns best with your needs and trading preferences. How Crypto Exchanges Work Understanding how crypto exchanges operate is crucial for effectively navigating the platform and making informed decisions. Account Registration To start using a crypto exchange, the first step is account registration. This typically involves providing personal information, creating login credentials, and setting up security features like two-factor authentication (2FA). Most exchanges require compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations to prevent fraud and ensure legal compliance, meaning users must verify their identity before trading. Deposits and Withdrawals Once registered, users can deposit funds into their exchange account. This can be done using fiat currency or transferring cryptocurrency from an external crypto wallet. Understanding wallet addresses is key—these are unique identifiers used to send and receive crypto securely. When withdrawing funds, it’s important to double-check these addresses to avoid errors. Additionally, enabling security features, such as 2FA, is essential to safeguard your assets. Trading on a Crypto Exchange With funds in your account, you can start trading. Crypto exchanges offer various types of trading, including: spot trading; margin trading; futures. Spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery, while margin trading allows users to trade with borrowed funds, increasing potential profits but also risks. Futures trading involves contracts to buy or sell assets at a future date. Understanding trading pairs—like BTC and ETH—and how to execute different orders, such as market orders, limit orders, and stop-loss orders, is crucial for managing your trades effectively. Key Features to Look for in a Crypto Exchange Choosing the right crypto exchange involves evaluating several key features that can significantly impact your trading experience. Security Measures Security is paramount when selecting a crypto exchange. Essential features include two-factor authentication (2FA), cold storage for storing assets offline, and encryption to protect sensitive data. These measures help safeguard your funds and personal information from potential threats. User Interface and Experience A user-friendly interface is crucial, especially for beginners. A well-designed platform should be intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide clear access to trading tools and account management features. This ensures a smooth and efficient trading experience. Fees and Charges Understanding the fee structure of an exchange is vital. This includes trading fees, withdrawal fees, and deposit fees. Fees can vary widely between exchanges, so it’s important to compare them to find the most cost-effective option for your needs. Liquidity Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High liquidity on an exchange means quicker transactions and more stable prices, which is essential for active traders. Customer Support Reliable customer support can make a significant difference, particularly in resolving issues quickly. Look for exchanges that offer responsive and helpful support through multiple channels, such as live chat, email, or phone. Supported Cryptocurrencies Before choosing an exchange, check the list of supported cryptocurrencies to ensure it offers the assets you want to trade. Additionally, consider emerging new crypto exchanges that may provide unique or niche cryptocurrencies not available on more established platforms. Pros and Cons of Using Crypto Exchanges Using crypto exchanges offers numerous benefits, but it also comes with potential risks. Here’s a breakdown of the main advantages and disadvantages: Advantages Accessibility and Convenience: Crypto exchanges provide a user-friendly platform for trading digital assets, making it easy for users to buy, sell, and manage their cryptocurrencies from anywhere. Wide Range of Cryptocurrencies and Trading Options: Exchanges offer access to a diverse selection of cryptocurrencies and various trading pairs, catering to different investment strategies and preferences. Potential for Profit: Engaging in crypto trading can offer significant profit opportunities, especially with price fluctuations and market trends. AI-Powered Cryptocurrencies: Advanced AI-powered cryptocurrencies can enhance trading strategies by utilizing predictive analytics and automated decision-making, offering more sophisticated trading opportunities. Disadvantages Security Risks: Centralized exchanges are susceptible to security breaches and hacks, which can lead to significant financial losses and compromised personal information. High Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, which can result in substantial financial losses due to sudden price swings. Regulatory Concerns: Regulatory issues can impact exchanges and users, including potential legal implications and compliance requirements that vary by jurisdiction. How to Choose the Right Crypto Exchange for You Assessing Your Trading Needs Before selecting an exchange, consider your investment goals. Determine whether you’re interested in long-term investment strategies or more active trading. Your objectives will influence which exchange features are most important to you. Researching Exchange Reputation Thoroughly investigate the reputation of potential exchanges. Read user reviews and consider industry recognition. Pay attention to factors such as security history, customer support quality, and overall user satisfaction. A well-regarded exchange is crucial for a positive trading experience. Testing the Platform Once you’ve narrowed down your options, test the exchange with a small investment. This allows you to evaluate the platform’s functionality, user interface, and trading process without significant financial risk. Use this opportunity to ensure the exchange meets your needs before committing larger sums. Conclusion Crypto exchanges are essential platforms for anyone venturing into the world of digital assets. By understanding the types of exchanges, their features, and the pros and cons of using them, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your trading goals and risk tolerance. As you begin your cryptocurrency journey, remember to prioritize security, research thoroughly, and start small. The crypto market offers exciting opportunities but comes with risks. Approach it with knowledge and caution, and stay informed about new developments like AI-powered cryptocurrencies. Choosing the right exchange is a crucial step in your crypto journey. With the right platform and a clear strategy, you’ll be well-equipped to navigate this dynamic and potentially rewarding financial landscape.",Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-26 17:36:48

This designation reflects progress, although it does not confirm regulatory approval. According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, a decision could arrive in weeks or by October. Despite anticipation around VanEck’s Solana ETF registration, the asset has failed to retest the $200 mark. Traders expected bullish momentum following its DTCC listing, yet Solana’s price remains under resistance. As market attention shifts, newer low-cost alternatives are drawing investor interest. In this climate, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) has emerged as a key contender. Solana Remains Under Pressure: Here is What Technical Analysis Hints The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission remains involved in the process, marking ongoing evaluation. Polymarket data has stayed optimistic, with 92% listing by December 31st this year. Despite the ongoing positivity on the ETF, Solana has been under pressure failing to reach a price above $200. According to a technical analysis from TradingView, Solana (SOL) is trading at $134.53, showing signs of a potential reversal. The RSI is at 35.11, nearing oversold territory, while the MACD reads -1.77 with a signal line at -4.60, indicating a possible bullish crossover. Source: TradingView (SOL/USD Chart) SOL is currently trading inside a falling wedge—a pattern that often hints at a breakout. It’s holding key support around $126.23, while resistance is stacked up near $142.74. If buyers step in with momentum, we could see a move toward the $142–$145 range, and if that breaks, a run toward $160 might be in play. But if SOL slips below support, it opens the door to a possible drop toward $115. Right now, the indicators lean slightly bullish, but any real upside depends on momentum picking up. Little Pepe Launches Layer 2 With Utility-Focused Token Model Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) introduces a Layer 2 blockchain that prioritizes speed, low fees, and strong security infrastructure. This network supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, positioning it to operate alongside existing decentralized applications. $LILPEPE serves as the utility token within this ecosystem, powering transactions across the Pepe Unchained network. The presale for $LILPEPE went live on June 10, offering tokens at $0.0012 in Stage 3. The next stage price will increase to $0.0013. As of now, over 1.7 billion tokens have been sold from the available 2.25 billion. A total of $1,9 million has been raised toward the $2.525 million target. Source: Little Pepe Tokenomics include 26.5% allocation to presale, 30% to reserves, 5% each to marketing, liquidity, and DEX listings. Additionally, 13.5% of the supply is allocated for staking rewards. There is no transactional tax on the token. Total supply is fixed at 100 billion $LILPEPE. Presale Momentum Builds Ahead of Giveaway Event Little Pepe is currently hosting a $777,000 giveaway to mark its launch. There will be 10 winners who will get an equivalent of $77,000 in $LILPEPE tokens. There is also a rating of 73.56 percent in favor of the project as regards the next sale stage. Those wishing to buy the tokens will be able to do so by buying with ETH or USDT or by using credit/debit cards via a DeFi wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Solana failed to perform according to expectations, and the attention of investors seems to revolve around more affordable and new assets. Little Pepe keeps getting traction, which has a solid tokenomics design and an increasing amount of presales.

Institutional XRP sales remain barred under current injunction. SEC must file the next update by August 15, 2025. On June 26, 2025, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres rejected a joint motion from Ripple Labs and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that sought an “indicative ruling” to dissolve Ripple’s permanent injunction and cut its civil penalty. The court filing, Document 989 in case 1:20-cv-10832, confirmed that the request was denied in full. The decision halts an agreement reached in May 2025 between Ripple and the SEC, which aimed to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty by 60% and end litigation without further appeal.

This setup is designed to appeal to those already in the ecosystem, but not everyone’s on board. New card offers Bitcoin rewards, but comes with strings The idea of crypto rewards isn’t original. Exchanges like Gemini and Crypto.com already offer similar cards. But what makes this one different is the underlying asset, Bitcoin, and how volatile that can get. With cashback, what you earn is steady. With crypto, your 4% could spike or tank depending on what the market does. So you’re low-key investing, whether you like it or not. That risk comes on top of standard credit card hazards: high interest, debt buildup, and personal data exposure. Coinbase says its platform has never lost any customer funds to wallet breaches, and that card rewards are deposited into Coinbase wallets, not external providers. Gemini confirmed that rewards go into a Gemini wallet with full platform-level security. Some long-timers in the crypto space aren’t feeling it though. Graham Friedman, who leads crypto venture deals at Republic, isn’t sold. “I got into bitcoin in 2012 and a lot of it was about privacy, libertarianism, etc. And credit cards, by nature, swap your private information across a variety of companies,” Graham said . He added that for someone like him, who travels for work, airline cards with seat upgrades and miles are a better fit. “I can just go buy my own investment assets.” Still, for others, the idea of stacking BTC through normal purchases feels like an easy win. Buying coffee, booking flights, paying bills, etc., all become part of a long-term crypto strategy. That’s the appeal Coinbase is apparently banking on. Bitcoin and Ethereum futures trading go live July 21 On the derivatives side, Coinbase announced the launch of two US-based perpetual-style futures contracts through its Coinbase Derivatives Exchange. These will go live on July 21 and include a nano Bitcoin contract at 0.01 BTC and a nano Ether contract at 0.10 ETH. These aren’t just any contracts—they’re designed to function like global perpetual futures but under US regulatory oversight. Futures like this have already taken over international crypto markets. In some cases, they account for over 90% of total crypto trading volume. But until now, Americans have had to go offshore to trade them. That workaround adds extra baggage—custody concerns, regulation issues, counterparty risk. Coinbase says this new product removes all that friction by offering a legal, domestic alternative with the same trading perks. The contracts are built with five-year expirations and will trade 24/7. They include a funding rate mechanism that keeps the futures prices synced with the spot market. Funding builds up every hour, then settles twice per day. At each settlement point, the funding collected is either credited or debited to the trader’s account based on their position. The goal, Coinbase says, is to offer the feel of spot trading while still giving access to leverage, capital-efficient trading, and regulated clearing. The contracts are small, so traders can size their positions with more precision. No need to overexpose just to get in the game.

His analysis comes on the back of XRP's consolidation phase, which began after a drop from the $3.4 top in mid-January. Specifically, after XRP collapsed from the $3.4 peak , it immediately relinquished the $3 mark and has since consolidated around $2 over the past five months.XRP Sees Hammers and Rockets Within Descending ChannelWhile the broader market takes a similar path, Bitcoin (BTC) has been witnessing new all-time highs . Now, EGRAG believes XRP is on the verge of breaking out of this consolidation phase, calling attention to a descending channel that has prevailed over the daily chart since November 2024.Interestingly, EGRAG's chart shows that XRP's upswings and declines since November have led to what he calls ""3 hammers"" and ""3 rockets."" Specifically, a hammer refers to the resistance presented by the bears when XRP attempts to break above the channel. Meanwhile, a rocket is the recovery push after XRP retests support at the channel's lower trendline.Notably, each hammer (or roadblock) has eventually resulted in a price correction, while each rocket (recovery effort) has led to a push toward a breakout. XRP Descending Channel | EGRAG Crypto For context, XRP saw three rockets at $1.95 on Dec. 20, 2024, at $1.76 on Feb. 3, 2025, and then at $1.61 on April 7, 2025.However, the three hammers came in at $3.4 on Jan. 16, 2025, at $3.02 on March 2, 2025, and then most recently at $2.65 on May 12, 2025.EGRAG Predicts When XRP Bull Run Will ResumeFollowing the three iterations of each pattern, EGRAG asked for audience opinions on whether XRP would break out or go lower. In his view, the next direction from here could be upward. According to him, XRP could break out from this channel or consolidation structure by mid-June, with the uptrend persisting until August to September 2025.However, his projection came up days before the Israel-Iran war began, which has since skewed the direction of the market. As a result of the conflict, this timeline could be delayed. Meanwhile, EGRAG provided several immediate targets around the breakout from the descending channel. Specifically, XRP would need to breach the $2.6 resistance to break above the channel. From the current price of $2.16, XRP must rise 20.3% to reach this price mark.XRP Breakout TargetsFollowing a breakout from the channel, XRP's next immediate target could be the $3 psychological level, which it has failed to reclaim since March. Beyond this, the next target would be the yearly peak of $3.4. A break above this mark could open the door for greater price heights.While EGRAG failed to present his ultimate targets for when the bull run resumes, he had in previous instances suggested that XRP could reach the $20 range this cycle. Most recently, he predicted that XRP's top for this cycle could be $24. Meanwhile, last month, he predicted a possible XRP rally to $27.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-26 17:55:52

According to respected crypto analyst Casitrades, this key support line is “everything right now,” and the market’s reaction to it may signal whether XRP is ready to ignite its next leg upward. A Precise Bounce from Key Support XRP recently tapped the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.145—a zone that also marks the apex of its recent consolidation structure. This convergence of technical levels makes $2.145 a vital area to hold in the short term. So far, the price has responded positively, bouncing cleanly off this support, which suggests strength and renewed bullish momentum. Casitrades described this level as “the most critical on the chart, short-term,” warning that a drop below it would indicate weakness . However, XRP is currently holding above it with confidence. “This is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside,” Casitrades wrote. This Trendline Is Everything Right Now! I’ve been tracking this trendline support as the key level to hold and we just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation… that’s… pic.twitter.com/bA79dP1c99 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 25, 2025 The current structure, where price remains above the consolidation range while showing impulsive upward moves, is often a strong sign of trend continuation. Resistance at $2.25: The Next Test As XRP stabilizes above support, attention now turns to the $2.25 resistance level. According to Casitrades, this is the next major hurdle. A breakout above $2.25 would be a bullish confirmation and could open the door to a move toward $2.69—the next Fibonacci retracement target. “Price is now trying to push back toward the $2.25 resistance. That’s the next big test,” Casitrades noted. “If we can flip that level, we’ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test—and from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A move beyond $2.69 could trigger an even stronger rally, potentially signaling the ignition of a powerful wave 3, typically the most explosive phase in Elliott Wave theory. Momentum Building Across the Market XRP’s price action is unfolding as the broader altcoin market shows signs of revival. With Bitcoin consolidating, many traders are shifting focus to high-potential assets like XRP. Market indicators such as RSI and Stochastic RSI are also aligning in favor of the bulls, hinting at growing upward momentum. Volume is beginning to increase as XRP approaches resistance, suggesting rising interest and accumulation. Meanwhile, the price continues to respect key support levels, reinforcing the bullish structure. For now, all eyes are on whether XRP can clear $2.25 and confirm a breakout. But one thing is clear: as Casitrades rightly said, “This trendline is everything.” How XRP behaves around it could determine the direction of the next major move.

What was once a feature reserved exclusively for XRP is now being unlocked for a much broader range of tokenized assets. This change comes with the introduction of the Token Escrow amendment, known as XLS-85. Vet (@Vet_X0), a validator on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), summarized the significance of this development in a recent post . He explained that the amendment opens escrow capabilities to issued tokens and multi-purpose tokens (MPTs). This means stablecoins, such as RLUSD or USDC, which recently launched on the XRPL , tokenized real estate, money market funds, and even meme coins, can now be securely placed in escrow. Big change for Escrow on the XRP Ledger! Currently only XRP can be escrowed. This amendment opens it up for issued and multi purpose tokens. Think of escrow for stablecoins like USDC and RLUSD, memes, US treasuries, Real Estate, Money Market Funds etc https://t.co/8wDqTUhIVx pic.twitter.com/qrgjUhHfLb — Vet (@Vet_X0) June 25, 2025 From XRP-Only to a Universal Solution In May, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that major advancements were coming to the XRPL , and this new amendment fits the bill. The XRPL’s native escrow function has long been limited to XRP, allowing holders to lock tokens and release them only when specific conditions were met. XLS-85 extends this functionality to Trustline-based tokens and MPTs, creating an entirely new set of possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users operating within the ecosystem. Use Cases for Token Escrows The practical use cases unlocked by token escrow are substantial. Conditional payments become fully automated, allowing funds to be released only upon the successful completion of services or milestones. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Time-locked distributions are now possible for project teams, grant disbursements, or airdrops, with tokens vesting incrementally over predefined schedules. This can introduce greater accountability and trust within token-based projects. Decentralized exchanges and marketplaces also benefit from escrow by enabling secure token holding for trade settlements and collateral within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Vet noted that it also supports trustless peer-to-peer swaps, eliminating counterparty risk. Additionally, escrow enhances digital rights management by ensuring tokenized assets like licenses or collectibles are only released when payment or contract conditions are fulfilled. A New Standard for XRPL Utility The implementation of XLS-85 marks a pivotal evolution for the ledger. The XRPL is becoming a DeFi powerhouse through these upgrades, and by enabling escrow for other tokens in the ecosystem, the ledger positions itself to support an even wider range of real-world financial applications. This development shows a clear shift toward broader utility and enterprise-grade solutions. With escrow no longer limited to XRP, the ledger’s potential use cases expand dramatically, setting the stage for the next chapter in its growth.

Ripple (XRP) has taken a major step toward interoperability. On Thursday, June 26, the protocol integrated with the cross-chain interoperability protocol Wormhole. The move will make both the main XRP Ledger and Ripple’s new EVM-compatible sidechain compatible with over 35 blockchains. Wormhole’s cross-chain bridge will connect the XRP Ledger to Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Polygon, and others. This will allow XRP-native dApps to interact with EVM chains, Solana DeFi platforms, and more. Additionally, developers will be able to build dApps that operate across multiple ecosystems. Ripple bets on interoperability According to David Schwartz, CTO of Ripple and Co-creator of the XRP Ledger, interoperability is essential for mass adoption. He emphasized that Ripple’s role depends on opening up its ecosystem to other networks and their users. “If you want real mass adoption, interoperability is essential. The infrastructure has to be there, not just on one chain, but across them. With this integration, tokens natively issued on the XRP Ledger are being set up for that reality by being able to move between blockchain networks while maintaining native issuance and control,” David Schwartz, Ripple. According to Wormhole, the integration will help position XRP as an institutional-grade chain—particularly given Ripple’s reputation as a blockchain with a compliance-first approach. “By integrating Wormhole into the XRP Ledger, we’re helping unlock even greater potential spanning all major blockchains for one of the most established blockchain networks in enterprise finance—further advancing its role as a foundation for regulated, interoperable digital asset ecosystems,” said Robinson Burkey, Co-Founder of Wormhole Foundation. Ripple will leverage this cross-chain interoperability to expand its offerings in decentralized finance, tokenization, and liquidity provision.

If bulls defend this level, a rotation back toward the range highs could be in play, but confirmation is still needed. Ethena ( ENA ) has been range-bound between a high time-frame support at $0.21 and major resistance at $0.47, creating a broad consolidation zone that may define price action over the coming weeks and months. Currently, ENA is sitting at the lower end of this range near $0.22, just above the yearly low. This level marks a critical decision point for both bulls and bears. Key technical points Trading Range: $0.21 (support) to $0.47 (resistance) defines the current macro structure. Value Area Low Lost: Bearish rotation from value area high to low is now complete. Volume Spike at Support: Above-average volume at current levels suggests interest from buyers. ENAUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, ENA’s current position reflects a completed bearish auction rotation. Price previously rejected the value area high, then the point of control, and has now dropped through the value area low, fulfilling the downward move. With price consolidating near the $0.21–$0.22 support zone, the market is at a key inflection point. If $0.22 fails to hold, a further drop toward the swing low becomes increasingly probable. However, if bulls can defend this level, or if a deviation below the lows traps sellers, a reclaim could trigger a rotation back toward the mid-range and eventually to the high time-frame resistance at $0.47. You might also like: FUNToken’s Telegram bot gets a major upgrade with high-stakes spins An important supporting factor is the volume profile. Volume at current levels is above average, indicating that demand may be returning around this support zone. This could signal that buyers are accumulating, but the market structure remains bearish for now. A shift in structure, such as a higher low followed by a breakout above the value area low, would be required to confirm a bullish rotation. The challenge for bulls is turning this potential demand into a trend reversal. Until ENA can reclaim lost levels with conviction, the path of least resistance remains sideways or lower. However, the proximity to the yearly low offers a well-defined risk-reward setup for long-biased traders looking to catch a reversal at the bottom of the range. What to expect in the coming price action If ENA holds support near $0.21–$0.22 and reclaims the value area low, a range-bound move toward $0.47 could begin. Failure to defend this level, however, would likely send price toward the previous swing low. Watch for volume confirmation and a structural shift before positioning aggressively.

In a new thread, crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum needs to reclaim the area around $2,500 as support before ETH can mount an explosive move to the upside. “After holding the orange circled area for about six full weeks, Ethereum ended up following through on the blue circled scenario. Still, this orange box is the macro range low ($2,200), and price needs to effectively reclaim around $2,500 to rally across the range.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also says that until Ethereum closes above $2,500 on the daily chart, ETH will likely hold $2,200 as support as it trades sideways. “For the time being, Ethereum is treating the ~$2,500 level as resistance after it previously held for almost six weeks. But Ethereum just needs a daily close above ~$2,500 to start the reclaim process. Until then, ETH will meander between $2,200-$2,500.” ETH is trading for $2,425 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is showing bullishness on the daily timeframe, having smashed through a downtrend line for the second time in June. “Bitcoin has broken two two-week downtrends over the past month.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,302 at time of writing, flat on the day.

The purchase arrives just ahead of the long-awaited shift to transferable WLFI tokens. Aqua 1 has bought additional WLFI tokens, investing $100M into the Trump family project. The platform managed to raise up to $590M so far, with some of the funds supplied by large-scale whales and high-profile buyers. Part of the funding came from retail users, who were at that time supportive of Donald Trump’s second bid for the US Presidency. World Liberty Fi aims to build its own niche in decentralized finance, with a native stablecoin USD1, as well as the WLFI token, which will be used for governance. Aqua 1 has not disclosed the sale price for WLFI at the current stage. On-chain data shows Aqua 1 received WLFI tokens before disclosing its involvement with Trump’s platform. | Source: Etherscan Aqua 1 goes big on World Liberty Fi On-chain data shows that an ENS name aqua1.eth holds 800M WLFI tokens. After the investment, the fund is the 11th largest holder of WLFI. On-chain data shows Aqua 1 received the tokens in the past three weeks in two major transfers. The WLFI moves were noted by analysts, though it took some time before the fund disclosed its involvement. As of June 21, on-chain analysts also noted Aqua 1 registered four other related ENS names . “ We’re excited to work hand-in-hand with the team at Aqua 1,” said Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial. “ Aligning with Aqua 1 validates our blueprint for global financial innovation, as we have a joint mission to bring digital assets to the masses and strengthen our nation’s standing as a champion and leader of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology,” he added. Aqua 1 will retain its role as a native Web3 fund, compliant with local UAE regulations. The fund will be part of the consultant team for World Liberty Fi , assisting in its expansion to other regions. Trump’s platform may reach South America, Europe, Asia and other emerging markets to widen its digital asset ecosystem. While sold as “Made in USA” crypto, WLFI has not shied away from foreign investors. World Liberty Fi and Aqua 1 to build new investment platforms World Liberty Fi will in turn support the launch of a new investment vehicle, Aqua Fund, also registered in the UAE and partnering with local stakeholders. The fund will target the Middle Eastern digital economy, offering projects in AI, Web3 and blockchain infrastructure. Aqua Fund will serve as a regional hub for capital flows, developer talent and technology. Aqua Fund will also seek out additional secondary market liquidity for investors. World Liberty Fi and Aqua Fund will also develop and promote BlockRock, an institutional-grade platform for RWA tokenization . The new entity’s goal will be to provide premium traditional assets and integrate them into the Web3 ecosystem. The latest large-scale purchase arrives at a time when the launch of WLFI trading is seen as an imminent option. WLFI was sold at a deep discount during several presale rounds. The token currently has a limited presale market, with around $5M in daily volumes on the LBank exchange. WLFI has started its initial price discovery and currently hovers around $0.97 , a significant premium above the presale discounts. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres also denied the motion seeking to lift the permanent injunction on Ripple’s institutional XRP ( XRP ) sales, which the court imposed in 2024, according to Reuters . The court ruled that Ripple and the SEC cannot use their settlement agreement to reverse the order imposing a permanent injunction against the company’s institutional XRP sales. You might also like: Ripple’s Arthur Britto resurfaces on X after 14-year silence Judge denies yet another Ripple/SEC motion The Ripple/SEC motion marks the second attempt before the court to bring a legal close to the long-running case. In addition to the prohibition on XRP sales to institutional investors, Ripple and the SEC had asked the court to approve a settlement in which the SEC would retain $50 million and return $75 million of the $125 million civil penalty. Notably, both parties also asked the court to pause their appeal of the final judgment pending the outcome of this motion. In 2023, Judge Torres ruled that XRP sold on exchanges did not violate securities laws—meaning the cryptocurrency is not a security. However, she found that institutional sales did violate securities laws, leading to the injunction and civil penalty imposed in August 2024. Ripple and the SEC appealed the ruling, with a settlement reached in March 2025 that could only proceed if the judge agreed to set aside her earlier decision. Parties “have no authority” Judge Torres rejected the latest motion, stating that it did not meet the “exceptional circumstances” required for a court to modify or vacate a final judgment. A similar motion filed on June 12, 2025, requesting an “indicative ruling,” also failed to persuade the court. Arguments that the SEC has dismissed similar or related crypto cases also do not apply to the Ripple versus SEC case , as those other lawsuits did not go all the way to a final ruling. “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment that a party violated an Act of Congress in such a manner that a permanent injunction and a civil penalty were necessary to prevent that party from violating the law again,” the judge wrote. Under the ruling, Ripple and the SEC may now choose to either withdraw their appeal or proceed with it and challenge the injunction. Stuart Alderoty, chief legal officer at Ripple, has said the company is yet to decide its next steps with regard to the matter. “With this, the ball is back in our court. The Court gave us two options: dismiss our appeal challenging the finding on historic institutional sales—or press forward with the appeal. Stay tuned. Either way, XRP’s legal status as not a security remains unchanged,” he posted on X.

The capital is being raised through M3 Brigade Acquisition V Corp, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) backed by the two. A Multi-Token Approach Anonymous sources cited in the report said that the vehicle would hold a diversified mix of tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). They also revealed that the fundraising effort is ongoing, meaning that the details, including the $1 billion target, may change. Cantor Fitzgerald LP is among the parties advising on the deal. Furthermore, Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce in U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration, has reportedly been tapped to serve as vice chair alongside Binance board chairman Gabriel Abed. The venture will also have ex-Hut 8 Mining head Jaime Leverton as CEO in an acting capacity. Chu and Collins’ multi-token approach is markedly different from that taken by the likes of Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The former has bought over 592,000 BTC, currently valued at more than $60 billion. The latter now holds 12,345 BTC worth over $1.33 billion and recently passed Tesla to become the seventh-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Meanwhile, others like SharpLink Gaming have taken an Ether-focused approach. The Minneapolis-based company owns 188,478 ETH worth about $457 million and is staking 100% of it to support the Ethereum network. This strategy followed a $425 million private placement led by Consensys and the appointment of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman. Tether Co-Founder Buys $6.47M SPAC In May 2025, Collins acquired a controlling stake in M3-Brigade for $6.47 million. The deal included 7.19 million Class B shares and 5.04 million private placement warrants, with plans to purchase an additional 3.29 million from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Following the transaction, Collins was named CEO, with Chinh coming in as the SPAC’s new president. The crypto entrepreneur, who has also just joined the advisory board of Canadian-listed digital asset ETF company Fineqia, was instrumental in founding Tether, NFT platform BLOCKv, and Smart Media Technologies. He is currently chairman of STBL.com (formerly Pi), a yield-bearing stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum and Solana. This decentralized platform enables yield retention from tokenized RWAs such as U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. Meanwhile, Chu was Blackstone’s longest-serving dealmaker before leaving in 2015. While at the firm, he sponsored several SPACs, including deals for Getty Images and Utz Brands.

The attacker reportedly manipulated token prices through a smart contract vulnerability. According to blockchain security analysts, Resupply, a DeFi stablecoin platform integrated with Convex Finance and Yearn Finance, was the main target of the exploit. The attacker used an elaborate price manipulation tactic on cvcrvUSD, a token tied to Convex, to deceive the system and obtain a loan using virtually worthless collateral. Smart contract bug leads to zero exchange rate The main point of the breach was found at the ResupplyPair contract, deployed Thursday at Ethereum address “ 0x6e…6bd6″ . The contract used the price of cvcrvUSD to calculate an internal exchange rate for collateralized lending. Yet another lending protocol exploited via exchange rate manipulation on low-liquidity—even empty—markets! Specifically, attackers artificially inflated #cvcrvUSD 's share price through donations. @ResupplyFi 's ResupplyPair contract ( https://t.co/yo2N5lScHi , created ~2h ago) uses… https://t.co/MelEYFLr98 pic.twitter.com/2qXC9IiREL — BlockSec Phalcon (@Phalcon_xyz) June 26, 2025 The attacker used this dependency by artificially inflating the cvcrvUSD token’s price through coordinated donation transactions. When the token’s value surged, the price input in the ResupplyPair contract soared. However, a flaw in the protocol’s code, specifically the use of floor division, caused the exchange rate to round down to zero once the price moved past a measured threshold. With the exchange rate set to zero, the attacker was able to borrow a massive amount of Resupply’s native stablecoin, reUSD, using only 1 wei of cvcrvUSD as collateral. The platform’s insolvency checks, which rely on this exchange rate, were effectively bypassed. “ The attacker manipulated token prices, triggering a bug (zero exchange rate) in Resupply’s smart contract, letting them borrow a ton of money for almost nothing ,” explained Hakan Unal, senior security operations lead at blockchain risk firm Cyvers. Tornado Cash used for transaction anonymity Blockchain activity shows the hacker initially funded their wallet through Tornado Cash, a decentralized privacy protocol mixer that criminals use to hide the origin of funds. The entry point of the attack was a transaction on Cow Swap involving 2 ETH, according to an analysis by blockchain security firm PeckShield. After the breach, they liquidated the stolen assets by converting reUSD to stablecoins and Ethereum through Curve and Uniswap, both decentralized exchanges. The $9.6 million in profit was split across two separate Ethereum addresses. The attacker used both USDC and wrapped Ethereum (wETH) to store the final proceeds. Later in the day, Resupply confirmed the breach and admitted that the exploit had affected its wstUSR market. The platform immediately paused all contracts to prevent further damage. “ Users should avoid reUSD vaults and withdraw funds if possible ,” Unal advised investors using the protocol. Crypto-related hacks in 2025 become rampant The Resupply breach adds to a string of high-value hacks targeting both decentralized finance and centralized platforms. Blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis reports that over $2.3 billion has already been stolen in crypto hacks since the start of 2025, a figure that outpaces last year’s total by midyear. Just days before the Resupply incident, on June 18, Iran-based cryptocurrency exchange Nobitex suffered a devastating breach. Hackers made off with more than $90 million in digital assets from several blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, and Ton. Prior investigations have linked wallets on Nobitex to actors affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and networks tied to Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hamas operatives. The National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) of Israel has identified the platform as a conduit for funds to several sanctioned entities. These include the pro-Hamas media outlet Gaza Now, an alleged propaganda arm of al-Qaeda, and sanctioned Russian cryptocurrency exchanges Garantex and Bitpapa.

Lingerie Fighting Championships (BOTY), a Las Vegas-based women’s MMA league, announced plans to acquire $230,000 worth of bitcoin within 30 days and up to $2 million over the next six months. The decision to add BTC to its treasury coincides with LFC’s first shows in the UK. LFC43: Sindependence Day 2 is set for July 4 in London and has already sold out. LFC44: Underground Knockouts follows in Cardiff on July 6. The firm did not provide any explanation for its bitcoin adoption in its press release. However, CEO Shaun Donnelly told CoinDesk that LFC believed that ""bitcoin has lots of potential to grow to levels never seen before and we wanted to get in while we still can."" ""While we aren’t able to purchase a large amount I looked at it like real estate — even if it’s only a small starter home it’s better to be in the market than outside wishing you had gotten in when you could have,"" he added. A number of bitcoin treasury firms have elected to scale back their prior businesses in order to identify completely as a BTC company and focus on raising funds in order to buy bitcoin.

With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round now live, the project is gaining real traction thanks to its AI-first architecture and clear roadmap. Lightchain AI introduces a purpose-built virtual machine for executing intelligent workloads and a consensus model that rewards real computational contributions—features that resonate with developers and strategic investors alike. With its July 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon, Lightchain AI is quickly shifting from a hidden gem to a rising market priority. Solana Struggles to Maintain Spotlight Amid Growing Competition In 2025, Solana (SOL) is operating in a tough environment, dealing with increased competition and changing market mood. Although known for its fast transactions and a flourishing ecosystem, SOL has met stiff resistance around the $180 level, as the price sits around $174.69. This has made some afraid of retracements to the $125 support area. The platform also finds itself competing against Sui and Mutuum Finance, which have grown in popularity due to their unique new elements and rapidly-expanding user bases. Furthermore, Solana’s links to wild meme coins like BONK and WIF have called its commitment to sustainable, use case-focused projects into question. Although Solana’s creator, Anatoly Yakovenko, sounds confident, and calls for product-driven development (not hype), the network’s continued popularity in the face of new and burgeoning competition comes down to its ability not just to solve these problems, but reinforce its promise to developers and investors alike. Lightchain AI Drives Strong Presale Momentum Across Platforms Lightchain AI is driving strong presale momentum across platforms as buyers and builders take early positions ahead of the mainnet launch. With its Bonus Round priced at $0.007 and over $20.9 million raised, the project’s technical foundation is fueling interest. Core infrastructure includes decentralized validator and contributor nodes, enabling real-time AI task execution at scale. Lightchain is also advancing cross-chain infrastructure to support interoperability and broader blockchain integration. DeFi partnership onboarding is underway, expanding ecosystem functionality and liquidity opportunities. Adding transparency, Lightchain’s public code repositories will go live at mainnet launch, giving developers full access to its smart contracts and AI framework. As momentum continues to build, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a serious, multi-chain-ready Layer 1 with real traction. Lightchain AI- New Darling of Crypto Watchlists The buzz is real—traders are turning their attention to Lightchain AI , and it’s easy to see why. With its Bonus Round in full swing, fixed pricing, and no-nonsense approach, this project is standing out from the crowd. Backed by robust tokenomics, decentralized architecture, and real AI utility, Lightchain AI isn’t just another flashy name—it’s a game-changer. As word spreads and presale excitement grows, savvy, early-cycle traders are recognizing this as more than just hype. Lightchain AI might just be the smartest move of the season. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|BONK,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-26 19:00:00

This price crash is expected to mark Wave C of a corrective move, with ETH dropping to as low as $1,800. Why Ethereum Could Still Drop To As Low As $1,800 In an X post, Crypto Wave declared that the primary expectation remains that Ethereum will see one more leg down in wave c of wave 2, targeting the zone between $1,950 and $1,700. Specifically, his accompanying chart showed that the largest altcoin by market cap could drop to around $1,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000? The crypto analyst revealed that Ethereum has already hit the 0.5 fib retracement at $2,100, which is the minimum target for a Wave 2 correction. However, structurally, he claimed that this drop still looks like wave A only. Crypto Wave further explained that these ABC corrections are always three-part moves, and that is what he sees forming now for ETH. The broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin, has bounced back following the ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Ethereum has also rebounded, having dropped to as low as $2,100 last week. However, Crypto Wave suggested that the current market sentiment doesn’t invalidate this bearish setup for ETH and that it could still witness a deeper sell-off. The crypto analyst alluded to the fourth quarter of last year when Ethereum was underperforming heavily while many altcoins rallied. In line with this, he remarked that there could be a repeat of this scenario. However, on the other hand, Crypto Wave claimed that if ETH breaks above $2,880 impulsively, especially in one clean wave, then the correction could be over. He added that this would also put the altcoin in the early stages of a new bull cycle. 2021 Pattern Playing Out For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Merlijn drew similarities between the current Ethereum price action and that of 2021. He stated that the 2021 playbook is repeating, with ETH having a dead count bounce, then a final retest before the parabolic leg. The analyst expects the altcoin to retest the $2,000 level before the massive move to the upside. Related Reading: Market Expert Who Predicted Ethereum Price Crash At $2,800 Reveals What’s Coming Next His accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could rally to as high as $11,000 on this uptrend. Merlijn had remarked that ETH has more firepower this time around than in 2021, which is why the altcoin could witness such a parabolic move to the upside. Interestingly, based on the chart, this rally is expected to happen between now and year-end. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,480, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The conversation reignited after Blockchain Backer posted: “If it isn’t clear yet, XRP is a threat to Bitcoin.” That statement quickly drew a strong reaction from popular XRP advocate Cobb, who responded, “THIS IS WHY THEY TRY TO SUPPRESS XRP SO HARD.” Cobb’s comment reflects a belief shared by many in the XRP community: that XRP’s unique design and growing real-world use cases have positioned it as a direct challenge to Bitcoin’s dominance. And for that reason, it faces persistent suppression from both market influencers and regulatory powers. THIS IS WHY THEY TRY TO SUPPRESS XRP SO HARD https://t.co/xLQkJra2a0 — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 26, 2025 XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Fundamental Divide At the heart of this debate is the contrast between Bitcoin and XRP in both function and philosophy. Bitcoin was created as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value. Its slow transaction speeds and high energy consumption are often defended as trade-offs for its security and decentralization. XRP, by contrast, was built for speed, efficiency, and utility, especially in cross-border payments. With transaction finality in seconds, negligible fees, and the ability to handle over 1,000 transactions per second, XRP offers a practical solution for real-time settlement that Bitcoin simply cannot match. This performance gap has led many analysts to argue that XRP threatens Bitcoin’s position, not just in market cap, but in relevance. If institutions and governments begin to prioritize utility over store-of-value narratives, XRP could emerge as the preferred blockchain solution for global finance. The Suppression Theory Cobb’s claim that XRP is being “suppressed” taps into a longstanding theory within the community: that XRP’s growth has been deliberately stalled to protect entrenched interests in Bitcoin and legacy financial systems. This theory gained momentum during Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began in December 2020. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The timing of the SEC’s lawsuit—just as XRP was gaining traction with institutional partners—raised eyebrows. For nearly three years, XRP was delisted from major U.S. exchanges and excluded from key bull market rallies, while Bitcoin and Ethereum soared. Though the legal cloud is partially lifted, many believe the damage was already done. Cobb and others suggest that XRP’s sidelining wasn’t accidental. With its deep ties to banks, central banks, and payment providers, XRP threatens not only Bitcoin’s dominance but also the interests of those who benefit from the current system. A Real Threat to the Old Guard? The question now is whether XRP can reclaim its momentum. As Ripple expands into CBDCs, tokenized assets, and institutional finance, XRP’s utility continues to grow. And with renewed attention on Bitcoin’s limitations, XRP is once again being viewed as a legitimate alternative. Cobb’s pointed reaction, “This is why they try to suppress XRP so hard”, sums up the sentiment of a growing number of traders who believe that XRP’s biggest obstacle isn’t technology or demand, but the fear it inspires in those who stand to lose the most.

Crypto markets are not always driven by fundamentals. On Thursday, June 26, Binance announced the delisting of five tokens, including Biswap (BSW) . However, instead of triggering a price collapse, the delisting news sparked a major rally. 🛡 A Tough Goodbye – A Stronger Future The @binance delisting is tough. We’ve had a long journey together, but now, we fully embrace decentralization. CEXs can delist tokens, but they can’t delist vision – we’re free to build. And we’re just getting started 🧵 1/2 https://t.co/bDSTE6uPvV — Biswap (@Biswap_Dex) June 26, 2025 Despite the Binance delisting, the small-cap token rallied 118% in just a few hours, rising from $0.017 to a peak of $0.037. Biswap’s price subsequently stabilized at $0.026, but the token remains up 30% over the past 24 hours. One potential reason for the price spike is the announcement of a new roadmap by the project. Biswap outlined plans to make the project more decentralized, enabling users to vote on rewards rather than just passively farm the token. The protocol also announced steps toward on-chain governance, as well as updates to its tokenomics. You might also like: Hackers keep exploiting audited DeFi protocols: What’s missing? | Opinion Why Binance delisted Biswap Binance periodically reviews tokens on its platform to ensure they meet the standards for listing. The exchange considers factors such as regulatory compliance, trading volume and liquidity, security, team commitment, and ownership structure. Binance did not explicitly state why it delisted Biswap or the other tokens. However, the announcement suggests that it failed to meet one or more of these criteria. Biswap launched in 2021 as a decentralized exchange on the BNB Chain. It allows users to swap tokens, earn yield by providing liquidity, and stake crypto rewards. The token peaked in December 2021 at $2.13 and has since lost nearly 99% of its value. Since launch, Biswap has faced criticism over the security of its protocol and centralization concerns. In June 2021, Valix Consulting discovered a critical exploit in its code that allowed an attacker to mint unlimited BSW tokens via the exchange. Biswap patched the vulnerability afterward.

The aim is to extensively revamp the Cardano ecosystem, which could potentially trigger a long-awaited turnaround for its native token, ADA. In a recent post shared with X, Input Output Global (IOG), the organization backing Cardano reiterated the network’s long-term vision for the Cardano ecosystem through implementing Leios. Leios implementation – Increasing network throughput by optimizing resource use and transaction processing. The Cardano mainnet can experience congestion with high transaction volume. Block utilization sometimes peaks, and emerging use cases will demand even higher throughput… pic.twitter.com/n5SwIZMgKS — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) June 19, 2025 By integrating Leios into the network, IOG intends to increase network throughput by optimizing resource use and transaction processing. Congestion is a key network limitation observed during periods of high transaction volumes. With block utilization failing, and emerging use cases requiring higher throughput capabilities, Leios is expected to become a game changer. The Leios upgrade is designed to boost the network’s throughput by optimizing available resources and implementing efficient transaction methods. To sustain data availability and security, Leios will utilize the time between endorsements and Praos blocks—a core component of the network’s Ouroboros POS consensus mechanism. In the long term, IOG asserts that the upgrade will spearhead overall network growth and accommodate complex applications on the Cardano network. “Leios aims to significantly increase transaction throughput on the Cardano mainnet – this enhancement will support a growing ecosystem and more demanding applications.” — IOG With blockchain upgrades come renewed expectations amongst market players, especially for the network’s native token, which happens to be ADA in Cardano’s case. ADA’s volatile state and unstable price movements have been of major concern for investors and traders alike. With the arrival of Leios, market players anticipate a massive turnaround in the asset’s performance, one that could send the token to new price levels.

Judge Torres cited the SEC’s past view that Ripple would continue to violate the law in his court ruling today. “That has not changed, and neither party is arguing otherwise. Despite this, they request that the fine be reduced by 60% and the permanent injunction be lifted, citing public interest,” Torres said. The parties had requested that, if the permanent injunction imposed on Ripple was lifted, $50 million of the $75 million fine be returned to the SEC and the remaining $25 million be returned to Ripple. The SEC and Ripple litigation began in 2020. The SEC accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion through unregistered securities sales. In July 2023, Judge Torres ruled that “programmatic sales” of XRP to individual investors were not securities, but direct sales to institutional investors were. This ruling resulted in a $125 million fine for Ripple. Related News: Bold Statements from the Famous CEO for Ripple (XRP)! ""No Investor Can Buy XRP at This Price!"" In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the case was effectively over, and the SEC withdrew its appeal. However, the final stages of the case focused on reassessing the amount of the penalty imposed. The parties had requested that the penalty be reduced, citing the SEC’s change in approach to crypto assets in the new period. With the departure of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who was in office during the Biden era, in January, the institution ended its investigations and lawsuits against many crypto companies and began work on creating a regulatory framework by establishing a cryptocurrency task force. But Judge Torres said, “Parties cannot avoid the binding force of a court decision by mutual agreement. In such cases, extraordinary circumstances must be shown in the public interest and in the interests of justice. This is not the case in this case.” While the SEC did not comment on the matter, Ripple Legal Director Stuart Alderoty said in a statement on the social media platform X, “The ball is now in our court.” Alderoty stated that the court gave them two options, “To withdraw our appeal of the findings regarding past institutional sales or to continue the appeal.” He stated that the decision that XRP is not a security has not changed. *This is not investment advice.

The flagship coin dropped slightly to trade at about $107,472 on Thursday, June 26, during the mid-North American session. After recording an impressive comeback, following the 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs in April, BTC price has been forming a potential reversal pattern. The bearish sentiment for BTC price has been forming amid the growing demand from institutional investors, led by Strategy, and Metaplanet. Major Factors Weighing Down on Midterm Bullish Sentiment for Bitcoin Price Technical Headwinds The BTC price, in the daily timeframe, has been forming a falling trend following a bearish breakout from a rising wedge formed in late May 2025. The midterm bearish sentiment for BTC price is bolstered by the falling daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) with the MACD line having crossed below the zero line. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC price is well-positioned to retest the support level above $92k again in the coming weeks. The ultimate support level for BTC price was established above $76k earlier this year. High Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage Bitcoin price faces intensified bearish sentiment fueled by cumulative short liquidation leverage of about $12 billion around $112k. Ideally, it is safe to say that more institutional investors are seeking to suppress BTC price through the futures and leveraged markets to acquire as many coins as possible before the highly anticipated parabolic rally.Furthermore, on-chain data shows that institutional investors have been aggressively accumulating more BTC through leveraging equity markets.

What does it mean?",https://crypto.news/bitcoin-did-go-to-1000000-this-cycle/,"On June 24, 2025, a blogger using the Pledditor handle published an X post that kicks off like this: Bitcoin did go to $1,000,000 this cycle, it’s just the value wasn’t captured by “you”. It was captured by “them”. Then, Pledditor explains how 10x mNAV may help Bitcoin pioneers holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin to trade BTC at $1,000,000. How realistic is this scheme? A sleuth using the Pledditor moniker on Twitter made headlines in 2023 when they shared deleted tweets of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The person behind this account is an avid critic of Bitcoin treasury companies, which they refer to as “grift.” It’s worth saying that Pledditor is far from being a Bitcoin skeptic; rather, they advocate for self-custody and a DIY approach in general. Table of Contents What is the scheme described by Pledditor? Likening treasuries to SPACs Which treasuries can boast 10x mNAV? What is the scheme described by Pledditor? In a recent Twitter thread, Pledditor dissects how the “Bitcoin OGs” (i.e., David Bailey, Adam Back, Ten31, Swan, and others) can trade Bitcoin at one million during the current cycle. Bitcoin did go to $1,000,000 this cycle, it's just the value wasn't captured by ""you"". It was captured by ""them"". If you are a bitcoin OG with a bunch of coins, what you do is securitize your BTC stack by SPAC'ing it on the public markets. You then create a ""irresponsibly long… — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 24, 2025 In the post, Pledditor describes the way the early Bitcoin holders with huge bags can securitize their holdings. According to them, they may launch a Strategy-like treasury company and hype up people on Twitter, urging them to buy their stocks. They may do it themselves or via a third-party frontman (“influencer”). As soon as the market net asset value reaches ten, the company founder may exit the common stock while keeping preferred shares for themselves. Given that the mNAV is 10 and the BTC price is $100,000, the company founder technically sells their bitcoins at $1,000,000 while not fully departing with their bitcoins thanks to keeping preferred shares. In the following tweets, Pledditor adds that the base Bitcoin for such ventures is coming from “Bitcoin OGs,” not even from the OTC desk. So, the impact on the market BTC price is zero. Pledditor concludes , “They tell you buying common gives you __ amount of BTC per share, when in reality *they* own all the preferreds, *they* own the BTC.” Earlier, Pleddior replied “Correct” to a tweet saying that Strategy is an exit scam for executives and Bitcoin OGs. Likening treasuries to SPACs On top of that, in the post, Pledditor compares the treasury companies to Special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Lately, this comparison has been occurring across the crypto Twitter repeatedly; Pledditor is not the only one to bring it up. Bitcoin and other crypto treasury companies are the new SPACs. The only people that got rich off the SPAC model 4 years later were those who created it. It’s financial engineering. It never ends well for retail. Most SPACs are down 90% or more. Only a few are above initial price. — Beanie (@beaniemaxi) June 12, 2025 SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are shell companies created to raise capital via IPOs to merge with a public company or to acquire it. SPACs have no operations. SPACs may be seen as an attractive way to release shares without having to go through the normal disclosures required for companies going public. Two waves of SPAC popularity (in the late 2000s and the early 2020s) ended up rough for retail investors. Most of the time, they saw negative return rates for years. One of the latest popular SPACs was the 2024 Trump Media company merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Currently, the DJT stock is traded well below the merging period price. No wonder the comparison between SPACs and treasuries is unfavorable and hints at the lack of real, practical purpose behind companies like Strategy, Metaplanet, and their copycats. Both SPACs and treasuries don’t produce anything and have only a speculative value. While Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy raises concerns as it may seem too risky, Goldman Sachs analysts claimed Bitcoin has to dip 50% to put the company at real risk. According to Fakhul Miah from Go Mining Institutional, newer Bitcoin treasuries don’t have proper safeguards . If the BTC price goes below $90,000, it may trigger liquidations and a ripple effect that will affect bigger treasuries too. More than that, as regulation will allow companies to hold BTC self-custody, Bitcoin ETFs and stocks of Bitcoin treasuries may lose their attraction for corporations.

While he is advertising Bitcoin and urging everyone to buy Bitcoin, whatever it costs, Strategy is busy selling MSTR stocks, not exposing investors to direct Bitcoin ownership. Micheal ""SELL YOUR CHAIRS"" Saylor must be tripping, telling everyone to buy Bitcoin for years then watching everyone pile into every imaginable explicitly non-bitcoin financial product he offers. Truly amazing, absolute genius on his part. — P (@pmilanovich_bfs) June 24, 2025 Which treasuries can boast 10x mNAV? While most treasuries’ mNAV rate doesn’t exceed a 3.0 mark, several companies already reached the threshold brought up by Pledditor in the post. On June 6, 2025, NYDIG shared the mNAV rates based on the SEC filings. It indicates that GameStop and Nakamoto have mNAV rates above the 10 mark, while Metaplanet and Strive are near this value, with 7.6 and 9.1 rates, respectively. It’s worth saying that GameStop is leading the charge mostly because it had a substantial market cap before allocating Bitcoin, and the BTC share of GameStop’s reserve is relatively small. Was the Pledditor’s post aimed directly at David Bailey, whose company Nakamoto has an mNAV rate above 10? Probably so.

Krak is built to be simple, fast, and low-cost. It was released ahead of Kraken’s planned initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market in 2026. The app supports more than 300 cryptocurrencies. Krak Follows A Consumer-Focused Approach Ripple is recognized for facilitating the transfer of money across international borders for banks and large companies. Krak, on the other hand, is built for everyday people and small businesses. Users can transfer money to other Krak app users or directly to their bank accounts, with no transaction fee. This is designed to help people save money when sending funds, making digital payments easy and affordable for everyone. Meanwhile, the Krak app is part of Kraken’s bigger goal to expand its business. In the past months, the exchange introduced zero-fee trading on U.S. stocks and also bought a futures trading platform for $1.5 billion . With Krak, Kraken is now entering the fintech world, competing with popular apps like Venmo, Revolut, Cash App, and Coinbase Payments. Kraken To Expand Krak Use Beyond Digital Payments Kraken has plans to add more features to the app. Soon, Krak users will have access to both physical and virtual debit cards. These cards will let them spend their money directly from the app, just like a regular bank account. Later, Kraken will also offer loans and credit services through the app, demonstrating its plans to become a comprehensive financial service provider. By leveraging the existing strong systems, the company hopes Krak will attract both new and experienced users. Additionally, Krak will offer rewards to users, allowing them to earn up to 10% returns on selected assets. Most recently, Kraken partnered with Babylon, an innovative staking protocol, to let users earn rewards on their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings . This is part of the company’s plan to give more value back to users. Industry Experts See Big Potential in Krak Many experts believe the Krak app is an important move for Kraken. Analysts from Oppenheimer say that Krak could become a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional financial tools. Financial firms, such as Citi and PwC, also support this view, stating that the timing is right. This comes as new global rules are making it easier for digital money apps to grow safely. However, these experts believe that a good user experience will be key to Krak’s success. At the same time, Ripple is also growing. Its new RLUSD stablecoin was added to Alchemy Pay, making it easier for people to move between traditional money and crypto. Nevertheless, Krak focuses more on helping everyday users make fast and free payments.

Amid this transformation, certain projects rise above the rest, showcasing potential and robust growth. These standout initiatives are now setting the bar for future advancements in the market. Dive in to discover which coins are poised for remarkable growth and leadership in this new cycle. SUI Price Levels and Momentum Amid Bearish Trends SUI price action over the past month shows a notable loss of around 22.15% accompanied by a roughly 33.47% decline over six months. A weekly drop of nearly 3.97% further underscores the persistent downward pressure. The altcoin has experienced continuous selling pressure, reflected in the steadily declining trend and negative momentum indicators. A bearish stance has been maintained as the trading environment continues to weigh on confidence, with recent price behavior highlighting significant losses and a lack of upward recovery. Current prices are trading between $2.77 and $4.01, with an immediate resistance level at $4.77 and an initial support level at $2.29. A second resistance at $6.01 and a deeper support near $1.05 frame the broader trading range. The relative strength index at 39.99 borders the oversold area, suggesting potential buyer interest if conditions shift. However, bearish control remains dominant. No clear uptrend has emerged, and traders might explore long positions on dips, provided the lower support at $2.29 holds, while a break above $4.77 could prompt a rally toward $6.01. Jupiter Faces Mixed Signals as Price Struggles to Recover Over the past month, Jupiter has experienced a significant downturn, registering a nearly 33% price drop. The half-year performance isn't much better, reflecting an almost 50% decline. The coin's value has been trapped within a narrow trading range of $0.40 to $0.65 recently, indicating a loss of momentum. This ongoing decline suggests that investors are becoming more cautious amid uncertain market sentiment, which affects risk tolerance over both short and long-term periods. Currently, Jupiter is trading between crucial levels that necessitate caution while presenting potential trading opportunities. The price is hovering near the support level of $0.27 and encountering resistance at $0.78, marking a pivotal point for market participants. A second support at $0.02 and resistance at $1.04 provide additional decision-making layers. Technical indicators reveal a subdued market with bears in control, as moving averages indicate bearish pressure despite oscillators showing mixed sentiment. The absence of a clear upward trend urges buyers and sellers to carefully evaluate entry points. Trading strategies include seeking a bounce from lower support or cautiously testing the resistance zone, while monitoring any signals that may indicate a sustained price movement. CRV Price Analysis: Bearish Trends and Technical Boundaries in Focus Past performance of CRV indicates a significant downtrend with a decline of approximately 31% in the last month and about 42% over the past six months. A one-week reduction nearing 13% underscores a swift short-term drop. Price movement has remained under pressure, fluctuating between $0.58 and $0.81 while reflecting a consistent bearish sentiment. Historical losses have pressured the token, leading traders to adopt a cautious approach as the overall trend has been downward during this period. The current trading zone for CRV is established between $0.58 and $0.81, with immediate resistance around $0.95 and strong support near $0.50. Additional resistance can be found at $1.17, while extra support is marked at $0.27, creating a well-defined price range. Indicators show that sellers dominate, with an Awesome Oscillator at -0.099 and a Momentum signal of -0.084. The RSI stands at 35.117, approaching oversold levels but still under bearish pressure. Traders may look for opportunities if prices remain above support or test resistance, but caution is recommended until a clear trend reversal is observed in this constrained range. Conclusion SUI , JUP , and CRV are emerging as frontrunners in the new crypto cycle. Each project shows strong potential and unique strengths. SUI stands out with innovative technology. JUP excels with strong community engagement. CRV is gaining attention through impactful partnerships. Collectively, these projects set a new benchmark in the crypto space. Their progress provides a glimpse into the future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As competition heats up, questions emerge about whether Dogecoin can maintain its charm or if a bolder contender will take over. This article delves into the factors determining which coin is poised for growth. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Bearish Trends and Key Support/Resistance Levels Dogecoin has seen steep declines recently, with a nearly 26% drop over the past month and close to a 47% fall over the last six months. Price movements have remained subdued within a range of $0.15 to $0.24, reflecting persistent downward pressure. Historical trading sessions have revealed a bearish outlook that has gradually eroded investor confidence, as the coin slipped from previous highs. Recent market behavior aligns with broader trends in altcoin trading, which have exhibited similar levels of weakness. The overall decline underscores a period of volatility and highlights the challenges faced during bearish phases. Current prices are trading between $0.15 and $0.24, with a nearby support level at $0.11 that could serve as a potential buying zone, and resistance at $0.30 acting as a short-term ceiling. Market indicators are mixed, though bearish signals dominate, with a low RSI of roughly 40 and negative readings from both momentum and moving average indicators. A slight lift from the oscillators hints at limited buying interest, but overall, bears remain in control with no clear upward trend. Traders may find opportunities in carefully testing the support around $0.11, with any break above $0.30 offering a chance to reassess risk. Caution is advised until price action confirms a shift from the current defensive stance. Shiba Inu Faces Sustained Bearish Pressure Amid Extended Declines Over the past month, Shiba Inu experienced a significant decline of approximately 19%, marking notable short-term weakness. In the last six months, the token lost nearly half of its value with a 46% drop, highlighting persistent downward pressure. A slight weekly decrease of 0.51% revealed minimal daily fluctuation amid an extended period of bearish sentiment. Historical price movements indicate the altcoin has struggled to regain its footing and has shown reluctance in achieving a sustained recovery. Considerable losses over both the short and long term reflect broader market hesitance and a lack of renewed buying interest. Its current price environment for Shiba Inu is defined by a band ranging from $0.00001084 to $0.00001622. The market finds a primary resistance point near $0.00001962 and immediate support at $0.00000886, with a secondary resistance at $0.000025 and a further support near $0.00000348. Current indicators show that bears exert considerable influence, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.00000123 and the Relative Strength Index at 42.87. The absence of a clear upward trend creates a cautious atmosphere among traders. Trading ideas might include waiting for a bounce off the support before entering a long position, while a break below could prompt short positions. A move past $0.00001962 could signal renewed bullish momentum. Conclusion DOGE has long held its place as the leading meme coin, but SHIB's rise suggests increased competition. SHIB has adopted a more aggressive approach, often stealing the spotlight. While DOGE retains a loyal fan base, the evolving market dynamics make it clear that SHIB is a contender to watch closely. The meme coin arena is more competitive than ever, and both coins face the challenge of maintaining relevance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite market volatility, it continues to attract attention. With the current excitement and anticipation for assets like XRP to surge in July , we consulted ChatGPT to see if SHIB would go in a positive direction. When asked for a price prediction for July 1, 2025, ChatGPT outlined three possible scenarios based on current market dynamics and sentiment patterns. Base Case Scenario for SHIB Price According to the forecast, the base scenario projects Shiba Inu to trade between $0.000017 and $0.000021 by July 1, 2025. This projection assumes relative stability in the broader cryptocurrency market, supported by moderate bullish sentiment. ChatGPT explains that this range reflects “a moderate growth phase driven by ecosystem developments like Shibarium adoption and ongoing token burns.” The model emphasizes that such growth also relies on continued investor interest in altcoins and a healthy level of risk appetite within the market. Bullish Case Scenario for SHIB Price In a bullish outcome, where altcoins gain significant traction and liquidity starts rotating, SHIB could reach between $0.000024 and $0.000027. This scenario is based on strong speculative demand and increased trading volumes. ChatGPT notes that under these conditions, the price is supported by “sustained speculative demand, high trading volumes, and social hype fueling meme token rallies.” The AI tool also mentioned accelerated token burning as a catalyst for bullish momentum. ChatGPT’s bullish outlook depends heavily on positive market sentiment and the continuation of trends that favor riskier digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bearish Case Scenario for SHIB Price On the downside, should the cryptocurrency market experience heightened volatility or a broader correction, Shiba Inu may end up between $0.000013 to $0.000015. ChatGPT describes this as a scenario reflecting “risk-off behavior in altcoins” but clarifies that it would likely “hold above critical long-term support zones unless a severe breakdown occurs.” This projection assumes that SHIB would remain relatively resilient unless the broader digital asset market experiences a significant downturn. What’s Next for SHIB? SHIB is currently trading at 0.00001159, down 0.4% from yesterday. All ChatGPT’s predictions suggest growth for the asset, including the bearish case. The primary drivers behind this prediction include market sentiment, speculative interest, and developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The Shiba Inu team shared words of encouragement with the community due to recent struggles, and ChatGPT’s forecast suggests that those struggles are coming to an end.

46841838,https://crypto.news/?p=14392232,1750966665,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/46841838.jpeg,U.S Senate eyes fall finish for crypto rules as House keeps cards close,https://crypto.news/u-s-senate-eyes-fall-finish-for-crypto-rules-as-house-keeps-cards-close/,"The Senate is racing toward a September finish line for crypto rules. But with the House stuck at the starting block, this legislative marathon might take longer than anyone expected. At a Thursday press briefing, Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott laid down a new target for completing crypto market structure legislation: September 30. Flanked by Senator Cynthia Lummis and President Trump’s digital asset advisor Bo Hines, Scott said he believes the timeline is “realistic,” even if it pushes beyond the president’s preferred August deadline. But while the Senate appears unified, the House remains conspicuously silent, with Financial Services Chair French Hill refusing to commit to the same schedule, signaling a potential roadblock ahead. You might also like: Will Wall Street keep betting on crypto: What to expect from your altcoin portfolio Is Washington’s crypto consensus falling apart? Behind Senator Scott’s confident September deadline lies a widening rift between congressional chambers. While the Senate Banking Committee moves with unusual coordination, even securing buy-in from digital assets skeptic Sherrod Brown on key provisions, House Financial Services Chair French Hill has maintained radio silence on whether his chamber will play ball. Even within the House, where the Clarity Act has advanced through key committees, there’s little clarity on whether leadership will embrace the Senate’s GENIUS Act or continue to push its own version of stablecoin legislation. The Senate’s GENIUS Act, passed last week with rare bipartisan support, would impose Federal Reserve-backed reserve requirements and block tech giants like Amazon from issuing tokens. But Hill’s competing bill, already cleared by House committees, carves out authority for state regulators and offers more flexibility for foreign issuers. These aren’t minor technical differences; they represent a philosophical clash over whether crypto belongs under Washington’s thumb or gets a decentralized regulatory approach. There’s also political calculus at play. President Trump’s call for an August signing deadline adds pressure, but it doesn’t alter the procedural hurdles. Even if the Senate finalizes its draft by September, reconciling it with House proposals could stretch into late fall. For all the urgency projected from the Senate podium, the path to actual crypto legislation remains uncertain. The political choreography between chambers, committees, and competing visions has yet to sync. The longer this drags on, the more ground U.S. markets lose. The EU’s MiCA framework is already reshaping global stablecoin flows, while Asia’s crypto hubs are capitalizing on America’s regulatory paralysis. Every delayed vote, every unresolved dispute over state versus federal oversight, pushes another wave of innovation offshore.

Ongoing instability in the Middle East has put the market on a shaky foundation this week, while today’s news regarding Judge Torres’ rejection of a final settlement between the SEC and Ripple has also weighed on prices. ETH therefore remains down by 2% in a week and by 8% in a month, with its two-week chart forming a very bearish death cross that could indicate further losses. However, such crosses precede a clearing out of weaker hands, and with Ethereum’s fundamentals remaining as strong as ever, the long-term ETH price prediction remains bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction – ETH Forms Rare ‘Death Cross’ Pattern Last Seen in 2022 – What’s Going On? Looking at ETH’s two-week chart, we can see that its 20-period average (orange) has just dropped below the 50-period (blue), following the coin’s declines since the start of the year. And if you scan back in time, you can see that the last time these two averages formed a death cross was in September 2022, when the Ethereum price went from around $1,750 to $1,150 by December. Source: TradingView This is a 34% decline, implying that we may be about to see a similarly steep drop in the coming weeks and months. There are other parallels with the second half of 2022, such as the fact that Ethereum’s moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has recently turned negative. And after turning negative in the middle of 2022, it remained below the baseline for more or less a year, as ETH struggled to regain the highs it had enjoyed in late 2021. Of course, past patterns are no guarantee of the future, and it’s possible to argue that circumstances are different this time, what with a pro-crypto White House. But we can also argue that, with the situation tense in the Middle East , the crypto market could encounter shocks that drag down the Ethereum price.

And because Ethereum remains the biggest layer-one network in terms of TVL , it’s a prime position to grow again once conditions are more favorable. Based on this, we can expect that, after dipping in the coming weeks, the Ethereum price will return to $3,000 by Q4, and to $3,500 by the end of the year. Solaxy Continues to Rally After Big Launch and $58 Million Presale: Best New Coin? For those traders worried that history may repeat itself for Ethereum, there are newer tokens that are showing more positive momentum in the near term. A strong example of this is Solaxy (SOLX), a new layer-two platform that has recently listed after raising a massive $58 million in its presale. Solaxy is now LIVE on CoinGecko https://t.co/2PJM0PlkXt pic.twitter.com/5tCJc9WWNY — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 23, 2025 Its native token SOLX has now listed on Uniswap and Raydium, and it’s up by 5% in the past 24 hours, as of writing. In fact, it had a massive opening earlier this week, reaching its current record high of $0.001284 on Tuesday, which made for a 108% gain over its lowest price on the day (Monday) it listed. Investors have been flocking to Solaxy because of its interesting fundamentals, with the project launching Solana’s first proper layer-two network. As such, it offers ultra-low transaction fees and very fast confirmation times, helping users to avoid the congestion that can still impact Solana. It enables instant bridging between itself and Solana, while in the future its team plans to expand its compatibility to other chains. The next few weeks will see the arrival of its own token launchpad, Igniter, through which anyone will be able to issue their own coins. Its own DEX is also on the way, helping to make Solaxy one of the most exciting new platforms in crypto. Holders of its native token, SOLX, will be able to stake the coin for passive income, something which should boost demand for the token over time. And with more exchange listings rumored, now could be a very time to buy the token, while it remains relatively cheap.

Price is testing a key level where a bullish reversal could soon be initiated. After a recent dip, Cardano ( ADA ) is now trading near the lower bound of its established trading range, between $0.49 and $1.19. The zone around $0.49 is more than just daily support, it’s a confluence of several major technical levels, including a key swing low and the value area low of the current range. Holding this zone will be vital for ADA to maintain its broader bullish structure. Key technical points $0.49 Support Zone: Daily support, swing low, and value area low all converge at this level. Point of Control (POC): Critical reference level that must hold to sustain any upward move. Potential Deviation Setup: A liquidity sweep below support could trigger a sharp reversal. ADAUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView ADA’s recent decline appears to be a controlled correction rather than a breakdown. Price action is now pressing into the $0.49 support zone, which has acted as a key pivot level throughout this range. This level is reinforced by multiple forms of confluence, making it a high-probability area for a bounce or reversal if buyers step in. Importantly, the point of control remains a critical reference level. A breakdown below the POC would suggest a significant shift in sentiment and could negate the current bullish structure. As long as ADA stays above the POC and defends this support zone, the pullback can be classified as a healthy higher low within an ongoing uptrend. You might also like: Dogwifhat slips after golden pocket rejection, this support level now in focus From a structural standpoint, ADA is still printing higher lows, which is essential for maintaining bullish momentum. If this support holds, it would likely form the next higher low before a push back toward the range highs near $1.19. Traders should also be aware of the possibility of a deviation setup. In this scenario, price may temporarily dip below $0.49 to sweep liquidity before quickly reclaiming the level. This pattern often traps late sellers and fuels a stronger upside move once the deviation is resolved. Volume remains relatively subdued, which suggests ADA could continue to range between major support and resistance zones until a catalyst initiates expansion. What to expect in the coming price action If ADA holds the $0.49 support zone, a bullish rotation toward $1.19 becomes likely in the coming sessions. However, if price deviates below support and fails to reclaim it, the bullish structure may break down.

Currently priced at $128 and struggling to gain bullish momentum, having declined by 28% in the last 30 days, a 10x move to $1280 is more wishful thinking than a realistic projection. Nine tokens are expected to increase by 10x or more within the coming months to capture truly explosive growth in 2025. Why SOL’s Next Sprint Won’t Be a Marathon Solana’s network upgrades and validator client improvements have all but eliminated the outages that once plagued it. Transaction fees remain low, and a wave of new projects continues to launch on the chain. Yet, SOL’s market capitalization is already measured in the tens of billions, meaning any significant price move demands institutional inflows on a massive scale. With regulators tightening the reins and Bitcoin still playing the lead role in market sentiment, SOL is more likely to inch upward than rocket into the stratosphere. That doesn’t mean Solana is a bad investment—it simply means that if you’re hunting for a 10x return in 2025, you’re better off hunting in smaller ponds where a few million dollars of fresh capital can create tidal waves. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe is the new kid on the block, emerging with steam and creating buzz. Launched as a dedicated meme-centric Layer 2 blockchain, LILPEPE combines cheeky culture with real-world utility, offering ultra-low fees, near-instant finality, and a presale design that rewards early believers. Unlike most meme coins that fizzle out, Little Pepe has raised over $1.74 million in its ongoing presale, now in its third stage at $0.0012. Community giveaways, a no-tax policy, and a roadmap promising native meme launchpads and resistance to sniper-bot have turned what could have been a fleeting fad into a burgeoning ecosystem. At its current valuation, a 10x move for LILPEPE feels more than possible if the community continues to grow and its Layer-2 network sees real adoption. Sui (SUI) Sui has carved out a reputation for blistering transaction speeds and a fresh take on smart contract architecture. Its object-centric Move programming model allows parallel execution, which translates into finality in under two seconds. As DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces deploy on Sui, the token’s demand is growing faster than many anticipated. Given its relatively modest market cap compared to older layer-1 chains, SUI is still in a ‘grab it before you have to pay for it’ territory and has all the makings of a 10x token. With new rollouts on the horizon, SUI is set for a 10x return in 2025. Stellar (XLM) By teaming up with remittance services, central banks and stablecoin issuers, Stellar has proven its strength in payments. Thanks to almost zero fees and near-instant transactions, XLM is perfect for sending money across borders or making tiny purchases without breaking the bank. With USDC circulating on the network and CBDC pilots underway, Stellar’s practical value is no longer just a promise—it’s happening now. As regulators clarify frameworks around digital assets, networks with proven compliance track records—like Stellar—are likely to see fresh inflows. For investors who believe that blockchain’s next act involves disrupting the global payments industry, XLM presents a low-risk, high-upside play that could easily multiply by ten if adoption accelerates. Immutable (IMX) Blockchain gaming remains one of crypto’s most promising frontiers, provided the infrastructure can handle millions of users without breaking the bank. Immutable has solved that equation by deploying a zk-rollup on Ethereum, offering gas-free NFT trading and instant finality. Flagship titles like Gods Unchained and Guild of Guardians already attract thousands of daily players, and partnerships with mainstream gaming platforms are in the pipeline. As the sector grows, so too will demand for IMX. Its modest market capitalization and strong developer community position it perfectly for a ten-fold surge once mainstream gamers recognize the benefits of tokenized in-game assets. Sei (SEI) Sei hits the sweet spot for DeFi enthusiasts who crave high-performance orderbook trading without compromising decentralization. By optimizing block times and transaction ordering for DEXs, SEI provides a native environment for limit-order books, algo trading, and high-frequency strategies. Its early deployment on Binance and Coinbase has boosted liquidity, and new integrations with cross-chain bridges are coming online. For traders and protocols seeking an alternative to Ethereum and Solana for execution speed and functionality, SEI could become the default choice, triggering significant token demand and enabling a 10x move in 2025. Velar (VELAR) While Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of store-of-value, its blockchain isn’t known for DeFi. Velar changes that by leveraging the Stacks network to bring smart contract capabilities and lending markets to BTC holders. As more users seek yield on their Bitcoin without exiting the ecosystem, Velar’s lending and synthetic asset platforms are poised for explosive growth. With yields in DeFi often outpacing traditional finance and Bitcoin’s dominance still intact, Velar stands to capture a portion of that yield-chasing capital, potentially rewarding early VELAR holders with tenfold gains. ChainGPT (CGPT) AI and blockchain are converging in unprecedented ways, and ChainGPT is at the forefront. By offering AI-driven smart contract generation, on-chain market analysis, and automated customer support bots, CGPT is creating a suite of tools that developers and projects need. As more teams recognize the value of AI-powered automation in reducing costs and boosting security, demand for CGPT tokens could skyrocket. Given its niche yet rapidly expanding utility, a 10x increase is a realistic target for 2025. Kujira (KUJI) Kujira has built a reputation for no-BS DeFi services on the Cosmos network. Its decentralized liquidation protocol, a genuinely collateral-backed stablecoin, and simplified yield-farming offerings have won over users tired of complexity. More importantly, Kujira has proven profitable—an anomaly in DeFi. As users flock to sustainable projects that value transparency and actual yields over flashy APRs, KUJI could see demand drive its token price into the stratosphere, delivering those coveted 10x returns. Solaxy (SOLX) Solaxy enters the fray as a performance-first layer-1 built to rival Solana itself. With consensus optimizations that promise sub-second block times and fees so low they are zero, SOLX is attracting developers frustrated by congestion elsewhere. As dApps seek out reliable, cost-effective platforms, Solaxy’s early mover advantage in the high-throughput niche could translate into a significant token demand spike, potentially fueling a 10x surge by late 2025. Looking Beyond the Giants When you’re searching for truly asymmetric gains, it often pays to look where the crowd isn’t. Solana remains a household name, but if you’re aiming for tenfold returns, the smaller market caps and fundamentals of these nine tokens offer a clearer path. History has shown that the next moonshot token rarely comes from household names that have been in the spotlight. In 2025, those willing to scout beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, and even beyond Solana, may find the biggest wins waiting with these nine tokens.

This category of stocks now makes up a record-breaking 12.1% of the S&P 500. This is double what it was just three years ago. The chips are finally up, but the Trump-led tariff war is still in action. Nvidia, the chipmaker giant, alone now reportedly accounts for 56% of the semiconductor sector’s market cap. Broadcom trails far behind at 20%. After reclaiming the throne as the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia hit a fresh record with a $3.8 trillion market cap. Microsoft Corp remains the 2nd biggest in the tally. Nvidia holds the chip market crown As per the data, Nvidia has added $1.42 trillion in value since its April low. It has now surged 63% in just under three months. Meanwhile, the broader semiconductor index, $SOX, is up 111% over the past three years. It has even outpaced the S&P 500’s gain of 61%. In June alone, chip stocks have already led the S&P 500 with nearly 15% gains, crushing every other industry. Nvidia shattered its own record, trading over $155.5 on Thursday and officially flexing past its January high of $149.43. As the chipmaker basked in the AI glow, the broader chip sector followed it. Companies like Marvell Technology surged 5%, Credo and Allegro climbed 2% while Astera Labs rocketed 8%. US semiconductor stocks have never been bigger: The Semiconductor sector now reflects a record 12.1% of the S&P 500’s total market value.

However, its stock has nearly doubled since April’s lows and is trading at $125.15 at the press time. But while Wall Street’s riding the silicon wave, Trump is playing monetary chess with the Fed. Reports suggest that he’s privately considering replacing Jerome Powell before his term ends in 2026. He believes that the current Fed is moving too slowly on rate cuts. This speculation has already shifted the market odds as traders now give a 25% chance of a July rate cut, up from just 12.5% last week. China bets on Gold as tariff risks rise Trump’s ticking tariff time bomb remains, as the 90-day pause ends in 13 days, on July 9. If all remains the same, the tariffs on EU imports might hit 50%, for China it’ll be 30% while there is a global 10% baseline in effect. On the market side, the S&P 500 is up ~1,200 points since the pause was announced. And while the US flexes tariffs and stumbles on recession, China is following a different financial playbook. The dollar’s share of China’s FX reserves has dropped to just 22% and is at its lowest in the last 15 years. Meanwhile, gold’s price has doubled to a record 6.8%. Since 2022, China has bought 200 tonnes of gold, hinting at the de-dollarization theory. While the biggest crypto, Bitcoin, is on a roll, the AI-linked cryptos haven’t performed much. The biggest 5 AI cryptos are printing red index on every metric. Bittensor (TAO) price is down by 29% over the last 30 days and is trading at $320 at the press time. Near Protocol (NEAR) has performed in a similar trend and is down by 30% in the same period. The cumulative AI crypto market cap dropped by 3% in the last 24 hours to stand at $27.08 billion. Bitcoin is trading high on an adoption rally, trading at an average price of $107,409 at the press time. It is just shy by 4.1% of its all-time high of $111,900.

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap looks poised to hit a new ATH by the end of next month, also noting that he expects BTC to dip before skyrocketing. “Bitcoin continues to push upwards and break the all-time high. I still think we’ll have a slight consolidation before the big breakout happens, which means that an all-time high is on the cards for July ’25.” Van de Poppe says that in order for the crypto king to shatter its previous best, it needs to first hurdle a key resistance level at $108,900. “Bitcoin has taken the liquidity. That’s great, there’s a lot of upside momentum here. However, this is the FINAL hurdle before a new ATH. I think we’ll consolidate slightly and break towards new ATHs in the coming 1-2 weeks max.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X According to the analyst, BTC rallying would also send altcoins skyrocketing due to them being short-squeezed, or a rapid increase in price driven by short sellers covering their positions. “Altcoins are looking primed for a big move upwards. If Bitcoin is able to break up, Altcoins are likely to outperform. How? Massive short squeezes across the board accelerating the price action of those altcoins upwards vanishing losses away in days/weeks.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,633 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced the indictment of 25-year-old Kai West on Wednesday. West is accused of using his “IntelBroker” identity to infiltrate computer networks, steal sensitive data, and sell it on underground cybercrime forums. Hacker “West” Ran Global Data Theft Operation, Used Monero to Obscure $2.4M in Sales Authorities say West led a cybercriminal group known as “CyberN[——],” which infiltrated systems belonging to a telecommunications company, a municipal healthcare provider, an internet service firm, and dozens of other organizations. Prosecutors say West and his associates stole sensitive data and sold it online, often requesting payment in Monero, a cryptocurrency favored for its privacy features. Serial hacker “IntelBroker” charged in $25 million cyber scheme. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice,” said USA Jay Clayton. https://t.co/CrMzWtJ1fR pic.twitter.com/ob6gJDsALF — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) June 25, 2025 Over a two-year period, from 2023 to 2025, West allegedly posted and offered stolen data across at least 158 public threads. He listed data for sale in 41 of those posts, asking prices that totaled over $2.4 million. In many cases, he gave away stolen information in exchange for forum credits or to boost his reputation within the hacker community. One breach included patient data from a healthcare provider, exposing names, Social Security numbers, and health records. In another case, West reportedly accessed servers of a U.S. telecom firm and sold customer details. Prosecutors allege that West even served as the “owner” of BreachForums between August 2024 and January 2025, further solidifying IntelBroker’s profile in the cybercrime space. “This action reflects the FBI’s commitment to pursuing cybercriminals around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes, and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice.” FBI Assistant Director Christopher G. Raia described West as a “serial hacker” who profited off stolen data and caused harm to organizations across borders. “Today’s announcement should serve as a warning to anyone thinking they can hide behind a keyboard and commit cybercrime with impunity,” he added. According to the complaint, an undercover agent paid IntelBroker $250 in Bitcoin for stolen data, which included admin-level credentials. The payment was sent to an address linked to Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka IntelBroker), and the data was delivered. Fitzpatrick and his associates allegedly tried to sell more data for over $2 million. West was arrested in France in February 2025. The U.S. is seeking his extradition to face prosecution. He is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized access to protected computers, and wire fraud. If convicted on all counts, he faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison. The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan B. Finkel leading the prosecution. West remains in custody in France pending the outcome of the extradition request. The charges remain allegations, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Massive Credential Leak Raises New Alarms After IntelBroker Indictment Following the indictment of British national IntelBroker for allegedly trafficking stolen data worth over $25 million via BreachForums, a new report from Cybernews has added fuel to the fire, revealing one of the largest credential leaks ever recorded. According to researchers, over 16 billion login credentials linked to platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub have been exposed in a sweeping breach. But this wasn’t a single incident. Over 16 billion login records from Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub exposed in fresh malware-based data breaches. #cybersecurity #databreach https://t.co/YncLGPv9MU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The data, traced back to early 2024, comes from infostealer malware, credential stuffing attacks, and several previously undisclosed leaks. Some individual sets contained as many as 3.5 billion records, with the average around 550 million. For crypto users, the implications are serious. Wallets and exchanges often tie to compromised email providers or cloud services. A breach in one could mean direct access to digital assets. Cybernews urges users to change passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and scan devices for malware immediately. This follows a grim 2024, where the FBI recorded $9.3 billion in crypto fraud losses , up 66% from 2023. The Bureau also reported over 149,000 complaints, and had to intervene in suicide cases linked to crypto scams.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi-driven presale gem that’s rapidly climbing investor watchlists. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is selling at $0.03. The investor interest remains very strong and the token has been purchased by more than 12,500 investors with a raise of $11.2 million. The investors who invest at this level will obtain 100% of returns on investment when the token is listed. For investors asking what’s the best cryptocurrency to invest in this summer, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming hard to ignore. Mutuum Finance Surpasses $11.2 Million Milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast turning out to be one of the hottest projects within DeFi. With a whopping $11.2 million raised and over 12,500 investors already signed up, the presale is taking serious traction. In its fifth phase, the token is selling at $0.03. The next round will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors can already expect a 100% return even before the token goes on sale. Some are even predicting a post-launch price bounce to more than $2.50 before the 2025 bull run is through. Unlocking Adaptive Intelligence in DeFi Borrowing With a user-freedom, security, and control-based lending platform, Mutuum Finance is disrupting decentralized finance. Instead of leading users towards a single model, Mutuum will provide a two-side model which makes up for several means of DeFi engagements. Its Peer-to-Contract functionality gives users an option to put USDT into smart contracts that are automated in nature where the interest rate may fluctuate depending on market activity. This is a stable, hands-off source of passive income because no manual work is required for facilitating trades. For those who prefer to have greater freedom of action, they have the option of using the Peer-to-Peer approach which gives freedom to the same groups of borrowers and lenders to talk directly to one another and determine their own terms and are not compelled to depend upon third party groups. It is an open, trustless design that allows the user complete control over their money, something that is an effective option in a more unstable environment or special lending transaction. By combining the force of automation and customization, Mutuum Finance can establish a new standard in DeFi lending; be capable of having an entirely automated product without necessarily completely giving up control of the system. $100,000 in Leaderboard and Giveaway Rewards Now Available Mutuum Finance is celebrating its fast-paced growth and thanking early bird fans by creating a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000’s worth of MUTM tokens, simply for signing up early. In addition, the project has also introduced a live leaderboard, and the top 50 MUTM token holders will be awarded special bonus rewards, adding a gamified touch to the presale and making it more fun to join. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly cementing its status as a breakout DeFi project, already raising over $11.2 million and attracting 12,500+ investors in its presale. Priced at just $0.03 in phase five, early adopters are positioned for 100% gains by the time the token hits its launch price of $0.06. In addition a 100x post-launch rally will easily turn $1,000 into $100,000. Join the presale now before prices increase in the next round and claim your stake in what could be DeFi’s next major success story.

The trader pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 321,100 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat ( WIF ), a memecoin built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem, could go up by about 472% to reclaim and surpass the all-time high recorded in March of 2024. “Still a lot of work to put in and need to see price action confirm, but I think there’s a very real chance a new impulse back to all-time high on WIF has commenced.” According to the analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, WIF started a bullish uptrend earlier this month in a five-wave pattern. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Based on Bluntz’s chart on the three-day time frame, WIF bottomed out earlier this year. Source: Bluntz/X Over the short term, the pseudonymous analyst says WIF could undergo a correction before rallying. Based on the widely followed analyst’s chart of the one-hour time frame, WIF could pull back by around 10% from the current level. “Very obvious five-wave rise from the lows on hourly for WIF, would expect a bit of a pullback here before the next major leg up.” Source: Bluntz/X WIF is trading at $0.845 at time of writing.

46842924,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-are-loading-up-on-bdag-heres-how-theyre-using-the-0-0030-window-to-maximize-gains/,1750968051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/46842924.jpeg,Crypto Whales Are Loading Up on BDAG: Here’s How They’re Using the $0.0030 Window to Maximize Gains!,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-whales-are-loading-up-on-bdag-heres-how-theyre-using-the-0-0030-window-to-maximize-gains/,"Crypto’s larger players are quietly building positions, and BlockDAG (BDAG) has become their focus. With over $323 million already raised and 23.3 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is moving swiftly toward its $600 million presale target. But what’s catching attention isn’t just its progress, it’s the current pricing move. A temporary $0.0030 offer in Batch 29 contrasts sharply with the standard $0.0276 rate and lasts for a limited time. This pricing shift, backed by a confirmed $0.05 listing rate, is viewed by many as one of the most favorable setups in the current presale cycle. The upcoming rise to $0.0080 only adds to the urgency, encouraging strategic accumulation from well-informed buyers during this limited period. Significance of the $0.0030 Pricing Phase Price matters most at the early stage. BDAG’s first entrants came in at $0.001, and with the current limited-time rate of $0.0030, new participants are looking at potential gains of 2,400% once the coin lists at $0.05. While several projects suggest strong future growth, BlockDAG stands apart due to its open presale structure and technical infrastructure. This isn’t just another speculative name. The project has sold over 18,100 ASIC miners, attracted 2 million+ users on its X1 mining app , and successfully launched its testnet. Developers are already using its no-code dApp builder, with grants supporting early usage. These are not future promises; they are operational components aiming toward full-scale rollout by Q4 2025. Large-scale buyers understand the significance. Instead of waiting for the market to react, they’re positioning themselves before the six-week run-up to launch begins. Why This Moment Aligns with a Larger Plan The clarity of BlockDAG’s roadmap stands out. Unlike projects that delay key developments until after listing, this team is delivering ahead of schedule. The milestones include: Live Testnet: Developers are already working with smart contracts and decentralized applications. Mainnet Rollout: Launches a month before listing, ensuring early decentralization and mining activity. DeFi Stack: A DEX, lending system, launchpad, and oracles will be deployed before BDAG goes live on centralized exchanges. Coin Distribution: 40% of presale coins will be released two weeks prior to launch to promote engagement and liquidity. This planned sequence is built to minimize post-listing volatility. Entry at the presale stage provides more than just lower pricing; it secures early ecosystem involvement. What Makes BlockDAG a Strong Contender in the Market Amid widespread meme coins and loosely structured plans, BlockDAG brings a hybrid foundation: a Directed Acyclic Graph structure paired with a proof-of-work system. This allows up to 15,000 transactions per second, without compromising on decentralization. Support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine also means developers can migrate dApps with ease. On top of that, its low-code tools allow broader participation from non-programmers, helping the network grow steadily. With over 200,000 unique holders and momentum building through confirmed exchange listings and a potential US-based sponsorship, BlockDAG is aiming for broader market visibility in the months leading up to launch. Final Words! Where most launches see early excitement and tapering interest, BlockDAG has reversed that trend. Strong demand is arriving now, before the last six-week window opens. This limited-time $0.0030 offer is acting as a reset for those who missed the opening stages. High-volume buyers are already making their move. With the special pricing set to end soon and the next increase bringing it to $0.0080, this may be the last time such a gap exists before the public listing. Even if BDAG only climbs to $1, a target considered realistic by some analysts, the gains from $0.0030 would reach as high as 49,900%. Significant returns in crypto often come from acting early with the right data, not chasing trends. For now, that window with BDAG remains open.

Unlocking True Multichain Functionality Through its integration with Wormhole, XRPL will be connected to over 35 major blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and more. This means assets like XRP, stablecoins, and tokenized RWAs can seamlessly move across chains without the friction traditionally associated with interoperability. Today, we are partnering with @Wormhole to bring multichain interoperability to the XRPL and the upcoming XRPL EVM Sidechain: https://t.co/soylouwu47 This integration brings new optionality for developers and institutions looking to build cross-chain applications whether for… pic.twitter.com/dpDDEKEQY6 — RippleX (@RippleXDev) June 26, 2025 According to Ripple, this opens new horizons for building flexible, scalable, and efficient cross-chain solutions, with significant appeal to both developers and enterprise users. A Strategic Leap for Developers and Enterprises Ripple CTO David Schwartz underscored the importance of the Wormhole partnership, noting that blockchain adoption won’t be driven by isolated chains, but by networks that can communicate effectively across ecosystems. This vision is now coming to life. With lower transaction costs and near-instant finality, XRPL already offers an attractive infrastructure. By adding cross-chain capabilities, Ripple is making the network even more developer-friendly, especially for those building next-gen DeFi protocols, stablecoin solutions, and RWA marketplaces. The XRPL EVM Sidechain: Ethereum Compatibility Meets XRP Performance At the heart of Ripple’s broader strategy is the XRPL EVM Sidechain , expected to go live by the end of Q2 2025. Built by Peersyst and anchored by the Axelar bridge, the sidechain will support wrapped XRP (eXRP) as its native gas token and bring full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts. This means developers can deploy existing Solidity-based applications using familiar tooling while benefiting from XRPL’s fast and cost-effective infrastructure. The sidechain’s testnet has already gained traction, with over 87 contributors—many from outside the XRP community—and hundreds of thousands of transactions processed daily. The ability to connect XRPL’s speed and stability with Ethereum’s programmability represents a crucial leap in utility for both chains. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Expanding Use Cases in DeFi, Payments, and RWA Tokenization This dual development—the Wormhole partnership and the EVM Sidechain—positions Ripple and XRPL to lead in several critical sectors. For DeFi, it enables capital to move freely between chains, supporting lending, trading, and yield strategies at scale. For payments, enterprises can integrate XRPL’s low-cost, high-speed rails into multichain workflows. And for RWAs, asset issuers can tap into deeper liquidity pools and broader investor bases thanks to seamless cross-chain transferability. Laying the Foundation for an Interoperable Blockchain Future Security and compliance remain central to Ripple’s strategy. Axelar’s decentralized validator set and security measures—including key rotation policies—ensure trust and resilience in asset bridging. As institutions increasingly adopt regulated digital assets like Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, the ability to move those assets across chains with confidence becomes critical. With this integration and the pending launch of the XRPL EVM Sidechain , Ripple is accelerating its vision of a truly interoperable blockchain ecosystem—bridging speed, scalability, and global usability. As Ripple continues to gather feedback and enhance its tooling, the XRP Ledger is being positioned as a foundational layer for the next wave of multichain innovation.

XRP , ETH , and ADA are showing promising signs of upward momentum. This period may be ripe for notable growth in these digital assets. Investors and enthusiasts will want to understand why these coins could lead the charge and what factors might drive this potential surge. XRP Price Action and Key Levels Signal Neutral Market Conditions XRP experienced a 5.04% decline over the past month, while showing a 2.25% increase over the last six months. The coin's price movements have been moderate, lacking extreme fluctuations, which suggest a blend of short-term weakness and longer-term recovery. Throughout this period, price changes remained within a consistent range, indicating that investors faced dips and subsequent recoveries in their trading activities. XRP is currently trading between $1.95 and $2.53, with resistance at $2.88 and support at $1.73. The next notable levels include resistance at $3.45 and support at $1.15. Technical metrics indicate a neutral position, with an RSI of 50.46 and slight negative momentum from both the Awesome Oscillator at -0.061 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.044. This equilibrium shows a lack of dominance from either bulls or bears, creating a sideways market. Traders may consider buying near support levels and look for profit as prices trend toward resistance zones, all while maintaining a cautious approach. Ethereum's Recent Downturn and Key Price Levels for Action Ethereum faced a moderate drop of about -3.23% over the past month and a sharper decline of -25.51% in the last six months. Price adjustments have pushed the current range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. This period has seen noticeable loss pressure with overall bearish movements impacting investor sentiment. Monthly and half-year changes indicate that price correction remains the prevailing trend, reflecting market forces that have favored sellers and resulted in significant downtrends that warrant caution among traders. Current prices hover within a tight band, setting the nearest resistance at $3395.40 and the closest support at $1318.72, with a second resistance level at $4433.74 and a deep support around $280.38. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at -163.45 and Momentum Indicator at -63.69 reflect a market leaning towards bearish pressure, while the Relative Strength Index at 50.11 shows no clear momentum for buyers or sellers. Trading strategies could involve shorting if upward moves stall near resistance while preparing for potential reversals at support levels, advocating for cautious tactics within these ranges amid uncertainties. Cardano's Market Trends and Critical Price Levels Cardano experienced a notable decline in the last month, dropping nearly 25%, and about 35% over the past six months. The sustained bearish momentum reflected persistent price weakness, where temporary fluctuations did little to reverse the downward trend. Both shorter and longer periods highlighted significant sale pressure and a cautious stance among traders. Volatility marked this period, with price swings indicating a lack of strong conviction among market participants. Current market dynamics position Cardano between $0.5967 and $0.8187. The nearest resistance level at $0.9523 defines a clear ceiling, while support appears solid at $0.5083, backed by a lower level at $0.2863. Technical indicators confirm prevailing bearish pressure, with an RSI of 36.85 indicating subdued market strength. Although bulls have not taken control, opportunities for trades within these levels may arise. Buying near support could be attractive with signs of reversal, while short positions near midrange prices may work if the downtrend continues. A disciplined strategy with tight stop-loss orders remains essential in this cautious outlook. Conclusion XRP , ETH , and ADA have strong potential for significant growth over the next 18 months. Increased interest and widespread adoption could drive their prices higher. Key partnerships and technological advancements play a major role. These factors should be closely monitored as these coins might yield lucrative returns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The move has revived bullish sentiment, with many analysts calling for Ethereum to lead the long-anticipated altseason. The swift rebound caught traders off guard, reinforcing the view that the recent drop was nothing more than a fakeout. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds Top analyst M-log1 commented on the reversal, stating that ETH is back in range. His analysis points to the idea that Ethereum’s price action has successfully shaken out weak hands while setting the stage for a bullish continuation. If momentum holds, ETH could attempt a move toward the higher range around $2,600–$2,800, a zone that has consistently acted as a battleground in previous cycles. Ethereum’s role as the leading altcoin makes its performance critical for broader market direction. A confirmed breakout here could trigger renewed confidence across the altcoin market and open the door for the long-awaited altseason. For now, bulls are in control—but Ethereum must hold current levels and push higher to keep the momentum alive and avoid another retracement into bearish territory. Ethereum Holds the Line: The Key to Unlocking Altseason? Ethereum surged following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, easing geopolitical tensions and triggering a sharp rebound across the crypto market. ETH, which had briefly broken down below the $2,200 mark, has since reclaimed key resistance near $2,444—indicating growing strength among bulls. While buyers initially lost control during the wave of uncertainty, they are now regaining momentum as the entire market braces for the next decisive move. Despite rising optimism, the macroeconomic backdrop remains fragile. Recession fears in the U.S. continue to build as leading indicators flash warning signs, and tightening global financial conditions may pressure risk assets in the coming months. Yet in the crypto space, focus is shifting toward Ethereum’s performance as the likely spark for the long-awaited altseason. M-log1 shared his view, saying, “ETH is back in range. Nice fake out after all.” His technical analysis suggests that Ethereum has reentered its consolidation zone, a move that could signal strength if followed by continued upward momentum. “If we want alts to do well,” he added, “we want ETH to move towards the higher range here and break out as soon as Uncle Bitcoin makes a new ATH.” With Bitcoin hovering just 4% below its all-time high, Ethereum is now in a critical position. A sustained breakout from current levels could trigger renewed risk appetite across the altcoin market, creating the perfect setup for a rotation. For now, Ethereum is holding the line—but it must maintain this bullish structure and break above resistance to lead the next phase of growth. All eyes remain locked on ETH as it charts the course for what comes next.

The chart shows ETH has reclaimed the short-term descending trendline and is now testing major moving averages, with the 50-day SMA at $2,254, the 100-day at $2,639, and the 200-day just overhead at $2,780. This confluence of resistance above makes the $2,500–$2,800 zone a key battleground. Volume appears to be picking up alongside the price, signaling increased interest as ETH reclaims structure. This rally was partly fueled by the broader market response to geopolitical easing in the Middle East, but the technical setup now holds independent bullish potential. The recent price action forms what could be a classic “fakeout” and re-entry into range — a pattern that often precedes strong breakouts. To confirm a trend reversal, Ethereum needs to push and hold above the $2,650–$2,800 resistance band.

However, failure to build momentum here could see ETH range-bound or even revisit support near $2,200. For now, the trend is shifting in the bulls’ favor, with a breakout scenario back on the table.

With key legal, technical, and institutional shifts underway, investor attention is sharp — and not just on the major players. A rising newcomer, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is generating widespread attention as demand intensifies across the crypto space. Ripple (XRP): Legal Limbo, but Technical Strength Ripple is back in the spotlight following a June 26 ruling that rejected a proposed $50 million settlement with the SEC. Despite the setback, XRP has maintained a solid price level around $2.11, supported by its continued use in global payments and adoption of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service. Legal clarity may still be months away, but analysts believe XRP’s practical utility and recent integration of native USDC on the XRP Ledger keep the long-term outlook bullish. A favorable legal resolution could act as a strong catalyst for upward price movement in the coming weeks. Ethereum (ETH): Rebound Potential After June Sell-Off Ethereum took a hit in late June, falling from nearly $2,900 to the $2,200 range due to global geopolitical tensions. Despite this, the network’s recent Pectra upgrade introduced smart contract wallets, stablecoin gas payments, and improved staking mechanics — all of which strengthen its long-term foundation. With over 27% of ETH now staked and institutions showing growing interest in ETH-based ETFs, many analysts believe Ethereum could reclaim $2,800 in July. Continued adoption, especially in real-world asset tokenization, adds further upside. Solana (SOL): Institutional Demand Picks Up Solana has rebounded from recent lows, trading between $146 and $158. A major catalyst came on June 25, when Invesco filed for a Solana ETF — a strong signal of increasing institutional appetite. Combined with rising smart contract deployment and top-tier network uptime, Solana’s infrastructure continues to mature. Analysts forecast a potential move above $180 if momentum holds, and some see even higher targets in Q3. Solana’s speed, low fees, and expanding ecosystem make it a serious contender in the current market cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Growing Excitement Among Investors While major coins like XRP, Ethereum, and Solana gear up for a potential Q3 breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly turning heads across the crypto community. What started as an under-the-radar project is now gaining serious momentum, thanks to a passionate community, a fully audited foundation, and a clear focus on long-term growth. More and more traders are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next big thing — especially as early access windows start to close and its public launch draws closer. With real utility, transparent leadership, and growing attention across social platforms, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about crypto projects of the year . For many investors, the sense is clear: this could be a rare opportunity, and no one wants to be the one who looked back and missed it.

Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said in a statement today that this development is a positive sign, stating that it is in line with other spot crypto ETF approval processes. Balchunas said the most notable change is the addition of “in-kind” (direct asset swap) asset creation and redemption mechanisms to the applications. This feature allows investors to create ETF shares or receive redemptions directly in cryptocurrencies instead of cash. “It seems almost certain that in-kind transactions will now be accepted across all spot ETFs,” Balchunas said, recalling that this mechanism was not included in the initial applications filed in January.

As you may recall, Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF application was filed on March 3, 2025 and supported by Coinbase Custody. After the application was opened to the public comment period, it was postponed by the SEC for additional evaluation on June 12.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $1,004.54. In 2031, AAVE will range between $1,306.81 to $1,657.38. Aave is a leading decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $255.35 Market cap $3.87B Trading volume (24-h) $398.24M Circulating supply 15.16M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $250.59 24-hour high $264.84 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.84% 50-day SMA $255.19 14-Day RSI 50.81 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 11/30 (37%) 200-Day SMA $197.53 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE faces resistance near $266 on the daily. Key support lies at $250.32. Indicators warn of continued weakness unless support holds. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE stalls near mid-Bollinger band as momentum weakens As seen on the daily chart for June 26, AAVE is trading at $254.47 after a minor dip of 0.58%. The asset previously attempted a recovery rally off the lower Bollinger Band ($225), bouncing back toward the middle band at $266. AAVE stalls near mid-Bollinger band as momentum weakens However, today’s red candle reflects indecision and rejection near that resistance. The MACD remains bearish, suggesting downside pressure still dominates. Volume momentum, as shown by the OBV at 27.61M, is failing to pick up, confirming that bulls aren’t returning in force just yet. Price remains below the middle Bollinger band, capping upside potential in the short term. Aave 4-hour price chart: Short-term weakness lingers as sellers defend $258 zone The 4-hour chart shows AAVE stuck just below the 20-period SMA ($258.74), currently priced around $254.20. Attempts to break above $256.91 and $260.20 have been rejected, forming lower highs. Short-term weakness lingers as sellers defend $258 zone The MFI is at 38.53, suggesting mild selling pressure but not yet oversold territory. Balance of Power remains slightly positive at 0.32, indicating bulls are trying to hold ground, but without volume support. The $250.32 level acts as local support, and a break below this could accelerate downside. To regain bullish momentum, AAVE needs to reclaim $260.20 with conviction. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $220.99 BUY SMA 5 $231.56 BUY SMA 10 $247.42 BUY SMA 21 $264.20 SELL SMA 50 $255.19 SELL SMA 100 $209.02 BUY SMA 200 $197.53 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $256.24 SELL EMA 5 $243.86 BUY EMA 10 $217.48 BUY EMA 21 $195.72 BUY EMA 50 $197.46 BUY EMA 100 $213.60 BUY EMA 200 $210.24 BUY AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is likely to remain range-bound or slide further if it fails to reclaim the $258–$260 resistance zone soon. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. It’s AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, ByBit, OKX, Kraken, and KuCoin also support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? AAVE is down today mainly due to a broader crypto market pullback, profit-taking by large holders, and bearish technical signals. It recently declined from $264.48 to $251.7, and has lost about 2% in the last 24 hours. AAVE price chart | Coingecko Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve. If DeFi continues to grow and mature, Aave isn’t just likely to stick around; it’ll probably be one of the key players shaping the future.

COIN hit $382 Thursday before paring some of the gains and closed higher by 5.5%. The stock's more than doubled since plunging alongside April's tariff-induced market panic. Coinbase’s 2021 listing marked a watershed moment for the digital asset industry, but also signaled a peak in crypto. The stock rose as high as $382 before sliding over 90% amid the prolonged 2022 bear market. Now, investors are increasingly positioning Coinbase as a long-term winner in the next phase of crypto growth, defined by rising stablecoin adoption, institutional participation and increasing U.S. regulatory clarity. The company recently launched Coinbase Payments, a new service aimed at expanding the exchange’s footprint in global commerce. Built on Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, the platform allows merchants to accept 24/7 USDC stablecoin payments without needing blockchain expertise. It already integrates with platforms like Shopify, the company said. Coinbase also benefits from the rapidly-growing stablecoin sector, having a revenue-sharing agreement with Circle (CRCL), issuer of the USDC stablecoin, giving it a cut of the yield generated by reserve assets. The broader backdrop is supportive as well. The S&P500 and Nasdaq equity indexes notch record highs, and crypto-related businesses such as Robinhood (HOOD) has also enjoyed renewed investor interest. Some analysts expect further upside. Benchmark raised its price target to $421 on COIN, saying the company is well positioned to capitalize on potential U.S. legislation, including bills to regulate stablecoins and digital asset market structure. Meanwhile, Bernstein set a more ambitious $510 target, calling Coinbase crypto’s emerging ""universal bank,"" bridging retail users, institutional investors and on-chain infrastructure at global scale.

This regulatory victory is a milestone for Kraken's expansion into Europe, making it a top candidate in the race to be prepared for the EU's far-reaching new crypto rules before full implementation in December 2024. Why the Irish MiCA License Matters With its attainment of its MiCA license in Ireland, Kraken is now able to offer regulated spot trading, custody, derivatives, and payment services to tens of millions of retail and institutional clients across the EU. The license follows years of preparation and demonstrates Kraken's commitment to becoming part of the ”gold standard” of European regulation. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi characterized the license as ”a strong signal of Kraken's seriousness about growing the crypto ecosystem through responsible innovation.” Kraken praised the Irish Central Bank as professional in their work, citing the approval as an example of public-private collaboration to build a secure financial future for Europe. Capital Requirements and Compliance Checklist MiCA imposes stringent requirements for EU exchanges trading. Kraken is required to: Have sufficient regulatory capital and possess sufficient liquidity buffers. Segregate customer funds from firm assets, to safeguard customers. Possess good governance, risk management, and measures against market abuse. Provide transparent, timely disclosures on fees, asset risks, and conflict of interest. Subjected to regular audits and provide detailed reports to regulators. Kraken's Irish MiCA license covers all seven crypto activities that are regulated, including custody, trading, portfolio management, and payments. The exchange formerly operated with Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registrations in various EU countries, but the Irish MiCA license consolidates compliance into one framework and streamlines operations and enhances consumer confidence. Who's Next? The Race for MiCA Passporting Kraken's rivals are racing to catch up. Coinbase has just gained MiCA approval in Luxembourg, Bybit in Austria, and Bitpanda in Germany, Malta, and Austria. Crypto.com and OKX are licensed by Malta, and Bitstamp is approved in Luxembourg. Binance and Gemini are still waiting. Although a single national regulator grants the MiCA license, it allows for ”passporting” across the whole EEA states—setting data leaders like Kraken and Coinbase up for EU-wide expansion. MiCA's Phased Deadlines MiCA takes effect in a phased manner: June 2024: Stablecoin regulations became effective, full reserves and disclosure for issuers. December 2024: All crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) must comply with MiCA's key exchange, custody, and consumer protection rules. July 2026: ”Grandfathering” ends—any firm without a MiCA license must shut up shop in the EU. Exchanges will need to be ready for ongoing audits, further AML/KYC checks, and regular reporting to regulators. The ESMA will maintain a master list of recognized CASPs, and member state authorities will be able to subject further anti-money laundering screening even in the harmonized regime. What This Means for Investors and the Market Kraken's MiCA license is more than a regulatory box-ticking exercise—it's a source of competitive strength. With euro-denominated trading now at 17.5% of its global volume, Kraken is set to capture growing share of Europe's crypto market. Early MiCA-compliant exchanges are anticipated to capture additional institutional flows as regulatory clarity and consumer protections boost confidence and take-up. With the deadline in December, non-compliant platforms risk delistings, service outage, or even bans. Bottom Line Kraken's Irish MiCA licence puts it at the head of the European crypto game, with a passport to serve millions of clients inside the EU.

Now, with AI demand surging and Bitcoin mining margins tightening, CoreWeave has circled back and is reportedly in new talks to acquire Core Scientific. On June 26, the Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave, the AI cloud infrastructure provider backed by Nvidia and powering clients like OpenAI and Microsoft, has reopened negotiations to acquire Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. The move comes nearly a year after Core Scientific’s board dismissed CoreWeave’s initial $5.75-per-share offer ($1 billion total) as “significantly undervaluing” the company. This time, the terms remain undisclosed, but the market’s reaction was immediate: Core Scientific’s stock surged 28%, pushing its valuation close to $4 billion. People familiar with the matter say the latest negotiations follow a string of multi-year infrastructure deals between the two companies, including a major contract for 200 megawatts of power to support CoreWeave’s high-performance computing services. You might also like: U.S Senate eyes fall finish for crypto rules as House keeps cards close Can the second bid stick this time? CoreWeave’s renewed pursuit of Core Scientific appears to be about securing the infrastructure needed to win the AI race. The AI cloud provider, fresh off a $1.5 billion IPO and partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, is locked in a battle for computing power with rivals like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Unlike those giants, CoreWeave doesn’t own massive data center networks. That’s where Core Scientific comes in. Core Scientific controls something even more valuable than raw computing power: energy infrastructure. The Bitcoin miner’s facilities, mostly located near cheap, abundant power sources, are already wired for high-density computing, making them ideal for AI workloads. The existing 200-megawatt deal between the two companies, signed last year, was just the start. Owning Core Scientific outright would give CoreWeave direct control over power contracts, bypassing the scramble for data center capacity that’s bottlenecking AI expansion. What’s in for Core Scientific? For Core Scientific, the timing couldn’t be more strategic. The company emerged from bankruptcy in early 2024 with a leaner operation and a stronger balance sheet, but Bitcoin’s halving in April slashed mining rewards, squeezing margins across the industry. While some miners are selling off assets or pivoting to AI hosting piecemeal, Core Scientific’s management has held out for a bigger play. Their first-quarter profit of $580 million, largely driven by Bitcoin’s price rebound and efficient operations, proved they’re no longer a distressed asset. Now, they’re a strategic one. Whether the deal closes or collapses, the return of CoreWeave to the negotiating table underscores a broader realignment in digital infrastructure. The boundary between Bitcoin mining and AI compute is thinning, not because the technologies are converging, but because they share the same scarce foundation: power. In that light, Core Scientific’s real value may not be its mining rigs, but the grid connections beneath them.

Dubbed “US Perpetual-Like Futures,” the contracts aim to provide a local, U.S.-regulated alternative to perpetual futures products commonly used on offshore exchanges. “We are excited to offer these products on Coinbase Futures, designed to mirror how global perpetual futures work, yet remain fully compliant with U.S. regulations. Internationally, perpetual futures represent 90% of cryptocurrency trading volume by some reports,” Coinbase said in a statement. The first phase of the offering includes perpetual-style futures contracts for nano Bitcoin (0.01 BTC) and nano Ether (0.10 ETH). These contracts will have a five-year maturity, will be tradable 24/7, and will include a funding rate mechanism to ensure they remain in line with spot market prices. Funding will be processed hourly and collected during designated cash adjustment periods twice a day.

The new products aim to eliminate those risks by offering the ability to trade in a regulated environment within the U.S. Coinbase also noted that these futures will provide “regulated access to the crypto market with flexible position sizes and high capital efficiency.” More information on access to the products is expected to be shared ahead of launch. “We are very proud to bring perpetual-style futures to the U.S. market. This move represents the beginning of a new era of access, efficiency and innovation in the U.S. market,” the company said. *This is not investment advice.

Ripple case is reigniting conversations around a looming XRP supply shock. Earlier today, Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request from the SEC and Ripple seeking to dissolve a prior court injunction and reduce Ripple’s financial penalty. According to Jake Claver, this decision reinforces the setup for a massive XRP supply squeeze, one that could have dramatic implications for the asset’s price and availability. Judge Torres Denies Ripple-SEC Motion In the court order filed on June 26, Judge Torres rejected the motion for an indicative ruling, which would have dissolved a permanent injunction preventing Ripple from violating securities laws and reduced the fine imposed on the company. The Set UP for the MASSIVE Supply Shock continues.. https://t.co/H3L0zjj4cD — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) June 26, 2025 The motion, tied to ongoing settlement negotiations, was central to Ripple’s efforts to fully resolve the case and move forward without ongoing legal uncertainty. With the court’s denial, the prior restrictions remain in place. Ripple is still bound by the terms of the injunction, including limitations on the use of XRP held in escrow. This outcome delays the company’s ability to access or distribute billions of XRP that have been locked for years, significantly limiting the token’s circulating supply. Jake Claver: Legal Deadlock Tightens Supply Outlook Reacting to the development, Jake Claver, founder of QFOP and a respected voice in the digital asset space, posted on X: “The setup for the MASSIVE supply shock continues.” Claver has consistently highlighted how Ripple’s legal constraints are reducing available market liquidity for XRP. Claver’s insight builds on the idea that with Ripple unable to freely unlock or distribute escrowed XRP, and with decreasing exchange balances indicating steady accumulation, a major supply crunch is forming beneath the surface. This shock would be amplified if, or when, Ripple gains legal clearance to resume its full operations, potentially unleashing demand from institutional partners and cross-border payment corridors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Exchange Balances Continue to Shrink Recent data further supports Claver’s thesis. On-chain analytics have shown that XRP balances on major centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have steadily declined over the past 12 months. Long-term holders and private wallets appear to be absorbing available liquidity, while Ripple’s legal constraints mean no fresh supply is entering the market from escrow. In the past, Ripple would unlock up to 1 billion XRP each month , re-locking what wasn’t used. However, due to the ongoing lawsuit and injunctions, this practice has been largely frozen, further compounding the scarcity. What Happens Next? Judge Torres’ ruling doesn’t end the case but halts a key procedural step toward settlement. Until a new agreement is accepted by the court, Ripple remains restricted, and XRP’s available supply will continue to tighten. For XRP supporters and market analysts like Claver, this legal bottleneck is more than a procedural delay, it’s a setup for a dramatic supply and demand imbalance. If Ripple is ultimately cleared to resume its full market operations, the sudden influx in demand, especially from Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners , could collide with severely limited supply, triggering what Claver and others describe as a “massive supply shock.” Until then, the legal stalemate only sharpens the edge of anticipation.

33767162,[object Object],1750971613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin’s Chances Of An Upward Trend Continuation Increases With This Bullish Move,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoins-uptrend-chances-grows/,"With the growing bullish market sentiment, Dogecoin has flipped positive as the popular dog-themed meme coin slowly builds on its newfound upward momentum. Several technical signals are starting to unfold on the DOGE’s chart, hinting at a possible continuation of the renewed upside movements. Bullish Move Puts Dogecoin On Track For A Rally Following a period of heightened bearish performance, Dogecoin has ventured into a bullish state as it targets the next key resistance located at the $0.17 level. Given that the broader crypto market maintains its current optimistic condition, DOGE could retest this key level in the upcoming days. Delving into Dogecoin’s current price action, Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned technical expert and investor, has drawn attention to a signal that suggests that the meme coin is set for a bullish phase. Dogecoin is showing early indications of a possible recovery, and a recent positive move that reinforces the argument for an upcoming uptrend . In the 1-hour time frame chart, Trader Tardigrade revealed that DOGE has formed a hidden Bullish Divergence. This critical move is observed on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart, a key momentum indicator. With this key technical signal emerging, Trader Tardigrade believes that the development could indicate a greater chance of an impending upward trend continuation . A hidden bullish divergence is an indication of a continued uptrend despite a brief price decline. Specifically, this move occurs when a momentum indicator, such as the RSI or MACD, produces a lower low as seen on the DOGE’s chart. Since the divergence often precedes upward movements and price spikes, Trader Tardigrade’s forecast of a continued rally is likely to materialize in the short term. Past Trend Hints At A Massive Upsurge For DOGE Even though Dogecoin has fallen sharply from its yearly high of $0.48, the meme coin is still trending in an ascending trend line. Trader Tardigrade has highlighted a massive ascending support trend line in the 2-week time frame chart. The 2-weekly chart shows that this key rising trend line has been forming for nearly two years, particularly from September 2023 till the current date. Such a trend line reflects Dogecoin’s robust resilience over the years despite several notable pullbacks. Looking at the chart, this move to retest the ascending trend line appears to be a bullish one . In 2023, DOGE witnessed a rally after retesting this trend line. A similar result was also observed in September 2024, which ultimately led to the current yearly high of $0.48. Considering past scenarios as the meme coin retests the trend line once again this year, Trader Tardigrade is confident that a notable rally could be on the horizon. With each scenario resulting in a bigger upward move than the last, DOGE’s price is likely to experience a sharp spike beyond its yearly high and potentially revisit its present all-time high of $0.73.",Dogecoin|Ascending Trendline|Bullish Divergence|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|MACD|Moving Average Convergence Divegence|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-26 21:00:13

XRP and Dogecoin Holders Focus on Promising New Presale,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/which-cryptocurrency-is-set-to-rise-next-xrp-and-dogecoin-holders-focus-on-promising-new-presale/,"As the broader crypto market enters a period of uncertainty, seasoned investors are asking one urgent question: what’s the next altcoin set to break out? XRP and Dogecoin, two of the most recognized names in the industry, are both seeing mixed signals—and it’s leading many holders to explore a new contender that’s rapidly gaining traction. That token is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap memecoin presale that’s drawing attention across social media, Telegram, and early-stage investment circles for one simple reason: the potential for 50x or greater returns before mainstream listings. XRP and Dogecoin Investors Grow Restless as Gains Slow Both XRP and Dogecoin are facing renewed pressure, and it’s testing the patience of long-time holders. For XRP, hopes of finally settling its legal fight with the U.S. SEC took a hit this week when a judge rejected the latest attempt by both parties to resolve the case. The token has hovered between $2.10 and $2.18, but momentum has slowed, and some analysts warn that price dips could follow if investor confidence weakens further. Even with Ripple pushing ahead—securing regulatory progress and expanding through acquisitions—XRP hasn’t responded with the kind of price surges some expected. The coin is holding up, but it’s not racing ahead. And in a market where traders are increasingly looking for fast moves and bold stories, that’s starting to matter. Dogecoin has seen a bit of life recently, bouncing 17% after dipping below key levels. Interest in Elon Musk’s X platform and new use cases on Coinbase’s network have added excitement. But DOGE is still driven largely by sentiment and online chatter. If that energy fades, so could the price action. Analysts say it needs a clear breakout soon, or it risks drifting sideways for the rest of the quarter. With both tokens showing signs of stalling, many investors are now eyeing newer plays that offer something XRP and Dogecoin can’t: the thrill of getting in early on a breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Altcoin Catching Fire in Q3 While XRP and DOGE continue to face resistance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is blazing through presale milestones. Its early-stage offering has already raised over $10 million, with each phase closing faster than the last. But it’s not just about the numbers—it’s the momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE has attracted thousands of investors in just weeks, many of them DOGE and XRP holders looking to position early in what analysts now consider one of 2025’s most promising low-cap plays. There’s no mistaking the shift in investor psychology. In a market where large-cap coins are stalling, traders want tokens with asymmetric upside—projects that could deliver 30x, 50x, or even 80x returns with the right mix of narrative and demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that bill perfectly. With a fixed token supply of 170 billion, a price far below one cent, and no staking or play-to-earn distractions, it’s built to generate FOMO without overpromising. And that’s exactly what smart money is looking for right now: simplicity, scarcity, and social virality. It’s a familiar pattern—one that XRP saw in its early days, and DOGE rode to mainstream adoption. The difference? MAGACOIN FINANCE is just getting started. As other altcoins consolidate and hedge funds crowd into overbought blue chips, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the rare retail-first opportunity that hasn’t yet gone parabolic. But it could—especially as new listings approach and the presale supply dries up. For XRP and DOGE holders tired of waiting for momentum to return, the writing is on the wall. The biggest gains this cycle may not come from the names everyone already knows. They may come from the altcoins that still feel risky—still feel early. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is exactly that.

The news caused a temporary halt in trading, but the rally picked up again once the pause ended. This was Core Scientific’s second-biggest trading day since its return to the Nasdaq in January 2024, after it came out of bankruptcy. The sharpest jump the company ever saw was last June, when it climbed 40% in a single session after announcing a major AI expansion deal with CoreWeave. The new acquisition talks are tied to that same relationship, which has turned into a billion-dollar partnership over time. The companies signed a series of 12-year contracts last summer worth $10.2 billion, with Core Scientific committed to delivering 590 megawatts of AI-ready infrastructure by early 2026. CoreWeave’s 2024 bid rejected, deal now being revisited The Journal report said the buyout deal could be finalized in the next few weeks, unless something derails it. If agreed, the acquisition would deepen CoreWeave’s involvement with Core Scientific beyond just contracts. It also highlights how the AI boom has changed the game for miners. Core Scientific was once just a bitcoin miner struggling to stay afloat. Now it’s sitting on close to $5 billion in market value, five times higher than when CoreWeave first tried to buy it. In 2024, CoreWeave made a $5.75 per share offer for Core Scientific . At the time, that offer put the company’s value at just over $1 billion. But Core Scientific turned it down, saying the bid undervalued the business and that it preferred to focus on its existing deals. With its stock now trading well above that old offer, the tables have turned. The partnership between the two has grown stronger since that rejected proposal. They’ve been working together for years, but the 12-year contract signed in June 2023 formalized things. Core Scientific agreed to supply hundreds of megawatts of hosting power to support CoreWeave’s compute-heavy AI infrastructure. Bitcoin miners rush into AI as space and power run low Core Scientific’s shift into AI isn’t unique. Many crypto mining companies are now trying to retool their data centers to meet demand from AI firms. But analysts have warned that AI infrastructure often needs full-scale builds, not just old mining rigs converted into something else. It’s not always a simple flip. Still, companies like Core Scientific are trying to cash in while demand is high. With limited data-center space and rising competition for electricity, timing is everything. Being able to deliver infrastructure quickly has become more important than mining blocks. Even so, CoreWeave’s share price fell by about 1% on Thursday. That’s not a massive drop, but it’s a sign the market isn’t reacting the same way on both sides of this possible deal. Core Scientific, meanwhile, has made its turnaround story all about AI. Since leaving bankruptcy in early 2024, it’s shifted large portions of its operations to hosting high-performance workloads instead of mining bitcoin full-time. That move has put it ahead of many competitors who are still trying to adapt. The company is now one of several crypto miners competing for AI clients, looking to make use of every available megawatt of energy and every square foot of hosting space. With the AI race heating up and real estate for GPUs running thin, whoever controls the infrastructure gets the money. And Core Scientific, thanks to its 12-year agreement with CoreWeave , has already locked in its seat at the table.

Elon Musk’s 60M-View PEPE Meme Ignites Army’s Reversal Hope Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk, rumored to hold PEPE, shared a PEPE-themed meme that has accumulated over 60 million views. pic.twitter.com/QyKLzXez3L — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2025 This development has boosted confidence among the PEPE Army, who reference a similar Musk profile picture change in December that preceded PEPE’s massive rally to a market cap of over $10 billion. Contributing to the momentum, The New York Post published a purchasing guide for PEPE , while highlighting its potential as a long-term investment opportunity. A Bitcoin investor and OKX exchange key opinion leader also observed that PEPE is displaying chart patterns similar to those from two years ago, setting a bold target of an 800% move from current price levels. Trading volume also appears to be recovering for PEPE, with CoinGlass data showing over $2.4 billion worth of transactions in the last 24 hours, representing a 5.4% increase during that period. The funding rate in derivatives markets has remained positive for three consecutive days, suggesting traders may be positioning for long positions on PEPE in the near term. ​​Is PEPE’s RSI at 30.85 Signaling the Ultimate Oversold Bounce? The PEPE/USDT daily chart shows the token currently trading around $0.00000929, down 5.8% for the day. Price action is consolidating just above a crucial accumulation zone between $0.00000830 and $0.00000872, which has been identified as a support level during previous consolidation periods. This range has historically generated bullish reversals, as demonstrated in mid-March and early May. The RSI reads 30.85, nearing oversold territory, which suggests that bearish momentum may be diminishing and a potential bounce could be developing. This outlook is backed by the visible bullish projection trajectory that curves upward from current levels, targeting a potential retest of the $0.00002000 region if support is maintained. Despite earlier bearish signals from the RSI indicator, if buyers regain control from this demand zone, PEPE could initiate a recovery toward mid-range resistance near $0.00002000, with additional upside potential toward the $0.00002836 high. However, a breakdown below $0.00000830 would negate this scenario and expose lower support around $0.00000525.

Three blockchains exemplify this trend. For example, Qubetics prepares for its debut on a top-ten centralized exchange on June 30th, backed by solid presale metrics and a high-end solution to simplify cross-border transactions. At the same time, SUI sustains over $1 billion in daily trading volume. Cardano rethinks treasury strategy by reallocating assets. Each move offers unique insights into which are the best cryptos to buy today. This article addresses these details in-depth for the benefit of crypto backers looking to make an informed decision. Qubetics: A Futuristic Solution for Cross-Border Payments Traditional international payments are riddled with delays, conversion fees, and unclear settlement timelines. Qubetics, using its native $TICS token, delivers a framework designed to change that. With its near-instant global transfer capability, Qubetics aims to streamline operations for banks and payment providers. By automating compliance protocols and using smart contract routing, it shortens settlement windows while enhancing transparency. Its ability to align with international regulatory standards further empowers financial institutions to integrate without added risk. The result is faster, more predictable payments and an edge in a market where agility matters. CEX Listing Signals Institutional Readiness The protocol is now preparing to debut on one of the top ten centralized exchanges. This major milestone (taking place on June 30th at 11 am UTC) strengthens liquidity and opens access to global trading. It also marks a shift from a crypto entrant to institutional-grade infrastructure, allowing broader enterprise use and adoption. The listing is expected to expand Qubetics’ user base and provide entry points for firms seeking reliable, fast-moving blockchain tools. Qubetics Presale Performance Reflects Surging Demand Currently in Stage 37, Qubetics has raised over $18.1 million at a token price of $0.3370. More than 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold to over 28,300 holders. The surge in interest reflects growing confidence in Qubetics’ utility-driven roadmap. With fewer than 9 million tokens remaining at the fixed crypto presale price and the sale ending at 8 am UTC on June 30th, the chance to enter is rapidly narrowing. Forecasts and Upside Potential With the supply nearly depleted and a projected listing price of $0.40, market participants anticipate a sharp initial increase. A $4,000 acquisition at the current price of $0.3370 yields roughly 11,867 $TICS tokens. If the price rises to $0.40 at listing, that stake could reach $4,746.80. Should it climb to $1 post-presale, the return becomes $11,867. At $5, that figure grows to $59,335. A move to $10 pushes it to $118,670. If it ever reaches $15 following mainnet launch and deeper institutional integration, the value will reach $178,005. Analyst projections forecast potential ROI ranging from 196% to over 4,300%, depending on performance milestones. SUI Shows Strength Amidst Volume Surge and Market Stability While many layer-1s face downward momentum, SUI has demonstrated resilience in its market metrics. With a live market cap of over $9.25 billion and a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1 billion, SUI is one of the few chains gaining traction in the short term. Its circulating supply currently sits at approximately 3.39 billion coins out of a 10 billion cap. Despite a slight dip of 2.66% in the last 24 hours, SUI’s trading behavior suggests continued interest. Its volume-to-market-cap ratio reflects active liquidity and consistent transaction flow. The recent uptick in volume could be linked to ecosystem growth or protocol-level innovations. While SUI hasn’t released new structural updates, its high trading levels and ranking at #13 signal confidence in its scalability and user experience. It’s one of the best cryptos to buy today for those tracking network activity and short-term performance. Cardano Eyes Structural Realignment as Treasury Discussion Unfolds Cardano recently experienced a 3.5% price slide to $0.5669, slipping below key moving averages. The price action resulted in heightened speculation around the network’s future strategy. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 35 and an ADX reading of 26 show that the network is experiencing high downward momentum. Still, its long-term outlook remains centered on foundational upgrades. What grabbed attention was a proposal during a livestream by its founder to shift nearly $100 million worth of ADA from the Cardano Treasury into a basket of stablecoins, Bitcoin, and synthetic assets. This bold move aims to diversify liquidity reserves, stabilizing on-chain economic systems and potentially accelerating DeFi adoption. The proposed strategy is not without debate, but if implemented, it may mark a shift toward financial diversification that encourages decentralized growth. While ADA faces short-term resistance levels near $0.5900 and long-term challenges at $0.6400, this treasury move may reshape its risk model and unlock new market efficiencies. Conclusion: Best Cryptos to Buy Today Qubetics’ push into CEX territory and its cross-border capabilities mark it as a major project in the infrastructure industry. With fewer than 9 million tokens left at $0.3370 and a projected launch price of $0.40, the final presale phase offers a time-sensitive opportunity to access the network before June 30th. SUI’s trading strength showcases its resilience and network activity, holding strong despite market dips. Its consistent liquidity and rising market cap rank it among the best cryptos to buy today for those focusing on transactional utility. Meanwhile, Cardano’s proposed treasury shift may unlock strategic flexibility across its ecosystem. While all three look promising, due diligence is still essential to limit crypto-inherent risks.

This follows the recent decline in ETH value, with the token falling more than 6% in the last 30 days amidst market uncertainties. On-chain analyst Ember CN shared the development on X, noting that the company bought another 5,989 ETH worth $14.47 million on June 26. With its latest acquisition, Sharpink has 194,000 ETH, worth around $507 million. The company purchased its ETH at an average price of $2,611, slightly below the current price of $2,474. However, the sizable accumulation of ETH by the company is impressive given that it has been less than a month since it transitioned to an Ethereum treasury company after closing a $425 million funding round led by Consensys. However, the Sharplink is far from done with its accumulation, given that a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month shows that it has plans for another $1 billion raise, with all the funds expected to go towards accumulating ETH. Since its first purchase using funds raised from the funding round, Sharplink has been using proceeds from the sales of its shares through its at-market offering to buy more ETH. The company has also been staking all its ETH holdings to earn more Ether. Corporations showing interest in altcoin treasuries Meanwhile, the continued accumulation by Sharplink is likely part of its goal to become the biggest corporate holder of ETH in its reserves. Given its current stash, it appears to have already achieved that, especially since only a few companies have an Ethereum treasury. While it might be the one with the biggest ETH treasury, Sharplink was not the first public company to consider ETH as a treasury asset, with BioNexus Gene actually releasing an Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper back in March. Another public company with a known ETH treasury is Bit Digital. The Bitcoin miner recently transitioned to focusing solely on ETH staking and treasury, stating that it holds over 24,000 ETH and 417.6 BTC as of March 31, 2025. However, it plans to convert its Bitcoin holdings to ETH while also planning to sell its Bitcoin mining infrastructure and divert the proceeds to ETH. Unsurprisingly, the move caused its stock to fall. Nevertheless, it highlights how several companies are now hopping on the altcoin treasury trends instead of choosing BTC. For instance, companies such as Upexi, Sol Strategies, DeFi Development Corp, and MemeStrategy have all opted for a corporate Solana treasury to acquire and stake SOL. Other firms have also picked altcoins, such as HYPE, XRP, and BNB, as treasury assets. A Chinese chip maker, Nano Labs, recently released a plan to buy $1 billion BNB, while companies like ViVoPower and Webus plan to buy XRP and Lion Group Holdings is targeting a HYPE treasury. Despite this diversification among public companies, Bitcoin treasuries remain the biggest trend, with more companies establishing corporate Bitcoin strategies. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s firm, ProCap BTC, recently announced a plan to go public as a Bitcoin treasury company through a special purpose acquisition deal. The company has been busy buying BTC in anticipation of the move. However, concerns about establishing crypto treasuries continue to grow, especially as the adoption keeps increasing. Some experts believe this poses a major risk, especially as many firms now leverage debt to acquire crypto assets. Sharplink stock continues to perform well Meanwhile, the unrealised loss on Sharplink’s ETH treasury has no major impact on its stock performance. According to Yahoo Finance data, Sharelink SBET closed on June 25 with a 6.42% gain and has already seen an extra 4.57% increase in pre-market. It is now trading at $10.28, with a 52.98% gain over the past month. It is also up 33.85% year to date, showing that the optimism around ETH recovery is spreading to SBET. With market observers bullish on Ether rebound, some believe Sharplink is getting in early.

That would mean it would be completed later than President Donald Trump's targeted August but earlier than the year-end estimate of Senator Cynthia Lummis, who worked on the legislation. Scott told White House cryptocurrency advisor Bo Hines that this new timetable is realistic and that the stablecoin law called the GENIUS Act, which passed the Senate last week, should be quickly approved by the House of Representatives. Related News: Ripple (XRP) Announces Critical Partnership Agreement with Another Major Platform: Could Have Significant Potential “It is realistic to expect the market structure adjustments to be completed by the end of September. We are on track,” Scott said. But the House has not been as clear-cut. The House has already made progress on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, a market structure bill, but has yet to take a stance on the stablecoin regulation GENIUS Act. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill said this week that there are still some remaining differences between the Senate bill and the House’s own bill, suggesting that a short-term compromise could be difficult. As you may recall, Senator Lummis had stated in his speech just one day earlier that he predicted that all crypto regulations would be completed by the end of the year, while President Trump wanted this process to be completed by the August recess of Congress. *This is not investment advice.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.87 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $8. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.5262 Market cap $551.9M Trading volume (24-hour) $12.91M Circulating supply 1.04B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.5387 24-hour low $0.5173 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.06% 50-day SMA $0.6040 14-Day RSI 41.82 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6705 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: 1-day price chart shows consolidation around $0.527, with low volatility and a weakening downtrend. XTZ see a short-term bounce from $0.5166, but resistance at $0.5303 caps momentum. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ steadies at $0.527 with weak momentum and low volatility Per the daily chart on June 26, XTZ is trading at $0.5270, virtually unchanged on the day (–0.13%). The price is hovering just above the lower Bollinger band at $0.4866 and far below the upper band at $0.6198, signaling reduced volatility and potential consolidation. XTZ steadies at $0.527 with weak momentum and low volatility The price briefly rallied off a local bottom but has since stalled just under the mid-band resistance around $0.5532. The MACD remains negative, and the histogram is shrinking toward equilibrium, suggesting a fading downtrend but no strong reversal. OBV is holding at 869.94M, recovering slightly but not decisively climbing, meaning volume does not strongly support upward movement. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ bounces off $0.5166 support On the 4-hour chart, XTZ has shown a modest rebound to $0.5281, after dipping to an intraday low of $0.5166. This level acted as solid support, with price recovering just above the 9-period SMA at $0.5282. XTZ bounces off $0.5166 support Still, XTZ is facing a resistance zone at $0.5303–$0.5404, where it was previously rejected. The Balance of Power indicator is currently at 0.61, hinting at a slight advantage for buyers in the short term, though not overwhelmingly strong. Price is stuck in a narrow range between $0.5166 and $0.5404, and the failure to break out convincingly keeps the bias neutral-to-bearish unless volume confirms upward strength.

XTZ is currently in a sideways phase with mild upward potential, but unless it breaks above $0.5404 with volume, it’s likely to stay range-bound between $0.5166 and $0.5400 in the short term. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Rejkt.xyz launches as a curated discovery companion for Tezos NFT art .

XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ is currently trading between $0.5173 and $0.5387 in June.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XTZ|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-26 21:30:00

Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities It started near $754 when Michael Bloomberg left office in December 2013. Now, as the city prepares for its next election, it’s trading above $107,000. These numbers show a rise of about 14,590% in just over a decade. Mayoral Timeline Marks Bitcoin Growth Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014. At first, Bitcoin barely budged. But by December 2021, it hit roughly $47,000. That climb happened while de Blasio’s two terms played out on City Hall’s stage. The crypto market had its ups and downs, yet the overall trend pointed skyward under his watch. Worth noting that in the time it took New York to go from Bloomberg to Mamdani, Bitcoin soared from $754 to $106,000+ today. You may not see nor believe it right away, but this is actually not a coincidence. Separate money from state. — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Surge Through Political Change When Eric Adams stepped in as mayor in January 2022, he made headlines by taking his first paychecks in Bitcoin. The move sent a clear message that New York was open to crypto. The market then endured a tough 2022 bear phase. Still, Bitcoin bounced back strong in 2023 and kept going. This month, it’s up about 3% and sits at $107,567, according to figures by Coingecko. Separate Money From State Park used the mayor count as a storytelling tool. He’s calling for a break between money and government. His view: people should choose how they handle their own cash. Political shifts come and go, but Bitcoin keeps growing on its own terms. That steady rise speaks to the idea of financial freedom outside state control. New Leadership And Future Trends Zohran Mamdani has surged ahead in the Democratic primary after Adams declared an Independent bid. Since Democrats usually win in New York, many see Mamdani as the likely next mayor. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Park even joked that Bitcoin’s journey has moved “from Bloomberg to Mamdani.” That line underlines how the asset climbed, even as the city’s politics reshuffled itself. It’s easy to draw lines between mayoral posters and price charts. But Bitcoin’s real drivers go beyond City Hall. Global demand, big investors, shifts in mining, and moves by the Federal Reserve have all shaped its path. New York’s mayors provide handy markers on the timeline, not the engine of growth. On Crypto & Politics As New York eyes November 2025, Bitcoin stands as proof that financial tools can live beyond politics. The question now isn’t whether the next mayor will back crypto. It’s how far Bitcoin will go when its story isn’t tied to any single office.

According to reports , this investment reflects a commitment to promoting the use of blockchain technology in finance and enhancing global capital allocation. Aqua 1 Token Purchase to Boost DeFi Adoption Notably, Aqua 1’s $100 million investment in WLFI shows strong support for WLFI’s goal to change the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space. Together, WLFI and Aqua 1 plan to develop a new blockchain financial system and drive innovation in key areas, including blockchain development, Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, and stablecoin integration. This commitment is not just about money; it drives change. Aqua 1 aims to collaborate with WLFI to establish new standards for transparency, security, and capital flow. Their shared vision aims to connect old financial systems with new blockchain technology, providing effective and flexible solutions for businesses and individual users. Furthermore, Aqua 1’s global investment and compliance teams will assist WLFI in expanding into South America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. This will speed up the development of the digital asset ecosystem. WLFI also plans to support the launch of Aqua 1’s Aqua Fund, an investment fund based in the UAE. World Liberty Financial Navigates the Digital Finance World Since launching in September 2024, WLFI has conducted two successful public sales, raising $550 million across 85,000 registered token holders. With the Donald Trump family’s name reportedly behind it , the project is drawing both investor attention and political intrigue as it navigates the volatile world of digital finance. Meanwhile, WLFI has gained support among token holders as it geared to reward early backers with a test distribution of its freshly launched USD-pegged stablecoin, USD1. Whether USD1 takes off as a viable competitor remains to be seen. WLFI Gains Ground Despite Ongoing Criticism Despite the continued criticism , WLFI recently secured a significant boost. The new stablecoin bill, which passed the Committee stage, could benefit the company. It is worth noting that WLFI is the company that created the USD1 stablecoin used in a $2 billion deal with Binance . The new law may cover the stablecoin, further protecting it. In a bold move, President Trump urged lawmakers to fast-track the GENIUS Act steblcoin bill without any additional changes. The president is urging the bill, which recently cleared the final Senate vote , to be quickly approved and sent to his desk.

The charts suggest both could move higher if key levels hold. But in a market that punishes hesitation and rewards early conviction, many investors are looking past legacy names and placing bold bets elsewhere. One new token is attracting that kind of speculative confidence: MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap presale project that’s quietly positioning itself as the most aggressive breakout candidate of 2025. ADA Eyes Recovery, but Questions Linger Cardano has traded sluggishly below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Short-term support holds around $0.60, and a push above $0.72 could open the door to $0.76 in July. But even with upcoming scalability upgrades and strong DeFi infrastructure in place, ADA’s momentum feels stalled. Analysts see a year-end target as low as $2.05—or as high as $5.33 in extreme bull scenarios—but few are making that bullish call with conviction. Cardano is still seen as technically sound. Yet compared to the rapid growth cycles of tokens like Solana, ADA risks being overshadowed by faster-moving competitors. XRP’s Next Chapter Depends on Clarity XRP’s recent volatility hasn’t scared away traders, but its price action remains confined between $1.90 and $2.18. A breakout to $2.50 is in sight, and with ETF talk swirling and Ripple’s legal team gaining ground, there’s room for optimism. Yet that optimism is cautious. Some models stretch to $5.05 by year-end, but the path there depends on sustained buying pressure and a clean regulatory finish. The problem? XRP has been stuck in legal purgatory for years. While progress has been made, many long-term holders are still waiting for the explosive upside they were promised in 2018. The market isn’t always patient. Meanwhile, a New Player Enters with Nothing to Lose MAGACOIN FINANCE is not concerned with reclaiming old highs or navigating SEC lawsuits. It’s focused on capturing attention—and capital—during a cycle that favors speed, meme culture, and community-first narratives. The presale has moved quickly, and what started as a niche political-finance fusion project is now drawing attention from crypto influencers, early-stage investors, and speculative retail buyers. The fixed 170 billion token supply adds a layer of scarcity to an already FOMO-driven narrative. With the altcoin market heating up, MAGACOIN FINANCE has slotted into a sweet spot—low entry point, rapid awareness, and the kind of edge that gets people talking. While XRP and ADA have to prove they can bounce, MAGACOIN FINANCE only needs to maintain momentum—and that’s exactly what it’s doing. Q3 Altcoin Season May Separate the Old from the New Historical market cycles suggest Q3 is a launchpad for altcoins, particularly after a period of Bitcoin-led consolidation. Survey data from South Korea shows rising investor appetite for risk, with over a third of retail traders eyeing July to September as the likely start of the next alt season. ADA and XRP may catch that wave—but so might the tokens with fewer bags and fresher narratives. And MAGACOIN FINANCE fits that mold. Conclusion Cardano and XRP still matter. Their long-term prospects aren’t dead, and both could benefit from broader institutional interest and regulatory wins. But the market is shifting, and capital is flowing faster toward bold, early-stage plays. While all three tokens show potential, the one that truly stands out for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its low price entry point, rapid presale momentum, and projected upside make it a strategic first pick for 2025. The window is still open—but it won’t stay that way for long.

The amended S-1 filing follows the June 12, 2025 delay from the U.S. SEC on the spot Dogecoin ETF, whereby the agency cited market risks and investor protection concerns. According to the amended S-1 filing, Bitwise introduced in-kind creations and redemptions to enable authorized participants to exchange shares directly for Dogecoin. With the increased engagement between the U.S. SEC and fund managers, Bloomberg analysts, led by Eric Balchunas, estimate a 90 percent approval probability by the end of October 2025. The next step after this would be the intended exchanges filing for Form 19b-4 with the U.S. SEC. Market Impact on Dogecoin and Aptos The filing of amended form S-1 filings for Bitwise spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETF is a clear indication that the agency is looking to approve several similar products in the near future. As Coinpedia reported, the U.S. SEC has engaged with fund managers seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs. Before the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs last year, the U.S. SEC engaged the fund managers in a similar manner as it has engaged with altcoin ETF issuers in the recent past. The imminent approval of the spot Dogecoin and Aptos ETFs could follow a similar pattern to Ethereum’s, which recorded bearish sentiment after the final approval. Moreover, the spot altcoin ETFs have shown characteristics of an exit market from institutional investors. Meanwhile, both altcoins continue to have a midterm bearish outlook, especially after BTC’s price struggled to rally consistently beyond $110k in the past few weeks.",News|Altcoins|Crypto Regulations|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING|APT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-26 21:35:21

While meme coins like PEPE continue to trend on social platforms, it’s Mutuum Finance’s explosive presale growth and unique DeFi model that are positioning it as one of the top altcoins to watch right now. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.03 in the fifth phase of its presale, now over 40% sold out. Phase 5 buyers are set for a guaranteed profit of 100% ROI at launch. The project has already raised over $11.2 million, gaining serious momentum even as broader market sentiment leans cautious. As traders ask what crypto to buy now to beat the market slump, MUTM’s under-the-radar rise is turning heads, and possibly offering the kind of early entry some believe could lead to life-changing returns. Pepe Coin Consolidates Near $0.000009 as Meme Coin Sentiment Cools Pepe Coin (PEPE) has been slowly oscillating within its central support in anticipation of further decline whilst other meme coins are in a drawback. PEPE is still a very liquid token with daily trading volume of almost $1billion, but it does not have enough headlines or catalyst-driven momentum to count. Analysts observe that there should be a new drive in the social media to enable the price of PEPE to move outside the limit of possible two to three cents range of $0.000008 to $0.000010. With the meme coin market settling down, lately, investors appear to want to switch their focus to younger projects of greater interest, including Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions that offer the next level of growth opportunities. Mutuum Finance Hits $11.2 Million Raised Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running wild in popularity. With its trailblazing two-way lending model, this DeFi behemoth has already attracted more than 12,500 investors and raised $11.2 million, and it’s not slowing down. The Mutuum Finance token price will jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, a 16.67% increase, so investors who come aboard here are in for massive gains. Early bird investors are locking profits. Mutuum Finance Lending: Smarter, Simpler, Decentralized Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, offering users stable returns from USDT pools via the P2C framework and full ownership of direct crypto transfer via the P2P framework. Such lending protocols provide start-to-end seamless DeFi experience that is perfectly tailored to the needs of the user and which is safer, transparent, and more customizable than other centralized lending products. Mutuum Finance’s USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability while avoiding flaws found in algorithmic stablecoins. While the project is already audited by CertiK, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and investors who pay attention at this point might benefit the most in the future. On top of that, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will each receive $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly proving to be more than just another altcoin, it’s becoming one of the most promising early-stage DeFi projects in 2025. With over $11.2 million raised and 12,500+ investors already on board, the project’s innovative dual lending system and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin are setting the stage for major adoption. Investors buying in at the current $0.03 price point in Phase 5 are positioned for guaranteed 100% ROI at launch, with a 16.67% price increase locked in for Phase 6. Join the presale now.

The site originally said the device would start shipping in August, but that’s been deleted. It now says the T1 will arrive “later this year.” The company had originally named Alabama, California, and Florida as the places where the phone would be built. The phone’s specs have also been dialed back. It was first listed as having a 6.78-inch screen, but now it says 6.25 inches. It also no longer mentions the 12GB of RAM it once claimed. The rollback on both the manufacturing claim and the specs comes after tech experts questioned whether it was even possible to build a competitive smartphone with US-made parts. There’s a reason no major phone company makes its devices in America. Liberty Mobile handles service and raises more questions More than 80% of all smartphone components come from China, and even the top players, Apple and Samsung, still rely heavily on Asian factories. Getting something built completely in America is a long game, and Trump Mobile seemed to skip that part. A formal “Made in America” label from the Federal Trade Commission requires that “all or virtually all” components are manufactured inside the country, which is almost never the case for a phone. Trump’s push to localize phone production isn’t new. He’s slammed Apple for building iPhones in China and India, threatening 25% tariffs on imported devices. The T1 was supposed to be proof that he could do it differently. But now, even Eric Trump, who is running the company with his brother Donald Trump Jr., admits the phones will only be made in the US “eventually.” At the launch event in New York, the Trumps brought out Don Hendrickson, Eric Thomas, and Pat O’Brien as executives who would run the company. They told the crowd the three had “hundreds of years in the mobile space,” but gave no actual information about their backgrounds. Trump Mobile is also tying customers into a monthly mobile plan. The price? $47.45 per month, a reference to Trump’s 45th presidency and hopes for a second full term in office. The service is being handled by Liberty Mobile Wireless, a Florida-based company created in 2018 by Matt Lopatin, who has a long history of setting up small companies, many of which no longer exist. Liberty is a mobile virtual network operator, which means it doesn’t own its own infrastructure. It buys capacity from AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, then resells it under its own brand — a common practice, especially among celebrity-backed services like Mint Mobile. Doubts grow around the T1’s design and timeline The T1 phone was originally promised for a September delivery. That looks unlikely now, and nothing on the website confirms a hard date. Trump Mobile staff said the site crashed on launch day because of the high volume of pre-orders, but didn’t share numbers. The design of the phone itself is nearly identical to models sold by Vivo and Umidigi, two low-cost Chinese Android phone makers. There’s no unique hardware or design shown. Even the few companies that have tried building phones in the US haven’t pulled it off at scale. Todd Weaver, the CEO of Purism, an American electronics company based in California, said building a US phone is slow and expensive. “When I started, I knew we couldn’t build it immediately,” he said. “When I was going to put out my first phone, we flew to China to look at all the designs and learn the processes.” Today, Purism makes secure phones with a custom OS aimed at niche users like government agencies, but the trade-off is fewer features, fewer apps, and a smaller audience. The smartphone market itself isn’t easy for mid-tier devices. In 2024, phones priced between $400 and $600 made up less than 5% of the market, down from 9% in 2019. Even Apple’s iPhone 16e, launched in February 2025 for $599, had to work hard to grab budget users. There’s just not much space left in that segment. As of now, there’s no proof that the T1 meets any of the requirements to be called American-made. The FTC’s standard is clear, “all or virtually all” parts must be from the US, and that means nearly zero imported components.

While mature players like Ethereum and Bitcoin remain stable, the next generation of altcoins is picking up steam, attracting serious investors, funds, and retail players. Three names continue to surface in analyst forecasts and high-volume trading circles: Solana, XRP, and a rising breakout called MAGACOIN FINANCE . Solana: A Layer 1 Powerhouse Eyeing ETF Catalysts Solana remains one of the strongest Layer 1 blockchains, with high throughput, low transaction costs, and a growing developer base. Analysts believe the speculation surrounding a potential Solana spot ETF in the U.S. could be a major trigger. Pantera Capital and other market experts say ETF approval could send Solana soaring — with ultra-bullish targets as high as $1,000. Even without confirmation, SOL continues to benefit from institutional activity and vibrant DeFi and NFT ecosystems. XRP: Institutional Exposure Expands with Canadian ETFs XRP gained renewed investor interest following the launch of two spot ETFs on Canada’s TSX in June 2025. The Evolve XRP ETF and Purpose XRP ETF are giving both retail and institutional players secure, regulated access to the asset. XRP price saw heavy volatility early in the year, correcting from $2.30 to near $2.00. Still, whale behavior signals confidence, with large holders holding firm. With legal clarity and new investment avenues, XRP is back on analyst radars. Why Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Is a 2025 Power Play MAGACOIN FINANCE is picking up speed quickly, becoming one of the altcoin presales that are most closely followed so far this year. With its capped 170 billion token supply, it has a scarcity-based framework that resonates with early purchasers. With no unlock risk and no VC control, the token is for long-term holders. The complete HashEx audit model is referenced by analysts as additional layers of attractiveness. What’s fueling its explosive growth is the combination of bold branding and structural simplicity. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already sold out multiple stages, with thousands of new participants joining. Forecasts show MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver 30x returns for early participants, as it nears listings and broader exposure. Crypto insiders are calling it one of the most undervalued assets on the market today. With traction building, many view it as a breakout altcoin with the potential to lead ROI charts throughout 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned for Major Growth and High ROI Solana, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE represent a broad spectrum of market opportunity heading into 2025. Solana offers technical scale and the possibility of ETF momentum. XRP is showing signs of institutional maturity with regulatory approval and ETF availability. But analysts are looking toward MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top 2025 play. The fixed supply, complete audit, and lightning-fast presale of the project are all signs of increasing investor optimism. Its early-adopter-biased architecture has massive potential for upside as listings near. As more capital flows in and awareness grows, this project could deliver some of the highest returns of the year.

In a new announcement, Binance says that it is adding support for Sahara AI ( SAHARA ), a decentralized AI platform that enables users to develop and monetize AI models, datasets and applications. “Binance is excited to announce that Sahara AI will be added to Binance Simple Earn, ‘Buy Crypto,’ Binance Convert, Binance Margin, and Binance Futures.” News of the addition had a negative impact on the price of SAHARA, as the digital asset went from a peak of $0.141 earlier today to its current price of $0.096, a dip of over 32% in just a few hours. Earlier this week, SAHARA was also added to Binance Earn, a program that allows traders to generate passive income by staking crypto. In its official litepaper, the development team behind Sahara AI says its purpose is to address the common issues found in centralized AI platforms. “Centralized AI platforms come with significant limitations and risks, including concerns for privacy, deepening economic disparities, and restricted access to resources. This creates significant barriers that hinder widespread innovation, limit participation in AI development from diverse backgrounds, and restrict access to AI technologies across different communities. Sahara AI addresses these challenges by decentralizing AI ownership and enabling broader participation in its development.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The AI-focused cloud infrastructure firm is reportedly in advanced talks to buy the Bitcoin mining and hosting giant, after a previous $1 billion bid was rejected last year. Core Scientific Jumps 27% as CoreWeave Reignites Acquisition Talks The earlier offer, made at $5.75 per share, was turned down by Core Scientific’s board, which said the proposal undervalued the company. Since then, Core Scientific’s stock has surged. It jumped more than 27% to $15.67 on Thursday after the report surfaced, briefly triggering a trading halt. The company is now valued at around $3.7 billion, more than double CoreWeave’s earlier bid. *COREWEAVE IN TALKS TO BUY CORE SCIENTIFIC: WSJ Blocks are always moving in the #Bitcoin mining industry. $MNRS Learn more about $MNRS : https://t.co/kCpi8yOYF1 pic.twitter.com/sy9DG1f8dR — Grayscale (@Grayscale) June 26, 2025 Talks are ongoing, and the deal could close within weeks if negotiations continue without major setbacks. So far, the exact terms of the new offer have not been disclosed. Core Scientific operates one of the largest digital infrastructure networks for Bitcoin mining and data hosting in North America. In recent months, it has attracted attention beyond crypto, thanks to the global demand for data center capacity driven by artificial intelligence workloads. The two companies already have a deep relationship. In June last year, Core Scientific signed a series of 12-year contracts to host CoreWeave’s AI operations, supplying hundreds of megawatts of capacity. The agreement is expected to bring in billions in revenue over time and represents Core Scientific’s broader shift toward AI infrastructure. CoreWeave, which went public in March and now holds a market cap of roughly $75 billion, has rapidly scaled its AI infrastructure business. The company rents out access to Nvidia GPUs, often through partnerships with big tech firms. Microsoft alone accounted for over 60% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024, with Meta and IBM also among its clients. A successful acquisition would bring Core Scientific’s infrastructure under CoreWeave’s control, forming a major player in both Bitcoin mining and AI compute power. As demand continues to stretch global data center resources, the combination of Core Scientific’s scale and CoreWeave’s AI expertise could prove strategically valuable. Carlos Ramírez, an analyst following the sector, noted the shift. “Core Scientific is no longer just a crypto company,” he said. “Its infrastructure is becoming key to AI growth, and CoreWeave knows it.” While Core Scientific’s shares rallied on the news, CoreWeave’s stock slipped slightly. Market reactions to takeovers often reflect concern over deal execution, especially when integration or financing challenges loom. For now, all eyes remain on the negotiation table as CoreWeave looks to seal what could become one of the largest deals at the intersection of crypto infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Core Scientific Eyes AI Future Amid Revenue Decline, New CoreWeave Offer As CoreWeave returns with a renewed $1 billion-plus offer for Core Scientific, the backdrop tells a story of a mining firm in transition. Back in February, the Bitcoin mining firm secured a $1.2 billion agreement with CoreWeave to boost data center capacity for high-performance computing (HPC), signaling a pivot toward AI infrastructure. The move is expected to drive $360 million in colocation revenue by 2026, offering a buffer as traditional mining revenue comes under pressure. In Q1 2025, Core Scientific posted a net profit of $580 million , up from $210 million a year earlier. But revenue fell short of expectations, dropping to $79.5 million, down from $179.3 million in Q1 2024. @Core_Scientific reported a first-quarter net profit of $580 million for 2025, a sharp increase from $210 million a year earlier. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/a2zHWUsRcs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 The slump reflects weaker mining yields after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving and a strategic shift from self-mining to HPC hosting. Self-mining still brought in $67.2 million, but hosted and colocation mining lagged, contributing just $12.4 million combined. Industry-wide, miners are feeling the squeeze. According to CryptoQuant, daily miner revenues dropped to $34 million on June 22 , the lowest since April, due to falling BTC prices and lower transaction fees. Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year. Daily revenue slipped to $34 million in June, the lowest since April. Falling fees and Bitcoin’s price drop are crushing margins. pic.twitter.com/TXdN06CU1F — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 26, 2025 Analysts say miners are now the “most underpaid” they’ve been all year. Meanwhile, sustainability is improving. A Cambridge University study shows that 52.4% of Bitcoin mining now runs on sustainable energy , up from 37.6% in 2022. But uncertainty looms as President Trump’s proposed tax bill threatens to slash incentives for solar and renewable-powered miners, potentially raising energy costs across the sector.

The removal of over $7.5 million from the TRUMP liquidity pool, widely interpreted as an intention from insiders to cash out, casts doubt on the long-term Trump coin price outlook . For a meme coin so closely pegged to the social momentum and influence of U.S. President Donald Trump, a move from its core team to pull away from the token could mark a collapse. TRUMP is now 45% below its late-May peak following the presidential dinner for top holders, struggling to regain traction and in need of a fresh social catalyst to reignite retail attention. Whale Ramps Up Sell-Offs Following $7.5 Million Withdrawal According to an X report from smart money tracker Lookonchain, the TRUMP coin team moved $4.4 million in USDC and $3.12 million worth of TRUMP from its liquidity pool on June 25. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) to a new wallet. https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiA https://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 The USDC has since been bridged to Ethereum, while the remaining 347,438 TRUMP tokens were transferred to a newly created Coinbase wallet. With no details on the purpose or intention of the transfer, speculation-fueled FUD around an insider sell-off could be detrimental for a meme coin that is already struggling with low demand. Lookonchain also flagged that a known whale has quietly ramped up profit-taking efforts following the transfer, placing a limit order to sell 275,672 TRUMP worth nearly $2.5 million. This same wallet had sold 100,000 TRUMP just two weeks earlier, and still holds 369,400 TRUMP valued at around $3.31 million. TRUMP Coin whale places second $2.5 Million limit order. Source: X, @lookonchain. The staggered sell-off pattern suggests an intent to exit rather than to de-risk, raising concerns that subsequent dumps could follow suit. TRUMP Coin Price Prediction: Could Sell Pressure Spark a Breakdown? The mass movement of capital from large hands could put pressure on the Trump coin price as it approaches the conclusion of a falling wedge forming since its late May peak. TRUMP / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. This comes as wider market dynamics flip bullish for the first time since, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line in a golden cross—an early sign of a potential trend reversal. The RSI has also bounced from oversold territory at 30, an indication of seller exhaustion. However, FUD may have stopped buyers from filling the gap as it stalls at 33. This bullish momentum coincides with a critical bounce from the wedge’s lower support, aligned with a historic accumulation zone below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $9.30. If bulls can defend it, the zone creates a confluence zone with the patterns’ upper descending trendline and a prime setup for a breakout. A successful breakout sets a technical target around the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $14.50, representing a potential 60% gain from current prices. However, if the accumulation zone fails, the next major support sits at 20% lower at $7.15, mirroring the mid-April market bottom and likely invalidating the bullish setup. Bitcoin Season Just Got a Whole Lot More Bullish Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.6 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 474% APY on staking that rewards early investors. You can keep up with Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Bitcoin Hyper website .
