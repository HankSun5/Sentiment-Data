BTC is rising and might aim for a move above the $82,000 resistance zone in the near term. Bitcoin started a fresh surge above the $78,500 zone. The price is trading above $80,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $80,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise above the $81,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase above the $76,500 level. BTC cleared the $78,000 resistance and traded to a new all-time high. It posted a high at $81,700 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $81,500 level. However, the price is still well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75,785 swing low to the $81,700 high. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $80,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading above $80,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $81,700 level. The first key resistance is near the $82,000 level. A clear move above the $82,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $82,500. A close above the $82,500 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $83,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $85,000 resistance level. Are Dips Supported In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $81,700 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $80,250 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $78,750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75,785 swing low to the $81,700 high. The next support is now near the $77,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $76,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $80,250, followed by $78,750.

ETH is up over 10% and now approaches the key barrier at $3,250. Ethereum started a fresh surge above the $2,880 resistance zone. The price is trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new bullish trend line forming with support at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,250 resistance. Ethereum Price Regains Momentum Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,750 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $2,880 and $3,000 resistance levels to move further into a positive zone. It even surged above the $3,120 level in the past few sessions. It is up over 10% and there was a move above $3,150. A high is formed at $3,249 before there was a minor pullback. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,020 swing low to the $3,249 high. However, the bulls were active near the $3,080 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,020 swing low to the $3,249 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a new bullish trend line forming with support at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,200 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,300. A clear move above the $3,300 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,500 resistance zone. Are Dips Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,250 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,150 level. The first major support sits near the $3,120 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,120 support might push the price toward $3,080. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5780 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5950 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.6162 swing high to the $0.5630 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.6040 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6150. A clear move above the $0.6150 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6220 resistance.

If XRP fails to clear the $0.600 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5820 level.

DOGE is up over 50% and is showing signs of more upsides. DOGE price started a fresh rally like Bitcoin and climbed above the $0.220 resistance level. The price is trading above the $0.2800 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.280 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to rally if it clears the $0.3050 and $0.3120 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh surge after it reclaimed the $0.200 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE was able to gain pace for a move above the $0.2200 and $0.250 resistance levels. The pair even surged above $0.3000. A high is formed at $0.3036 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2013 swing low to the $0.3036 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.280 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2880 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.300 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.3050 level. A close above the $0.3050 resistance might send the price toward the $0.3120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.34500 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.350. Are Dips Limited In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.3050 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.280 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.2680 level. The main support sits at $0.2550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2013 swing low to the $0.3036 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.2550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.2420 level or even $0.2350 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.280 and $0.2680.

Over the past weekend, the BTC price staged a rare “weekend pump”, rallying by more than 6%. While there are several reasons for this move, one clear main reason stands out: The victory of Donald Trump. #1 The Bitcoin “Trump Pump” Donald Trump’s victory has significantly bolstered Bitcoin’s market sentiment, primarily due to his campaign promises and supportive legislative initiatives. During his election campaign, Trump pledged to establish a national Bitcoin reserve by retaining ownership of the 208,000 Bitcoins confiscated through various law enforcement actions over the years. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming often dubbed the “Bitcoin Senator” for her staunch advocacy, introduced the Bitcoin Act. This legislation aims to acquire 1 million BTC within a five-year timeframe. As Bitcoinist reported, the Bitcoin reserve could become a reality quite fast. BTC Inc. David Bailey, who is a key Bitcoin advisor to Trump, said recently that it could be done within the “first 100 days” of Trump’s term. In light of this, crypto research firm Matrixport writes in their latest investor note: “With expectations that Trump will transform US regulatory policies into a more pro-crypto environment, the bullish momentum appears difficult to halt. With his inauguration set for January 20, 2025, the market has several weeks to sustain this rally. Related Reading: How High Can Bitcoin Go In 2025? Legendary Trader Reveals Arthur Hayes, founder of BitMEX, echoed this optimism on X: “Some of y’all don’t believe Trump is about to trash the $ and print money. BTC disagrees. Here is Bitcoin leading vs. my new money supply indicator US Bank Credit. The market is speaking, listen up.” Renowned crypto analyst MacroScope (@MacroScope17) further elaborated on the implications for institutional investors: “Very important for BTC traders to understand how the game has changed since the election. In the institutional world, investments are built around having a thesis It’s hard to overstate how much the thesis has now changed for BTC in terms of the policy/political element.” #2 Rumors About Bitcoin Nation-State Adoption The strategic plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve under Trump carry substantial geopolitical weight, potentially igniting a global race to amass Bitcoin reserves. David Bailey remarked, “The Bitcoin Space Race has begun,” noting that “the game theory is playing out faster than anyone could have expected.” Mike Alfred, founder and Managing Partner of Alpine Fox LP, shared his excitement on X: “I just got a call out of the blue. It was someone important and they said someone huge is buying Bitcoin in size tonight. I almost couldn’t believe it when they said the name. Wild. We are going so much higher.” Related Reading: Economist Predicts ‘Blow-Off Top’ For Bitcoin At $123,000 Post-Trump Win Bailey commented on November 10, “There is at least one nation state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully, we hear from them soon.” His assertion, accompanied by a meme suggesting certainty over speculation. He added on the size: “Top 5 holder of bitcoin across all users.” There is at least one nation state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully we hear from them soon. — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) November 9, 2024 #3 Short Squeeze A significant short squeeze has also contributed to Bitcoin’s price surge. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, commented on X: “Circa $1B of shorts squeezed! From the weekend move from $76 to $81K. Open interest at the same level as when BTC traded at $62K. Provided funding continues to settle down, a very healthy up move.” Data from Coinglass corroborates this, revealing that on Sunday, $133.15 million in BTC shorts were liquidated, with additional $33 million on Saturday. This substantial liquidation of short positions has reduced selling pressure, thereby fueling further upward momentum in Bitcoin’s price. #4 Retail Is Back The resurgence of retail interest has been another pivotal factor in Bitcoin’s recent rally. Cameron Winklevoss, founder of Gemini, observed on X: “The road to $80k bitcoin was paved with steady ETF demand. Not retail FOMO. Little fanfare. People buy ETFs, they don’t sell them. This is sticky HODL-like capital. Floor keeps rising. Where are we in the cycle? We just won the coin toss, innings haven’t started.” Google Trends data supports this narrative, indicating a 53% increase in Bitcoin-related searches since the first weekend of October. On November 10, Bitcoin web searches peaked at 95, up from 42 points at the end of October. This surge in search activity suggests heightened retail interest and potential influxes of new investors into the market. At press time, BTC traded at $81,259.

According to the Stock-to-Flow model, Bitcoin’s position in the red-orange zone after the halving is a historically positive signal. RSI nearing 70 suggests overvaluation, but historically for Bitcoin, it doesn’t signal a downward trend. BTC's overcapitalization and concentrated supply may limit gains, but $100K isn’t as far off as it seems. Here we go again, talking about the father of crypto, during an important phase of its momentum. The recent break of the all-time high (ATH) and surpassing the $80,000 mark could be a good moment to take a deep breath and start thinking deeply about what Bitcoin is aiming to do next. Where is the price of BTC/USD heading? Not really sure. Because despite various apocalyptic or conspiracy theories, is BTC/USD truly on its way to $100,000? Let's look at some statistical and on-chain data to see where we are and where Bitcoin might go next. What is happening in the crypto world? It may seem obvious to say now, but Bitcoin is currently in a bull market . However, what seems clear now was not so evident just two weeks ago, when there was fear in the market (neutral zone of Fear & Greed Index) and a potential distribution phase for BTC/USD. Something like this. BTC/USD (TradingView) Then, Trump’s unexpected win in the election , along with talk of a new wave of deregulation and his surprising alliance with Elon Musk , quickly shifted the mood in the crypto market. Suddenly, what felt like caution and fear turned into excitement. According to the CMC's Fear & Greed Index , we’ve moved into the ""greed"" territory now. And that’s worth discussing. In my view, Bitcoin breaking its recent all-time high, while the market is feeling optimistic, is a strong signal: it shows the breakout was welcomed with open arms and positive energy. CMC Fear & Greed (coinmarketcap) Additionally, there is still no sign of an altseason, because Bitcoin dominance is increasing, while altcoin dominance is decreasing. So, despite BTC/USD surpassing its all-time high (ATH), the market interest in buying Bitcoin has not faded. Bitcoin Dominance (coinmarketcap) This is also evident when analyzing Bitcoin's ""Long Term Holder Supply,"" which is decreasing, even though there hasn’t been a significant sell-off that would indicate whales are taking profits. Long Term Holder Supply (bitbo) This trend also seems to be confirmed by the derivatives market , with a strong growth in open interest among the largest crypto firms. BTC Open Interest Statistics (coinalyze) A significant short liquidation occurred just before BTC/USD touched the $80,000 mark, in the $79,000 zone, totaling around $300 million. Aggregated Liquidation (coinalyze) A Deep Dive into the Stock-to-Flow Model So, where is BTC/USD heading now? To answer this, I’d like to introduce the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) chart , which, in my opinion, is one of the best tools for navigating the complex world of Bitcoin. We are currently at a very interesting point because the halving has already taken place , and the chart's color has shifted into the red zone, moving towards the orange area. From a statistical perspective, this zone is worth paying close attention to. In previous bull runs, the breakout of the previous all-time high (ATH) always occurred within the red-orange zone after a halving. I’ve been in the crypto market since 2015, and every time we’ve reached this area, it seemed almost impossible for Bitcoin to find the momentum to push higher. Yet, each time, a strong catalyst emerged. But, returning to the thread, according to the Stock-to-Flow model, and backed by statistical evidence, the breakout of the previous ATH in the red-orange zone of the Bitcoin halving cycle is typically a good signal for Bitcoin. Stock to Flow (Bitbo) Technical Perspective What’s the target price for BTC/USD? That’s a great and intriguing question. If you have a definite answer, please let me know … But we can make some educated guesses. We are already said that, previous bull market was difficult to predict because it happened after BTC/USD had already risen significantly. This is evident when looking at a classic 14-period RSI on the 1-week timeframe. Each time the RSI entered the overbought zone and people started to believe that BTC/USD was overvalued, Bitcoin would counterattack and push higher. Ok … first thing to note: Currently, BTC is approaching the 70-point level on the RSI, which I find to be an intriguing signal. BTC/USD, 1W (TradingView) But if a new bull run is coming, where could it be headed? During the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin pumped over 8x, and in the 2020 bull run, it pumped 4x. Following this pattern, we might expect a smaller multiplier this time, indicating a potential contraction in the extent of the bull market. This trend can be explained by the increase in market cap and the growing supply of BTC, which have led to a decrease in Bitcoin's annualized volatility. Bitcoin Annualized Volatility (Dune (@21co)) In my opinion, we shouldn’t expect a bull run similar to those we’ve seen in previous cycles. The target set by the Stock-to-Flow model, which suggests a BTC/USD price of around $300,000, seems unrealistic at this point. However, I do believe that the widely anticipated target of $100,000, mentioned by many in the crypto community, is becoming far more achievable. RISK The risk remains the same as always, aside from potential issues like a U.S. political crisis or an economic recession : the extreme concentration of BTC supply in a few addresses. The table below illustrates this situation perfectly. It’s not just our capital at risk but also the decentralized nature of Bitcoin itself. For instance, if centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance, with a CEO like CZ,well known for his ""playful"" control, hold more than 2% of the Bitcoin supply (based only on publicly declared addresses), a new risk emerges: a ""Binance risk,"" not just a risk to the Bitcoin network. Top 100 Bitcoin Holders (Dune (@21co)) The issue becomes even more pronounced when we consider another fact: over 82% of the BTC supply is held in fewer than 200,000 addresses. This could be alarming, as it’s often unclear who these holders are and what their intentions might be with their assets. It’s definitely something worth thinking about. Bitcoin distribution (bitinfocharts) Conclusion In conclusion, BTC/USD appears to be well-positioned at the moment. With a combination of strong technical momentum, bullish sentiment analysis, and a favorable statistical outlook, I believe a ""BUY"" rating for this crypto pair is well justified.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-11 15:30:00

MicroStrategy Now Holds Nearly $23 Billion In Bitcoin In a social media post by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, the company announced that it had acquired approximately 27,200 BTC for approximately $2.03 billion. This transaction is one of the largest BTC purchases to date by a corporate entity but in line with the company’s strategy to integrate crypto into its financial framework. According to a statement released Monday, these acquisitions took place between October 31 and November 10, using proceeds from recent stock sales. With this latest purchase, MicroStrategy now holds nearly $23 billion in Bitcoin, totaling approximately 279,420 BTC with an average purchase price of about $42,692 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: PEPE Upsurge Stalls At Key Resistance, Eyeing Support At $0.00001152 Michael Saylor also revealed that the company’s MSTR treasury operations since the beginning of November have resulted in a BTC yield of 7.3%, representing a net benefit to shareholders of nearly 18,410 Bitcoin. However, this strategy has also had a notable impact on Microstrategy’s stock MSTR, which jumped 11% on Monday as the announcement was made and is currently trading at approximately $299 per share, up from $270 the previous week. Post-Election Bull Run The current uptrend in Bitcoin’s price also coincides with a notable shift in investor sentiment following Donald Trump’s victory in the recent US presidential election against Vice President Kamala Harris. According to CoinShares, digital asset investment products experienced inflows of $1.98 billion following the election, marking the fifth consecutive week of positive inflows and bringing the year-to-date total to a record $31.3 billion. Along with the largest cryptocurrency on the market, the overall global assets under management (AuM) in cryptocurrencies have reached an all-time high of $116 billion. The inflows were predominantly driven by US investors, who contributed $1.95 billion, while European markets also saw smaller inflows, particularly in Switzerland and Germany. Bitcoin alone attracted $1.8 billion of these inflows, reflecting a broader trend that has emerged since the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates in September. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Soars 50% In a Flash: Is More Upside Ahead? Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that the bullish momentum in the crypto market is fueled by a sense of “euphoria” following Trump’s election. Streeter commented that his pledge to ‘go all in on crypto’ has sent BTC to “new, heady heights,” and ultimately believes that Trump’s shift towards supporting the cryptocurrency industry has created a more favorable regulatory environment, boosting investor confidence. In further support of this sentiment, Citi strategists highlighted that cryptocurrencies remain one of the few Trump-related trades that have not retraced. They noted that his administration’s expected crypto-friendly policies could lead to greater regulatory clarity in the US, further encouraging investment. Overall, as Bitcoin continues its uptrend, some predict that BTC could reach the $100,000 milestone by the end of the year, driven by a combination of favorable market conditions and growing institutional adoption. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is trading at $82,479, up 20% in the past week alone.
