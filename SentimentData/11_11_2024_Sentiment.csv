BTC is rising and might aim for a move above the $82,000 resistance zone in the near term. Bitcoin started a fresh surge above the $78,500 zone. The price is trading above $80,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $80,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to rise above the $81,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Sets Another ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase above the $76,500 level. BTC cleared the $78,000 resistance and traded to a new all-time high. It posted a high at $81,700 and is currently consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $81,500 level. However, the price is still well above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75,785 swing low to the $81,700 high. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $80,250 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading above $80,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $81,700 level. The first key resistance is near the $82,000 level. A clear move above the $82,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $82,500. A close above the $82,500 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $83,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $85,000 resistance level. Are Dips Supported In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $81,700 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $80,250 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $78,750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $75,785 swing low to the $81,700 high. The next support is now near the $77,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $76,500 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $80,250, followed by $78,750.

ETH is up over 10% and now approaches the key barrier at $3,250. Ethereum started a fresh surge above the $2,880 resistance zone. The price is trading above $3,000 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new bullish trend line forming with support at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to rise if it clears the $3,250 resistance. Ethereum Price Regains Momentum Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,750 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH was able to climb above the $2,880 and $3,000 resistance levels to move further into a positive zone. It even surged above the $3,120 level in the past few sessions. It is up over 10% and there was a move above $3,150. A high is formed at $3,249 before there was a minor pullback. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,020 swing low to the $3,249 high. However, the bulls were active near the $3,080 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,020 swing low to the $3,249 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a new bullish trend line forming with support at $3,120 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,200 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,250 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,300. A clear move above the $3,300 resistance might send the price toward the $3,350 resistance. An upside break above the $3,420 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,500 resistance zone. Are Dips Supported In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,250 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,150 level. The first major support sits near the $3,120 zone and the trend line. A clear move below the $3,120 support might push the price toward $3,080. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

The price rallied toward $0.6150 resistance and recently corrected gains. XRP price is struggling to rise steadily like Bitcoin.

The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.6050 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $0.6162 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $0.600 and tested $0.5640.

There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5780 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5950 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.6162 swing high to the $0.5630 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.6040 level. The next key resistance could be $0.6150. A clear move above the $0.6150 resistance might send the price toward the $0.6220 resistance.

If XRP fails to clear the $0.600 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5820 level. The next major support is near the $0.5780 level and the trend line.

DOGE is up over 50% and is showing signs of more upsides. DOGE price started a fresh rally like Bitcoin and climbed above the $0.220 resistance level. The price is trading above the $0.2800 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.280 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could continue to rally if it clears the $0.3050 and $0.3120 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes More Gains Dogecoin price started a fresh surge after it reclaimed the $0.200 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE was able to gain pace for a move above the $0.2200 and $0.250 resistance levels. The pair even surged above $0.3000. A high is formed at $0.3036 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2013 swing low to the $0.3036 high. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.280 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.2880 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.300 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.3050 level. A close above the $0.3050 resistance might send the price toward the $0.3120 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.34500 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.350. Are Dips Limited In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.3050 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.280 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $0.2680 level. The main support sits at $0.2550 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.2013 swing low to the $0.3036 high. If there is a downside break below the $0.2550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.2420 level or even $0.2350 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.280 and $0.2680.
