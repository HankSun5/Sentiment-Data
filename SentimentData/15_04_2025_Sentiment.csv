The investigation follows a past consent order from the OCC, which cited the bank’s failure to meet anti-money laundering compliance standards. The probe’s timing coincides with Anchorage’s newly announced crypto custody partnership with BlackRock. A branch of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tasked with fighting money laundering and financial crimes at large is investigating Anchorage Digital Bank, a Monday report from Barron’s alleges. Homeland Security Launches Anchorage Probe: Report According to an April 14 report from the media outlet, members of Homeland Security’s El Dorado Task Force have reached out to employees in recent weeks over the crypto company’s “practices and policies.” Established in 1992, a webpage from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) states that the specialized task force’s mission is “to disrupt and dismantle transnational money laundering organizations by conducting aggressive proactive investigations.” BREAKING: U.S. crypto bank Anchorage Digital is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, according to sources familiar with the matter. pic.twitter.com/XnD8rHwXov — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) April 14, 2025 Anchorage is known for being the only federally chartered digital asset bank , with backers including heavyweight financial players such as Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs, and more. Founded by engineers Diogo Mónica and Nathan McCauley in 2017, the firm previously faced a consent order from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) over its failure to implement a compliance program in line with anti-money laundering standards. “The OCC holds all nationally chartered banks to the same high standards, whether they engage in traditional or novel activities,” former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu said at the time. “When institutions fall short, we will take action and hold them accountable to ensure compliance with federal laws and regulations,” he added. BlackRock, Anchorage Digital Team Up News of the probe comes just days after reports emerged that Anchorage Digital Bank had teamed up with BlackRock for crypto custody services, with the world’s largest investment bank holding tens of billions of dollars of digital assets . A press release from the firm earlier this month states that the partnership will “lay the groundwork for deeper collaboration between BlackRock and Anchorage Digital in response to rising client demand for digital assets.” As of Monday, it was unclear if the reported probe had any effect of the aforementioned business relationship.

The exchange clarified its requirements, including promotion budgets, refundable security deposits, and thorough project reviews. Bybit’s swift, evidence-based response shows a broader industry trend toward rebuilding trust and operational clarity after recent security incidents and market scrutiny. Crypto exchange Bybit has denied claims that it charges $1.4 million to list tokens on its platform following public allegations made on social media. The controversy began on April 14, when X user “silverfang88,” with over 100,000 followers, accused the exchange of demanding millions in listing fees from token projects. The user also claimed Bybit used key opinion leaders (KOLs) to silence students involved in its Campus Ambassador program. Bybit Responds to Viral Allegations Over Listing Fees, Campus Program Silence Claim Bybit CEO Ben Zhou responded directly to the accusations, calling for evidence and dismissing the claims as unsubstantiated. “Please show evidence if Bybit has done anything wrong,” Zhou wrote on X, adding that the crypto space has become chaotic due to rumors spread without proof. 1. 去哪个学校让学生交易合约了？证据拿出来。 2. 哪个法务举报友商了？证据呢？ 3. 哪个币上币收了上币费了？证据？ 币圈就是因为有你这种没证据造谣的傻逼天天喜欢意淫才这么乱。 — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) April 14, 2025 A Bybit representative outlined the exchange’s actual listing requirements in a statement. According to the company, token projects are expected to provide a promotion budget and a security deposit and undergo a comprehensive evaluation process. “Projects are expected to allocate promotional funds for user engagement activities, though legal constraints prevent exchanges from holding tokens directly,” the spokesperson said. The exchange clarified that it typically asks for a security deposit ranging from $200,000 to $300,000 in stablecoins, which is intended to ensure that promotional goals are met. Bybit said penalties may apply if these targets are not achieved. The listing process also involves form submissions, internal votes, due diligence, and a listing review meeting. “Evaluations focus on fundamentals and risk controls, including on-chain data, address authenticity, use cases, user distribution, project value, token valuation, value capture mechanisms, and team credentials,” the spokesperson added. The social media user further alleged that Bybit’s 2024 Campus Ambassador program involved issuing student trial contracts and that KOLs were later used to suppress complaints. Bybit has not responded directly to the ambassador-related allegations, but Zhou reiterated his call for evidence, stating that claims without proof only add to confusion in the market. At the time of publication, the exchange had not released any further statement regarding the ambassador program accusations. Bybit Rebounds Post-Hack, Streamlines Services Amid Security Overhaul Following a record-setting $1.4 billion exploit in February, Bybit has clawed its way back , restoring market share and tightening its focus. According to an April 9 report from analytics firm Block Scholes , Bybit’s market share dropped to just 4% immediately after the hack. However, it has since rebounded to around 7%, showing renewed user confidence and a steady return in spot trading activity. Bybit Incident Postmortem Report: @Bybit_Learn x Block Scholes The Feb 21, 2025 Bybit hack occurred amid broader macro uncertainty. While BTC & ETH markets saw brief disruptions in spot volume and order book depth, bid-ask spreads remained largely intact, showing market… pic.twitter.com/h4FRXuTVvx — Block Scholes (@BlockScholes) April 9, 2025 The February 21 exploit targeted liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH), and other assets. While the attackers laundered the funds through THORChain over 10 days, blockchain experts managed to trace nearly 89% of the stolen assets. The recovery comes as Bybit adjusts its platform strategy. On April 8, the exchange officially shut down its NFT and Initial DEX Offering (IDO) services. The move reflects internal efforts to reduce risk and a broader market shift away from NFTs amid declining volumes. Other platforms, such as Kraken and LG Art Lab, have also exited the NFT space as market activity continues to cool from its $3.24 billion peak in August 2021. Bybit’s latest decisions appear to strengthen trust and streamline operations in the wake of heightened regulatory pressure and user demand for greater security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do viral allegations affect crypto companies’ reputations? Even when unproven, social media rumors can quickly weaken user confidence and force the company, like exchanges, to prioritize transparency and proactive communication. What does Bybit’s response reveal? Bybit’s detailed disclosure of its listing process and security deposits shows a shift toward clearer, more accountable practices in exchange operations. How does Bybit’s recent recovery from a major hack influence its handling of public accusations? The need to rebuild trust post-hack likely makes Bybit more sensitive to reputational risks, prompting swift denials and calls for evidence to maintain credibility.

Market analysts are warning of potential instability. Are these top altcoins on the verge of a major downturn? This article delves into emerging risks and reveals which digital assets show signs of potential growth amidst the uncertainty. Chainlink Price Trends: Mixed Midterm Recovery and Near-Term Ranges Chainlink experienced a 7.28% decline over the past month, while the half-year performance remained positive with a 10.59% increase, indicating alternating periods of downward movement and recovery. The recent weekly gain of 12.49% suggests occasional bullish momentum amidst the overall monthly decline. These movements highlight shifting investor sentiment, characterized by a blend of caution and sporadic optimism. Currently, prices are trading between $11.04 and $16.82, with resistance identified at $20.13 and support at $8.57. There is a secondary resistance level at $25.91 and support at $2.79. The market shows slight bearish pressure, prompting traders to consider range-bound strategies while keeping an eye on potential breakouts as prices approach these significant levels. VeChain Price Analysis: Past Trends and Current Levels Last week VET highlighted a notable increase of 16.49%, although the monthly performance dropped by 6.67%. Over the past six months, the price has seen a decrease of 3.09%. Recent price action has shown mixed behavior, characterized by short-term rallies intertwined with longer-term declines. The volatility has been evident, with quick price movements contrasting the steadier trend observed over the half-year timeframe. Current prices are fluctuating within a defined range, with support at $0.0128 and primary resistance at $0.0389, plus a secondary resistance level at $0.0520. Bearish signals are evident, indicated by a negative Awesome Oscillator and an RSI at 47.93, suggesting no clear direction. A range-bound strategy is advisable, focusing on buying near support and selling close to resistance levels. Conclusion Chainlink (LINK) and VeChain (VET) face growing challenges in the market. These challenges could impact their value negatively. It is essential to stay informed about market trends and developments affecting these coins. Understanding the risks ahead can help in making informed decisions. The market's direction remains uncertain, and caution is necessary for those interested in LINK and VET. It is a crucial time to monitor these assets closely. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43346350,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=731105,1744671605,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/43346350.jpeg,Is The XRP Price Mirroring Bitcoin’s Macro Action? Analyst Maps Out How It Could Get To $71,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-mirroring-btcs-macro-action/,"A crypto analyst has presented a compelling case, suggesting that the XRP price may be closely mirroring Bitcoin’s historical macro action. By comparing its multi-year chart patterns and market behaviour, the analyst argues that XRP may be gearing up for a significant price rally to $71 and beyond. XRP Price Traces Bitcoin Path To Reach $71 TradingView crypto analyst RizeSenpai has forecasted that XRP could surge explosively to $71. At its current market price, this would represent a staggering 3,281% increase. Related Reading: XRP Price Nears ABC Correction With Clear Targets For Buying The TradingView expert conducted a detailed comparative analysis, drawing striking similarities between Bitcoin’s breakout from its multi-year accumulation range in 2015-2017 and XRP’s current price structure. He points out that XRP’s movements since it was listed on Poloniex in 2014 have closely mirrored Bitcoin’s macro price action but at a slower rate, estimated at 65%. For emphasis, the price chart shows that Bitcoin experienced a sharp surge of 5,424% after consolidating between 2013 and 2016 and finally breaking out in 2017. Similarly, XRP had a big rise in 2017 but has since been stuck trading within a large multi-year range for nearly six years as of the end of 2022. Recently, XRP broke out of its long-term price range and has been consolidating above its old all-time high resistance for several months. Considering its current price action, the analyst assumes that the asset may be attempting to move toward new breakout levels. The TradingView analyst has highlighted the potential for XRP to surge toward a more realistic target of $27 – $30, near the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level. For reference, he shared a chart comparing Bitcoin’s past bull market breakout and performance with XRP’s current breakout and future price action. The chart reveals that when BTC broke out, it surged toward the 1.618 Fibonacci level at $61,800 before initiating a secondary run that topped at the 1.902 HOP level. As a result, RizeSenpai predicts that if XRP can completely mirror Bitcoin’s performance, it could skyrocket to $27, potentially reaching as high as $71, where the 1.902 HOP level lies. The Token To Surge Above $71 To $120 As mentioned earlier, XRP is still trading within a multi-year range breakout similar to Bitcoin’s in its past cycle. As of writing, XRP’s price sits at $2.13, having declined by more than 11% over the last month. Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Called The XRP Price Crash, Here Are The Next Targets Notably, if the altcoin replicates the breakout momentum previously seen in Bitcoin, RizeSenpai predicts an explosive 5,400% increase, pushing its price to a very ambitious target of $120.94. This suggests that the TradingView analyst believes that XRP could exceed its previously projected target of $71 and climb past $120. Adding to the weight of this bullish forecast is the presence of a monthly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Hidden Bullish Divergence. This technical indicator is often associated with an uptrend continuation and potential upside momentum.

On April 10, 2025, news broke that President Donald Trump had paused tariffs for 90 days, a move that has injected fresh optimism into financial markets, including digital assets. This policy shift has eased fears of a trade war, allowing investors to refocus on opportunities in the crypto space. Amid this resurgence, one lesser-known altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF), is quietly positioning itself for a dramatic breakout, with analysts predicting a 150% rally in just 23 days. A Crypto Resurgence Fueled by Tariff Relief When President Trump announced the 90-day tariff pause, the crypto market responded with a sigh of relief. Bitcoin (BTC) , the bellwether of digital currencies, steadied above $91,000 after weeks of volatility tied to macroeconomic pressures, with predictions that it could even soar past $82,844 in the next few days. This stability has had a ripple effect, lifting altcoins that had been battered by uncertainty. Traders, once wary of global trade tensions, are now diving back into the market, seeking undervalued assets with high growth potential. The altcoin sector, known for its volatility and outsized returns, is seeing renewed interest as investors look beyond mainstream tokens like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA). This recovery has set the stage for lesser-known projects to shine, and RCO Finance (RCOF) is emerging as a standout contender. With the crypto landscape stabilizing, the timing couldn’t be better for this altcoin to make its mark. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Hidden Altcoin Ready to Skyrocket While the broader altcoin market catches its breath, RCO Finance (RCOF) is quietly gaining momentum in its presale phase. Currently in its fifth presale stage , the RCOF token has already surged 684% from its initial price to its current price of $0.10, reflecting growing investor confidence. The presale journey has been a steady climb, with prices rising through Stage 2 at $0.0343, Stage 3 at $0.0558, and Stage 4 at $0.0777. The next milestone, Stage 6, will see the price jump to $0.13, followed by a final presale target of $0.2142. Once the presale concludes, RCOF is expected to get listed on major exchanges at $0.4 to $0.6, a gain of over 150% from its current level. Post-listing analysts speculate the token could soar above $1 shortly after listing, driven by the altcoin’s unique value proposition and the market’s bullish mood. The RCO Finance team isn’t waiting for the public launch to prove its worth; they’ve already rolled out a Beta platform , giving users a glimpse of its capabilities. Now, the team is finalizing the Alpha platform, set to debut soon, which promises to amplify the project’s appeal and possibly propel RCOF’s price even higher. Why RCO Finance Stands Out in the Altcoin Crowd What sets RCO Finance apart from other altcoins isn’t just its presale success; it’s the robust ecosystem underpinning the RCOF token. At the heart of RCO Finance is an AI-powered Robo Advisor, a game-changer that crafts personalized investment strategies using real-time data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. The Robo Advisor analyzes market trends, user risk tolerance, and financial goals to deliver precise entry and exit points, making sophisticated trading accessible to everyone, from novices to seasoned investors. In addition to the AI tool, privacy-conscious users will appreciate the KYC-free approach, which eliminates cumbersome identity checks while maintaining a secure, decentralized environment. In addition, the platform’s smart contract, audited by the reputable SolidProof , adds a layer of trust, ensuring the system is free of vulnerabilities. Beyond that, RCO Finance offers access to over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 classes, spanning stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate. This diversity allows users to build balanced portfolios with ease, a feature few altcoin projects can match. As the Alpha platform launch nears, anticipation is building that these features will drive an explosive price surge, potentially pushing RCOF above $10 within weeks—a staggering leap that could redefine this altcoin’s place in the crypto hierarchy. While it may not be on your altcoin radar yet, the next 23 days could change that as RCOF aims for a 150% rally and beyond, proving that the most unassuming altcoins can sometimes deliver the biggest surprises.

The token lost nearly 90% of its value in a single day, plummeting to as low as $0.50 before stabilizing slightly at $0.66 at the time of writing. Much of the latest scrutiny stems from a personal investigation shared by the prominent crypto investigator ZachXBT on X. The investigator accused Denko Mancheski, the founder of Reef Finance and another X user, Fukogoryushu, of suspicious behavior in the days leading up to the crash. Reef Finance founder named in OM crash ZachXBT was responding to a Cointelegraph post on the matter, which stated, “Mantra investors deny dumping $OM before crash, despite onchain data showing $227M in $OM moved to exchanges ahead of the collapse.” He wrote, “The two names I keep hearing tied to the Mantra incident are Denko (Reef Finance founder) and Fukogoryushu, as they had allegedly been reaching out to a number of people asking for massive loans against their OM in the days leading up to the -90% crash.” ZachXBT also pointed out that Reef Finance has a documented history of controversy, including market manipulation allegations that preceded Binance’s delisting of the token in October 2024 and a controversial $80 million OTC deal with the infamous Alameda Research in 2021. According to ZachXBT, he got those names after speaking with many people, and it turned out that some users were offered deals by Fukogoryushu. Vortex , an algorithmic market maker and token adviser, confirmed that Fukogoryushu reached out to them before the OM crash with a request to provide a loan against his position. While it doesn’t show any sign of wrongdoing, it adds another layer of suspicion on their intentions. Exchange dumps and on-chain suspicion More red flags have emerged from blockchain data. According to analytics shared by Lookonchain on X , at least 43.6 million OM tokens, representing 4.5% of the total circulating supply, were deposited into exchanges by 17 wallets ahead of the crash. Two of those wallets were reportedly linked to Laser Digital, a crypto investor that backs Mantra. Arkham Intelligence data shows one of these wallets deposited over $41 million worth of OM to crypto exchange OKX on April 11. However, Laser Digital released a statement on X denying any wrongdoing, saying, “Laser has no involvement in the recent price collapse of $OM…” They also wrote, “As part of our core investment in Mantra, we want to clarify that Laser Digital has not sold any tokens we are due to receive.” When asked about what he thought was the involvement of Laser Digital and Shorooq in the crash of OM, ZachXBT said that they weren’t the culprits based on his findings. He also added, “However, I do not know the extent of how much the Mantra team knew about the actions of Denko.” Meanwhile, speculation has also turned inward, with some community members questioning whether Mantra CEO and co-founder John Patrick Mullin and the project team were aware of, or complicit in, the token’s sudden downturn. In an official statement , Mantra attempted to distance itself from the incident, stating that the actions that caused OM’s dramatic dip were reckless liquidations which had nothing to do with the project. They added, “One thing we want to be clear on: this was not our team.” Still, many investors remain unconvinced, and what becomes of the token and blockchain looks to be seen in the near future.As of the time of writing this story, Denko and Fukoguryushu had not released any statement on the matter.

A local court in China recently sentenced nine Chinese fraudsters to prison terms ranging from five to fourteen years. They targeted Indians for USDT fraud, defrauding a total of 66,800 Indians of about US$6 million. https://t.co/IU2hI9GjJj — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 14, 2025 The scheme , meticulously crafted and executed between June 2023 and January 2024, stole ₹517 million, roughly $6.2 million, using fabricated investment platforms, manipulated online identities, and the lure of romance. How a Chinese Fraud Empire Was Destroyed At the center of the operation was a man identified only by his surname, He, who, according to court documents, rented office space in Heze, Shandong Province, in May 2023 to launch what would become one of the most organized and professionally run scams in recent history. He recruited a team of fraudsters, leased overseas servers to mask their digital footprint, and acted as the central coordinator between the group and Indian companies. His main responsibilities included fund supervision and capital laundering through complex crypto conversion routes. The fraudulent operation ran under the guise of a bogus investment platform called SENEE, which offered suspiciously high monthly returns of 8% to 15% on deposits as low as ₹1,000 (~$12). Victims were primarily Indian men, approached through popular chat and social media platforms by female personas portrayed as affluent, self-made Indian women with successful investment backgrounds. To appear legitimate, the scammers fabricated elaborate online personas with geo-tagged photos of Indian cities, curated lifestyle content, and emotionally appealing backstories. When the deposits exceeded the promised returns, the group swiftly moved to shut down the platform or “convert” the funds into equity, freezing user access and locking away the money. These proceeds were then laundered through third-party platforms and converted into Tether’s USDT, a stablecoin known for its global liquidity. The USDT was then swapped into Chinese yuan or U.S. dollars, with the group reportedly taking a 15% cut from each transaction. The Chinese court described the operation as a “professional criminal syndicate” with clearly defined roles, a profit-sharing system, and advanced operational security. The sentences ranged from five to nearly fifteen years in prison, accompanied by financial penalties. Presiding judge Liu Xilei warned of China’s increasing efforts to crack down on telecom and online fraud and urged perpetrators to surrender voluntarily. You might also like Chinese Couple Arrested in Thailand for Massive Crypto Scam, Kidnapping Thailand and Cambodia Linked Cases Reveal Wider Web Amid Cross-Border Crackdowns This high-profile Chinese-Indian scam appears part of a broader and growing transnational trend, with strikingly similar methods seen in neighboring Southeast Asia. In March 2024, Thai police arrested two Chinese nationals, Wu Di and her boyfriend, Zhou Zongyon , in a luxury villa in Pattaya, Thailand, for a parallel crypto scam and kidnapping operation. As a friendly investor posing on Facebook, Wu ran a crypto con that defrauded victims of over 600 million baht ($17.7 million) in just two months. The scam mimicked the SENEE model, enticing victims with small early payouts before locking larger deposits. One Thai teacher reportedly lost 1.5 million baht after falling into this trap. Upon Wu’s arrest, officers uncovered images on her phone showcasing lavish living, luxury cars, wads of cash, and even drugs. Her travel history revealed regular trips between Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Wu and Zhou’s arrest wasn’t an isolated event. Just days later, a joint Thailand-China raid busted another crypto fraud operation run by two more Chinese nationals , Ye Wanyou and Li Weijie, living in a luxury apartment in Bangkok. Joint operation busts Chinese scammers in Thailand, seizing $2.5M USDT and uncovering human trafficking links. #Thailand #China #crypto https://t.co/r2ZecvysTV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 11, 2025 Acting on intelligence, the Huamark Police Station and the Police Cyber Taskforce (PCT) raided the premises and confiscated $44,550 in initial assets. The suspects were caught trying to erase their mobile phone data but were stopped in time. Upon deeper investigation in collaboration with Chinese authorities, they discovered hidden crypto wallets holding 2.5 million USDT, which were promptly frozen. As crypto adoption rises across Asia, so does its exploitation by organized criminal networks. These operations stretch across borders, using crypto for both fraud and laundering and often intertwining with human trafficking, identity theft, and cyber manipulation. And despite the millions recovered and the recent wave of arrests, authorities admit they’ve only scratched the surface of a much larger, murkier web operating across Asia.

After months of consolidation, the leading digital asset broke above its multi-month descending trendline and rallied 2.22%, only to hit a hard ceiling at $85,000—the exact point that aligns with its 200-day Exponential Moving Average and daily resistance. It’s now hovering near $84,000, holding tension between confirmation and correction. A break and close above $85K would unlock a potential move toward $90K and maybe even a run to retest $95K. Until then, the Relative Strength Index sitting flat at 50 paints a picture of indecision. For those tracking the top cryptos to buy this month , Bitcoin remains the cornerstone. If it moves, the market listens. Meanwhile, XRP is staging a recovery of its own. After a sharp 14.28% rise that reclaimed its 200-day EMA at $1.95, XRP retested its April 2 high of $2.23. It now consolidates around $2.14. That $2.23 resistance? It’s more than a line—it’s a pivot. A breakout could see XRP retesting its March 24 high of $2.50. The daily RSI currently sits right at 50, pushing upward, suggesting that bearish momentum is finally wearing off. If XRP confirms above its resistance, it could set off a ripple effect in altcoin sentiment. Among the top cryptos to buy this month , XRP brings one of the cleanest setups on the chart. While Bitcoin and XRP dominate headlines, one project has quietly surged into the spotlight with its unmatched presale structure and ROI-backed momentum. That project is Qubetics ($TICS) —an emerging Layer 1 platform offering a real-world solution to cross-border transaction problems. Qubetics is designed not for speculation, but for application. Its tools are built for businesses, professionals, and global users who demand low fees, fast settlements, and seamless interoperability. And that’s just the beginning of why Qubetics leads this list of top cryptos to buy this month . Qubetics ($TICS): Cross-Border Transactions Made Practical and Profitable Qubetics isn’t here to be trendy. It’s here to be useful. With a focus on cross-border transaction capabilities , Qubetics has developed a framework that eliminates bottlenecks in global payments. For businesses, this means quicker invoice settlements across regions without the headaches of third-party processors. For professionals, it unlocks seamless contract payments across jurisdictions. And for individuals, it offers cheaper, faster international transfers than anything on traditional rails. The backbone of this utility is its architecture. Built with enterprise-grade throughput and designed to handle real traffic, Qubetics is positioning itself to be the go-to protocol for interoperable, compliant, and scalable finance. This isn’t just about building a new chain. It’s about building one that actually solves something. Presale Status and ROI Potential for Entry-Stage Participants Right now, the Qubetics presale is in Stage 30 , with over 507 million tokens sold and more than 24,700 early adopters on board . The platform has already raised $16.1 million , and $TICS tokens are available at $0.1729 . Those who jumped in during Stage 1 at $0.01 are already looking at a 1629% return . But even at Stage 30, the numbers tell a story that’s hard to ignore. $TICS at $1 offers a 477% return. If it hits $5, that climbs to 2789%. At $6, the ROI jumps to 3367%. $10 represents a 5678% gain. And a $15 mainnet launch value delivers a staggering 8567% ROI. This isn’t hype—it’s based on actual presale performance and growing adoption. That’s why Qubetics is considered the best crypto presale in 2025 and a major contender in the top cryptos to buy this month . Why is Qubetics topping the list? Because it’s got product, traction, and timing—and those three rarely show up together. XRP: Holding Structure with Breakout Eyes on $2.50 XRP is back in the spotlight, and for good reason. After breaking through its 200-day EMA at $1.95 , the token retraced briefly but held the line. By Sunday, XRP retested its April 2 high of $2.23 , and now it’s cruising near $2.14 . That resistance level at $2.23? It’s more than a ceiling—it’s the key to opening the next run toward $2.50 , which marks XRP’s high from late March. What’s supporting this potential breakout is momentum. The RSI sits at 50 , and it’s pointing up. A move above this midpoint confirms the bulls are gaining traction. A breakdown below the 200-day EMA, however, could send the token back toward $1.77 , its next key support. XRP has weathered market downturns, regulatory headwinds, and sentiment swings. But it’s still standing, and right now, it’s technically primed. Among the top cryptos to buy this month , XRP offers both history and short-term setup—something few assets can claim. Why does XRP make this list? Because structure, support, and momentum are aligning—and that doesn’t happen by accident. Bitcoin: $85K on Watch, Market Eyes on the King Bitcoin broke above its long-standing descending trendline last week, giving it room to breathe and rally. That push led to a 2.22% gain , with BTC testing a stiff resistance at $85,000 —a confluence point tied to both the 200-day EMA and major horizontal resistance. Currently, it’s sitting at $84,000 , creating a high-stakes zone. A close above $85K could confirm the breakout and trigger a move to $90K , or even $95K if sentiment accelerates. But the warning signs are also clear. If BTC fails to break out, price could slide back toward the next daily support at $73,072 . With the RSI flatlining at 50 , the market is undecided. But that kind of calm before the storm typically doesn’t last long. Bitcoin is the one to watch—not just because of its market cap, but because everything else follows its rhythm. That alone earns it a spot on the top cryptos to buy this month list. Why does Bitcoin stay relevant here? Because when it moves, the rest of the market reacts—and this setup is reaching a boiling point. Final Thoughts Crypto doesn’t wait around for permission. When setups align, the best plays don’t stick around—they get picked clean by those who know how to read the board. This month, the smart money is looking closely at Qubetics , XRP , and Bitcoin . Qubetics is delivering real-world payment utility and serious ROI through a presale model that’s still open but moving fast. XRP offers one of the sharpest short-term breakouts across the majors, and Bitcoin is at a resistance level that could shift momentum market-wide. These aren’t just coins with upside. They’re tools, signals, and strategic levers for those planning more than hoping. Stage 30 of the Qubetics presale is still active. But when it closes, so does the easy entry.

The bill reportedly contains several clauses that cover issuance and distribution protocols for both stablecoins and cryptoassets. The draft law also seeks to impose disclosure protocols on stablecoin issuers. These would oblige force stablecoin firms to demonstrate evidence that they hold cash or other assets equivalent to the number of tokens they issue. Min’s law also proposes the launch of a self-regulatory body to police stablecoins and cryptoassets in South Korea. Critics said it would be “unfair” to saddle domestic companies with regulations, while overseas firms can continue “operating unhindered.” One unnamed crypto industry insider said: “Dollar-pegged stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) are not subject to domestic regulations. But they are actively traded on domestic crypto exchanges . That is unfair [on South Korean companies]. Regulations should be designed in a way that provides opportunities rather than stifles the industry.” ‘MiCA Not a Relevant Benchmark for South Korea’ Another industry insider claimed that Min’s bill appears to have used the European Union’s MiCA regulations as a reference point.

Stablecoins also need a realistic institutionalization strategy. This is not an issue that can be resolved over the course of a few meetings.” The post South Korean Crypto Industry Smarts at Stablecoin Regulation Plans appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|News|South Korea|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-14 23:30:00

Canada is poised to become a frontrunner in cryptocurrency investment by approving spot Solana Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). This landmark decision not only broadens access to the booming Solana ecosystem but also introduces an innovative staking feature through one of Canada’s banking giants, Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). Let’s dive into what this means for investors and the future of crypto ETFs. Canada ETF Market Welcomes Spot Solana ETFs The Canadian regulatory landscape is proving to be increasingly welcoming to digital assets. Following the successful launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, regulators have now given the green light to Spot Solana ETFs . According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, several prominent issuers including Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ have received approval. This move positions Canada as one of the first jurisdictions globally to offer such a product, demonstrating a progressive stance on cryptocurrency investments. Key Highlights of Canada’s Spot Solana ETF Approval: Multiple Issuers Approved: Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ are among the first to launch these innovative ETFs. Staking Support: A unique feature of these ETFs is the staking mechanism facilitated through Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD). Regulatory Green Light: Canadian regulators are showing a proactive approach to integrating digital assets into traditional finance. Accessibility: This approval makes Solana investment more accessible to a wider range of investors through regulated and familiar investment vehicles. Why is a Solana ETF a Game Changer? The introduction of a Solana ETF is a significant leap forward for both Solana and the broader cryptocurrency market. ETFs provide a regulated, accessible, and potentially less volatile way for investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Here’s why this development is particularly noteworthy: Simplified Investment: ETFs trade on stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This simplifies the investment process compared to directly purchasing and managing Solana tokens. Reduced Custodial Risk: Investors don’t need to worry about the complexities and security risks associated with storing Solana in digital wallets. The ETF provider handles custody. Potential for Broader Adoption: ETFs can attract institutional investors and retail investors who are hesitant to directly engage with crypto due to regulatory uncertainties or technical complexities. Diversification: For portfolio diversification, a Solana ETF offers exposure to the Solana ecosystem without requiring direct management of the asset. Unlocking Staking Rewards: The TD Bank Crypto Advantage What sets these Canada ETF offerings apart is the integration of staking. Solana staking is the process of participating in the network’s validation to earn rewards. By holding a spot Solana ETF that supports staking, investors can potentially earn passive income on their investment. The fact that Toronto-Dominion Bank ( TD Bank crypto ), a major Canadian financial institution, is involved in facilitating the staking process adds a layer of credibility and security. Benefits of Staking Through Solana ETFs: Passive Income: Earn staking rewards without directly managing staking processes. Compounding Returns: Staking rewards can potentially enhance the overall returns of the ETF over time. Institutional Grade Staking: Leveraging TD Bank’s infrastructure for staking provides a secure and reliable mechanism. Transparency and Regulation: Staking within a regulated ETF structure offers greater transparency and investor protection. The Impact on Solana and the Crypto Ecosystem The approval of Spot Solana ETFs in Canada is expected to have a ripple effect across the cryptocurrency landscape. For Solana specifically, this development could: Increase Demand for Solana: As ETFs become available, increased investment could drive demand for Solana tokens. Enhance Solana’s Legitimacy: Listing on traditional exchanges via ETFs further legitimizes Solana as a significant player in the crypto space. Boost Ecosystem Growth: Increased investment can fuel further development and innovation within the Solana ecosystem. Set a Global Precedent: Canada’s approval may encourage other countries to consider similar products, potentially accelerating the adoption of crypto ETFs worldwide. Potential Challenges and Considerations: While the approval of spot Solana ETFs is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, including Solana, are known for their volatility. ETF investors need to be aware of these market risks. Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving, and future changes could impact ETFs. Staking Risks: While TD Bank is involved, staking inherently carries some risks, including potential slashing (loss of staked tokens due to validator misbehavior), although these are typically mitigated in ETF structures. Tracking Error: ETFs may not perfectly track the price of Solana due to fees, operational costs, and market dynamics. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors considering Solana ETF investments in Canada, here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence: Research the different ETF issuers (Purpose, Evolve, CI, 3iQ) and understand their fee structures and specific ETF details. Understand Staking Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how staking works within the ETF and the potential rewards and associated risks. Assess Risk Tolerance: Consider your risk tolerance and investment goals before investing in a volatile asset like Solana, even through an ETF. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments are often best viewed with a long-term horizon. Consider the long-term potential of Solana and the crypto market. Diversification Strategy: Integrate Solana ETFs as part of a diversified investment portfolio, rather than putting all your eggs in one basket. Conclusion: A Transformative Step for Crypto Investment Canada’s approval of spot Solana ETFs with staking support via TD Bank is a transformative development for the cryptocurrency market. It marks a significant step towards mainstream adoption, offering investors a regulated, accessible, and innovative way to engage with Solana. As these ETFs launch this week, all eyes will be on their performance and the broader impact they have on the crypto investment landscape. This move not only benefits Solana but also reinforces Canada’s position as a forward-thinking nation in the digital asset revolution.

43347530,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149261,1744674053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Shocking SEC Delay: Ethereum ETF Staking Decision for Grayscale Postponed, Igniting Crypto Uncertainty",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-etf-staking-sec-delay/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just thrown a curveball into the highly anticipated world of spot Ethereum ETF s. News has broken via Solid Intel on X (formerly Twitter) that the SEC has decided to delay its verdict on whether Grayscale Investments can offer staking within its proposed spot Ethereum ETF. This development has sent ripples of uncertainty through the crypto market, leaving investors wondering what’s next for Ethereum and the broader ETF landscape. Let’s dive into what this delay means and what it could signify for the future of crypto investments. What Does the SEC Delay on Grayscale’s Spot Ethereum ETF Mean? For those unfamiliar, a spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a financial product that would allow investors to gain exposure to the price of Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. Think of it like investing in gold through a gold ETF, but for Ethereum. The ‘spot’ aspect means the ETF’s value is directly tied to the current market price of Ethereum. Now, the staking part adds another layer of complexity. Crypto staking involves holding and ‘locking up’ your cryptocurrency to support the operations of a blockchain network, and in return, you earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional savings account. Grayscale, in its proposal, wanted to potentially offer staking within its spot Ethereum ETF, which could provide an additional yield for ETF holders. The SEC’s delay means they are not yet ready to approve or reject Grayscale’s proposal. This isn’t a rejection, but it definitely pushes back the timeline for a decision. Here’s a breakdown of what this delay signifies: Extended Review Period: The SEC needs more time to evaluate the intricacies of staking within a spot Ethereum ETF. This could be due to various factors, including regulatory concerns, market volatility, and investor protection. Increased Uncertainty: The delay injects uncertainty into the market. Investors who were hopeful about a swift approval are now left waiting, and this uncertainty can impact market sentiment and potentially Ethereum’s price. Regulatory Scrutiny: It highlights the ongoing intense regulatory scrutiny that the crypto industry faces in the U.S. The SEC is taking a cautious approach, especially with novel financial products like spot crypto ETFs that incorporate staking. Why the SEC Might Be Hesitating on Ethereum ETF Staking? Several factors could be contributing to the SEC’s cautious stance and the subsequent SEC delay . Understanding these potential reasons can offer valuable insights: Novelty and Complexity of Staking: Staking is a relatively new concept compared to traditional financial instruments. The SEC might be grappling with how to regulate and oversee staking within an ETF structure, ensuring investor protection and market integrity. Custodial Risks: Who would be responsible for the staking process and the custody of the staked Ethereum within the ETF? The SEC needs to be confident in the security and reliability of the custodial arrangements. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators are always wary of potential market manipulation. They might be assessing if staking within an ETF could create new avenues for manipulation or unfair practices. Investor Protection Mandate: The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors. They need to ensure that a spot Ethereum ETF with staking is a safe and transparent investment product for the average investor. Precedent Setting: Approving staking in a spot Ethereum ETF would set a precedent for future crypto ETFs. The SEC likely wants to tread carefully and establish a robust regulatory framework before giving the green light. Grayscale’s Spot Ethereum ETF: A Pioneer in Crypto Investment? Grayscale Investments is a major player in the crypto asset management space, and their push for a spot Grayscale ETF is significant. They were instrumental in converting their Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF, paving the way for other issuers. Their attempt to launch a spot Ethereum ETF with staking showcases their ambition to further bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto world. Grayscale argues that a spot Ethereum ETF would offer investors a regulated and accessible way to invest in Ethereum. Adding staking to the mix could make it even more attractive by providing potential yield. However, this added feature is what is likely causing the current regulatory bottleneck. Benefits of a Spot Ethereum ETF with Staking (Hypothetical) While the SEC delay is a setback, it’s worth considering the potential benefits that a spot Ethereum ETF with staking could offer if eventually approved: Benefit Description Simplified Ethereum Exposure Investors can gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without the complexities of buying, storing, and securing ETH directly. Potential Yield Generation Staking within the ETF could generate passive income for investors in the form of staking rewards, enhancing returns. Accessibility and Liquidity ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a wider range of investors and offering high liquidity. Regulatory Oversight (Once Approved) An SEC-approved ETF would provide a layer of regulatory oversight and investor protection, potentially making crypto investment more palatable for institutional and retail investors. Tax Advantages (Potentially) Investing through an ETF can sometimes offer tax advantages compared to directly holding cryptocurrencies, depending on the jurisdiction. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors The SEC delay regarding Grayscale’s spot Ethereum ETF is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles in the crypto space. So, what should investors do amidst this uncertainty? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments regarding the SEC’s decision and Grayscale’s ETF. Follow reputable crypto news sources and regulatory updates. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto investments across different assets and strategies to mitigate risk. Understand the Risks: Crypto investments are inherently volatile and risky. Understand the risks involved before investing, and only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Regulatory processes can be lengthy. Focus on the long-term potential of Ethereum and the broader crypto market rather than short-term price fluctuations driven by news events. Explore Alternative Investment Options: While waiting for spot Ethereum ETFs, consider other ways to gain exposure to Ethereum, such as direct ETH purchases, staking through other platforms (with caution and due diligence), or investing in companies involved in the Ethereum ecosystem. Conclusion: The Waiting Game for Ethereum ETF Staking Continues The SEC delay on Grayscale’s spot Ethereum ETF staking decision is undoubtedly a setback for those eagerly anticipating this innovative financial product. It underscores the ongoing regulatory complexities and the SEC’s cautious approach to crypto-related investment vehicles. While the delay introduces uncertainty, it also highlights the SEC’s commitment to thorough evaluation and investor protection. The future of spot Ethereum ETFs with staking remains in the balance, and the crypto community will be watching closely for the SEC’s next move.

According to a report made public on Monday, the apps belong to unreported foreign crypto operators. The banned exchanges allegedly operated as unregistered overseas virtual asset operators. Crypto exchanges KuCoin and MEXC are among the firms targeted by the regulator, and domestic access to their apps has been blocked since April 11. South Korea tightens regulations on unreported virtual asset operators Foreign virtual asset business operators who intend to operate in South Korea are required to report to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. FIU noted that unreported business activities are subject to criminal punishment. The regulator has been targeting overseas unreported virtual asset operators conducting domestic business activities without reporting (16 companies in 2022, 6 companies in 2023) while blocking domestic access through internet sites and mobile phone apps. South Korea has been moving to block crypto providers that are operating illegally. The move to block apps on the Apple Store follows a similar action by Google Play on March 26, which restricted access to several unregistered exchanges. KuCoin and MEXC were also among the platforms targeted in Google’s crackdown. The FSC has published a list of 22 unregistered platforms operating in South Korea, with 17 already blocked on Google Play. The FSC report states that users will no longer be able to download the apps from the Apple Store, and existing users will be unable to update them. The report also highlights that operating without proper registration is considered a criminal offense, with penalties including up to five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million won ($35,200). At the end of March, South Korean publication Hankyung reported that the FIU and the FSC were considering sanctions against crypto exchanges operating in the country without registration with local regulators. The sanctions included blocking access to the companies’ apps. In South Korea, crypto sales, brokerage, management, and storage operators must report to the FIU. Failure to comply with registration and reports is subject to penalties and sanctions. Crypto adoption in South Korea hits 30% of the population, driving regulatory action The new sanctions arrive as cryptocurrency usage in South Korea nears a “saturation point.” By March 31, the country’s number of crypto exchange users had exceeded 16 million, representing more than 30% of the population. Industry experts project that this figure could surpass 20 million by the end of 2025. Moving forward, FIU has committed to continuing to block domestic access through mobile applications (apps) and Internet sites of overseas unreported virtual asset operators. This initiative aims to mitigate money laundering risks and user damage in consultation with relevant organizations. With almost a third of South Korea’s population engaged in crypto trading, institutional involvement could further boost market liquidity and growth. FSC Vice Chairman Kim So-young acknowledged the increasing pace of international crypto adoption, particularly in response to policy shifts in the US.

43348115,https://cryptonews.com/?p=351050,1744675188,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43348115.jpeg,"Vitalik Buterin Calls for Stronger Privacy in Web3, Citing Rising Data Risks",https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-advocates-for-stronger-privacy-in-web3/,"Key Takeaways: Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin argued that privacy must become a built-in feature of decentralized systems to protect users from growing surveillance threats. He pointed to advanced cryptographic tools like ZK-proofs and homomorphic encryption as essential to protecting data. His recent roadmap proposes wallet-level and network-level privacy features for Ethereum without altering its Layer-1 consensus. Privacy, according to Buterin, should be viewed as a pillar of freedom and resilience in Web3—not a technical afterthought. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a new article titled “Why I Support Privacy” on Monday, in which he urged the Web3 community to treat privacy as a core part of decentralization, amid growing concerns over AI-driven surveillance and data misuse. Buterin’s essay outlined the philosophical, technical, and social arguments for embedding privacy at the foundation of Web3 design, as artificial intelligence and large-scale data harvesting have started eroding personal autonomy and civil liberties. Why I support privacy: https://t.co/4Um4QdnTqG — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) April 14, 2025 He explained that his shift toward privacy advocacy stemmed from a core belief: information is power—and when that power becomes centralized, it risks distorting democratic balance. Recent advances in cryptography, combined with increasingly sophisticated AI systems, have made the call for stronger privacy more urgent than ever. Buterin emphasized that privacy today is about more than just hiding secrets—it is about maintaining personal agency in systems that are trending toward surveillance by default. He named fully homomorphic encryption, ZK-proofs, and code obfuscation as foundational tools for developers to build privacy-preserving decentralized systems. Why Vitalik Buterin Sees Privacy as Essential to Freedom In his article, Buterin framed privacy as a basic component of freedom in the digital age. He referenced the early 2000s optimism around transparency—such as David Brin’s The Transparent Society and Scott McNealy’s infamous “privacy is dead” comment—and argued that such views had aged poorly. Instead of promoting fairness, he wrote, transparency has increasingly allowed powerful institutions to operate without oversight, while individuals lose control over their own lives. To illustrate this shift, Buterin shared a personal experience: he was filmed in Chiang Mai while using his laptop, and the video was later circulated online. Source: vitalik.eth.limo Although the incident may have seemed minor, it illustrated how easily personal moments can be captured and spread without consent. He warned that this kind of hyper-visibility, once limited to celebrities or public figures, now extends to anyone—especially those vulnerable due to their job, opinions, or unexpected exposure. In a future where AI can comb through years of digital records , even seemingly harmless data can be weaponized. Buterin also criticized the idea that national security justifies access to private data. He warned that building backdoors—even for well-intentioned reasons—creates long-term risks of abuse, corruption, and unchecked power. The scale of data being collected today, he wrote, dwarfs that of previous generations, and the potential for harm has grown accordingly. Integrating Privacy Into Decentralized Systems On April 11, Buterin released a roadmap outlining how Ethereum could build in stronger privacy protections without modifying its Layer-1 consensus model. @VitalikButerin proposes a new Ethereum privacy roadmap, aiming to integrate seamless privacy features into the blockchain without overhauling its core. #Ethereum #Privacy https://t.co/dT4wYxA2Ju — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 11, 2025 The roadmap focused on four areas: anonymous payments, privacy at the application level, secure data reads, and obfuscation at the network layer. He suggested that wallets adopt tools like Railgun and Privacy Pools to create “shielded balances,” enabling private-by-default transactions. Additionally, Buterin advocated for generating a unique address per dApp to prevent linkability and for supporting standards such as FOCIL and EIP-7701 to reduce reliance on public transaction relays. With this roadmap, Buterin reinforced his belief that privacy should be a design principle—not a secondary consideration—in building resilient Web3 systems. Buterin’s ongoing influence over Ethereum’s direction highlights how Vitalik Buterin continues shaping the blockchain’s approach to individual privacy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How can decentralized platforms improve personal data protection? They help shield data by encrypting transactions, segmenting user identities, and reducing record linkages. Academic studies affirm these methods boost privacy and secure user interactions in distributed networks. What additional measures strengthen privacy in digital interactions? Decentralized networks secure data by using layered encryption, strict transaction isolation, and continuous monitoring of digital flows. Expert analyses indicate such measures lower risks of unauthorized data access. How might enhanced privacy reshape the future of digital rights?

But, while XRP is enjoying the buzz, a new contender Ruvi AI (RUVI) is fast becoming the favorite among early adopters. This innovative project is wowing investors with 100x gains during the presale. Ruvi AI stands out with blockchain and AI combined to deliver real use cases. The presale is packed with exclusive rewards and incentives and is one of the hottest opportunities in crypto. What sets Ruvi AI apart? Ruvi AI changes the game for blockchain and AI by creating a platform where users can generate text, images, videos and even audio using advanced AI tools. It’s more than just an altcoin, it’s a project with real utility to solve real world problems. By offering functionality for content creators, businesses and individuals Ruvi AI has the edge over many other projects in the market today. The $RUVI token powers the entire ecosystem, users can access premium features and governance and stake for rewards. And the presale is a great opportunity to get in early on this game changing project that’s already set to disrupt the industry. Rewards that multiply your investment Ruvi AI’s presale introduces a VIP Tier Rewards system where investors can multiply their holdings based on the size of their initial purchase. Investors buying more during the presale get additional bonus tokens, effectively multiplying their gains. For example, investing at least $5,000 gets you 500,000 RUVI and with the VIP 5 bonus another 500,000 tokens , effectively doubling the amount of tokens purchased and sets the stage for huge gains at Ruvi’s launch considering it’s projected price of $0,07 per token. At this point, the initial $5,000 investment skyrockets to $70,000 right out of the gate. Ruvi AI’s Leaderboard Rewards takes it to the next level by rewarding the top contributors during the presale. Investors in the top 10 by total contribution get a 500,000 token bonus , those in the top 50 to top 200 get additional token rewards. Even Top 1000 investors are rewarded with 20,000 tokens. This creates a sense of competition and makes the presale more exciting for those looking to maximize their stakes. Beta Release is Real World Proof Unlike many crypto projects that promise future utility Ruvi AI is already showing off its functional capabilities with its Beta release . Users can interact with the platform, try out the AI tools, generate content and experience the seamless blockchain integration at its core. This early release gives investors confidence, it’s proof of Ruvi’s commitment to its roadmap and readiness for adoption. Analysts have called the Beta release a major milestone that shows Ruvi AI can deliver on its promises making it a standout investment in a market full of unproven ideas. 100x Gains The buzz around Ruvi AI isn’t just hype, it’s based on its potential for life changing returns. With a presale token price of $0.01 buying in bulk is both possible and smart. According to industry analysts, the token might easily hit at least $0.15 post launch which is a 1400% increase from presale levels. But the long term projections are even more exciting. Crypto experts believe Ruvi AI could reach $1 per token in the coming years. That’s a huge opportunity for early adopters. For example an initial investment of $1,000 gets you 100,000 RUVI during the presale. Considering the VIP 3 bonus tier that adds another 60,000 tokens and brings the total to 160,000 at $0.15 per token that’s $24,000 , and if the token reaches $1 those same tokens would be worth $160,000 . Ruvi AI’s use cases and adoption potential underpins those forecasts making it a great investment for those looking to get in on a high growth crypto project. Ruvi AI is the talk of the town While XRP is hot right now Ruvi AI is carving out its own space as a unique opportunity. Its blockchain and AI combination delivers real world utility and sets the stage for solutions in many industries. From its reward systems to its Beta release and ROI potential Ruvi AI has more excitement than most projects. The presale pricing and tiered bonuses add more value, so early adopters invest in technology and get extraordinary financial returns. For those looking for the next big crypto winner Ruvi AI is the one to watch. Don’t Miss Out The window to invest in Ruvi AI during the presale is closing fast as more people get in. With its competitive rewards system, innovative platform and Beta validation Ruvi AI could be one of the top projects in the coming years.

Pseudonymous trader Inmortal tells his 231,500 followers on the social media platform X that Solana appears to have set a massive bear trap earlier this month when the price of SOL briefly dropped below $100. A bear trap is a false signal that makes it appear that the price of an asset is heading to much lower levels, but instead, the price abruptly reverses and rallies, leaving short-sellers trapped. Says Inmortal, “That weekly candle is maybe the biggest bear trap I’ve ever seen, SOL.” Source: Inmortal/X The analyst now believes that SOL is setting the stage for strong rallies en route to a new all-time high of $340 by December 2025. “In retrospect, it will be so obvious, SOL.” Source: Inmortal/X At time of writing, Solana is trading for $128.19, down over 3% on the day. Looking at Bitcoin, Inmortal thinks that BTC will trade between $74,000 and $95,000 in the coming months before sparking a breakout rally toward the end of the year. “Expecting something like this: > Bounce to $90,000 > More chop/ranging ($67,000 maybe) > Uptrend in the second half of this year Maybe not in this exact order. BTC.” Source: Inmortal/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that Bitcoin will soar close to $130,000 by the end of 2025. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $84,943. Turning to the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), Inmortal thinks the altcoin is at a price level where it can potentially carve a major cycle bottom. “Accumulating more FLOKI at these levels. RSI (relative strength index) is at the same levels it was 700 days ago, and price at pre-bullrun levels.” Source: Inmortal/X The RSI is a momentum indicator that can help traders spot levels where an asset is oversold or overbought. At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000057.

That shift in sentiment isn’t limited to SUI. The Litecoin (LTC) price rally adds fuel to the broader market mood, climbing nearly 13% in a single day and narrowing weekly losses. Market confidence seems to be picking up across the board, and BlockDAG (BDAG) is a clear example. The project’s latest Keynote 3 broke down its layered approach to security—GhostDAG consensus, MPC protection, and audits from CertiK and Halborn—giving holders something solid to latch onto. Since then, the project’s presale has taken off, raising $214 million and drawing fresh attention as one of the most talked-about moves in the space. SUI Technical Outlook: Chart Structure Suggests Upside Potential The SUI technical outlook is currently shaped by a falling wedge formation that has been in play since mid-November 2024. Following a 28% drop from its recent high, SUI is testing support near the lower boundary of this pattern—a level that has historically triggered strong buyer activity. Monday’s intraday recovery of 5% highlights renewed demand after breaching the wedge support. Technical indicators, including a bullish divergence on the RSI and clustered EMAs between $2 and $2.82, suggest a possible short-term rally. If momentum holds, the SUI technical outlook could include a 13% rise before retesting upper resistance levels. Litecoin Price Rally Pushes Market Cap to $5.46 Billion The Litecoin (LTC) price rally has been gaining traction, with the asset rising nearly 13% recently to reach $71.94. This marked its strongest daily gain since mid-January, temporarily lifting its market capitalisation to $5.46 billion. The surge occurred despite Litecoin still being down over 82% from its all-time high of $420. Over the past week, the token experienced a 14% loss, trading between $63.51 and $88.48. However, the recent momentum in the Litecoin price rally has narrowed weekly losses, reflecting increased trading volume and renewed short-term interest across the broader crypto market. Inside BlockDAG’s Keynote: Security Architecture, Audits, & $214M Presale Surge BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 put the spotlight on its security and made it clear that the project isn’t cutting corners. Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj delivered a detailed look into how the system is designed to withstand attacks, tampering, and downtime from day one. “At BlockDAG, security is not a feature—it’s the bedrock upon which we’ve built everything,” he said. The GhostDAG protocol, which rethinks how consensus is achieved, plays a big part in that. Unlike traditional blockchains that treat forks as errors, GhostDAG processes them in parallel, reducing wasted energy and improving throughput. The keynote also introduced a layered security model that goes well beyond smart contract audits. Treasury operations are protected by Multi-Party Computation (MPC), ensuring transactions can’t go through without multiple layers of approval. To tighten things up, security audits by CertiK and Halborn have already been completed, with a full audit of the entire network scheduled before mainnet. These aren’t afterthoughts—they were described as core to the project’s identity. Following the keynote, confidence in BlockDAG’s direction picked up noticeably. The transparency around its infrastructure and long-term roadmap helped drive fresh momentum into the ongoing presale. Now in its 27th batch, BDAG has surged 2,380% from its starting price, reaching $0.0248 and over 19.2 billion coins already sold. Backed by $214 million in funding and counting, it’s quickly becoming one of the best cryptos for the future—and it hasn’t even hit the market yet. To Sum It Up The SUI technical outlook suggests traders may keep a close watch as it approaches key resistance, especially if momentum builds off recent support. The Litecoin (LTC) price rally shows that older, established assets still have room to move when conditions align. But it’s BlockDAG that’s drawing the biggest wave of interest. Its recent Keynote 3 outlined a clear security-first approach: GhostDAG enhances consensus speed and safety, MPC safeguards treasury operations, and third-party audits by CertiK and Halborn strengthen credibility. Market trust and interest surged following the announcement. The presale has already crossed $214 million, and over 19.2 billion coins have been sold. Experts say rhe BDAG coin is currently the best crypto for the future , and if the current pace holds, those buying BlockDAG at $0.0248 could reap huge returns post-mainnet launch this year.

ADA is flirting with a breakout setup, while SOL is bouncing hard off recent lows, jumping 20% thanks to external policy shifts. These moves have reignited interest in top Layer-1s. Still, BlockDAG is moving differently—and faster. With its presale crossing $214 million and a 600% Golden Ticket bonus now live via the BDAG1200 code, BlockDAG isn’t just catching attention—it’s becoming the standard. With its 7th AMA coming up on April 17th and the debut Global Convention on the calendar, this project is pulling ahead with real power. Cardano Eyes Breakout, Traders Watching $0.64 Level Closely Cardano has been steadily gaining this week, pushing up 12% in just a few days after rebounding from strong support at $0.537. It’s now trading near $0.61, and traders are laser-focused on a potential move above $0.64. If that resistance breaks, ADA could rally toward $0.66—but if not, it risks slipping back to $0.509 or even $0.456. Still, momentum is building, and sentiment is shifting in Cardano’s favor. With governance improvements and scaling upgrades in the pipeline, long-term holders are keeping their faith. But for now, ADA’s next move hinges on breaking that resistance. Solana Rockets 20% on Policy News, but the Trend Still Has Work to Do Solana delivered a surprise this week with a powerful 20% rally, driven by news of Trump’s tariff delay that injected fresh optimism into tech and digital assets. SOL is now back above $115, reclaiming lost ground—but not without caution. Technical resistance looms between $120 and $125. Analysts say breaking above that zone could confirm a broader reversal. Until then, Solana still trades under its key moving averages and sits below its Q1 highs. But this recent move has reignited buzz around Layer-1s—and that spotlight is now shifting hard toward BlockDAG. BlockDAG Hits $214M, Launches 600% Bonus, & Preps for AMA 7 Cardano and Solana might be on the move, but BlockDAG is executing a next-level campaign fueled by delivery, scale, and community growth. The presale has surged past $214 million with zero VC funding, and new users can still claim a 600% bonus using the BDAG1200 code—one of the most generous deals in any active presale. CEO Antony Turner is set to host BlockDAG’s 7th AMA on April 17th, and insiders expect major updates on listings, partnerships, and the global roadmap. Meanwhile, the team has confirmed its first-ever BlockDAG Global Convention, open to new users with priority invites. This shift from digital to real-world connection is a bold move that very few Layer-1s have pulled off. What powers all this? BlockDAG’s tech. It combines Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with Proof-of-Work (PoW), offering parallel processing and instant scalability. Mainnet is launching with 2,000 TPS and will ramp up to 15,000 TPS within two years—blazing fast compared to many leading networks. It’s not just talk. The X1 Miner App and Tap-to-Earn game have already brought in more than 1.1 million users. That’s real traction. Security is locked in, too. Audits are underway with Certik and Halborn, and treasury funds are protected by MPC-level security. The launch roadmap includes full DeFi integration, governance modules, and listings on over 10 major exchanges. BlockDAG isn’t just aiming for the top 10—it’s building for it. Key Highlights! Cardano is working on a breakout, Solana just bounced hard, and both are drawing short-term attention. But BlockDAG is building a complete story—with real users, real momentum, and a blueprint that’s turning early buyers into long-term believers. With $214 million raised, a 600% bonus still active, and two huge events just around the corner, BlockDAG is more than just another hot presale—it’s shaping up to be one of the most important crypto stories of 2025. For those still undecided, the clock is ticking. BlockDAG’s window is wide open—but not for long.

Just as crypto markets experience volatility, the traditional financial world is seeing significant shifts. The US dollar, a cornerstone of global finance, is experiencing a notable downturn. After a historic selloff, the dollar bearish trend accelerates , sending ripples across the forex market and beyond. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio and the broader economic landscape? Let’s dive deep into understanding this critical development. Why is the Dollar Bearish Trend Gaining Momentum? The dollar bearish trend isn’t a sudden event; it’s a culmination of various economic factors and global shifts. Understanding these drivers is crucial to navigating the current market landscape. Here are some key reasons behind the dollar’s recent weakness: Economic Data Disappointments: Recent US economic data has painted a less rosy picture than anticipated. From weaker-than-expected jobs reports to cooling inflation figures, indicators suggest a potential slowdown in the US economy. This dampens investor enthusiasm for the dollar as a safe-haven asset. Federal Reserve Policy: While the Federal Reserve has been hawkish in its approach to combat inflation, future rate hike expectations are being tempered. Market participants are increasingly pricing in a potential pause or even reversal in rate hikes as economic growth concerns mount. This shift in monetary policy expectations weighs heavily on the dollar. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global geopolitical tensions, while sometimes boosting the dollar’s safe-haven appeal, can also contribute to its weakness. Specific events and evolving international relationships can influence currency valuations, adding complexity to the dollar bearish trend . Strength in Other Currencies: The dollar’s weakness isn’t happening in isolation. We’re seeing renewed strength in other major currencies like the Euro and the British Pound. Improved economic outlooks or hawkish central bank policies in these regions can make their currencies more attractive relative to the dollar. Decoding the Historic Dollar Selloff: What Happened? The term ‘historic selloff’ isn’t used lightly. The recent period has seen a significant and rapid depreciation of the US dollar against a basket of other currencies. But what exactly triggered this dollar selloff accelerates scenario? Factor Description Impact on Dollar Inflation Concerns Easing (Slightly) While inflation remains elevated, recent data suggests a potential moderation in price pressures. This reduces the urgency for aggressive Fed rate hikes, weakening dollar support. Negative Regional Banking Stress Concerns about the health of regional banks in the US have resurfaced periodically. While contained, these worries can erode confidence in the US financial system and the dollar. Negative Debt Ceiling Debates (Recurring) Political standoffs surrounding the US debt ceiling, though often resolved, introduce uncertainty and can temporarily dent dollar appeal. Negative (Short-term) Global Growth Divergence While the US economy faces potential headwinds, some other economies are showing resilience or improvement. This divergence can lead to capital flows away from the dollar. Negative USD Weakness: Implications for the Forex Market and Beyond The USD weakness has far-reaching consequences that extend beyond just currency trading. For cryptocurrency investors and those watching the global economy, understanding these implications is vital: Forex Market Volatility: A weaker dollar often leads to increased volatility in the forex market. Currency pairs involving the USD can experience significant price swings, creating both opportunities and risks for traders. Commodity Price Impact: Many commodities are priced in US dollars. A weaker dollar can make commodities cheaper for buyers using other currencies, potentially leading to increased demand and higher commodity prices. This can have inflationary implications globally. Emerging Markets Dynamics: A weaker dollar can be beneficial for emerging markets. It can ease the burden of dollar-denominated debt and potentially attract capital flows to these economies. However, the impact can vary depending on individual country circumstances. Cryptocurrency Correlation: Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the US dollar and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. When the dollar weakens, some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies as alternative stores of value, potentially driving up crypto prices. However, this correlation is not always consistent and can be influenced by other market factors. Navigating the Forex Market Analysis Amidst Dollar Downturn In this environment of forex market analysis and dollar depreciation, what steps can traders and investors take? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic data releases, central bank announcements, and geopolitical developments. These factors will continue to drive currency movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across asset classes, including currencies, can help mitigate risk during periods of market uncertainty. Risk Management is Key: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes. Volatility can amplify both gains and losses. Consider Alternative Currencies: Explore trading opportunities in currency pairs that don’t solely rely on the USD. Identify currencies that are showing strength and have positive economic fundamentals. Understand Cryptocurrency Dynamics: If you’re involved in crypto, monitor the dollar’s performance in relation to crypto prices. Be aware of the potential, but not guaranteed, inverse correlation. Global Currency Devaluation: Is This a Broader Trend? While the focus is on the dollar, it’s important to consider if this global currency devaluation is a more widespread phenomenon. Are we seeing a broader shift in the global currency landscape? Inflationary Pressures Worldwide: Many countries are grappling with elevated inflation. Central banks globally are responding with varying degrees of hawkishness, leading to shifts in currency valuations. Geopolitical Realignment: Evolving geopolitical alliances and rivalries can influence currency flows and create winners and losers in the global currency market. Economic Cycles and Divergence: Different economies are in different phases of the economic cycle. This divergence can lead to periods of relative strength and weakness for various currencies. The Rise of Digital Currencies: The emergence of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies could potentially reshape the future of the global monetary system and impact traditional currencies in the long run. Actionable Insight: For crypto investors, the dollar bearish trend and potential global currency devaluation can be viewed as both a challenge and an opportunity. Monitoring these forex trends alongside crypto market movements can provide valuable insights for strategic portfolio adjustments. Consider exploring trading pairs that involve currencies other than the USD to diversify your exposure and potentially capitalize on global currency shifts. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Global Finance The accelerating dollar bearish trend and the historic selloff are significant developments that demand attention. As the global economic landscape evolves, understanding the drivers behind USD weakness and engaging in thorough forex market analysis are crucial for investors and traders alike. While the future remains uncertain, staying informed, adapting strategies, and considering the broader context of potential global currency devaluation will be key to navigating these shifting sands of global finance. The interplay between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto world adds another layer of complexity and opportunity, making it an exciting yet challenging time for market participants.

43348392,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149265,1744675829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Meta’s Bold AI Move: Training Models on EU Public Content Sparks Data Privacy Debate,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-ai-models-eu-data/,"Exciting news for the AI world, but with a twist of data privacy debate! Meta, the tech giant behind Facebook and Instagram, is pushing forward with its plans to train its advanced AI models using public content from users in the European Union (EU). This move, initially paused due to regulatory concerns, is now back on track, raising important questions about how our online data fuels the future of artificial intelligence. Let’s dive into what this means for you and the evolving landscape of AI. Why is Meta Training AI Models on EU Public Content? Meta’s decision to train its AI models on public content in the EU is driven by several key factors. Firstly, it’s about creating more relevant and effective AI for European users. According to Meta, training AI on data that reflects the nuances of European languages, cultures, and online interactions is crucial for building AI that truly understands and serves the diverse communities across the EU. Here’s a breakdown of Meta’s reasoning: Enhanced User Experience: Meta argues that training AI models on local data will lead to more personalized and culturally attuned AI experiences for users in the EU. This includes understanding local dialects, colloquialisms, humor, and specific regional knowledge. Competitive Edge: Companies like Google and OpenAI are already training their AI on European user data. Meta needs to catch up to remain competitive in the rapidly advancing AI landscape. Responsibility to Innovate: Meta states it has a “responsibility to build AI that’s not just available to Europeans, but is actually built for them.” This suggests a commitment to making AI development inclusive and representative of its global user base. Data Privacy in the EU: Navigating the GDPR Maze The path to training AI models in the EU isn’t straightforward due to the region’s stringent data privacy regulations, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR mandates a clear legal basis for processing personal data, and training AI models often involves processing vast amounts of user-generated content. This is where the initial friction arose. Key GDPR considerations include: Legal Basis for Data Processing: Meta needs to demonstrate a lawful basis for using public content to train its AI. While they argue public content is inherently shareable, regulators are keen to ensure user rights are protected. User Consent and Control: Even with public content, GDPR emphasizes user rights. Meta is now providing EU users with notifications and opt-out options, acknowledging the importance of user control over their data. Regulatory Scrutiny: The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which regulates Meta in the EU, has been actively scrutinizing Meta’s plans to ensure compliance with GDPR. This reflects the EU’s commitment to upholding high standards of data privacy . Meta AI and Public Content: What Data is Being Used? Meta is clarifying what kind of public content will be used to train its Meta AI models. It’s important to understand the scope to gauge the implications for user privacy. Here’s what Meta has specified: Public Posts and Comments: Training will primarily involve public posts and comments on Facebook and Instagram. This means content that users have intentionally shared with a broad audience. Interactions with Meta AI: User interactions with Meta AI, such as prompts and responses, will also be utilized to refine the models. This is common practice to improve AI conversational abilities. Exclusions: Crucially, Meta has stated it will not use private messages or public data from users under the age of 18 in the EU for AI training. This is a significant commitment to protecting younger users and private communications. Opting Out: Taking Control of Your Data For EU users concerned about their public content being used to train Meta AI , there’s an opt-out mechanism. Meta is sending in-app and email notifications to users, providing clear instructions on how to object. Here’s how the opt-out process works: Notifications: Users will receive notifications explaining Meta’s plans and their right to object.

Making waves across the financial landscape, Visa has become the first traditional finance (TradFi) powerhouse to join the Global Dollar Network (USDG), a stablecoin consortium spearheaded by blockchain infrastructure leader, Paxos. This strategic alliance marks a significant milestone, indicating Visa’s deepened commitment to the digital asset space and the evolving infrastructure surrounding stablecoins. For crypto enthusiasts and TradFi observers alike, this news sparks excitement and raises crucial questions about the future of payments and financial integration. Unpacking the News: Visa and Paxos Unite for Stablecoin Innovation The headline is clear: Visa is joining the Paxos-led USDG consortium. But what does this really mean, and why is it a game-changer? Let’s break down the key aspects: First TradFi Giant on Board: Visa’s entry into the USDG is groundbreaking because it’s the first time a major player from traditional finance has directly joined this consortium. This isn’t just a partnership; it’s an integration, signaling a serious commitment to stablecoin technology. Paxos Leading the Charge: Paxos, known for its regulatory-first approach and robust blockchain infrastructure, is at the helm of the USDG. Their expertise provides a solid foundation for this ambitious project.

It signifies a transformative shift in the financial landscape, where traditional finance and digital assets are converging to create a more efficient, accessible, and innovative financial future. As stablecoin adoption accelerates and consortiums like USDG pave the way, we are entering a new era of finance, one that promises to reshape how we transact, invest, and interact with money globally. The journey is just beginning, but the direction is clear: the future of finance is increasingly digital, and stablecoins are poised to play a central role.

The blocked platforms included major names like KuCoin and MEXC, sending a clear signal to overseas exchanges lacking local approval.

South Korea Crypto Companies Must Operate Legally Under the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information (commonly referred to as the Special Financial Transaction Information Act), any virtual asset service provider (VASP) conducting business that targets users in South Korea must register with the FIU. The requirements for registration include providing services in Korean, supporting Korean won-denominated transactions, or engaging in marketing campaigns aimed at South Korean residents. Noncompliant platforms face penalties, including fines of up to 50 million won and prison terms of up to five years. The 14 apps recently removed from Apple’s platform—KuCoin, MEXC, Phemex, Bitrue, CoinW, CoinEX, ZoomEX, Poloniex, BTCC, Blofin, CoinCatch, DOEX, WEEX, and BitMart—were found to be offering services to South Korean users without securing the required FIU registration. According to the Financial Services Commission, Apple Korea took action on the FIU’s request starting April 11, cutting off access to new users in South Korea and blocking updates for existing ones. The FIU has indicated that it will continue working with internet service providers, mobile platforms, and regulatory partners to prevent access to unregistered crypto apps and websites. From Google to Apple and Beyond On March 25, Google blocked 17 unregistered VASP apps at the FIU’s request, including several platforms now also restricted on Apple’s App Store. @GooglePlay blocks 17 unregistered crypto apps in South Korea, targeting foreign exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC, as the FIU enforces strict compliance with local regulations. #CryptoRegulation #SouthKorea https://t.co/M9UoZ8w1dV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 26, 2025 This dual-platform crackdown aims to close any remaining loopholes that allow overseas operators to sidestep South Korea’s strict crypto licensing regime. This dual-platform strategy is part of an escalating campaign to close gaps that allow unregistered exchanges to reach South Korean users. As of March 2025, multiple investigations have been launched into foreign exchanges suspected of operating illegally within the country. KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix, BitMEX, and KCEX remain under investigation for continuing to serve South Korean users without proper registration. To aid public awareness, the FIU has published an official list of registered VASPs on its website. South Korean users are advised to verify platform registration status and withdraw any funds from unregistered platforms to reduce risk.

In a direct response to community concerns, Mantra CEO John Mullin has stepped forward to address these issues head-on, prioritizing the OM token recovery and dispelling any notions of illicit activities. Let’s dive into the key takeaways from his statement and understand what it means for OM holders and the future of the Mantra project. What’s the Latest on Mantra’s OM Token Recovery Plan? According to CEO John Mullin, the primary focus right now is the OM token recovery . This isn’t just lip service; Mullin explicitly stated that bringing the OM token back to health is the project’s “top priority.” To demonstrate this commitment, Mantra is actively exploring concrete measures such as: Buybacks: Mantra is considering injecting capital back into the market by purchasing OM tokens. This can help to increase demand and potentially drive up the price. Burns: Token burning involves permanently removing tokens from circulation. This reduces the overall supply, which, in turn, can increase the scarcity and value of the remaining tokens. These are significant steps that signal Mantra’s dedication to supporting the OM token and its community. The implementation details and scale of these measures are still under consideration, but the intent is clear: Mantra is serious about reversing the recent downward trend and fostering a healthier token ecosystem. Insider Selling Accusations: What Did Mantra CEO Say? One of the most pressing concerns within the Mantra community has been the allegation of insider selling , often referred to as ‘insider dumping.’ These accusations suggest that individuals within the project might be selling off large amounts of OM tokens, contributing to the price decline. Mullin firmly denied these allegations, stating unequivocally that there has been no insider dumping. To back up his denial, Mullin made several key points: 90% Control: He asserted that Mantra itself controls 90% of the total OM token supply. This is a crucial detail because it significantly limits the amount of OM that could be circulating outside of Mantra’s direct control and potentially be ‘dumped’ by insiders. Transparency Report: Mullin pointed to a transparency report (presumably publicly available or soon to be) that substantiates their claim of holding the majority of OM tokens. This report likely details the distribution and allocation of OM, offering verifiable evidence. Major Holders: He identified major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and OKX as significant holders of OM. This is important because large exchange holdings are typically for operational purposes (like providing liquidity for trading) rather than individual insider accounts. Furthermore, Mullin addressed a specific transaction that had raised eyebrows – a transfer of 38 million OM tokens. He clarified that this transfer was not a sell-off but was directly related to the completion of a Binance staking program. Tokens used in staking programs are often moved back to the project’s control after the program concludes. This explanation aims to dispel the notion that this large transfer was indicative of insider selling . Understanding the Recent Volatility: Exchange Liquidations If insider selling wasn’t the culprit, what caused the recent volatility in OM’s price? Mullin offered another explanation: exchange liquidations. He stated that the recent price drops were, in part, triggered by OM tokens being liquidated as collateral by an unnamed exchange. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what this means: Collateral: Some traders likely used OM tokens as collateral to take out loans or engage in leveraged trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. Price Drop & Liquidation: When the price of OM started to fall, these positions may have become undercollateralized. To manage risk, the exchange automatically liquidated (sold off) the OM collateral to cover the loans. Downward Pressure: Large-scale liquidations can create significant selling pressure in the market, further driving down the price and creating a negative feedback loop. This explanation suggests that the volatility might have been driven by market mechanics and cascading liquidations rather than malicious insider actions. It highlights the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading and the potential for market events to trigger significant price swings, especially in more volatile cryptocurrencies. The $109 Million Ecosystem Fund: A Ray of Hope for Mantra’s Future? Despite the recent challenges, Mantra has a substantial resource at its disposal: a $109 million Ecosystem Fund. Mullin emphasized that this fund remains dedicated to supporting the project’s recovery and future growth. This is a significant commitment and a potential source of hope for the OM token and the broader Mantra ecosystem. What could this Ecosystem Fund be used for? Funding Development: A portion of the fund can be allocated to further develop the Mantra platform, introduce new features, and enhance its technology. Community Initiatives: The fund could support community-driven projects, grants for developers building on Mantra, and marketing initiatives to expand the ecosystem. Strategic Partnerships: Mantra might use the fund to forge strategic partnerships with other projects and businesses, expanding its reach and utility. OM Token Support: Crucially, a portion of the Ecosystem Fund could be strategically deployed for the buybacks and burns discussed earlier, directly contributing to the OM token recovery . The existence of this substantial fund provides Mantra with considerable financial flexibility to navigate the current situation and invest in its long-term success. The strategic deployment of these funds will be critical in determining the speed and effectiveness of the crypto recovery efforts. Looking Ahead: Transparency and Community Trust Mantra CEO John Mullin’s statement is a crucial step towards addressing community concerns and restoring confidence in the project. His emphasis on OM token recovery , denial of insider selling, and clarification of recent events are all aimed at reassuring OM holders and the broader crypto community. Moving forward, continued transparency and consistent communication will be paramount. Here are some actionable insights for OM holders and those following the situation: Review the Transparency Report: Keep an eye out for and review the transparency report mentioned by Mullin. This document should provide verifiable data to support his claims about token distribution and control. Monitor Buyback and Burn Announcements: Stay informed about any official announcements regarding buyback and burn programs. These actions will be key indicators of Mantra’s commitment to OM token recovery . Engage with the Community: Participate in community discussions on official Mantra channels and forums. Asking questions and sharing insights can contribute to a more informed and resilient community. Assess Risk Tolerance: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Understand your own risk tolerance and make informed investment decisions based on your individual circumstances and research. Conclusion: A Path to Recovery? Mantra CEO’s direct address offers a glimmer of hope amidst the recent turbulence surrounding the OM token. By prioritizing OM token recovery , denying insider selling, and highlighting the resources available through the Ecosystem Fund, Mantra is attempting to chart a course towards stabilization and future growth. The effectiveness of these efforts will depend on consistent execution, transparent communication, and the continued support of the Mantra community. The coming weeks and months will be critical in determining whether Mantra can successfully navigate these challenges and deliver on its promises for the OM token and its ecosystem.

The announcement helped ease market concerns, contributing to renewed momentum in both equity and digital asset markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Above 365-Day Moving Average, But Market Sentiment Remains Subdued Bitcoin Whales Show Restraint as Market Climbs As Bitcoin finds its footing in upward momentum, a new analysis from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost suggests that large holders on Binance—one of the most active crypto exchanges—are responding to macroeconomic uncertainty with a cautious, but notably non-reactive, approach. The insights were detailed in a post titled “How Are Binance Whales Reacting to Market Uncertainty?” which examined key on-chain metrics. According to Darkfost, two primary indicators reveal the evolving behavior of Binance whales. The first, the Exchange Whale Ratio (EWR), compares the top 10 inflows to total inflows on Binance to gauge whale involvement. A rising 365-day moving average (DMA) for the EWR reflects a growing concentration of inflows from large holders over time, indicating their stronger influence during long-term trends. However, a recent decline in the 30DMA points to reduced short-term activity. This suggests that whales may be taking a step back from active trading, neither selling aggressively nor showing signs of panic. The second metric, Whale to Exchange Flow, analyzes the value of whale inflows to Binance over a 30-day period. Here too, the trend is down—falling over $3 billion, mirroring similar drawdowns observed during past corrections in 2024. Combined, these signals suggest that Binance whales are opting to hold their positions rather than sell into current market conditions, potentially signaling confidence in longer-term prospects despite ongoing uncertainty. Buying Strength Persists Despite Uncertain Outlook In a related CryptoQuant post, analyst Mignolet highlighted a continued pattern of buying strength on Binance. According to the analyst, the market buy ratio—an indicator tracking the volume of market buy orders—has not only remained intact but has recently surpassed previous highs. This trend highlights persistent demand despite recent market corrections and volatility. The recurring nature of this pattern suggests that there is underlying buyer strength even as external macroeconomic forces, such as trade policies and regulatory shifts, continue to influence sentiment.

This meeting has sparked considerable interest, especially given El Salvador’s pioneering move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. But what exactly does this signify for Bitcoin adoption and the broader crypto landscape? Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing encounter. Why is the Trump-Bukele Meeting Significant for Bitcoin Adoption? The meeting between Trump and Bukele isn’t just a routine political event; it carries weight within the cryptocurrency community for several reasons. El Salvador’s bold embrace of Bitcoin has been a closely watched experiment, and any dialogue involving its leader and a prominent figure like Donald Trump, who has previously expressed mixed feelings about crypto, is noteworthy. Here’s why this meeting is generating buzz: Validation for El Salvador’s Bitcoin Bet: President Bukele’s decision to make Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador was met with both enthusiasm and skepticism globally. A meeting with a former U.S. President, regardless of political stance, can be seen as a form of international recognition of El Salvador’s economic and technological direction. Trump’s Evolving Stance on Cryptocurrency: Donald Trump’s past comments on cryptocurrency have ranged from critical to cautiously interested. His engagement with a nation deeply invested in Bitcoin could indicate a shift or at least a deepening of his understanding and perspective on digital currencies. Geopolitical Implications: El Salvador’s pivot to Bitcoin has positioned it uniquely in the global financial landscape. Discussions between Trump and Bukele might touch upon the broader geopolitical implications of cryptocurrency adoption by nations, particularly in relation to U.S. foreign policy and economic influence. Economic Discussions: Beyond Bitcoin, the meeting likely covered economic cooperation and investment opportunities. El Salvador, like many nations, seeks to strengthen its economy, and Bitcoin is a part of its strategy. Trump’s business background could bring valuable insights to these discussions. El Salvador Bitcoin Holdings: A Quick Recap El Salvador’s commitment to Bitcoin is not just rhetoric; it’s backed by substantial holdings. As of today, El Salvador reportedly holds 6,146.18 Bitcoin (BTC) . This makes the nation a significant player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, especially considering its size. Let’s break down what this means: Strategic Investment: For El Salvador, Bitcoin is more than just a currency; it’s a strategic investment. The nation has been actively purchasing Bitcoin, particularly during price dips, viewing it as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation. Chivo Wallet and Bitcoin Bonds: El Salvador launched the Chivo wallet to facilitate Bitcoin transactions and even planned to issue Bitcoin-backed bonds to raise capital. While facing challenges, these initiatives highlight the nation’s innovative approach to integrating Bitcoin into its financial system. Tourism and Remittances: El Salvador hopes Bitcoin will boost tourism and streamline remittances, a significant source of income for the country. By reducing reliance on traditional financial intermediaries, Bitcoin could potentially lower transaction costs and speed up money transfers. Cryptocurrency News and Market Reactions The news of the Trump-Bukele meeting has rippled through cryptocurrency news outlets and social media platforms. The immediate market reaction has been subtle but positive, with some analysts suggesting that such high-profile discussions lend further legitimacy to the crypto space. Here’s a look at the broader context: Aspect Details Market Sentiment Generally positive, with a slight uptick in Bitcoin price observed following the news. Market participants view it as a sign of growing mainstream acceptance. Media Coverage Major financial news outlets and crypto-specific publications have covered the meeting, highlighting the Bitcoin angle. The narrative often focuses on the potential shift in global perceptions of cryptocurrency. Social Media Buzz Twitter and other platforms are abuzz with discussions, ranging from speculation about Trump’s future crypto policies to debates about El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. Trump Bitcoin : What Could This Mean for the Future? The question on many minds is: What does this meeting imply about Trump Bitcoin policy should he return to office? While it’s speculative, here are a few potential takeaways: Potential for Crypto-Friendly Policies: Engagement with a Bitcoin-adopting nation might signal a more open or at least a more informed stance on cryptocurrency from Trump. This could translate to potentially more favorable regulatory frameworks for crypto in the U.S. if he were to regain presidency. Economic Opportunities: Trump, known for his focus on economic growth, might see the potential of the crypto industry to create jobs and attract investment. His administration could explore ways to foster innovation in the crypto space while addressing regulatory concerns. Geopolitical Strategy: In a world where digital currencies are gaining traction, the U.S. might need a clear strategy on crypto.

Source: OCEAN Mining While Bitcoin hashrate is decentralized, the block-building process conducted by mining pools is mostly centralized by a few dominant actors — most notably Foundry USA, AntPool and ViaBTC. The OCEAN protocol attempts to decentralize this process by empowering miners to build their own block templates using their open-source DATUM protocol, reducing dependency on centralized intermediaries and enhancing censorship resistance, Tether said. Tether’s deployment would leverage OCEAN’s DATUM software across all of its mining operations worldwide, including in rural areas in Africa. “By enabling on-site generation of unique block templates and aggregating thousands of rig connections with low-latency performance, DATUM ensures global competitiveness while promoting geographic and operational diversity,” Tether said. Related: Inside the Trump-backed Bitcoin mining mega-deal with Hut 8 Tether currently deploys Bitcoin hashrate at sites in Uruguay, Paraguay and El Salvador, where the $144 billion stablecoin issuer is also headquartered. Those initiatives emerged around the time Tether announced it would invest $500 million into Bitcoin mining in late 2023. OCEAN was created by Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr in 2023 and has been backed by the likes of Block CEO Jack Dorsey. OCEAN also relocated its headquarters to El Salvador in May 2024. Dashjr sparked controversy in December 2023 when he slammed Bitcoin Ordinals users for clogging the network with “spam.” However, he refuted claims that OCEAN censored the non-fungible token-like transactions. OCEAN still has a lot of market share to capture The OCEAN protocol currently mines between 0.2% to 1% of Bitcoin blocks, according to mempool.space data. It has mined nine blocks over the last week, including two in a row at 892342 and 892343 on April 14. However, OCEAN’s output remains a fraction of that seen by Foundry USA, AntPool and ViaBTC, which have mined 331, 199 and 161 Bitcoin blocks, respectively, over the same timeframe — accounting for over 66% of all blocks. The Tether partnership would likely provide a much-needed boost to OCEAN’s hashrate, which has amounted to 18.3 exahashes per second (EH/s) over the last 24 hours.

Solana (SOL), currently trading around $118, continues to impress with its lightning-fast transactions and growing DeFi ecosystem. Yet, a fresh wave of investor interest is beginning to swell around a new DeFi disruptor, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising altcoin. MUTM has already raised over $6.7 million and has attracted more than 8300 holders within days. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. The Muutum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off The decentralized finance (DeFi) market adopts Mutuum Finance because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 8,300 investors have participated in the project’s unique approach through which they poured $6.7 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% because it marks the termination of early investment possibilities. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance utilizes CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security which will receive publication on their social media channels afterwards. CertiK will audit the platform after completion before the official report gets published on their social media platforms for public transparency and trust. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. Through the Ethereum blockchain the platform stablecoin reaches price stability by using reserve-backed USD. The configuration works as a risk management system for algorithmic stablecoins to secure safe and reliable financial transactions. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The MUTM Giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. Solana (SOL) remains a strong performer in the DeFi market, trading around $118 and maintaining solid developer and investor interest. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a top-performing altcoin, having raised over $6.7 million from more than 8,300 investors.

Recently, Bybit, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, found itself at the center of such a storm. A pseudonymous X (formerly Twitter) user, @sunlc_crypto, alleged that Bybit had engaged in market manipulation by modifying Zcash (ZEC) contract parameters, causing significant losses for traders. These are serious allegations that can erode trust in the crypto ecosystem. But did Bybit really manipulate the market? Let’s delve into the facts and hear directly from the source. Decoding the Allegations of ZEC Market Manipulation The accusations leveled against Bybit centered around changes made to the parameters of their ZEC perpetual contracts. @sunlc_crypto claimed these changes were deliberately timed and designed to trigger liquidations and unfairly profit Bybit at the expense of its users. Such claims, if true, would be a major blow to Bybit’s reputation and raise serious questions about the integrity of the platform. In a market where trust is paramount, these allegations needed to be addressed head-on and with transparency. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou Steps In to Set the Record Straight To quell the rising concerns and address the accusations directly, Bybit CEO, Ben Zhou , took to social media to personally respond. In a series of posts and statements, Zhou refuted the claims of market manipulation , emphasizing Bybit’s commitment to fair trading and user protection. Instead of remaining silent and letting rumors fester, Zhou chose a proactive approach, aiming to provide clarity and transparency to the Bybit community and the wider crypto world. Key Points from Ben Zhou’s Response: Timeline of Parameter Changes: Zhou meticulously outlined the timeline of changes made to the ZEC contract parameters. This transparency is crucial in demonstrating that the changes were not sudden or designed to catch users off guard. Reason for Parameter Adjustments: The CEO explained that the adjustments were implemented to maintain price stability and ensure a fair trading environment. In volatile markets like crypto, exchanges often need to tweak parameters to prevent excessive volatility and protect both traders and the platform itself. Commitment to Fairness: Zhou reiterated Bybit’s core principle of fairness and their dedication to providing a level playing field for all users. He stressed that Bybit’s actions are always guided by the intention to create a stable and reliable trading environment. Addressing User Concerns: By directly engaging with the community and addressing the specific allegations, Zhou aimed to reassure users and rebuild trust that might have been shaken by the accusations. Understanding ZEC Contract Parameter Adjustments: Why Exchanges Tweak the Settings For those less familiar with the intricacies of crypto derivatives trading, the concept of contract parameter adjustments might seem confusing. So, why do exchanges like Bybit sometimes need to modify these settings, especially for cryptocurrencies like ZEC ? Let’s break it down: Maintaining Price Stability: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Sudden and extreme price swings can lead to cascading liquidations and market instability. Exchanges adjust parameters, such as margin requirements and liquidation thresholds, to mitigate these risks and prevent excessive volatility. Ensuring Fair Trading: Parameter adjustments can also be used to ensure fair trading practices. For example, setting appropriate leverage limits can prevent traders from taking on excessively risky positions that could destabilize the market. Adapting to Market Conditions: The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and constantly evolving. Exchanges need to be agile and adapt their parameters to changing market conditions. This might involve adjusting parameters based on the volatility of a specific cryptocurrency like ZEC , overall market sentiment, or external economic factors. Protecting Users and the Platform: Ultimately, parameter adjustments are implemented to protect both users and the exchange itself. By managing risk effectively, exchanges can ensure the long-term sustainability of their platform and the safety of user funds. Cryptocurrency Exchange Transparency: A Critical Factor for Trust In the wake of the allegations and Bybit’s response, one thing becomes abundantly clear: transparency is paramount in the cryptocurrency exchange industry. Users need to trust that the platforms they are trading on are acting fairly and with integrity. When accusations of market manipulation arise, the way exchanges respond is crucial in shaping public perception and maintaining user confidence. Why Transparency Matters: Building Trust: Open communication and transparency build trust between exchanges and their users. When exchanges are transparent about their operations, policies, and actions, users are more likely to feel confident in using their services. Addressing Concerns Effectively: Transparency allows exchanges to address concerns and allegations proactively and effectively. By providing clear explanations and data, they can counter misinformation and reassure users. Promoting Accountability: Transparency promotes accountability. When exchanges know they are operating under scrutiny, they are more likely to adhere to high ethical standards and prioritize user interests. Fostering a Healthy Crypto Ecosystem: Transparency is essential for fostering a healthy and sustainable cryptocurrency ecosystem. It helps to create a level playing field, reduce the risk of fraud and manipulation, and encourage wider adoption of cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders: Navigating Market Volatility While the Bybit situation highlights the importance of exchange transparency, it also offers valuable lessons for crypto traders navigating the volatile market: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, exchange announcements, and parameter changes. Understanding how exchanges operate and the factors that can influence trading conditions is crucial for informed decision-making. Manage Risk Wisely: Cryptocurrency trading involves inherent risks. Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders, managing leverage prudently, and diversifying your portfolio. Choose Reputable Exchanges: Select cryptocurrency exchanges that have a strong reputation for transparency, security, and user support. Do your research and consider factors like regulatory compliance, security measures, and community feedback. Engage with the Community: Participate in crypto communities and forums. Sharing information and insights with other traders can help you stay informed and make better trading decisions. Conclusion: Clarity Prevails in the Bybit ZEC Controversy The allegations of market manipulation against Bybit , while serious, were met with a swift and transparent response from CEO Ben Zhou . By providing a clear timeline, explaining the rationale behind ZEC contract parameter adjustments, and reaffirming Bybit’s commitment to fairness, Zhou effectively addressed the concerns and set the record straight. This incident underscores the critical importance of transparency and open communication in the cryptocurrency industry. For traders, it’s a reminder to stay informed, manage risk effectively, and choose exchanges that prioritize integrity and user trust.

43350119,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149277,1744679434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Upbit and Bithumb Suspend ATOM Deposits Amid Unexpected Cosmos Network Halt,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-bithumb-atom-deposit-suspension/,"In a sudden turn of events impacting the cryptocurrency landscape, South Korean exchanges Upbit and Bithumb have announced the temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals for ATOM, the native token of the Cosmos network. This unexpected move comes in response to a halt in block generation on the Cosmos Hub network, sending ripples of concern across the crypto community. Are you an ATOM holder wondering what this means for you? Let’s delve into the details of this developing situation and understand the implications for traders and investors. What’s Behind the Sudden ATOM Deposit and Withdrawal Suspension? The primary driver behind Upbit and Bithumb’s decision to suspend ATOM transactions is the temporary disruption of the Cosmos Hub network. According to official announcements, the Cosmos Hub, the central hub of the Cosmos network, experienced a halt in block production. This essentially means that the network stopped processing new transactions and confirming existing ones. For crypto exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb, network stability is paramount for ensuring the smooth and secure deposit and withdrawal of digital assets. When block generation is suspended, it introduces uncertainty and potential risks to these processes. Here’s a breakdown of the key events: Cosmos Hub Network Halt: The Cosmos Hub, the backbone of the Cosmos ecosystem, experienced an unforeseen suspension in block generation. This is a critical issue as it impacts all activities dependent on the network’s operational status. Exchange Response: Leading South Korean crypto exchanges, Upbit and Bithumb, swiftly reacted to the network disruption. They announced the temporary suspension of ATOM deposits and withdrawals to safeguard user funds and prevent potential transaction issues during the network instability. Precautionary Measure: This suspension is a precautionary measure. Exchanges typically halt deposits and withdrawals during network disruptions to avoid transactions getting stuck or lost due to network instability. Industry Standard Practice: Suspending deposits and withdrawals during network issues is a common and responsible practice among cryptocurrency exchanges globally to protect users. Why is Cosmos Hub Network Stability Crucial for Crypto Exchanges? For cryptocurrency exchanges, the stability and reliability of blockchain networks are non-negotiable. Exchanges act as gateways for users to buy, sell, and transfer cryptocurrencies. Any disruption to the underlying network can directly impact their operations and user experience. Let’s understand why network stability, especially for a prominent network like Cosmos Hub, is so critical: Transaction Processing: Exchanges rely on the network to process deposit and withdrawal requests accurately and promptly. A network halt prevents the confirmation of these transactions, leading to operational gridlock. User Trust and Security: When a network is unstable, there’s an increased risk of transaction failures, delays, or even potential losses. Exchanges prioritize user trust and security above all else. Suspending operations during such times is a way to maintain this trust. Preventing Double Spending and Errors: Network instability can create vulnerabilities, such as the risk of double spending or other transaction errors. By halting deposits and withdrawals, exchanges mitigate these risks. Maintaining Operational Integrity: Consistent network operation is vital for the overall integrity of an exchange’s platform. Suspensions are sometimes necessary to ensure the exchange operates smoothly and reliably once the network issue is resolved. Impact on ATOM Holders and Crypto Traders The suspension of ATOM deposits and withdrawals on Upbit and Bithumb directly affects users who hold ATOM or actively trade it on these platforms. Here’s what ATOM holders and crypto traders need to consider: Temporary Inconvenience: The most immediate impact is the temporary inability to deposit or withdraw ATOM from Upbit and Bithumb. This can be inconvenient for users who planned to move their ATOM holdings or trade them on these exchanges. Trading Restrictions: While spot trading of ATOM might still be available (depending on the exchange’s specific policies during such events – always check exchange announcements), the inability to deposit or withdraw can limit trading strategies, especially for arbitrage traders or those needing to move funds quickly. Market Volatility: News of network disruptions can sometimes lead to increased market volatility. Traders should be prepared for potential price fluctuations in ATOM and the broader Cosmos ecosystem. Stay Informed: It’s crucial for ATOM holders to stay updated through official announcements from Upbit, Bithumb, and the Cosmos team. Monitor their communication channels for updates on the network status and the resumption of deposit and withdrawal services. No Immediate Loss of Funds: It’s important to note that this suspension is not indicative of a loss of funds. It’s a temporary measure to protect user assets during a network issue. Once the Cosmos Hub network stabilizes, deposit and withdrawal services are expected to resume. Cosmos Hub Network: Understanding the Ecosystem and the Current Situation Cosmos Hub is the flagship blockchain within the Cosmos network, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains.” It plays a central role in facilitating interoperability between different blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. Understanding the Cosmos Hub network’s function helps to appreciate the significance of its current disruption: Interoperability Focus: Cosmos Hub is designed to enable different blockchains to communicate and transact with each other. It acts as a central router for the Cosmos ecosystem. ATOM Token Utility: ATOM is the native staking token of the Cosmos Hub. It is used for securing the network through staking, participating in governance, and paying transaction fees within the Cosmos Hub. Security and Validation: The Cosmos Hub network relies on validators who stake ATOM to secure the network and validate transactions. A halt in block generation indicates an issue within this validation or consensus mechanism. Ecosystem Impact: While the Cosmos ecosystem is designed to be interconnected yet independent, a significant issue with the Cosmos Hub can have ripple effects across the entire ecosystem, at least in terms of sentiment and confidence. The exact reasons for the Cosmos Hub network’s block generation suspension are still unfolding. Technical teams are likely working diligently to diagnose and resolve the issue. Updates from the Cosmos team will be critical in understanding the root cause and the timeline for network restoration. Actionable Insights for ATOM Holders and Crypto Enthusiasts While the suspension of ATOM deposits and withdrawals is undoubtedly a noteworthy event, it also presents an opportunity to learn and adapt within the dynamic crypto space. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Calm and Informed: Panic selling or impulsive reactions are rarely beneficial. Stay calm, monitor official announcements, and make informed decisions based on verified information. Diversification: This event underscores the importance of diversification in crypto portfolios. Relying heavily on a single asset or network can expose you to concentrated risks. Understand Network Risks: Blockchain networks, like any technology, can experience disruptions. Understanding these inherent risks is part of being a responsible crypto participant. Follow Exchange and Project Updates: Regularly follow official communication channels of crypto exchanges you use and the projects you invest in. This ensures you are among the first to know about important updates and changes. Long-Term Perspective: Temporary network issues are often resolved. Maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments and avoid making hasty decisions based on short-term fluctuations. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Market Fluctuations The temporary suspension of ATOM deposits and withdrawals on Upbit and Bithumb due to the Cosmos Hub network halt serves as a reminder of the ever-evolving and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be concerning, they also highlight the proactive measures taken by exchanges to protect users and maintain the integrity of the crypto ecosystem. For ATOM holders and crypto enthusiasts, staying informed, understanding the underlying technologies, and maintaining a balanced perspective are key to navigating these fluctuations successfully. As the situation with the Cosmos Hub unfolds, continued monitoring of official updates will be essential to understand when normal services will be fully restored. The crypto world never stands still, and staying adaptable and informed is your best strategy.

According to a recent update from Walter Bloomberg on X, Yellen suggests these policies could be actively ‘eroding trust’ in the United States and its dollar-denominated assets. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors keenly observing the global economic landscape, this development is particularly noteworthy. Could this erosion of trust in traditional financial instruments inadvertently bolster the appeal of decentralized digital assets? Let’s delve deeper into Yellen’s warning and unpack what it could mean for the future of finance and the burgeoning crypto market. Why is US Dollar Trust So Crucial? The US dollar trust isn’t just about faith in a currency; it’s about confidence in the entire economic and political stability of the United States. For decades, the dollar has reigned supreme as the world’s reserve currency. This dominance is underpinned by several key factors: Stability and Reliability: The U.S. economy, despite its fluctuations, has generally been perceived as stable and reliable. This stability has historically translated into confidence in the dollar’s value. Rule of Law: Strong legal frameworks and property rights in the U.S. provide a secure environment for investors, reinforcing trust in dollar assets . Deep and Liquid Markets: The U.S. boasts the world’s largest and most liquid financial markets, making it easy to buy and sell dollar-denominated assets. Geopolitical Influence: The U.S.’s global political and military influence has also played a role in maintaining the dollar’s status. When trust in the US dollar wavers, it can trigger a cascade of effects, impacting everything from international trade and investment flows to the value of dollar assets held by individuals and institutions worldwide. Yellen’s Warning: Trump Policies Under the Microscope Janet Yellen’s statement isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a serious alarm bell sounded by a seasoned economic expert who has held top positions in U.S. financial governance. Her warning specifically points to concerns that Trump policies , or policies associated with his administration, are contributing to this erosion of trust. But what specific policies might she be referring to? While the exact policies Yellen is alluding to weren’t detailed in the initial report, we can speculate on potential areas of concern based on past and potential future policy directions: Trade Wars and Protectionism: Trump’s past imposition of tariffs and trade disputes strained international relationships and raised questions about the predictability of U.S. economic policy. Further protectionist measures could be seen as destabilizing for global trade and, consequently, for the dollar’s role in international transactions. Fiscal Policy and Debt: Large tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts, a hallmark of some Trump policies , can lead to increased national debt. If investors become concerned about the sustainability of U.S. debt levels, it could undermine confidence in the dollar. Political Instability and Uncertainty: Periods of political turmoil or perceived instability in the U.S. can also erode international trust. Unpredictable policy decisions and challenges to democratic norms can make investors nervous about the long-term stability of dollar assets . Impact on International Alliances: Strained relationships with traditional allies and a more unilateral approach to foreign policy could weaken the U.S.’s global standing, indirectly impacting the perception of the dollar. It’s crucial to remember that Yellen’s warning is a forward-looking statement. It highlights potential risks associated with certain policy directions rather than necessarily reflecting an immediate crisis. However, her words carry significant weight and should not be dismissed. The Ripple Effect: Economic Impact and Global Finance The erosion of US dollar trust can have far-reaching consequences for the global economy and financial system. Here’s a look at some potential areas of economic impact : Impact Area Potential Consequence International Trade Increased transaction costs if businesses and nations seek alternatives to the dollar for trade settlements. Reserve Currency Status Gradual shift away from the dollar as central banks diversify their reserves into other currencies or assets. Investment Flows Reduced foreign investment in dollar assets , potentially leading to higher borrowing costs for the U.S. Dollar Value Potential depreciation of the dollar against other currencies, impacting import prices and potentially contributing to inflation in the U.S. Global Financial Stability Increased volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets as the anchor of the dollar weakens. While a sudden collapse of the dollar’s dominance is unlikely, a gradual decline in trust could lead to a more multipolar currency world, where the dollar shares influence with other currencies or alternative assets. Cryptocurrencies: A Potential Beneficiary? In the context of eroding trust in traditional financial systems and dollar assets , cryptocurrencies emerge as a fascinating alternative. The core principles of many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, resonate with the very concerns Yellen’s warning raises: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies operate outside the direct control of governments and central banks, offering a potential hedge against political and economic instability associated with specific nations. Transparency and Security: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and secure ledger for transactions, contrasting with the often opaque nature of traditional financial systems. Limited Supply (for some): Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have a capped supply, which some argue makes them a better store of value than fiat currencies prone to inflation. Global Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, potentially offering financial inclusion in regions where trust in local institutions is low. If US dollar trust continues to weaken, we might see an accelerated interest in cryptocurrencies as investors and institutions seek diversification and alternative stores of value. It’s important to note that cryptocurrencies are not without their own risks and volatility. However, in a world questioning the stability of traditional financial anchors, their appeal as a potential alternative could grow significantly. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what does Yellen’s warning mean for you as a crypto investor? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on geopolitical developments and policy changes that could impact the economic impact of the US dollar and global financial stability. News sources like Walter Bloomberg and reputable financial media outlets are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider diversifying your investment portfolio beyond traditional dollar assets . Cryptocurrencies, precious metals, and other alternative assets could play a role in mitigating risk. Understand Crypto Fundamentals: Deepen your understanding of the fundamentals of different cryptocurrencies. Focus on projects with strong technology, sound tokenomics, and real-world use cases. Manage Risk: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Implement robust risk management strategies, including position sizing and stop-loss orders, to protect your capital. Long-Term Perspective: View cryptocurrency investments with a long-term perspective. Market fluctuations are inherent, but the underlying trend of digital asset adoption remains strong. Conclusion: Navigating a Shifting Financial Landscape Janet Yellen’s warning about Trump policies potentially undermining US dollar trust is a stark reminder that the global financial landscape is constantly evolving. While the dollar’s dominance has been a cornerstone of the world economy for decades, it is not immutable. Erosion of trust in traditional institutions and currencies can pave the way for alternative financial systems and assets to gain prominence. For the cryptocurrency market, this could represent a significant opportunity. As investors and nations grapple with uncertainty, the decentralized, transparent, and globally accessible nature of cryptocurrencies may become increasingly attractive. The coming years could witness a fascinating shift in the balance of global finance, and understanding the dynamics of dollar assets and alternative systems like crypto will be paramount for navigating this evolving landscape. The message is clear: pay attention, stay informed, and be prepared for potential shifts in the financial tectonic plates.

Software Glitches: Like any software, cryptocurrency wallets can have bugs or vulnerabilities. These might be triggered by specific network conditions or internal system interactions, leading to unexpected behavior. Security Concerns: In some cases, withdrawal suspensions might be initiated as a precautionary measure if a potential security vulnerability is detected in the wallet system. This allows the exchange to investigate and patch the issue before any exploitation can occur. Maintenance and Upgrades: Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance and upgrades to wallet systems can sometimes necessitate temporary withdrawal suspensions. In Binance’s case, it appears to have been a technical glitch rather than a security breach, given the focus on ‘wallet issue’ and the relatively quick resolution. The exchange’s ability to swiftly address and resolve the problem is a testament to their operational capabilities. Navigating ZEC Withdrawal Problem: Tips for Crypto Users Encountering a ZEC withdrawal problem or any withdrawal issue on a cryptocurrency exchange can be frustrating. Here are some actionable insights and tips for crypto users to navigate such situations: Stay Informed: The first step is to stay informed. Monitor the exchange’s official communication channels, such as their X account, announcements page, and support channels. This is where they will typically post updates about withdrawal issues and resolutions. Contact Support: If you are experiencing withdrawal problems, reach out to Binance Customer Support directly. Provide them with relevant details, such as transaction IDs or error messages, to help them investigate your specific case. Check Network Status: Sometimes, withdrawal issues can be related to broader network congestion or problems with the cryptocurrency’s blockchain itself. Check blockchain explorers or network status websites to see if there are any reported issues on the Zcash network. Patience is Key: Resolving technical issues takes time. While it’s understandable to be concerned, try to remain patient and avoid spreading misinformation or panic. Trust that reputable exchanges like Binance are working to resolve problems as quickly as possible. Consider Alternatives (If Urgent): If you urgently need access to your ZEC and withdrawals are still suspended, consider if there are alternative exchanges where you hold ZEC and withdrawals are operational. However, always prioritize security and due diligence when using new platforms. Diversification: As a general risk management strategy, consider diversifying your cryptocurrency holdings across multiple exchanges and personal wallets. This reduces your reliance on a single platform and mitigates the impact of any potential issues on one exchange. Crypto Withdrawals in General: A Core Functionality The Binance ZEC withdrawal incident, while resolved, underscores the critical importance of crypto withdrawals as a core functionality of any cryptocurrency exchange. Withdrawals are not merely about moving funds; they represent user control, asset ownership, and the fundamental principle of decentralization in the crypto space. Here’s why withdrawals are so vital: Aspect Importance of Crypto Withdrawals User Control Withdrawals empower users to have full control over their digital assets. They are not locked into an exchange and can move their funds as needed. Security Moving funds to a personal wallet (non-custodial) is often considered a more secure way to store cryptocurrencies long-term, reducing risks associated with exchange hacks or failures. Decentralization Withdrawals are a practical manifestation of the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies. They allow users to interact with the blockchain directly, outside of centralized intermediaries. Flexibility Users need withdrawals to participate in various crypto activities, such as staking, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols, or simply transacting with others directly. Exchange Accountability The ability to withdraw funds is a key measure of an exchange’s accountability and trustworthiness. Reliable withdrawal services are essential for user confidence and market integrity. For exchanges, ensuring smooth and reliable withdrawal processes is paramount for maintaining user trust and operating a successful cryptocurrency platform. Conclusion: Relief and Confidence Restored The swift resolution of the Zcash wallet issue and the resumption of ZEC withdrawals on Binance is undoubtedly positive news for the crypto community. It highlights Binance’s commitment to resolving technical challenges efficiently and transparently. For Zcash holders, it brings relief and restores confidence in the exchange’s services. More broadly, it reinforces the importance of reliable withdrawal functionality in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the crypto space continues to evolve, users can expect occasional technical hiccups, but the responsiveness and effectiveness of exchanges like Binance in addressing these issues will be crucial for sustained growth and adoption.

The leading cryptocurrency’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently broken its trendline, fueling optimism for a potential major breakout. Bitcoin Weekly RSI Turns Bullish Bitcoin has struggled under the weight of escalating global tariff wars, with the flagship digital asset losing more than 10% over the past three months. However, it appears to have found some stability in the low $80,000 range after dipping as low as $74,508 on April 6. Related Reading: Bitcoin Boom Still In Play? Analyst Predicts Final Leg Up In an X post published earlier today, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that BTC may be on the cusp of a “major breakout.” The analyst highlighted BTC’s weekly RSI breaking above its long-standing trendline – a technical development that often precedes significant momentum shifts in price action. For the uninitiated, BTC’s weekly RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of the digital asset’s price movements over a one-week timeframe. It helps identify whether BTC is overbought – typically above 70 – or oversold – typically below 30 – signaling potential trend reversals or continuations. In the chart shared by Titan of Crypto, BTC’s weekly RSI can be seen breaking a downtrend for the third time since September 2024. Interestingly, the previous two breakouts in weekly RSI were followed by major rallies that pushed Bitcoin’s price significantly higher in the weeks that followed. Using a price fractal pattern – highlighted in yellow – Titan of Crypto suggested that if BTC mirrors previous price behavior following RSI breakouts, it could climb to as high as $130,000. Such a move would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the asset and signal renewed market enthusiasm. Similarly, fellow crypto analyst RookieXBT pointed out that BTC is currently trading inside a falling wedge pattern on the 12-hour chart. Falling wedge formations typically resolve to the upside, and RookieXBT suggests that a breakout could drive BTC’s price to around $140,575. BTC Could Be Showing A False Bullish Momentum However, not all analysts share the same bullish outlook. Seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez offered a contrasting view, warning that BTC may be forming a rising wedge pattern – a bearish technical signal that could lead to downside pressure. If this pattern plays out, Martinez believes BTC could fall back to the critical support level at $79,000. In addition to chart patterns, macroeconomic tensions continue to loom large. The ongoing tariff disputes are putting pressure on risk assets, including BTC. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies Key Bitcoin Demand Zone For ‘Substantial Gains’ – Details Adding to the concerns, Bitcoin recently formed a “death cross” – a bearish technical signal where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average – which may result in further losses.

43351594,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149283,1744682446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Brutal Crypto Truth: Peter Brandt Slams Ethereum as ‘Worthless Garbage’ – Should You Worry?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/brandt-ethereum-worthless-garbage-crypto/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The ever-volatile world of digital currencies just got another jolt of controversy, this time courtesy of veteran trader Peter Brandt. In a recent Twitter (or X, as it’s now called) exchange, Brandt didn’t mince words when describing Ethereum (ETH), labeling it as “worthless garbage.” This explosive statement has sent ripples across the crypto community, sparking debates and raising eyebrows. But what exactly fueled Brandt’s harsh critique, and more importantly, what does it mean for the future of Ethereum and your crypto portfolio? Peter Brandt’s Crypto Criticism: A Veteran’s Verdict on Ethereum For those unfamiliar, Peter Brandt is a name synonymous with seasoned trading expertise in traditional markets and, more recently, the crypto space. With decades of experience under his belt, Brandt’s opinions often carry significant weight. His agreement with X user @Web3Kristel, who pointed out the intricate and often confusing nature of transferring assets between the Ethereum mainnet and its layer-2 scaling solutions, wasn’t just a casual remark. It was a pointed jab at what Brandt perceives as fundamental flaws in the Ethereum ecosystem. But why such a strong reaction? Let’s break down the core of the issue: Complexity Concerns: The initial tweet that triggered Brandt’s response highlighted the user-unfriendly experience of navigating between Ethereum’s main network and its layer-2 networks. Think of it like having to switch between different bank accounts just to make a simple transaction – cumbersome and frustrating for the average user. “Worthless Garbage” Accusation: Brandt’s agreement and escalation to “worthless garbage” suggests a deeper dissatisfaction beyond just user experience. It implies a fundamental questioning of ETH’s value proposition, perhaps hinting at concerns about its technology, scalability, or long-term viability in the face of competing blockchains. While Brandt’s statement is undeniably provocative, it’s crucial to understand the context and delve deeper into the issues he implicitly raises. Is he just being a contrarian, or is there a valid point hidden beneath the harsh rhetoric? Decoding Layer 2: Understanding the Ethereum Scaling Debate To grasp the gravity of Brandt’s criticism, we need to understand what layer-2 networks are and why they are central to the Ethereum narrative. Ethereum, while being the second-largest cryptocurrency and a hub for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs, has faced scalability challenges. The main Ethereum network, often referred to as layer-1, can become congested, leading to slow transaction speeds and high gas fees – especially during periods of peak demand. Layer-2 solutions are designed to address these very issues. They are essentially separate networks built on top of the Ethereum mainnet. These networks handle transactions off-chain, processing them faster and cheaper, before settling them back on the main Ethereum chain. Think of layer-2s as express lanes on a highway, designed to alleviate traffic congestion on the main road. Popular examples of Ethereum layer-2 solutions include: Polygon (MATIC): A widely adopted layer-2 scaling solution offering various tools to improve speed and reduce transaction costs. Arbitrum: An optimistic rollup that bundles transactions together to increase throughput and lower fees. Optimism: Another optimistic rollup focused on scalability and EVM compatibility. zkSync: A zero-knowledge rollup that utilizes advanced cryptography for enhanced privacy and scalability. These layer-2 networks aim to make Ethereum more accessible and usable for everyday transactions and applications. However, as @Web3Kristel pointed out, and Peter Brandt agreed with, the process of bridging assets between the mainnet and these layer-2s can be complex and confusing for users. This complexity becomes a significant barrier to entry and seamless user experience. Is ETH Really Worthless Garbage? Examining the Counterarguments Peter Brandt’s “worthless garbage” label is undoubtedly sensational, designed to grab attention and provoke reaction. But is it a fair assessment of ETH ? Many would vehemently disagree. Ethereum boasts a massive ecosystem, a vibrant developer community, and a wide range of use cases that extend far beyond just being a currency. Here’s a look at some counterarguments and why many believe ETH holds significant value: Network Effects: Ethereum enjoys powerful network effects. Its vast ecosystem of dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs creates a strong gravitational pull, attracting users, developers, and capital. This established network is a significant advantage that is hard to replicate. Technological Advancements: Ethereum is constantly evolving. The recent “Merge” to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was a monumental upgrade, significantly reducing its energy consumption and paving the way for further scalability improvements. Ongoing development efforts are focused on enhancing layer-2 solutions and exploring sharding to further boost network capacity. Use Cases Beyond Currency: ETH is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s the fuel that powers the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s used to pay for transaction fees, interact with smart contracts, and participate in DeFi protocols. Its utility goes far beyond simple peer-to-peer transactions. Decentralization and Innovation: Ethereum remains a leading platform for innovation in the decentralized space. It fosters a permissionless and open-source environment that encourages experimentation and the development of groundbreaking applications. While layer-2 complexity is a valid concern, dismissing ETH as “worthless garbage” seems overly simplistic and ignores the significant value and potential inherent in the Ethereum ecosystem. Brandt’s statement, while attention-grabbing, might be more about highlighting the existing challenges rather than an outright declaration of ETH’s demise. Navigating the Crypto Market Volatility: Brandt’s Statement in Context It’s important to remember that the crypto market is known for its extreme volatility and often polarizing opinions. Peter Brandt’s statement should be viewed within this context. He is known for his strong opinions and isn’t shy about expressing them, especially when it comes to market analysis and critiques. Consider these points when interpreting Brandt’s remarks: Market Sentiment: Crypto markets are heavily influenced by sentiment. Negative comments from influential figures like Brandt can contribute to short-term price fluctuations. However, these short-term reactions often don’t reflect the long-term fundamentals of a project. Trading Perspective: Brandt is primarily a trader. His analysis often focuses on price action and market trends. His “worthless garbage” comment might be a reflection of his current market outlook or a trading strategy rather than a deeply researched fundamental analysis of Ethereum’s technology. Clickbait and Engagement: In the age of social media, provocative statements often generate more engagement and visibility. Brandt’s tweet certainly achieved that, sparking widespread discussion and debate within the crypto community. Therefore, while Brandt’s criticism is noteworthy due to his experience and influence, it’s crucial to avoid knee-jerk reactions and consider a broader perspective. The crypto market thrives on differing opinions and critical analysis, and Brandt’s statement is just one voice in a very noisy and dynamic space. Challenges of Layer 2 Networks: Addressing the Complexity Concerns Let’s circle back to the core issue that triggered Brandt’s comment: the complexity of layer-2 networks. While layer-2 solutions are essential for Ethereum’s scalability, their current implementation does present challenges for users. Here are some of the key challenges associated with layer-2 networks: Bridging Complexity: Moving assets between Ethereum mainnet and layer-2s often involves bridging mechanisms that can be technically complex and time-consuming. Users need to understand different bridging protocols and may encounter gas fees on both the mainnet and the layer-2 network. Fragmented Liquidity: Liquidity can become fragmented across different layer-2 networks. This means that trading and DeFi activities might be spread across multiple platforms, potentially reducing efficiency and increasing slippage. User Experience Friction: The need to understand and navigate different layer-2 networks, bridging processes, and potentially different wallets can create a fragmented and less user-friendly experience compared to using a single, unified network. Security Considerations: While layer-2s inherit security from the Ethereum mainnet to varying degrees, users need to be aware of the specific security models and potential risks associated with each layer-2 solution and bridging protocol. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the long-term success and mainstream adoption of Ethereum and its layer-2 ecosystem. Efforts are underway to simplify bridging processes, improve user interfaces, and enhance the overall interoperability between layer-2 networks. As the technology matures, we can expect to see more seamless and user-friendly solutions emerge. Conclusion: Navigating the Noise and Focusing on Fundamentals Peter Brandt’s “worthless garbage” comment regarding Ethereum is undoubtedly a powerful statement that has ignited debate within the crypto community. While his criticism highlights valid concerns about the complexity of layer-2 networks, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of the evolving crypto landscape and Ethereum’s ongoing development. Dismissing ETH outright ignores its vast ecosystem, technological advancements, and the significant value it provides to the decentralized web. Instead of getting caught up in sensational headlines, it’s crucial for investors and users to conduct their own research, understand the nuances of Ethereum and layer-2 solutions, and form informed opinions. The crypto market is full of noise and differing viewpoints, but by focusing on the fundamentals and understanding the underlying technology, you can navigate the volatility and make sound decisions in this exciting and rapidly changing space.

The price remains stuck in a near-term downtrend from its early 2025 highs near $3.50, having found resistance at its 50DMA over the weekend. That said, XRP enjoyed a strong bounce from its 200DMA last week and is up over 30% from monthly lows, suggesting the bulls have not lost control of this market yet. Resilient price action in recent sessions combined with elevated trading volumes suggests that whales could be accumulating in the background. Do they know something that retail doesn’t? Do the XRP Whales Know Something That Retail Doesn’t? Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, confirmed that the fintech company has reached a dismissal agreement with the SEC in an interview on Fox Business on Monday. BREAKING: Brad Garlinghouse confirms Ripple has reached a dismissal agreement with SEC staff.

Let… pic.twitter.com/8qgY9HXYeE — Ripple Queen (@Ripple_queen) April 14, 2025 Ripple Labs, the creator of the XRP Ledger and cryptocurrency, was fined by the SEC back in 2020. However, a series of legal setbacks combined with the arrival of the pro-crypto Trump administration in the White House has seen the SEC back off from lawsuits against major crypto market players, including Ripple Labs . However, this isn’t the key development. XRP already ripped higher since Trump’s November victory in anticipation of a friendlier approach from regulators. The key headline here is that Ripple Labs might settle the lawsuit by handing over $50 million in XRP tokens to the US government. That would establish XRP as one of the top assets in the US government’s recently established crypto stockpile (which is separate from its strategic Bitcoin reserve ). The fact that the US government would be officially stockpiling XRP would be a major bullish signal for the crypto. For now, XRP is likely to remain at the whims of the broader market. Developments relating to tariff wars, the state of the US economy and the Fed are key to watch. If XRP is able to break above its 50DMA and recent downtrend, a 60% jump back to 2025 highs could be on the cards. Alternative to Consider – SUBBD (SUBBD) XRP could see a near-term bounce, but market conditions may remain choppy. A good opportunity to accumulate for sure, but XRP investors might also want to check out an exciting new token called SUBBD (SUBBD) .

Just when you thought the naming conventions couldn’t get any more intriguing, they throw in a ‘.1’! But beyond the quirky nomenclature, these new models – GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano – are serious contenders in the rapidly evolving coding AI arena. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, where innovation in technology is paramount, understanding advancements like GPT-4.1 is crucial. Let’s dive into what makes these models tick and why they matter. What’s the Hype Around OpenAI’s New GPT-4.1 ? OpenAI isn’t just tweaking around the edges; they’re making bold moves. The GPT-4.1 family is explicitly designed to excel at coding and instruction following. Think of it as specialized tools crafted for developers. Here’s a quick rundown: Multimodal Capabilities: These models aren’t just about text; they are multimodal, meaning they can process and understand various types of data, including text and potentially images or audio (though primarily text focused for this release as per content). Massive Context Window: Boasting a 1-million-token context window, GPT-4.1 can digest an enormous amount of information at once. To put it in perspective, that’s roughly 750,000 words – surpassing the length of ‘War and Peace’! This massive window allows for incredibly complex tasks and nuanced understanding in coding projects. API Access: Currently, GPT-4.1 is available through OpenAI’s API, meaning developers can start integrating these powerful models into their applications and workflows right away. However, it’s not yet available on the more consumer-facing ChatGPT platform. This launch is happening against a backdrop of intense competition. Tech giants like Google with Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek with V3 are all pushing the boundaries of coding AI . The race is on to build the most sophisticated programming models, and OpenAI is clearly determined to stay ahead. The Grand Vision: Agentic Software Engineering AI OpenAI’s ambitions are sky-high. They’re not just aiming for better coding tools; they’re envisioning a future with “agentic software engineering AI .” Imagine AI that can: Program entire applications end-to-end. Handle quality assurance and rigorous bug testing. Generate comprehensive documentation. Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s CFO, hinted at this grand vision, emphasizing the creation of an “agentic software engineer.” GPT-4.1 is a significant stride towards this ambitious goal. According to an OpenAI spokesperson, GPT-4.1 is optimized based on direct developer feedback, focusing on: Frontend Coding Improvements. Reduced Extraneous Edits. Reliable Format Following. Consistent Response Structure and Ordering. Dependable Tool Usage. These enhancements are designed to empower developers to build agents that are significantly more adept at real-world software engineering AI tasks. GPT-4.1 vs. The Competition: Benchmarks and Performance In the competitive landscape of AI models , benchmarks are crucial. OpenAI claims GPT-4.1 outperforms its predecessors, GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, on coding benchmarks like SWE-bench. However, let’s break down the performance metrics and compare them to rivals: Model SWE-bench Verified Score Context Window (Tokens) GPT-4.1 52% – 54.6% 1 Million Gemini 2.5 Pro 63.8% 1 Million Claude 3.7 Sonnet 62.3% Unknown (but large) While GPT-4.1 shows strong performance, it’s slightly behind Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark. It’s important to note that OpenAI reported a score range for GPT-4.1 due to infrastructure limitations in running all benchmark solutions. GPT-4.1 Mini and Nano: Speed and Efficiency Alongside the full GPT-4.1 model, OpenAI introduced GPT-4.1 mini and nano versions. These are designed for different priorities: GPT-4.1 mini: Offers a balance between speed and accuracy, being more efficient than the full model but with some trade-offs in accuracy. GPT-4.1 nano: Prioritizes speed and cost-effectiveness, touted as OpenAI’s fastest and cheapest model ever. This comes with a further reduction in accuracy compared to mini and the full GPT-4.1. Here’s a look at the pricing structure, which is crucial for developers considering integration: Model Input Tokens (per million) Output Tokens (per million) GPT-4.1 $2.00 $8.00 GPT-4.1 mini $0.40 $1.60 GPT-4.1 nano $0.10 $0.40 The tiered pricing allows developers to choose the model that best fits their needs and budget, whether they require top-tier performance or prioritize speed and cost savings. Important Caveats: Limitations and Real-World Readiness of Coding AI Despite the impressive capabilities, it’s crucial to maintain a realistic perspective. Even the most advanced AI models today have limitations. Key points to consider: Security Vulnerabilities and Bugs: Studies have shown that code-generating models can often fail to fix, or even introduce, security vulnerabilities and bugs. This remains a significant challenge for relying solely on AI for critical software components. Reliability Degradation with Input Size: OpenAI acknowledges that GPT-4.1 becomes less reliable as the input token size increases. Accuracy can drop significantly when dealing with very large inputs, as demonstrated by their internal OpenAI-MRCR test. Literal Interpretation: GPT-4.1 tends to be more literal than GPT-4o, sometimes requiring more explicit and detailed prompts to achieve the desired outcome. This means developers might need to refine their prompting techniques to get the best results. Actionable Insights for Crypto and Blockchain Developers For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, coding AI like GPT-4.1 presents exciting opportunities. Here’s how you can think about leveraging these models: Smart Contract Development: Use GPT-4.1 to assist in writing and auditing smart contract code. While not a replacement for thorough human review, it can speed up development and help identify potential issues early on. Automated Testing: Implement GPT-4.1 for automated testing of blockchain applications. Its ability to understand complex instructions and large context windows can be valuable in creating comprehensive test suites. Documentation Generation: Utilize GPT-4.1 to automatically generate documentation for your crypto projects, saving time and ensuring clarity for users and developers alike. Rapid Prototyping: Leverage the speed of GPT-4.1 nano for rapid prototyping of new blockchain features or applications, quickly iterating on ideas and concepts. Conclusion: Embracing the Future of AI Models in Coding OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 family marks another significant leap forward in the evolution of AI models , particularly in the domain of coding AI and software engineering AI . With enhanced capabilities, massive context windows, and tiered model options, developers now have powerful new tools at their disposal. While benchmarks provide a snapshot of performance, and limitations exist, the trajectory is clear: AI is becoming an increasingly integral part of the software development lifecycle. For the crypto and blockchain world, staying abreast of these advancements is not just beneficial—it’s essential for remaining competitive and innovative. As OpenAI continues to refine and expand its GPT-4.1 offerings, the potential for transforming how we build and interact with technology is immense.

Injective just dropped IBC Eureka, an upgrade that’s turning heads across DeFi. Meanwhile, Cronos is making subtle but significant market moves that deserve attention. As the market reels from last week’s Bitcoin dip and macroeconomic uncertainty keeps crypto pricing volatile, these updates feel like fresh air in an otherwise sluggish April. Participants are hunting for trending cryptos to buy, especially those offering real application and strong upside. But among all the buzz, one underdog is catching serious traction— Qubetics ($TICS). This project isn’t just building hype; it’s deploying features with real-world value that might give even the most established coins a run for their money. While Injective plays the infrastructure game in the Cosmos ecosystem and Cronos stabilizes after price drops, Qubetics is busy solving problems that have plagued digital assets for years. By putting tokenized real-world assets at the center of its tech, it’s unlocking new use cases for both individuals and businesses. And with its presale still active and heating up, early adopters are eyeing this Layer 1 project as more than just another option—they see it as a shot at significant gains. Here’s why Qubetics might just be the real MVP of trending cryptos to buy right now. Qubetics Is Making Real-World Tokenization Actually Work The buzz around tokenized real-world assets is nothing new, but Qubetics is doing more than just talking—it’s building the infrastructure to support it. The Qubetics tokenization marketplace transforms physical and digital assets into tradable tokens using next-gen blockchain tech. That’s not just good for security—it changes the entire liquidity game. From intellectual property rights and real estate to luxury assets and commodities, Qubetics is enabling smoother, smarter trading options for diverse asset types. And all of it happens in one multi-chain ecosystem—because Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator that unifies the top blockchains. Think about what this means for businesses: an artist can fractionalize their work and give fans digital ownership rights. A startup can tokenize its equity to raise funds faster. Even someone holding rare collectibles can unlock liquidity without giving up full ownership. Qubetics gives these participants the tools to tokenize, trade, and diversify—securely and efficiently. Qubetics Presale Is Where ROI Potential Gets Real for Trending Cryptos to Buy The Qubetics presale is now in its 30th stage and each round only lasts 7 days—after which the price spikes by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. The current price stands at $0.1729, and over 508 million $TICS tokens have already been sold. That adds up to a presale tally exceeding $16.1 million, with more than 24,700 participants jumping in. This isn’t just hype—it’s serious traction. If the current price jumps to just $1, that’s a 477.85% ROI. But things get even more interesting when projections hit higher. A rise to $5 brings 2,789.31%, and at $6, it skyrockets to 3,367.17%. A $10 scenario after the mainnet launch (expected in Q2 2025) means 5,678.61% ROI, while the big $15 milestone translates to 8,567.92%. Here’s what that looks like in practice: someone who puts in just $100 right now could earn $8,567 if the coin hits $15. The numbers aren’t just attractive—they’re persuasive. This is exactly why Qubetics isn’t just another name among trending cryptos to buy —it’s potentially the best crypto presale of the year. And it’s not waiting around for the perfect market conditions. It’s building regardless. If you’re looking to break out of the cycle of late entries and missed chances, this might be the moment. Injective Turns Up the Heat with IBC Eureka to Supercharge DeFi Access Injective is getting surgical about how it scales, and it just made a massive leap with its new upgrade: IBC Eureka. Announced on April 11, this major enhancement drastically improves DeFi functionality within the Cosmos ecosystem, optimizing how smart contracts interact across chains. Injective has always been about interoperability and blazing-fast transactions, but Eureka takes that up a notch by simplifying cross-chain logic and streamlining liquidity flows. It reduces gas usage and adds a level of customization that makes dApp deployment way more efficient. With this release, Injective is giving smart contract developers and DeFi architects better tooling to experiment and innovate faster. IBC Eureka also improves transaction throughput and reduces latency, making it way more efficient for protocols looking to scale within Cosmos. This isn’t some vague upgrade either—the new features are live and open-sourced, which shows how committed Injective is to pushing boundaries. For community members tracking trending cryptos to buy, Injective’s latest move might just make it a top contender in the race for next-gen DeFi dominance. Cronos Price Pullback Grabs Attention, But Underlying Strength Remains Cronos ($CRO) might be down 3.31% in 24 hours, trading at $0.08635 as of April 13, 2025, but there’s more going on under the surface. The 24-hour trading volume is holding at $20.65 million, and the market cap sits around $2.29 billion. While short-term traders might be spooked, those watching the metrics know that Cronos is still playing the long game. With a circulating supply of 26.57 billion CRO out of a max supply of 100 billion, it has plenty of room to maneuver, especially considering its FDV of $8.63 billion. The real story, though, is about stabilizing after volatility. While other coins are bleeding, Cronos is showing resilience. Its Vol/Mkt Cap ratio at 0.9001% indicates consistent engagement from community participants. Though the price action has dipped, the fundamentals remain solid. For anyone exploring trending cryptos to buy, this short-term correction might just be a setup for a strong Q2 comeback—especially as the Crypto.com rebranding to Cronos gains traction and reshapes its brand identity in the market. Why These Three Coins Might Define the Next Crypto Cycle Every project mentioned here is doing something that matters. Injective is rewriting DeFi’s backend with its IBC Eureka upgrade, setting the standard for smart contract scalability and cross-chain optimization. Cronos, despite its recent pullback, continues to stand on strong fundamentals and consistent ecosystem development. But Qubetics? That’s the curveball that could change the whole game. With real-world application through asset tokenization, a multi-chain backbone, and ROI projections that hit hard, Qubetics is clearly more than just a presale. Among all trending cryptos to buy, Qubetics stands out for delivering functionality that most projects only promise. The fact that it’s still accessible makes it one of the few early-stage entries left with this kind of upside. Those looking to join this best crypto presale while it’s still under the radar might want to act before the next Sunday price hike. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other Layer 1 blockchains? Qubetics is the first Web3 aggregator that unifies top chains while offering a real-world asset tokenization marketplace with actual use cases. What stage is the Qubetics presale at right now? The Qubetics presale is in its 30th stage, priced at $0.1729, and increasing 10% every 7 days—usually every Sunday at midnight. Is Qubetics one of the trending cryptos to buy in 2025? Yes, due to its real-world applications, tokenization platform, and active presale, it’s considered one of the trending cryptos to buy.

This time, the delay concerns the approval of ‘in-kind’ creations and redemptions, a mechanism considered vital for the efficient operation of these investment vehicles. The decision, initially anticipated, is now slated for June 3rd , affecting applications from prominent players like WisdomTree and VanEck. Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett broke the news via X, adding another layer of anticipation to the already complex world of crypto ETF regulation. What’s the Buzz About the SEC ETF Delay? The SEC’s decision to postpone its verdict on in-kind creations and redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs isn’t just a procedural hiccup; it’s a significant event that could reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency investments. For those deeply invested in or closely monitoring the crypto markets, this delay introduces a period of uncertainty and speculation. But what exactly are in-kind creations and redemptions, and why is the SEC’s stance so critical? Let’s break it down: In-Kind Creations and Redemptions Explained: Imagine an ETF as a basket holding assets – in this case, Bitcoin or Ethereum. ‘Creation’ is when new shares of the ETF are issued, and ‘redemption’ is when existing shares are bought back. ‘In-kind’ means these transactions happen using the underlying assets themselves (Bitcoin or Ethereum) rather than cash. Why In-Kind Matters: This mechanism is generally seen as more tax-efficient and cost-effective for ETF operations. It allows authorized participants (large financial institutions) to create or redeem ETF shares by directly exchanging baskets of Bitcoin or Ethereum, streamlining the process and potentially lowering costs for investors. The SEC’s Hesitation: The SEC’s delay suggests ongoing scrutiny and potentially unresolved concerns around the operational mechanics and investor protection aspects of in-kind creations and redemptions in the volatile crypto market. This postponement affects applications from WisdomTree and VanEck, two firms eagerly waiting to bring their spot crypto ETFs to the U.S. market with full operational capabilities. The delay implies that the SEC is still diligently assessing the implications of these financial products, ensuring they align with regulatory standards and protect investors from potential risks. Decoding the Crypto ETF Regulation Maze Navigating the regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs has been anything but straightforward. The SEC’s cautious approach reflects a broader concern about the nascent and often volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Understanding the nuances of crypto ETF regulation is crucial for investors and market participants alike. Here are key points to consider regarding crypto ETF regulation: Investor Protection First: The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors. In the context of crypto ETFs, this means rigorously evaluating aspects like market manipulation, custody of digital assets, and the overall risk profile of these investment products. Evolving Regulatory Framework: Regulations around cryptocurrencies are still evolving globally. The SEC is tasked with applying existing securities laws to a novel asset class, which requires careful consideration and can lead to delays and cautious decision-making. Global Precedent vs. U.S. Approach: While other countries have approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, the U.S. market, being the largest, carries significant weight. The SEC’s decisions set a precedent and influence global regulatory approaches to crypto assets. Spot vs. Futures ETFs: It’s worth noting that the SEC has already approved Bitcoin futures ETFs. However, spot ETFs, which directly hold Bitcoin, are considered by many to be a more direct and potentially efficient investment vehicle, hence the heightened anticipation and regulatory scrutiny. The current delay underscores the SEC’s commitment to a thorough review process, even as the crypto industry pushes for broader acceptance and easier access to digital asset investments through ETFs. Bitcoin ETF In-Kind: What’s the Hold Up? The concept of Bitcoin ETF in-kind creation and redemption is central to this SEC delay. While seemingly technical, it has practical implications for how Bitcoin ETFs would function and how investors might benefit. So, what’s causing the hold-up? Potential reasons for the SEC’s hesitation on in-kind for Bitcoin ETFs could include: Custody Concerns: Ensuring the secure custody of Bitcoin used in in-kind transactions is paramount. The SEC needs to be satisfied that robust and regulated custody solutions are in place to prevent loss or theft. Market Manipulation Risks: The SEC is wary of potential market manipulation in the Bitcoin market. In-kind mechanisms need to be designed to prevent any exploitation that could disadvantage ETF investors. Valuation and Pricing: Accurately and transparently valuing Bitcoin and ETF shares during in-kind transactions is crucial. The SEC may be seeking assurances on the robustness of pricing mechanisms and fair valuation practices. Operational Complexity: Implementing in-kind creations and redemptions for a novel asset like Bitcoin adds operational complexity. The SEC needs to be convinced that the proposed operational frameworks are sound and efficient. These potential concerns highlight the SEC’s due diligence in ensuring that Bitcoin ETFs, especially with in-kind functionality, operate smoothly, securely, and in a manner that protects investor interests. Ethereum ETF In-Kind: Mirroring Bitcoin’s Regulatory Path? The delay also extends to Ethereum ETF in-kind creations and redemptions, indicating a consistent approach from the SEC towards both leading cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, while sharing similarities with Bitcoin, has its own unique characteristics and regulatory considerations. How does the situation with Ethereum ETFs mirror or diverge from Bitcoin ETFs in the context of in-kind and SEC scrutiny? Similar Regulatory Hurdles: Many of the concerns raised for Bitcoin ETFs, such as custody, market manipulation, and valuation, equally apply to Ethereum ETFs. The SEC is likely applying a similar level of scrutiny to both. Proof-of-Stake Considerations: Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism introduces additional complexities compared to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work. The SEC might be evaluating how staking and related aspects impact ETF operations and investor risks. Smart Contract Functionality: Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities, while innovative, also add a layer of complexity from a regulatory perspective. The SEC might be considering any potential implications of this functionality for ETF structures. Market Maturity: While both are leading cryptocurrencies, the Ethereum market has its own dynamics and liquidity profiles. The SEC’s assessment might factor in these market-specific characteristics when evaluating Ethereum ETF in-kind mechanisms. The parallel delays for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF in-kind decisions suggest a comprehensive and consistent regulatory approach to crypto spot ETFs, regardless of the underlying cryptocurrency. Spot Bitcoin ETF Decision: What’s Next? With the Spot Bitcoin ETF decision now pushed to June 3rd, the crypto community is left to speculate and prepare for the potential outcomes. What are the possible scenarios and what should investors watch out for? Looking ahead, here’s what to expect: Continued SEC Scrutiny: The delay indicates that the SEC is not rushing its decision. We can anticipate continued rigorous evaluation and potentially further questions or clarifications sought from ETF applicants. Market Volatility: News related to ETF approvals and delays often triggers volatility in the crypto markets. Investors should be prepared for potential price swings as June 3rd approaches and the SEC’s decision becomes imminent. Industry Engagement: ETF issuers and industry stakeholders will likely continue to engage with the SEC, providing information and addressing any outstanding concerns to facilitate a positive outcome. Long-Term Implications: Regardless of the immediate decision on in-kind, the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. is widely anticipated to be a significant catalyst for broader crypto adoption and institutional investment. The coming weeks leading up to June 3rd will be crucial. Market participants will be closely monitoring any signals from the SEC and analyzing the potential impact of the final decision on the future of crypto ETFs. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape The SEC’s postponement of the decision on in-kind creations and redemptions for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs is a stark reminder of the ongoing regulatory complexities in the cryptocurrency space. While delays can be frustrating, they also underscore the SEC’s commitment to investor protection and a thorough evaluation process. For investors, this means staying informed, understanding the nuances of crypto ETF regulation, and preparing for potential market fluctuations as the June 3rd decision date approaches. The ultimate approval of spot crypto ETFs with efficient in-kind mechanisms holds the promise of greater accessibility and maturity for the cryptocurrency market, but patience and careful navigation are key in this evolving landscape.

This uptick in demand has prompted some to speculate on the start of a new bullish phase. However, experts urge caution, as the market is still far from confirming a full trend reversal. Bitcoin Price Apparent Demand Shows Signs of Recovery Bitcoin’s apparent demand has shown signs of recovery, bouncing from a negative sentiment that had dominated the market for weeks. The 30-day sum of apparent demand has recently moved into positive territory, hinting at a possible shift in Bitcoin’s market behaviour. However, while the recovery is encouraging, some analysts caution that it may not yet signal the start of a complete market reversal. BTC/USD price chart (source: Cryptoquant) Looking at past cycles, similar patterns were followed by extended periods of consolidation, which prevent any quick conclusions about the rally’s sustainability. As observed during the 2021 cycle, an initial demand bounce was often followed by months of sideways movement before a proper recovery is achieved. Thus, while the recently notable performance cannot be denied, it still raises the question of whether the uptrend will continue. BTC Hashrate and Network Confidence With the increased apparent demand, Bitcoin’s hash rate is also rising. This increase means higher optimism among miners despite BTC/USD’s sideways trend. A higher hash rate points to increased network security and more distributed mining, both of which are positive for Bitcoin in the long run. “Bitcoin’s hashrate continues to explode to new highs,” noted analyst Miles Deutscher. “This signals increased network security, miner confidence, and potentially more decentralization, all of which are bullish signs for Bitcoin.” This trend supports the idea that Bitcoin remains a solid investment despite price fluctuations. With higher hashrates, Bitcoin’s security and decentralization improve, contributing to its long-term potential. Moreover, according to Robert Kiyosaki, investors have turned to Bitcoin as a “Safe haven” since the recent dollar crash. Support Levels Amid MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Accumulation Bitcoin’s price is currently testing critical support levels, with the most essential level identified at $82,024. This level, which corresponds to the point where 96,580 BTC were previously accumulated, is a key area to watch closely. Crypto analyst Ali Charts stated , “The most critical support for Bitcoin sits at $82,024, where 96,580 BTC were previously accumulated. A level worth watching closely!” A strong defense of this support level would indicate that buyers are in control and that a higher price move could be imminent. Institutional investors, including MicroStrategy, play a significant role in Bitcoin’s market performance. Recently, MicroStrategy purchased an additional 3,459 BTC to reach a total Bitcoin holdings of 531,644 BTC, which is equivalent to approximately $35.92 billion. Similarly, another institutional buyer, Metaplanet, bought 319 BTC for approximately $26.3 million. This indicates new institutional buying, which, if necessary, could support the Bitcoin price in case it falls. Moreover, the president of the ETF store, Nate Geraci, revealed in an X post that 79 companies have declared that they have Bitcoin on their balance sheets, indicating growing interest. Resistance Levels to Watch As Bitcoin Price Moves Higher As Bitcoin’s price continues its upward movement, it faces several key resistance levels. The first BTC price resistance level ranged from $74,000 to $78,000, and the current price has tested and broken this level. An upward breakout above this range has led to a surge in Bitcoin’s price to its next target, a pivotal point of control (POC) at $97,000. “While short-term momentum appears bullish, we still face multiple resistance hurdles before confirming the correction is complete,” said analyst Stockmoney Lizards. Beyond the $97,000 level, Bitcoin could move towards the $110,000 range, with the analysts predicting this level may be reached by late summer.

Acquired at an average price of $82,618 per Bitcoin, this latest investment pushes the firm’s total BTC holdings to an astonishing 531,644 coins—valued at nearly $45 billion based on current market prices. Funding the Buy with Equity Sales According to a recent SEC filing, the purchase was funded through the sale of company shares. Strategy sold 959,712 shares of MSTR stock within the same timeframe, generating approximately $286 million in net proceeds. The transaction was part of its ongoing Common ATM equity offering program. Even after this share sale, Strategy maintains substantial capacity for future funding. The company still holds over $2.08 billion in MSTR shares and approximately $21 billion in STRK shares that can be issued and sold down the line. Holding Steady Despite Market Turbulence The purchase comes on the heels of a one-week pause in acquisitions, during which the firm disclosed an unrealized loss of nearly $6 billion due to Bitcoin’s price drop. However, Saylor has shown no signs of changing course. On Sunday, he posted the company’s portfolio tracker on X (formerly Twitter)—a move that has historically signaled a pending buy. Despite the recent volatility, Strategy’s Bitcoin stash still shows approximately $9 billion in unrealized profits, with Bitcoin trading above $84,500 at the time of the announcement. Leading the Corporate Bitcoin Charge Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, owning around 2.5% of the total circulating supply. Other firms such as MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, and Galaxy Digital Holdings trail behind. Saylor’s firm continues to be a driving force in corporate Bitcoin adoption, frequently making large-scale purchases that reflect his unwavering belief in the cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value. Metaplanet Ramps Up Bitcoin Investment Meanwhile, in Asia, another Bitcoin-centric company is following a similar path. Metaplanet, often dubbed “Asia’s Strategy,” revealed its latest Bitcoin purchase on Monday. The Tokyo-based investment firm acquired $26 million worth of BTC, bringing its total to 4,525 coins. Despite the price swings triggered by political developments—including proposed tariff policies from former President Donald Trump—Metaplanet remains committed to reaching its goal of holding 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025.

The digital currency realm is buzzing with an electrifying wave of optimism. Fresh off the press, on-chain analytics powerhouse Santiment has dropped a bombshell report: bullish sentiment is surging across the crypto market , with Bitcoin leading the charge. What’s fueling this frenzy? Weekend tariff news that’s got traders feeling incredibly positive. But is this exuberance justified, or is it a classic case of FOMO brewing? Let’s dive into the heart of this exciting development. Decoding the Bullish Sentiment Surge in the Crypto Market Santiment’s latest analysis paints a vivid picture of a market brimming with confidence. According to their on-chain data, positive commentary within the crypto sphere has reached levels not seen since just before President Trump’s tariff announcement. This remarkable turnaround suggests a significant shift in market perception, driven primarily by the recent tariff exemptions. But what exactly does this mean for you, the crypto investor? Market-Wide Optimism: The surge isn’t isolated to just one or two cryptocurrencies. It’s a broad-based wave of bullishness sweeping across the entire crypto market, indicating a potentially strong and sustained upward trend. Bitcoin Leading the Charge: While the overall market is buoyant, Bitcoin, the king of crypto, is at the forefront of this sentiment surge. This is crucial because Bitcoin’s performance often dictates the direction of the altcoin market. Tariff News as a Catalyst: The weekend tariff exemption news acted as the primary trigger for this surge. This highlights the sensitivity of the crypto market to global economic and political developments. Historical Context: Comparing the current sentiment to pre-Trump tariff announcement levels gives us a historical benchmark. It suggests that the market has not only recovered from previous anxieties but is now potentially even more optimistic. Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum: Eyes on the $90,000 Mark Bitcoin, in particular, is basking in the glow of this renewed optimism. The leading cryptocurrency has shown remarkable resilience and is now firmly back in the spotlight. The question on everyone’s mind: can Bitcoin reach the coveted $90,000 mark this week? Santiment, while acknowledging the bullish momentum, has also issued a cautionary note regarding potential retail trader behavior. The Allure of $90,000 Bitcoin: Opportunity or Trap? The prospect of Bitcoin hitting $90,000 is undeniably exciting. For many, it represents a significant profit opportunity. However, Santiment’s warning about retail traders potentially exhibiting FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and greed as Bitcoin approaches this milestone is crucial. Let’s break down why this caution is warranted: FOMO-Driven Rallies: When prices rise rapidly, especially with a high-profile asset like Bitcoin, it often triggers FOMO among retail investors. This can lead to impulsive buying decisions, pushing prices up artificially and unsustainably. Greed Factor: As prices climb, greed can take over. Investors who initially planned to take profits at a certain level might become overly optimistic and hold on for even higher gains, potentially ignoring warning signs. Market Corrections: FOMO and greed-fueled rallies are often followed by sharp market corrections. When the initial excitement wanes, or if negative news emerges, these rapidly inflated prices can plummet just as quickly. Santiment’s Insight: Santiment’s expertise in on-chain analytics provides valuable early warnings. Their caution suggests that while the bullish sentiment is real, the market might be entering a phase of heightened risk due to potential speculative behavior. So, while the $90,000 target is within sight, it’s essential to approach this potential milestone with a balanced perspective, acknowledging both the opportunities and the risks. Tariff News: The Unexpected Catalyst for Crypto Optimism Why did tariff news spark such a significant surge in bullish sentiment ? The connection might not be immediately obvious, but when you delve deeper, the rationale becomes clear. Tariffs, in general, can create economic uncertainty and volatility. Exemptions, on the other hand, can signal a move towards greater economic stability and potentially lower inflation in certain sectors. Here’s how this ties into the crypto market: Factor Impact of Tariff Exemptions Positive Effect on Crypto Market Reduced Economic Uncertainty Tariff exemptions can be perceived as a step towards easing trade tensions and fostering a more predictable economic environment. Investors tend to favor risk assets like cryptocurrencies when economic uncertainty diminishes. Potential for Lower Inflation Reduced tariffs can lead to lower import costs, potentially easing inflationary pressures. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are often seen as a hedge against inflation. Lower inflation in traditional markets might still make crypto attractive as a diversifier. Improved Global Trade Outlook Tariff exemptions can signal a more positive outlook for global trade and economic growth. A healthier global economy generally benefits all asset classes, including the crypto market. Market Sentiment Boost Positive news like tariff exemptions can simply boost overall market sentiment, making investors more willing to take on risk. Improved sentiment in traditional markets often spills over into the crypto market, driving up prices and increasing trading activity. In essence, the tariff news provided a positive external trigger that reinforced the already underlying bullish tendencies in the crypto market. It acted as a catalyst, amplifying the existing optimism and propelling prices upwards. Navigating the Crypto Market with Bullish Sentiment and FOMO Awareness The current crypto market landscape is undeniably exciting, characterized by strong bullish sentiment and the potential for significant gains, especially with Bitcoin eyeing the $90,000 mark. However, it’s crucial to navigate this environment with both enthusiasm and caution. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Acknowledge the Bullish Trend: Recognize that the market is currently in a bullish phase, supported by positive on-chain data and external factors like tariff news. Be Aware of FOMO Risks: Heed Santiment’s warning about potential FOMO and greed. Avoid impulsive investment decisions driven by fear of missing out. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on market sentiment or hype. Conduct thorough research on any cryptocurrency you’re considering investing in. Manage Risk: Implement robust risk management strategies. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification can help mitigate risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if Bitcoin looks incredibly promising. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments, on-chain analytics, and news that could impact the crypto space. Platforms like Santiment and reputable crypto news sources are invaluable. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Bullish Sentiment, Responsibly The crypto market is flashing green, fueled by a surge in bullish sentiment following favorable tariff news . Bitcoin is leading the charge, with the tantalizing prospect of reaching $90,000. While the excitement is palpable and the potential for profit is real, it’s paramount to remain grounded and responsible. Be aware of the FOMO trap, conduct thorough research, and manage your risk wisely. This bullish wave could be incredibly rewarding, but only for those who navigate it with both enthusiasm and prudence. The crypto journey is always an adventure, and understanding market sentiment is a key compass in your hand.

Early reports indicate a staggering $7.4 million in losses, sending ripples of concern throughout the cryptocurrency community. Are your assets at risk? What exactly happened? Let’s delve into the details of this developing story and understand the implications of this DeFi hack . What Happened to the KiloEx Contract Address? According to on-chain data from Etherscan, a critical vulnerability was exploited in the KiloEx contract address . This breach has led to the unauthorized transfer of approximately $7.4 million worth of various digital assets. The incident is not isolated to a single blockchain; reports suggest that assets across multiple networks, including BNB Chain and Base, have been affected. This multi-chain impact highlights the sophisticated nature of the exploit and the widespread potential consequences for users who had entrusted their funds to the KiloEx platform. Here’s a breakdown of what we know so far: Incident: Security breach on KiloEx on-chain contract platform. Losses: Approximately $7.4 million reported. Affected Networks: BNB Chain and Base (potentially others). Assets Impacted: Multiple cryptocurrencies (specific details are still emerging). Source of Information: On-chain data from Etherscan.Devastating Crypto Security Breach: Unpacking the $7.4M Loss The scale of this crypto security breach is undoubtedly significant. A loss of $7.4 million is not just a number; it represents a substantial blow to investor confidence and underscores the ever-present risks within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the exact nature of the exploit is still under investigation, the immediate aftermath is clear: a large sum of funds has been illicitly drained from KiloEx. The community is now eagerly awaiting further details from KiloEx developers regarding the root cause of the vulnerability and the steps being taken to mitigate the damage and prevent future incidents. Let’s consider the potential impact of such a breach: Impact Area Description Financial Losses for Users Direct monetary losses for individuals who had assets on the KiloEx platform. Erosion of Trust in DeFi Incidents like these can weaken public trust in decentralized finance platforms, making users hesitant to engage. Regulatory Scrutiny Major security breaches often attract increased attention from regulatory bodies, potentially leading to stricter regulations for the crypto space. Market Volatility News of significant hacks can contribute to market instability and price fluctuations, particularly for related tokens and the broader DeFi sector. DeFi Hack: Another Blow to Decentralized Finance? Is this DeFi hack an isolated incident, or does it point to deeper systemic issues within decentralized finance? While DeFi offers numerous advantages like financial inclusion and permissionless access, it also presents unique security challenges. The decentralized and often open-source nature of DeFi protocols, while fostering innovation, can also create opportunities for malicious actors to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. Each successful hack serves as a stark reminder of the critical need for robust security audits, proactive vulnerability management, and enhanced security practices across the DeFi landscape. What can be done to bolster DeFi security? Rigorous Smart Contract Audits: Independent security audits by reputable firms are crucial before deployment. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivizing ethical hackers to find and report vulnerabilities can proactively identify weaknesses. Formal Verification: Employing mathematical methods to prove the correctness of smart contracts. Enhanced Monitoring and Alert Systems: Real-time monitoring of on-chain activity to detect and respond to suspicious transactions quickly. User Education: Empowering users with knowledge about security best practices, such as hardware wallets and risk management. Understanding Cryptocurrency Losses in the KiloEx Exploit The $7.4 million in cryptocurrency losses from the KiloEx breach is a significant sum, but understanding the types of assets lost and their potential recovery is crucial. Typically, in such exploits, a mix of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, major tokens like ETH and BNB, and potentially platform-specific tokens, are targeted. The recovery of these funds is often a complex and uncertain process. While law enforcement agencies and blockchain analysis firms may attempt to trace and recover stolen funds, the success rate is historically low. Users affected by the KiloEx breach are likely facing considerable uncertainty regarding the potential return of their assets. Key aspects regarding cryptocurrency losses in hacks: Asset Tracking: Blockchain analysis tools can track the movement of stolen funds on the blockchain. Recovery Challenges: Recovering stolen crypto is difficult due to the pseudonymous and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. Legal Recourse: Legal avenues for recovery are often complex and jurisdiction-dependent. Insurance (Limited): Crypto insurance is still a developing area, and coverage for DeFi exploits may be limited or unavailable. User Responsibility: While platforms bear responsibility for security, users also play a role in safeguarding their own assets through secure practices. On-Chain Platform Compromise: A Growing Concern for the Crypto Space The KiloEx incident underscores a broader and increasingly critical concern: on-chain platform compromise . As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures and more financial activity migrates on-chain, the security of these platforms becomes paramount. The KiloEx breach serves as a wake-up call, highlighting the need for continuous vigilance and innovation in security protocols for all on-chain platforms, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending platforms, and other DeFi applications. The industry must collectively prioritize security to foster trust and ensure the long-term sustainability of decentralized finance. Moving forward, what steps can be taken to mitigate the risk of on-chain platform compromise? Proactive Security Measures: Implementing robust security architectures from the outset, including multi-signature wallets, rate limiting, and anomaly detection systems. Community Collaboration: Fostering a culture of security awareness and collaboration within the crypto community to share threat intelligence and best practices. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Ongoing security assessments to identify and address emerging vulnerabilities. Transparency and Communication: Open communication with users about security measures and incident response plans builds trust. Innovation in Security Technology: Continued research and development of novel security technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation, to enhance on-chain security. Conclusion: A Stark Reminder of Crypto Security Imperative The KiloEx crypto security breach and the resulting $7.4 million in losses serve as a stark and urgent reminder of the ever-present risks in the cryptocurrency world. This incident is not just about financial losses; it’s about the trust we place in these platforms and the need for unwavering commitment to security. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, security must be at the forefront of innovation and development. Both platforms and users must remain vigilant, proactive, and informed to navigate the complex landscape of crypto security and protect their digital assets. The KiloEx exploit is a lesson learned, albeit a costly one, and the industry must heed its warning to build a more secure and resilient future for decentralized finance.

43353145,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149274,1744685442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Relief: EU Suspends Tariffs in Major Boost for US Trade Relations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eu-tariff-suspension-trade-boost/,"In a move signaling a potential thaw in global trade tensions, the European Union (EU) has announced a significant 90-day suspension of retaliatory tariffs against the United States. This news, initially reported by Yonhap News, comes as a welcome development amidst ongoing economic uncertainties. But what does this tariff suspension really mean, and how will it impact the global economic landscape? Let’s dive into the details. Understanding the EU Tariffs Suspension and US Trade Dynamics The core of this announcement is straightforward: the EU is pausing its retaliatory tariff measures on goods from the United States for a period of 90 days, starting from April 15th. This decision is directly linked to a statement from U.S. President Donald Trump last week, where he indicated a temporary halt on imposing reciprocal tariffs on several countries, including EU member states, also for a 90-day duration. To put it simply, both sides are stepping back from the brink of escalating trade disputes, at least for now. This US trade pause offers a window of opportunity for negotiation and potentially, a more lasting resolution to trade disagreements that have been simmering for some time. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key facts: Duration: 90-day suspension Effective Date: April 15th onwards Initiating Factor: US President’s announcement of a 90-day tariff suspension Scope: Retaliatory tariffs by the EU against the US Reason: To create a conducive environment for trade discussions and de-escalation Why is this 90-Day Tariff Suspension a Big Deal for the Global Economy? In today’s interconnected world, trade disputes between major economic blocs like the EU and the US can send ripples across the entire global economy . Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, can lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers, disrupt supply chains, and dampen overall economic growth. The EU’s decision to suspend tariffs, mirroring the US move, is therefore significant because: Reduces Trade Tensions: It immediately lowers the temperature in the trade relationship between the EU and the US, signaling a willingness to engage in constructive dialogue. Boosts Market Confidence: Businesses and investors thrive on stability and predictability. A tariff suspension, even temporary, can inject confidence into markets, encouraging investment and trade flows. Potential for Deeper Agreements: This 90-day window provides a crucial period for both sides to engage in meaningful negotiations aimed at resolving underlying trade issues and potentially forging more comprehensive trade agreements. Positive Impact on Supply Chains: Tariffs can disrupt intricate global supply chains. Suspension can help restore smoother operations and reduce uncertainties for businesses reliant on international trade. Positive Impacts of Tariff Suspension Potential Challenges Remain Reduced consumer prices (potentially) Increased business investment Strengthened global supply chains Improved investor sentiment Opportunity for trade negotiations Temporary nature of suspension Underlying trade disputes not resolved Possibility of tariffs re-implementation Geopolitical uncertainties Dependence on continued positive dialogue Benefits Beyond Immediate Relief: How Trade Relations Stand to Gain The benefits of this trade relations détente extend beyond just immediate tariff relief. A more stable and cooperative trade environment between the EU and the US can foster: Enhanced Economic Growth: Reduced trade barriers can stimulate economic activity on both sides of the Atlantic, leading to increased growth and job creation. Stronger Geopolitical Ties: Trade is not just about economics; it’s also a crucial element of international relations. Improved trade ties can strengthen the broader geopolitical alliance between the EU and the US. Innovation and Competition: Open trade encourages competition and innovation, as businesses strive to offer better products and services in a global marketplace. Consumer Choice and Affordability: Reduced tariffs can translate to a wider variety of goods available to consumers at potentially more affordable prices. Navigating the 90-Day Window: What to Watch Out For? While the tariff suspension is undoubtedly positive news, it’s essential to remember that it’s temporary. The underlying trade disagreements between the EU and the US have not vanished overnight. Key questions remain: Will meaningful negotiations take place during these 90 days? Can both sides bridge their differences and find common ground? What happens after the 90-day period? Will tariffs be reimposed, or will a more permanent solution be found? The answers to these questions will significantly shape the future trajectory of EU-US trade relations and their impact on the global economy. Businesses and investors should closely monitor trade policy developments and prepare for various scenarios. The Ripple Effect: Cryptocurrency Markets and Global Trade Optimism While seemingly distant, developments in global economy and trade policies can indirectly influence cryptocurrency markets. Positive news like the EU-US tariff suspension can contribute to a broader sense of economic optimism. Market sentiment in the cryptocurrency space is often influenced by macroeconomic factors and overall investor confidence. A stable and growing global economy, fostered by smoother trade relations, can create a more favorable environment for investment in various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, escalating trade wars and economic uncertainties can lead to market volatility and risk aversion. Actionable Insights: Staying Informed and Prepared For businesses, investors, and individuals alike, here are some actionable insights to consider during this 90-day tariff suspension period: Stay Informed: Closely monitor news and updates related to EU-US trade negotiations and policy announcements. Assess Supply Chains: Businesses should review their supply chains and assess how the tariff suspension and potential future trade developments might impact them. Diversify Investments: Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to mitigate risks associated with trade policy uncertainties. Engage in Dialogue: Businesses and industry stakeholders can engage in dialogue with policymakers to advocate for stable and predictable trade policies. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope, But Vigilance Remains Key The EU’s 90-day suspension of retaliatory tariffs is a welcome and urgent sign of de-escalation in trade tensions with the United States. It offers a valuable window of opportunity for both sides to engage in constructive dialogue and work towards more sustainable trade relations. This development injects a dose of optimism into the global economy and may indirectly benefit various sectors, including cryptocurrency markets, through improved investor sentiment. However, it’s crucial to remain vigilant. The suspension is temporary, and the underlying trade issues still need to be addressed. The next 90 days will be critical in determining whether this tariff suspension marks the beginning of a lasting improvement in EU-US trade relations or just a brief respite in an ongoing saga.

Pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Dr Altcoin wants the PiCoreTeam (PCT) to establish key guardrails to prevent a repeat of the OM incident for the Pi Network. The OM Incident Is A Huge Lesson For Pi Network Cryptocurrency expert Dr Altcoin has urged the Pi Network to learn valuable lessons from the grim Mantra (OM) incident. According to a post on X , Dr Altcoin called on the PiCoreTeam to lay a proper foundation to prevent steep price drops for token prices. The price of Mantra (OM) fell from $6.32 to $0.57 in one steep drop that left investors scratching their heads. OM, once ranked among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, tumbled by over 90% in a day, stoking speculations of a rug pull. While the official explanation puts the blame on liquidations, a consensus is forming that the steep drop is a “carefully orchestrated dump.” Market losses totaled $6 billion as a cohort of crypto traders lost $400 million after buying OM three days before the incident. However, Dr Altcoin wants the PCT to speed up the development of ecosystem guardrails to prevent a repeat of the incident for Pi Network. Dr Altcoin has his eyes on the clock, urging the PCT to set up robust infrastructure before the transition to open mainnet. “The OM incident is a wake-up call for the entire crypto industry – proof that stricter regulations are urgently needed,” said Dr Altcoin. “It also serves as a HUGE lesson for the PCT as we transition from the Open Network to the Open Mainnet. Belief In the PiCoreTeam Is Waning While a cross-section of community members will argue that the PCT is not scheming a rug pull, there is rising dissent in the ecosystem. Dr Altcoin remarks that faith in the PCT is waning given a trail of transparency issues facing the Pi Network in recent weeks. “One thing is clear about the PCT,” wrote Dr Altcoin on X. “They are not transparent.” Questions about the PCT’s transparency first reared its head over the murkiness of the locking and burning mechanism for Pi Coins. Furthermore, delays in issuing KYB approvals for projects leading to PiDaoSwap launching NFTs on the Binance Chain inflamed soured optimism for the PCT. Dr Altcoin notes that if the PCT fast-tracks the KYB process for centralized exchanges, it will unlock the floodgates of demand for Pi ahead of the transition At the moment, Pi miners are capitulating casting a shadow of doubt over the direction of Pi Coin price. Pi Coin is on the rise, climbing by nearly 30% over the last seven days to trade at $0.7404 but the specter of a drop to 0.3 hangs like a Sword of Damocles.

This has led to a record $7.2 billion in outflows since February, nearly wiping out all YTD inflows and leaving only $165 million. Despite this, a rebound in prices later in the week helped raise assets under management to $130 billion, which represented an 8% increase from the lowest point observed on April 8. This was the weakest level since November 2024, following US President Trump’s temporary reversal of the tariffs that were seen as economically damaging. Bitcoin Leads in Outflow According to CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , Bitcoin experienced the largest outflows among all digital assets last week, with a total of $751 million leaving the market. Despite this, Bitcoin’s year-to-date inflows still stand at a positive $545 million. Outflows were significant across different countries and asset managers, which reflected the broader negative sentiment in the market. The outflows were not limited to Bitcoin alone, as short-Bitcoin products also saw $4.6 million in outflows. Ethereum followed closely behind, with $37.6 million in outflows, while other assets like Solana, Aave, and Sui saw losses of $5.1 million, $0.78 million, and $0.58 million, respectively. Cardano and Litecoin also posted outflows of $0.3 million each. On the other hand, XRP saw inflows of $3.5 million, and smaller altcoins like Ondo, Algorand, and Avalanche recorded small gains. Multi-asset investment products also saw slight inflows of $1.1 million. Global Flows The United States experienced the largest outflow, with $763 million, amidst market tubulence. Switzerland followed suit with an outflow of $11.9 million, while Hong Kong had a similar figure of $11.2 million. Other countries, such as Sweden and Germany, also saw notable outflows of $6.8 million and $4.4 million respectively. On the positive side, Canada had inflows of $2.1 million, and Australia and Brazil saw modest inflows of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.

Although the OG meme coin did incur losses for several investors in the last two months, analysts believe that is about to change soon. Renewed institutional interest and ongoing developments within the Doge ecosystem confirm that something huge is coming for the asset. Meanwhile, investors are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the continuous rise and fall of the market. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is a new payment network whose unique DeFi capabilities could revolutionize payments across borders. Savvy investors have recognized its 100x potential and are accumulating as much $RTX as possible, as experts believe the new project could beat Dogecoin to the $1 mark. This article will examine Dogecoin price prediction and answer why Remittix is recognized as a safe haven for stability and growth. Dogecoin Price Prediction : What’s Next For Dogecoin? Amid a relatively wobbly crypto market, Dogecoin is returning to the spotlight. 21 Shares, the firm behind one of the largest spot Bitcoin ETFs, just filed for a spot Dogecoin ETF. President Duncan Moir believes Dogecoin’s growing utility in payments, tipping, and charitable giving makes it ripe for institutional-grade access. In its SEC filing, 21 Shares proposes a fund that would track Dogecoin price without requiring investors to hold the coin directly. But it’s not just about offering institutional exposure; the firm also announced an exclusive partnership with the House of Doge to launch funds endorsed by the Dogecoin Foundation. DOGE, the eighth-largest crypto by market cap at $24.35 billion, rose over 6% following the news. The asset had plunged to a five-month low of $0.13 earlier in the week amid the growing trade tension but quickly rebounded above the $0.16 support level. Dogecoin now trades at $0.1638 , representing a 10.8% weekly spike. This price jump comes after a substantial acquisition made by whales. According to crypto analyst ali_charts , over 80 million DOGE were purchased by whales in 24 hours between April 10 and April 11, confirming renewed institutional interest. The latest ETF filing comes as the SEC weighs several altcoin ETF proposals including for Solana, XRP and Litecoin while awaiting a leadership change. Crypto-friendly nominee Paul Atkins has been confirmed by the Senate as the next SEC chair. In light of these developments, market participants are optimistic Dogecoin could be the next tradable asset on Wall Street. Remittix: Offers Stability and Huge Profit Margins Remittix is a new payment protocol that fuses blockchain technology and local bank infrastructure to facilitate frictionless and direct crypto-to-fiat transfers. This unique DeFi offering would reinvent how transfers are made across borders. Remittix’s flat fee feature will eliminate the middlemen in financial blocks, enabling every cross-border payment made on its platform at zero cost. This changes everything because businesses can now avoid FX costs and wiring charges by adopting this innovative payment protocol. This easy-to-use yet sophisticated solution has become of interest to investors globally, particularly as market participants seek refuge in projects that offer stability and massive upside potential. $RTX tokens currently go for $0.0757 each and over half a billion have been bought. Conclusion With Remittix , users can instantly send and receive fiat payments via crypto assets, a solution the DeFi sector has always needed. Experts are confident that Remittix will revolutionize the payment industry and become the ultimate go-to platform for cross-border transfers. As of today, its ongoing presale has accumulated nearly $14.4+ million from investor crowdfunding. It’s clear that retail investors aren’t just tossing money; they recognize Remittix’s potential and how much of the multi-trillion-dollar payment market it would capture. And if this trend continues after its official launch, Remittix will undoubtedly reap huge profit margins for early investors in 2025.

Over the past week, Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, gaining nearly 10%, and now trades above $84,000. This upward movement has reignited optimism among investors, though some analysts remain cautious about calling this a definitive trend reversal. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Last Drawdown To $74,000 A ‘Healthy Correction’ — Analyst Says Bull Cycle Is Still On Apparent Demand Shows Recovery, But Trend Reversal Uncertain According to recent on-chain data, the current recovery in BTC may be linked to improving demand indicators. However, it is suggested that the broader market structure still needs to confirm whether this bounce reflects a sustainable rally or is merely a temporary pause in the ongoing correction. CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi particularly drew attention to Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand metric, specifically the 30-day sum, which has started to rebound from negative territory. This trend is being observed as a potential sign of changing market dynamics. However, Mevsimi warns against assuming this is the start of a new bullish cycle, drawing parallels to Bitcoin’s behavior during the latter part of the 2021 cycle. During that period, demand remained suppressed for an extended timeframe, even as prices temporarily recovered. Only after a long consolidation phase did the market experience a genuine structural shift. Mevsimi highlights that although momentum may be improving, more time and confirmation are necessary before a macro-level trend reversal can be confirmed. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Selling Pressure Declines on Binance Another market signal worth watching comes from Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost reports that inflows of Bitcoin from short-term holders (STHs) to Binance have been steadily decreasing, suggesting a decline in immediate selling pressure. The data indicates that average realized prices for STHs currently hover around $92,800, meaning many recent sellers have exited at a loss. Darkfost notes that inflows from STHs dropped from approximately 17,000 BTC in November to around 9,000 BTC more recently. This downtrend in selling could provide some support for Bitcoin’s current price levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Lags Gold As Wall Street Doubts Persist, Claims Expert Still, the analyst emphasizes the need for continued monitoring to determine if this reduction in selling pressure persists. The easing of short-term holder activity could reduce overhead resistance and contribute to market stability, but confirmation of accumulation or a broader bullish phase remains elusive.

The company also acknowledged that financial conditions have tightened more than in 2022 during one of the most rapid Fed hike cycles ever. Data showed that the Fed’s 1-year inflation expectation is at 3.6%, up from 3.1%; its 3-year inflation expectation is at 3.0%, while its 5-year inflation expectation is at 2.9%, down from 3.0%. The firm argued that the availability and cost of financing for economic activity have worsened due to a pullback of stocks as credit spreads surge. ZeroHedge argued that the economy may slow even further in the upcoming months due to the ongoing Trump administration’s heightened trade war. Source: ZeroHedge. U.S. financial conditions since 2020. Research revealed that all 3 major U.S. equity indexes dropped in Q1 2025, led by the Nasdaq and S&P 500, falling 10.42% and 4.59%, respectively. The firm argued that it was the worst quarter for both indexes since 2022. According to the RSM U.S. Financial Conditions Index, the U.S. equity markets now stand at 2.67 standard deviations below neutral following weeks of volatility. Economic analyst Joseph Brusuelas believes that uncertainty over monetary policy and the economy has contributed to excessive volatility across the bond market, which is one standard deviation below neutral, according to the index. The report also mentioned that inflation concerns helped drive gold to become the best-performing asset class, surging 19%, the highest quarterly increase since 1986. ZeroHedge also highlighted that gold was outperforming the S&P 500 since the COVID pandemic, exchanging hands at all-time high levels of 3,209 a troy ounce at the time of publication. Trump’s tariffs cause uncertainty in the markets The U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged he will still apply tariffs to phones, computers, and popular consumer electronics. He said, “NOBODY is getting off the hook,” downplaying a weekend exemption as a procedural step in the overall push to remake U.S. trade. Economic analyst Joseph Brusuelas estimates the spike in yields created the conditions for the president to seek an offramp from what has been a haphazard rollout of the new tariff regime. “I would be wary of assuming that the impact of tariff increases on inflation will be entirely temporary.” -Alberto Musalem, St. Louis Fed President. China’s President Xi Jinping warned that Trump’s trade war will “lead nowhere” and produce “no winners.” ZeroHedge also highlighted that the dollar weakened to a six-month low due to concerns that the confusion around Trump’s tariff policy will drive traders away from U.S. assets. JPMorgan Asset Management argued that Treasuries may have hit the bottom for now amid signs of robust foreign demand and expectations for the Federal Reserve to support U.S. government debt when needed. American banker and economist Neel Kashkari downplayed suggestions the Fed will step in to calm markets. He noted that “investors in the U.S. and around the world are trying to determine what the new normal in America is” and that the Fed has “zero ability to affect that.” Karoline Leavit mentioned last Friday that Trump was “optimistic” that a trade deal could be reached with China and that he was ready to be “gracious” about it. She also revealed that more than 75 countries had asked to cut deals, including Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam.

Xapo Bank said that Q1 trading volume grew 14.2% compared to the Q4 2024, as the Bitcoin ( BTC ) price drop helped drive trading volume growth on its platform. It said that during the decline, its high net-worth members “actively bought the dip,” reflecting these members’ “commitment to the long-term potential of Bitcoin.” In the first quarter of 2025, Bitcoin had its worst start to a year since 2018, closing the quarter down 13%. The crypto-friendly bank became the first licensed bank to launch interest-bearing Bitcoin and fiat banking accounts in the UK in 2025 and launched Bitcoin-backed USD loans of up to $1 million in March 2025. Xapo Bank’s self-selected poll on X showed respondents favored using Bitcoin for savings and investment. Source: Xapo Bank It also recorded a 50% quarter-on-quarter jump in euro deposits. “This rapid increase in volume came amidst mounting concern about the future of US dollar primacy and the threat of a US recession as markets braced for Trump’s planned ‘Liberation Day’ in April,” the bank said. There were also significant shifts in Xapo members’ stablecoin deposit patterns, with USDC deposits up 19.8% in Q1 and Tether ( USDT ) deposits down 13.4%. This shift comes as European cryptocurrency exchanges moved to delist Tether in order to comply with Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation regulations. “Xapo Bank member data shows that despite short-term headwinds, the bigger picture for Bitcoin remains strong and current volatility does not diminish Bitcoin's importance,” said Gadi Chait, Xapo Bank’s head of investment. Chait added that “while global events painted an erratic picture, the opportunity for Bitcoin has always been in its long-term performance, not its short-term volatility.” Related: Exclusive: Inside a Swiss nuclear bunker’s secret Bitcoin vault Crypto exchange Bitget also sees Q1 trading volumes surge Market turmoil also prompted a flurry of activity on digital currency exchange Bitget, according to its Q1 2025 Transparency Report. Bitget’s total trading volume hit $2.1 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, as spot trading volume saw a quarter-on-quarter increase of 159%, rising to $387 billion. This surge in trading volume came as Bitget’s total user base grew by almost 20%, with the exchange adding an additional 4.89 million users on its centralized exchange and 15 million users on its Bitget Wallet app — bringing its total global user count to over 120 million. Bitget’s CEO, Gracy Chen, said the exchange will continue to “focus on institutional-grade infrastructure and double down on expanding its Web3 presence through our ecosystem.” In February, Bitget loaned rival exchange Bybit 40,000 ETH, valued at approximately $100 million, after Bybit suffered a major hack. The loan has since been fully repaid by Bybit. “No interest, no collateral — this was simply about supporting a peer in need. Great to see Bybit fully recovered, and we never doubted the return of the loan,” Chen said.

With Bitcoin already 25% down from its peak, is this the right time for the U.S. to buy Bitcoin at a lower price using tariff funds? Using Tariff Revenue to Buy Bitcoin Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies using digital tokens the government already owns. He also asked the U.S. commerce and treasury secretaries to come up with budget-neutral strategies to buy more Bitcoin without costing taxpayers extra money. BREAKING: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS U.S. MAY BUY BITCOIN USING TARIFF REVENUE MEGA BULLISH pic.twitter.com/OLrr9TYG8s — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 15, 2025 One of the ideas that is circulating in the Trump administration is to buy Bitcoin, using revenue generated from tariffs. By doing this, the U.S. could add Bitcoin to its reserves without borrowing more money or raising new taxes. Though the idea is still being talked about, it shows the government is thinking about new ways to handle money. Lummis’ Plan to Use Gold Certificates for Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis is talking about a new way to buy Bitcoin with the “ Bitcoin Act of 2025.” She wants to change the value of U.S. gold certificates, which are worth less than the real value of gold. By making this change, the U.S. could get more money to buy Bitcoin and create a new reserve. Bitcoin Aims for $90K Bitcoin is showing strength again after bouncing back from a recent dip. The price has jumped by 15% and is now trading around $85,350 , with its market cap rising to $169 trillion. Right now, Bitcoin is holding above $84,000 and staying strong above the 100-hour simple moving average. A rising trend line is also forming, with support around $85,200, suggesting buyers are still in control. Looking ahead, Bitcoin faces some resistance. The first hurdle is near $85,800, followed by $87,200. If the price breaks above, it could move even higher, possibly reaching $90,000.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-15 04:05:46

Here’s how on-chain metrics have changed during this collapse. Mantra Has Seen A Reaction In Several On-Chain Indicators In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about the sudden price plunge that Mantra saw in the past day. During this crash, the asset’s value went from above $6 to around $0.50 in the matter of a few hours. Related Reading: Cardano Could Drop To $0.54 If This Support Gives Out, Analyst Says First, here is how the Exchange Inflow (that is, the total amount of OM being transferred to centralized exchanges) changed along with this volatile move: As displayed in the above graph, Mantra interestingly didn’t see any large spikes in the indicator in the leadup to the crash. Investors use exchanges for selling-related purposes, so large deposits tend to appear before intense volatility. In OM’s case, though, it seems there were no such inflows. Large deposits have still occurred in the past day, but they only came after the collapse was already over. These late inflows likely corresponded to reactionary moves from the investors. The opposite indicator, the Exchange Outflow, also saw spikes following the price plummet, as the below chart shows. While the largest withdrawals only came after the crash was over, there were some significant outflows also made before the low was reached. “This could reflect withdrawals post-liquidation, opportunistic buys followed by self-custody, or exchanges reducing exposure,” explains the analytics firm. A metric that did register a change ahead of time was the percentage of the Mantra supply held by the top 1% addresses. The top 1% addresses reduced their supply share from 96.4% to 95.6% before the OM collapse took place. “While not the largest drop in recent months, it’s notable,” notes Glassnode. Another indicator that showcases the market panic is the Number of Transfers, which observed a huge spike as OM went through its volatility. The Number of Transfers peaked at around 1,400 inside a 10-minute window. Given the scale involved, it’s likely that a large amount of traders were responsible for these moves.

And indeed, the trend in the Active Addresses, a metric keeping track of the number of addresses becoming involved in transactions on the chain, would confirm this. From the chart, it’s apparent that the Active Addresses mimicked the trend in the Number of Transfers very closely, so the Mantra selloff wasn’t contained to a few addresses at all. OM Price At the time of writing, Mantra is trading around $0.50, down more than 91% in the past day.

A beggar-thy-neighbour policy with tariffs has pushed spot gold to ATHs, with BTC finally regaining some of its long-lost 'store of value' narrative,” Fan added. Crypto majors tracked by the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) slid nearly 2%, data shows, with DOGE leading losses. Solana’s SOL, tron (TRX) and Cardano’s ADA lost as much as 2.5%, BNB Chain’s BNB and xrp (XRP) were little changed as bitcoin clung to the $85,000 level. Mantra’s OM token showed a 20% rise over the past 24 hours to trade at 63 cents in Asian morning hours Tuesday, following a bizarre sell-off that saw it lose 90% within an hour late Sunday. A recovery plan is in the works, its CEO said in an interview following the plunge, though market watchers remain sceptical of any promises. Elsewhere, Story Protocol’s IP dumped 20%, then jumped more than 30% within hours late Monday, with early fears of an OM-like sell-off among crypto circles. Meanwhile, VeThor’s VTHO zoomed 37% as UFC CEO Dana White joined the protocol as a strategic advisor, boosting hopes for mainstream adoption — and recognition — of the RWA-focused token.- https://x.com/vechainofficial/status/1911817066887197012 Meanwhile, Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast that BTC risk reversals remained skewed in favour of puts until June, suggesting that markets are still mildly cautious in the near term. “That said, the tone further out is turning more constructive. On Saturday, we observed aggressive buying of 800x BTC-27MAR26-100k-C. BTC continues to consolidate within the $80k-$90k range and could continue trading sideways, adopting a ""wait and see"" approach to the tariff situation,” QCP said. However, the $100,000 call option has become the most favored bet among traders in the mid-term, as CoinDesk noted Monday, with a notional open interest of nearly $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, some traders say that sell-offs related to tariffs may be well behind and hope for improved sentiment in the days ahead. “The current upward trend was further bolstered by the Federal Reserve's assurance that it stands ready to intervene and stabilize markets in the event of a crisis triggered by the tariffs,” Jupiter Zheng, partner of liquid fund and research at HashKey Capital, told CoinDesk. “As the US engages in trade negotiations with other nations, we remain hopeful that the most turbulent period may be behind us,” Zheng ended.",Markets,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-15 05:02:40

Recent burn metrics revealed that over 20 million SHIB tokens were removed from the asset’s circulating supply in just a day. Now, crypto market traders and investors speculate if price gains loom, whilst a renowned SHIB community member further revealed that a “new pump wave is loading.” Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars 2000% As 20M Tokens Burnt According to Shibburn’s data on April 15, the Shiba Inu burn rate exploded by 2061.22% at the time of reporting. This surge in the meme token’s burn rate is in sync with 20.83 million coins removed from the asset’s supply intraday. Source: Shibburn, official site For context, the SHIB burn mechanism transfers tokens to a null address and makes their recovery impossible. This saga drastically reduces the dog-themed meme coin ‘s circulating supply, a reason that many believe is driving SHIB’s relatively sluggish performance over the years. Besides, a renowned Wall Street expert going by the name “wallstreetbets” on X has stated that “Despite burns, SHIB supply remains unchanged.” This statement has ushered an apprehensive sentiment among market participants who are anticipating price gains ahead in light of the constant burns. Intriguingly, CoinGape found that the total circulating supply rested at 584.37 trillion tokens at the time of reporting. Can SHIB Price Pump Ahead? CoinMarketCap’s data showed that SHIB token’s price rested at $0.00001193, down nearly 3% over the day despite the Shiba Inu burn rate surge. The meme coin fell from an intraday high of $0.00001239, even hitting a bottom of $0.00001182. Crypto market participants are currently uncertain about the coin’s future price movements, given broader market trends and a volatile price trajectory. Nevertheless, renowned Shiba Inu community member SHIB Knight posted on X that a “new pump wave is loading.” Notably, a sustained break above $0.00001238 paves the way for a bull run, per the community member. Traders and investors continue to monitor the coin for further price action shifts ahead.

The DeFi world is once again in the spotlight after a newly launched perpetual trading platform, KiloEx, backed by YZi Labs (previously known as Binance Labs), fell victim to a multi-chain exploit that drained approximately $7 million. The attack has exposed fresh concerns about the security of cross-chain trading platforms. Hack Spans BNB, Base, and Taiko Chains The exploit began on April 14 and affected multiple networks: BNB Smart Chain, Base, and Taiko. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers reports , the attacker utilized a wallet funded via Tornado Cash to carry out a series of strategic transactions. These transactions exploited a price oracle vulnerability, allowing the hacker to manipulate asset pricing across chains and siphon funds in rapid succession. KiloEx Suspends Operations The launch had been off to a promising start. KiloEx, backed by big names like Binance Wallet and PancakeSwap, had just held its Token Generation Event on March 27 and quickly grabbed attention in the DeFi space. But that early momentum was disrupted by the sudden exploit. As a result, the team was forced to pause all platform activity while they dug into what went wrong. To help with the investigation, they’re now working on a bug bounty program with the hope that ethical hackers can step in, trace the stolen funds, and identify the exact weakness that allowed the attack to happen. Crypto Impact The incident had an immediate impact on investor sentiment. The KILO token crashed by 30%, wiping out $3.5 million in market cap within hours. From a previous valuation of $11 million, the token’s market cap now sits at $7.5 million, highlighting the fragility of newly launched DeFi tokens in the wake of security breaches. Ongoing Threat and Response Efforts Meanwhile, security teams are still keeping a close eye on the attacker’s wallet, as the exploit hasn’t been fully shut down yet. KiloEx hasn’t officially confirmed that the issue is resolved, and there are worries that stablecoins like USDC used during the hack could end up being blacklisted. This whole situation highlights how important strong access controls are, especially for DeFi platforms working across several blockchains. As the investigation continues, all eyes are on how KiloEx responds. Their next moves will likely decide if they bounce back or end up as yet another warning sign in the world of decentralized finance.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-15 05:07:47

Hines said the Treasury could revalue its gold certificates, valued at $43 per ounce, to the current market price of $3,200 per ounce, creating a paper surplus to fund Bitcoin purchases without selling gold. “Everything is on the table, and like we've said, we want as much as we can get, so we’re going to make sure that no stone is unturned,” Hines said in the interview, which aired on April 14. 🇺🇸 LATEST: Executive Director of Digital Assets Bo Hines said the US government may buy Bitcoin using tariff revenue. pic.twitter.com/Gfc2HiEJoL — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) April 15, 2025 The Bitcoin Reserve will initially comprise assets forfeited in government criminal cases but allow for the government to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional Bitcoin. During the interview, Hines said the White House is also developing a digital asset framework outlining how the US plans to support crypto innovation and promote US dollar stablecoins worldwide. “It'll provide clarity on many aspects of this space, whether it be from tokenization to staking, all sorts of things,” Hines said, adding that the Trump administration has been moving rapidly to make America the “crypto capital of the world.” Related: Bitcoin takes back seat as Trump, Bukele focus on trade and immigration “We're moving at tech speed, it’s like we’re a startup in this building,” Hines said. “We'll continue moving this along quite quickly.” The report Hines referred to is expected to be published in late July or August. No mention of Trump’s crypto ventures Hines wasn’t asked to address some of Trump’s potential conflicts of interest in the crypto space, including the controversial Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin and the Trump family’s business venture with World Liberty Financial — which have been raised by the opposition party.

Representative Maxine Waters also criticized Trump’s memecoin on Jan. 20, referring to a rug pull while claiming the launch represented the “worst of crypto.” The White House’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, said the TRUMP memecoin was nothing more than a collectible. Hines also wasn’t asked whether the US completed an internal audit of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings — a task that was supposed to be completed within 30 days of US President Donald Trump’s March 6 executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

In an Apr. 14 post on X, Cheong warned that projects and market makers are increasingly working together behind the scenes to artificially sustain token prices, creating a market where “you don’t know whether the price is a result of organic demand and supply” or coordinated manipulation. He went on to say that centralized exchanges are ignoring the issue, creating what he referred to as a “lemon’s market,” in which insiders profit while investors bear the risk. Cheong also noted that majority of recent token generation events have performed poorly, with prices falling 70-90% after listing. The biggest problem plaguing the liquid crypto market now is the complete blackbox of how projects and market makers can work together to create an artificial price that can sustain for a very long period.

Independent crypto analysts pointed out that Mantra had moved millions of OM tokens to OKX just ahead of the price crash, though Mantra has denied these claims. With 90% of the token supply controlled by the team, many believe this was a case of insider selling disguised as a market event. Mantra’s CEO denied any wrongdoing, blaming the crash on CEX liquidations . The concerns didn’t stop with Mantra. As the Mantra drama unfolded, Story Protocol’s ( IP ) token dropped 25% within an hour, falling from $4.24 to $3.02 before partially recovering. Once more, Binance and OKX, the same exchanges connected to the OM crash, accounted for the majority of the trading volume. Binance suggested the crash was caused by forced liquidations, while OKX pointed to tokenomics changes and suspicious exchange deposits. The conflicting statements added to speculation over manipulation. Meanwhile, manipulation has spread to decentralized markets. Last month, a trader on Hyperliquid opened a $5 million short on the JELLY token, then self-liquidated the position by pumping the token’s price on-chain, leading Hyperliquid’s vault to absorb the loss. In an analysis shared with crypto.news, Oak Security’s Dr. Jan Philipp Fritsche described it as “a textbook case of unpriced vega risk,” showing how vulnerabilities in DeFi design can still be exploited even without technical bugs.

According to an Apr. 14 announcement on Celestia’s ( TIA ) blog, mamo-1 is designed to support very high data throughput, up to 128MB blocks every six seconds, or 21.33MB per second. That’s more than 16 times higher than what Celestia’s mainnet currently handles. The new testnet is meant to simulate real-world conditions for apps that need to process large amounts of data. The testnet follows a smaller prototype called Mammoth Mini, which reached 27MB/s in lab tests. But unlike that devnet, mamo-1 is open to the public and connects with Celestia’s full data availability layer, including support for light nodes and data availability sampling. It is supported by 21 validators located in Amsterdam, Paris, and Warsaw to reflect realistic network behavior. The upgrade is powered in part by a new data transfer protocol called Vacuum!, which improves how data moves across the network. Instead of flooding the network with data, nodes only send it to peers who request it. This helps reduce unnecessary traffic and makes the system faster and more efficient. You might also like: VanEck bets on Celestia with new investment product Vacuum! also uses something called Validator Availability Certificates, so nodes can announce which data they’re holding. Even if full data isn’t available from a single source, Vacuum! features a new recovery method that helps validators rebuild missing parts of a block using backup data. Celestia says this technology brings them closer to a future where the network can handle 1GB blocks. Since its October 2023 mainnet launch , more than 20 rollups have deployed on Celestia, including Eclipse, Movement Labs ( MOVE ), and Dymension. Still, competition from rival data availability networks like EigenDA and Avail could challenge its lead. Even with the new testnet, Celestia’s token TIA hasn’t moved much. It’s trading at $2.52, down 30% this month and 88% below its $20.85 all-time high in February. According to an Apr. 10 Nansen report , developer interest in the platform remains quite high despite the price drop, raising conviction of future price recovery.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Might Outperform ADA and XRP This Year,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/mutuum-finance-mutm-might-outperform-ada-and-xrp-this-year/,"The post Next Big Cryptocurrency in DeFi? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Might Outperform ADA and XRP This Year appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a market where investors are constantly asking what crypto to invest in, attention is shifting from well-known names like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) to newer tokens showing early promise. One project making quiet but noticeable progress is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a DeFi platform that combines lending, borrowing, and passive income tools in a simple, user-focused way. Still priced at $0.025 during its presale, MUTM is now being seen by many as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in this year. ADA and XRP Face Market Pressure Cardano and Ripple have been mainstays in the crypto world for years. However, both are facing headwinds in 2025. ADA is under regulatory scrutiny in the U.S., with analysts warning of further downside in price. Meanwhile, XRP’s recent growth—driven by Ripple’s settlement with the SEC and a $1.25 billion acquisition—is promising, but investor confidence is still recovering from past legal battles and volatility. With these concerns in play, many traders and long-term holders are starting to consider new alternatives in the DeFi space—projects with fresh tech, strong use cases, and lower entry points. That’s where Mutuum comes in. What Makes Mutuum Finance Different Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that focuses on real value, not hype. The platform enables users to deposit their digital assets into smart contracts and receive mtTokens in return, which gradually accrue interest over time. The platform operates with two models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Assets are pooled into smart contracts. ChatGPT said: Borrowers access funds by providing collateral, while lenders receive passive returns as interest payments flow back into the pool. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Users can lend directly to others using specific tokens not available in the P2C pool. That includes assets like SHIB or PEPE, which many other DeFi platforms avoid. This flexibility adds more utility and opens the door to broader participation. Unlike platforms that overcomplicate earnings, Mutuum is focused on being accessible. No need to stake in layers or jump through technical hoops—just deposit and earn. Another key feature in development is Mutuum’s overcollateralized stablecoin. This fully decentralized asset will be backed by deposits made within the platform, offering stability without relying on centralized reserves. In today’s market, where transparency is becoming a must, this gives Mutuum a clear advantage and strengthens trust for both borrowers and lenders. With more than 8,100 holders and over $6.5 million raised, the Mutuum presale is moving fast. Once the current phase ends, the price will rise to $0.03, with a public launch set at $0.06. That alone offers a 2.4x return for early participants. But what’s drawing attention is not just the price. Shortly after launch, the team plans to release a beta version of the platform, giving users the ability to interact directly with its core features. Exchange listings are also expected soon after, which could significantly increase visibility and trading volume. Mutuum’s tokenomics are simple but effective. As borrowers use the platform, part of the fees are used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. These are then distributed to mtToken holders, creating a reward loop that benefits those who actively participate. This model makes passive income sustainable and ties token demand directly to how much the platform is being used—something not every DeFi project can offer. For those wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in right now, MUTM deserves serious consideration. It’s not just a speculative token—it’s a working DeFi protocol that’s already gaining real traction. With ADA and XRP dealing with pressure and uncertainty, many see Mutuum as a top crypto to buy for both short- and long-term gains. At $0.025, it offers a low entry point into a project that’s focused on usability, security, and delivering value to its community.

Bitcoin Nears $85K After Trump’s Tariff Pause, But Risks Loom",https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-crash-ahead-bitcoin-nears-85k-after-trumps-tariff-pause-but-risks-loom/,"The post Crypto Crash Ahead? Bitcoin Nears $85K After Trump’s Tariff Pause, But Risks Loom appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market got a strong boost recently after Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for imports from over 70 countries. This move brought some relief to investors and sparked a solid comeback in both crypto and stock markets. Bitcoin jumped close to $85,000, and coins like Ethereum, Solana, Flare, and even meme coins like Pepe saw big gains. Stock markets also reacted well. The Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 310 points, with major tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and AMD all rising. The mood improved even more when the Trump administration decided not to include smartphones and semiconductors in the tariff list. That was a big deal, especially since a 145% tax on Chinese-made electronics would have made everyday items like iPhones way more expensive for American buyers. Market Confidence Grows, but Risks Remain Trump’s decision to pause tariffs was seen as a sign of flexibility, especially with countries like Japan and South Korea, which boosted hopes for stable negotiations. This helped tech stocks rally, and since crypto often moves with tech, digital assets saw strong gains, too, giving confidence to both short-term traders and long-term holders. But the mood isn’t entirely calm. Trump has a history of quickly changing course, sometimes based on political shifts or media pressure. His sudden U-turns, like removing smartphones from his tariff list after initially targeting them, keep markets on edge, especially in the already-volatile crypto space. Potential Impact if Trump Reverses the Pause If Trump were to end the 90-day pause and resume strict tariffs, the ripple effect could be severe. A return to aggressive trade policies may trigger fresh fears of a recession. In such a scenario, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could lose their recent gains quickly. Technical analysis shows that Bitcoin is still trading below its 50-day moving average, indicating that bearish pressure is still in play. If the price falls below the $76,495 support level from March 11, it could slide further to $70,000, dragging the broader market down with it. Trump’s next move could play a major role in shaping the near-term direction of crypto and stocks, especially as global markets remain sensitive to trade and policy signals. Ray Dalio Warns of Deep Economic Trouble Amid Trump’s Tariff Push On the flip side, Ray Dalio has raised the alarm over Donald Trump’s tariff-heavy economic approach, warning that it could lead to something even worse than a recession. Speaking on NBC, the Bridgewater founder said the U.S. is facing a major breakdown in the global monetary system, with risks of international conflict if Trump’s policies are mishandled. Dalio, who predicted the 2008 crisis, believes the current situation is rare and extremely serious. As Bitcoin hovers around $85,000, market sentiment remains shaky. While exemptions for smartphones helped ease fears temporarily, Dalio’s warning adds fresh pressure to an already fragile market.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-15 05:18:47

From $3,900 at the beginning of the year to $1,470 – $1,600 now, Ethereum’s price has been a rollercoaster for many investors. While it has a solid foundation and upcoming upgrades, ETH has struggled to maintain its dominance against macro headwinds and waning interest. This has led Ethereum investors to look elsewhere for new game changers and one name at the top of the list is Ruvi AI . With a presale price of just $0.01 per token , a VIP bonus system and massive returns , Ruvi AI is attracting many savvy investors seeking exponential growth.The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. What is Ruvi AI and Why Is It a Game-Changer? Ruvi AI is a revolutionary platform that combines AI with blockchain . It’s a superapp where users can create text, images, audio and video all in one place. Ruvi AI is designed to empower its users and contributors, so anyone can earn $RUVI tokens by improving its AI models. The $RUVI token is the backbone of the platform, offering utility for premium features, staking and platform governance. At $0.01 presale price , early investors are getting in at the grassroots level. This price, combined with Ruvi’s model, means big upside for those who act fast. Get Extraordinary Rewards with Ruvi’s VIP 5 Tier Bonus For investors looking to maximize returns, Ruvi AI’s VIP bonus tiers offer a great incentive structure. Among them, the VIP 5 tier stands out with a 100% bonus on your holdings when you accumulate 500,000 RUVI tokens or more during the presale.For example, an investment of $5,000 during the presale gets you 500,000 RUVI tokens. Hit the VIP 5 level and you’ll get an extra 500,000 tokens, giving you a total of 1,000,000 RUVI tokens . At the project’s projected $0.07 listing price , this would be worth $70,000 , a 14x ROI before even considering future price increases. Leaderboard Rewards Add to the Fun Beyond the VIP bonuses, Ruvi AI has introduced a Leaderboard Rewards system to incentivize its early adopters. Major contributors, defined as those in the Top 10 to Top 200 , get bonus tokens on top of their existing rewards. Top 10 investors get an extra 500,000 RUVI tokens . Top 50 investors get 200,000 extra tokens . Top 200 investors get 75,000 tokens . This layered reward structure makes Ruvi AI’s presale one of the most competitive and rewarding entry points in the crypto market right now. Industry Experts Say $1 Ruvi Token While Ruvi AI’s presale price of $0.01 is a steal, the project’s growth potential has industry experts predicting much higher valuations. With its AI-powered offerings and community-driven improvement model, Ruvi AI is going to disrupt both blockchain and AI. Analysts think Ruvi AI tokens could go to $1 per token as adoption grows and the platform gains traction globally. What does this mean for early investors? Using our earlier example, those who invested $5,000 to get 1,000,000 RUVI tokens (via VIP 5 bonuses) could see their holdings go to $1,000,000 when the token hits $1. That’s a 200x return on investment, which is why Ethereum investors are flocking to Ruvi AI’s presale. Why Ethereum Investors Are Watching Ruvi Ethereum has always been the bastion of innovation but its recent price struggles and declining transactional activity have left some investors frustrated. While ETH’s upcoming Pectra upgrade and staking ETF approvals are hopeful, its short term outlook is uncertain with macro headwinds.Instead, Ruvi AI offers investors high scalability, low entry point and immediate rewards through VIP bonuses and leaderboard incentives . Ruvi’s community-driven AI development and tangible token utility eliminates the inertia that has slowed down some Ethereum-based projects. Why You Must Act Now Timing is everything in crypto and Ruvi AI’s $0.01 presale is a one-time opportunity. The bonus tiers, leaderboard rewards and ultra-low entry price is the perfect storm for early investors. Ethereum investors who remember their early gains know the importance of getting in before the crowd.

In a recent interview at the White House with investor Anthony Pompliano, Hines said the administration is considering a broad set of creative approaches. These include, among others, using tariff revenue and revaluing gold reserves. Further, he said that any move to accumulate Bitcoin must be “budget neutral” and that the administration is confident about finding viable solutions. JUST IN: President Trump's Executive Director Bo Hines said the US may buy #Bitcoin using revenue from tariffs. pic.twitter.com/JxnYeFx170 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 15, 2025 Treasury Assets May Be Revalued for Digital Reserves “We have, as the President likes to say, many high IQ people working on these solutions,” Hines said. He also pointed to ongoing discussions among agencies such as the Department of Commerce and the Treasury, coordinated through an interagency working group. One prominent idea gaining traction is linked to the Bitcoin Act of 2025 , spearheaded by Senator Cynthia Lummis. The bill proposes revaluing outdated gold certificates currently held by the US Treasury. These certificates are still recorded at around $43 an ounce, despite gold trading above $3,216 today. Updating the valuation to match current market prices could unlock billions in surplus capital. The government could then redeploy that into Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Hines acknowledged that the proposal is still moving through Congress. He noted, “we’ll see how many co-sponsors she can get” as it progresses. Yet he said that the administration is not limiting itself to just one option. Hines: Tariff Revenue May Offer External Path to Build Bitcoin Holdings Tariffs, which have surged in relevance amid rising US-China tensions and a wave of protectionist policies, are also on the table. Hines suggested that future tariff collections could create a new stream of external revenue. This money could be used to accumulate Bitcoin. It would avoid simply reshuffling existing federal assets. “There’s literally countless ways in which you can do this,” Hines said, hinting at a wider brainstorming effort taking place across federal agencies. “Everything’s on the table. We want as much as we can get.” The strategy reflects a broader vision Hines has articulated. His recent comments echo what he said at the Blockworks Digital Asset Summit 2025. There, he described Bitcoin as a commodity with intrinsic value . He also said it should be treated as a strategic asset. Further, he said that building national reserves in digital assets is “imperative for the United States.” The post US Government Considering Buying Bitcoin Using Tariff Revenue: Bo Hines appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|bitcoin acquisition,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-15 05:28:10

While the euro has strengthened amid US tariff threats, driving demand for euro-pegged stablecoins like Circle’s EURC, infrastructure-focused projects like Truebit are exploring how blockchain can improve supply chain transparency and help enforce tariff regulations. Circle’s Euro Coin Surges as Trade War Undermines Dollar, Boosting EURC Adoption in DeFi Circle’s euro-pegged stablecoin, Euro Coin (EURC), is seeing explosive growth in 2025. As trade tensions between the United States and key economic partners intensify, weakening the dollar, investors and decentralized finance (DeFi) users alike are increasingly turning to the euro and EURC as alternatives for transacting and preserving value. According to data from CoinMarketCap , EURC’s market capitalization skyrocketed from under $84 million at the end of 2024 to over $198 million by mid-April — a remarkable 136% increase in just over three months. This surge comes amid a broader rally in the euro, which has gained 2.2% in recent weeks, pushing its exchange rate to $1.13 — the highest level since February 2022. “In recent weeks, interest in the euro has grown tremendously,” noted Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research, in a recent post on X. He added that DeFi protocol Aave recorded inflows of €2.3 million worth of EURC in April alone, indicating mounting demand for the euro-denominated asset across lending platforms. Obchakevich also pointed out that EURC’s growth has been fueled by its increasing multi-chain availability. Since launching on Ethereum, the stablecoin has expanded to major networks including Avalanche, Base, Stellar, Sonic, and Solana. This cross-chain strategy has allowed Euro Coin to become a popular on-ramp and liquidity source for users transacting in euros across various blockchain ecosystems. Looking ahead, Obchakevich predicts that EURC could expand to €400 million in circulation by the end of 2025, citing favorable regulatory conditions and macroeconomic tailwinds. A Trade War’s Monetary Fallout The euro’s climb is directly tied to the weakening of the US dollar, which has shed more than 9.3% of its value against the euro since Dec. 31. Analysts attribute this drop to escalating tariff battles and rising uncertainty around the US's global trade strategy. This economic turbulence is creating a unique opportunity for euro-pegged stablecoins like EURC, which are seen as both a hedge against dollar volatility and a compliant alternative for institutions operating under European regulations. Circle’s regulatory foresight is now proving invaluable. As the European Union enforces the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which aims to bring stablecoins under strict regulatory scrutiny, Circle has emerged as a first mover by ensuring both USDC and EURC are fully compliant with the new laws. While Tether’s USDt remains the dominant stablecoin globally with a market cap of $144 billion, it is losing ground in Europe due to regulatory challenges. Earlier this year, Binance delisted USDt for European Economic Area (EEA) users in order to remain MiCA compliant, prompting a shift toward alternatives like Circle’s offerings. With MiCA support and growing infrastructure integration, Circle’s EURC is increasingly seen as the “go-to” euro-denominated asset for both retail and institutional players. The Digital Euro Backdrop The European Central Bank (ECB) is also pushing forward with its digital euro project, which it claims could become “the most private electronic payment option” available. While this initiative is still in development, the rising popularity of EURC in the DeFi space could give the ECB a preview of how euro-based digital currencies might be used in practice. Circle, meanwhile, continues to strengthen its foothold in both DeFi and regulated financial ecosystems. Its euro strategy not only differentiates the firm from competitors focused solely on dollar markets but also positions it well for a future where digital euro assets could become a core part of the global financial infrastructure. As the geopolitical and macroeconomic landscape continues to evolve, EURC is benefitting from a perfect storm: a rallying euro, a declining dollar, regulatory alignment under MiCA, and growing blockchain integration. All signs suggest that the stablecoin’s momentum is only accelerating. If Obchakevich’s forecast proves accurate, EURC’s supply could more than double again before year-end — a development that would underscore a major shift in the global stablecoin ecosystem, and perhaps mark the beginning of Europe’s stronger digital presence in the world of decentralized finance. Trade Wars Spark New Blockchain Use Cases Amid Crypto Market Jitters, Truebit Execs Say Meanwhile, as escalating trade wars send shockwaves through global markets and rattle cryptocurrency prices, blockchain infrastructure firms like Truebit are finding unexpected opportunity in the turmoil. According to executives at the verification-focused network, the uncertainty surrounding international tariffs is highlighting one of blockchain’s most practical — and increasingly urgent — use cases: supply chain transparency. On April 2, President Donald Trump reignited fears of a global trade conflict by announcing sweeping tariffs on US imports. Although he later paused rollout for select allies, the threat remains very real. Trump has doubled down on his plan to impose hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, which could send ripple effects across global commerce and upend traditional systems of logistics and trade certification. Trump’s proposed tariffs would transform global trade (Source: Statista ) Blockchain for Fair Tariff Enforcement Blockchain ledgers, especially public and immutable ones, are uniquely suited to track goods from point of origin through the entire logistics chain. This could be particularly useful in the context of Trump’s proposed tariffs, which could impact $2.4 trillion worth of goods, according to the Tax Foundation . If other nations retaliate, that figure may climb even higher. For governments, blockchain could represent a powerful enforcement tool, ensuring that tariffs are applied equitably and accurately. Truebit, a protocol originally launched in 2017 to add verifiable computation to blockchain networks, is not yet working directly with governments, but it is actively laying the groundwork. “We’re not yet talking directly to governments, but to the software vendors trying to interface with them — because that’s where we want to be,” said Jason Teutsch, CEO of Truebit. He revealed the company is already involved in a European Union-funded project that is exploring Web3’s role in strengthening global supply chains. According to the executives, interest from enterprise and institutional vendors has been growing steadily. The company aims to provide the “verification layer” necessary for governments and multinational corporations to adopt blockchain without compromising on performance or regulatory compliance. However, not everyone in the crypto industry sees the trade war as a boon. “Aggressive tariffs and retaliatory trade policies could create obstacles for node operators, validators, and other core participants in blockchain networks,” warned Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO of Concrete & Glow Finance. In his view, geopolitical disruptions could fracture global internet infrastructure, introduce new forms of regulatory censorship, and make life difficult for decentralized participants. Market Headwinds and Token Struggles Truebit’s own TRU token hasn’t been immune to market pressures. Since its launch in 2021, the token has struggled to gain momentum, and currently has a fully diluted market capitalization of just $20 million, according to CoinGecko. Market volatility, regulatory pressure, and broader skepticism around niche infrastructure tokens have all contributed to its stagnation. Still, the executives argue that Web3 is no longer just about speculation — it’s about hard infrastructure for a world increasingly shaped by geopolitical fractures and digital trust.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-15 05:30:00

Posts and comments from adult users across Meta’s stable of platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, along with questions and queries to the company’s AI assistant , will now be used to improve its AI models, Meta said in an April 14 blog post. The company said it’s “important for our generative AI models to be trained on a variety of data so they can understand the incredible and diverse nuances and complexities that make up European communities.” Meta has a green light from data regulators in the EU to train its AI models using publicly shared content on social media. Source: Meta “That means everything from dialects and colloquialisms, to hyper-local knowledge and the distinct ways different countries use humor and sarcasm on our products,” it added. However, people’s private messages with friends, family and public data from EU account holders under the age of 18 are still off limits, according to Meta. People can also opt out of having their data used for AI training through a form that Meta says will be sent in-app, via email and “easy to find, read, and use.” EU regulators paused tech firms' AI training plans Last July, Meta delayed training its AI using public content across its platforms after privacy advocacy group None of Your Business filed complaints in 11 European countries , which saw the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) request a rollout pause until a review was conducted. The complaints claimed Meta’s privacy policy changes would have allowed the company to use years of personal posts, private images, and online tracking data to train its AI products. Meta says it has now received permission from the EU’s data protection regulator, the European Data Protection Commission, that its AI training approach meets legal obligations, and the company continues to engage “constructively with the IDPC.” “This is how we have been training our generative AI models for other regions since launch,” Meta said. “We’re following the example set by others, including Google and OpenAI, both of which have already used data from European users to train their AI models.” Related: EU could fine Elon Musk’s X $1B over illicit content, disinformation An Irish data regulator opened a cross-border investigation into Google Ireland Limited last September to determine whether the tech giant followed EU data protection laws while developing its AI models.

Let’s explore OM price prediction and if there’s a chance of a 50% rebound after the recent crash. The price outlook for OM is different than the rest of the altcoins due to the reason for its crash. Many attribute insider dumping to the sudden plummet in MANTRA’s value. Regardless, here’s what investors can expect as the dust settles after a brutal selloff. OM Price Prediction: Can MANTRA Bounce 50% From Lows? The weekly chart shows OM Price drop ended as it hit the weekly buy side imbalance, extending from $0.380 to $0.540. If this key zone holds, investors can expect bullish reversal. In such a case, the midpoint of the 94% crash is $1.594, which would mean a OM price would need a 328% rally to reach it. While this target might seem unreachable and this bullish MANTRA price prediction unlikely, investors need to note that the altcoin has already bounced 65% from the bottom. OM/USDT 1-week chart Can MANTRA Price Catalyze a Recovery Rally? The daily chart shows oversold RSI and steep red histograms, both of which reflect the recent sell-off. A few more days to let the price action at the bottom develop will suggest if there’s a possibility of a 328% rally to $1.594. One catalyst could turn this bullish reversal dream into reality – an official announcement of why MANTRA price crashed and fixes or steps from the project to make investors whole or plans to prevent it from happening again. These two steps from the OM team could rebuild trust and lead to a potential rally that leads to a MANTRA price recovery rally to $1.594. MANTRA/USDT 1-day chart So far, the team has announced that this event happened during “low liquidity hours on Sunday,” and that this was the doing of team members. “To be clear, this dislocation was not caused by the team, the MANTRA Chain Association, its core advisors, or MANTRA’s investors selling tokens. Tokens remain locked and subject to the published vesting periods. OM’s tokenomics remain intact, as shared last week in our latest token report. Our token wallet addresses are online and visible.” To conclude, the OM price action needs a few more days to develop before technical analysis or price prediction can be done clearly. In the mean time, updates from the team could also help boost the price of MANTRA higher.

Among them is one token that’s flying under the radar but quickly catching the attention of early investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new cryptocurrency that isn’t relying on speculation or meme-driven hype—it’s laying the foundation for a full DeFi ecosystem. And at just $0.025, it’s still one of the best cheap crypto projects you can get in on before the next big surge. Momentum is already building. MUTM is currently in the fourth phase of its presale, with the price holding steady at $0.025. But time is limited. The next phase is expected to bump the price up to $0.03, marking a clear 20% increase for those who wait. Over $6.6 million has already been raised, and the community has expanded to more than 8,200 holders—showing strong support even before the token reaches exchanges. This new cryptocurrency is gaining traction because it offers more than just a good entry price. It’s creating actual utility—and that’s what separates it from countless others. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At its core, Mutuum Finance is a permissionless, non-custodial DeFi protocol that focuses on lending and borrowing. Users can deposit digital assets and receive mtTokens, which represent their share in the platform’s liquidity pools. These mtTokens gradually gain value over time as interest from borrowers flows back into the protocol, giving holders a reliable way to earn passive income. Borrowers, in turn, can lock up crypto as collateral to access liquidity—without needing to sell their assets. This keeps their long-term exposure intact while still giving them access to capital. Mutuum supports both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. In the P2C setup, users deposit into shared pools and earn variable APY based on usage. The P2P model allows for customized loan terms between individual users, which is especially useful for tokens outside the standard pool setup. This dual-structure design gives users more flexibility depending on their strategy. A Passive Income Model That Encourages Holding One standout feature is Mutuum’s built-in reward system. Instead of inflating the token supply with emissions, the protocol uses revenue generated from platform activity to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market. These are then redistributed to mtToken holders. The result is a system that rewards long-term supporters, aligns incentives, and creates steady buy pressure over time. For investors asking which crypto to buy today for long-term, this setup offers a refreshing alternative to more volatile and less transparent models. Another key part of the roadmap is the launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the U.S. Dollar and secured on the Ethereum network. This asset will give users an additional tool within the platform, whether they’re seeking a stable borrowing option or want to hold a predictable value within DeFi. With built-in interest-generating capabilities and backed entirely by excess collateral, this stablecoin is expected to increase the overall stickiness of the Mutuum ecosystem. The tokenomics behind MUTM are structured to support long-term viability. Tokens are distributed across ecosystem incentives, liquidity reserves, strategic partnerships, and contributors. This diversified allocation ensures that as the project grows, there’s always support for user engagement, developer participation, and market presence. Analysts are starting to highlight MUTM as one of the best cryptocurrency projects for long-term upside. While it’s still early, forecasts suggest the token could experience a significant price appreciation after launch. With a projected listing price of $0.06 and plenty of upcoming catalysts—including platform beta rollout and a CertiK audit already in progress—many expect the value to rise quickly as visibility increases. At the current price, a $1,000 investment in MUTM could translate to substantial returns as the ecosystem matures. And as one of the next big cryptos quietly gaining traction, its position is only getting stronger. This isn’t just another speculative token hoping for hype. It’s a low-cap cryptocurrency that’s building out real products, with real mechanics, and a strategy designed for sustainability. And right now, it’s still accessible at a price point that leaves plenty of room for growth. For those looking for the best crypto to buy now—especially one that hasn’t hit exchanges yet—MUTM might just be the smartest move on the board.

In an April 11 letter seen by Cointelegraph, Northern Mariana Islands Governor Arnold Palacios said he vetoed the bill as it “presents several legal issues and may be unconstitutional.” Palacios’ letter said the bill , which largely dealt with issuing licenses to internet casinos, would regulate an activity that could not “be clearly restricted” to Tinian, a small island forming part of the territory that was hoping to launch a stablecoin. Tinian, which has just over 2,000 residents and a largely tourism-based economy, is governed by the local government, the Municipality of Tinian and Aguiguan, one of four municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In February, Republican Northern Marianas Senator Jude Hofschneider led the introduction of the bill to amend a local Tinian law to allow internet-only casino licenses, which tacked on a provision allowing the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” The four-member Tinian delegation to the Marianas legislature passed the bill in a unanimous vote on March 12. In vetoing the bill, Palacios didn’t comment on the proposed stablecoin, instead taking issue with its aim to police an industry that can cross jurisdictional boundaries, and said the measure lacked “robust enforcement measures to prevent illegal gaming activities.” A highlighted excerpt of Governer Palacios’ letter noting his reasons for vetoing the stablecoin and internet gambling bill Source: Northern Mariana Islands Governor’s Office Tinian misses chance at beating Wyoming The bill’s passage could have seen Tinian’s government be the first US government entity to issue a stablecoin ahead of Wyoming, whose Governor Mark Gordon said in March that the state’s stablecoin could be ready for a launch in July . The stablecoin was to be known as the Marianas US Dollar (MUSD), which was to be fully backed by cash and US Treasury bills held in reserve by the Tinian Municipal Treasury, according to statements shared with Cointelegraph last month. Related: The GENIUS stablecoin bill is a CBDC trojan horse — DeFi exec The Tinian local government chose tech services firm Marianas Rai Corporation, based in the Commonwealth’s capital of Saipan, to exclusively provide the infrastructure to issue and redeem MUSD and develop its ecosystem. The token was slated to launch on the eCash blockchain, a network that rebranded from Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2021 and is a fork of Bitcoin Cash — a blockchain that split off from Bitcoin in 2017. The launch of MUSD was meant to coincide with Google’s $1 billion plan announced in April to route fiber-optic subsea cables from the mainland US through Tinian and onto Japan to improve internet connectivity.

Meanwhile, Bybit and Avalon Labs introduced a Bitcoin yield product via the Bybit Earn platform, bridging CeFi and DeFi to offer returns on Bitcoin without selling it. Additionally, Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy bought another 3,459 BTC for $285.5 million. Tether Bets on OCEAN to Challenge Centralized Bitcoin Mining Tether, the $144 billion stablecoin issuer, announced plans to allocate both its current and future Bitcoin mining hashrate to OCEAN’s decentralized mining pool. The move is part of Tether’s mission to enhance the decentralization of the Bitcoin network and reduce reliance on dominant centralized mining pools like Foundry USA, AntPool, and ViaBTC. According to Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, this initiative is aligned with the company’s mining investments and efforts to safeguard Bitcoin against centralizing forces. Although Bitcoin’s hashrate is geographically dispersed, the block-building process is still heavily centralized, with a handful of mining pools controlling a majority of block production. OCEAN was created by Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr in 2023, and it aims to shift this dynamic through its open-source DATUM protocol, which allows miners to build their own block templates independently. This protocol not only boosts censorship resistance but also reduces dependency on centralized intermediaries. Tether’s partnership with OCEAN includes deploying DATUM software across all of its global mining operations, including facilities in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador. The company’s mining initiatives gained some traction after it pledged to invest $500 million into Bitcoin mining in late 2023. The deployment will allow Tether to generate unique block templates on-site and aggregate thousands of mining rig connections with low-latency performance, promoting operational and geographic diversity in the process. Despite its ambitious goals, OCEAN currently holds a modest share of the Bitcoin mining market, and produces between 0.2% to 1% of Bitcoin blocks. Data from mempool.space shows that OCEAN mined nine blocks in the past week, including a rare consecutive pair on April 14. OCEAN statistics (Source: Mempool.space ) In contrast, Foundry USA, AntPool, and ViaBTC collectively mined over 66% of all blocks during the same period. While OCEAN’s hashrate reached 18.3 exahashes per second over the past 24 hours, Foundry USA dwarfed that figure with more than 298 EH/s, sourced from major mining firms like Hut 8, Bitdeer, and Bitfarms. OCEAN is backed by some well known people in the industry like Block CEO Jack Dorsey, and it relocated its headquarters to El Salvador in May of 2024. Despite controversy in December 2023 when Dashjr criticized Bitcoin Ordinals users for clogging the network, he denied allegations that OCEAN censored related transactions. Overall, the new partnership with Tether could greatly strengthen OCEAN’s competitiveness and help along its decentralization goals in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bybit and Avalon Bring Bitcoin Yield to the Masses Other companies are also innovating in the Bitcoin space. Bybit partnered with Avalon Labs to offer Bitcoin yield through its Bybit Earn platform, which is a big step in merging centralized and decentralized finance models. According to an announcement that was made by Avalon Labs on April 14, the CeDeFi protocol will now be integrated into Bybit’s yield-generating product, which will allow users to earn returns on their Bitcoin holdings by participating in Avalon’s fixed-rate institutional borrowing system. This system allows institutional borrowers to access USDT liquidity without selling their Bitcoin, offering them an 8% fixed borrowing cost. Avalon Labs revealed in March that it secured at least $2 billion in credit capacity , with the potential to scale even more depending on market demand. The protocol is positioning itself as a key player in transforming Bitcoin into a productive asset, without the complexities that are typically associated with yield farming in decentralized finance. Earlier this year, Avalon also indicated that it is interested in launching a Bitcoin-backed debt fund under the SEC’s Regulation A exemption to bridge traditional finance and crypto markets. The protocol operates as a hybrid of CeFi and DeFi, providing enhanced control and compliance benefits while still leveraging decentralized mechanisms. The integration with Bybit leverages FBTC, a Bitcoin-pegged token that was developed by DeFi protocol Mantle and Antalpha Prime, which is bridged to Ethereum and other blockchains. Avalon accepts FBTC as collateral and lends against it in USDt, which is then deployed into high-yield strategies managed by Ethena Labs. These strategies utilize Ethena’s USDe and staked USDe tokens, offering returns that Avalon claims are both stable and secure. Avalon functions as a bridge between Bybit users and Ethena Labs’ DeFi yield strategies, delivering yield while minimizing user-side complexity. The announcement describes this approach as a CeFi-to-DeFi bridge that enables users to benefit from decentralized opportunities with centralized ease. This partnership comes shortly after Ethena raised $100 million to expand its blockchain offerings and develop products for institutional finance, including iUSDe, which is a version of its synthetic dollar aimed at regulated entities. Strategy Keeps Accumulating While some companies are innovating with Bitcoin, others are collecting it. Michael Saylor’s digital asset firm, Strategy, once again expanded its Bitcoin holdings with the purchase of 3,459 BTC for $285.5 million, at an average price of $82,618 per coin. The acquisition was revealed in an April 14 X post by Saylor, and brings the firm’s total Bitcoin stash to 531,644 BTC that was acquired at a cumulative cost of $35.92 billion. This positions Strategy with an average purchase price of $67,556 per coin and an unrealized gain of more than $9.1 billion. This represents an almost 25% return on its Bitcoin investment. This latest buy was Strategy’s first Bitcoin acquisition since March 31, when it purchased $1.9 billion worth of BTC. The move proves the firm’s enduring confidence in Bitcoin, even as global markets face serious pressure from evolving trade policies. The recent market pullback that was triggered largely by renewed tariff tensions under US President Donald Trump, has done little to deter Strategy’s bullish stance. On April 9, Trump temporarily paused the implementation of higher reciprocal tariffs, and returned rates to a 10% baseline for most countries except China, which still faces a steep 145% import tariff. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite macroeconomic turbulence, Bitcoin rebounded more than 6% in the past week, and was trading above $85,000 at press time. According to Stella Zlatareva from Nexo, the crypto market opened the week with “cautious strength,” showing a strong recovery from the previous tariff-induced sell-off. She noticed that investors are still focused on US-China trade developments, upcoming economic data from China, Federal Reserve commentary, and retail sales figures, all of which could influence near-term market direction. Some analysts still have bullish long-term outlooks for Bitcoin. Jamie Coutts projected that the increasing money supply could drive Bitcoin’s price to over $132,000 by the end of 2025. Joe Burnett of Unchained predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1.8 million by 2035.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MINING|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-15 05:59:10
43358761,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=710244,1744696790,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43358761.jpeg,Scott Bessent believes deleveraging drives the U.S. Treasury market downturn,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bessent-u-s-treasury-market-downturn/,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the recent decline in the U.S. Treasury market was driven by deleveraging, not foreign selling. Bessent pointed out that there was increased foreign demand in 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds in recent auctions, noting that there was no immediate need for action. He disclosed that the Treasury had tools to mitigate the situation, including scaling up buybacks if necessary. Bessent also dismissed the recent selloff in the bond market, rejecting speculation that foreign nations were dumping their holdings of U.S. Treasuries. Instead, Bessent interpreted the decline in the Treasury market as mainly a product of deleveraging, nothing systemic. The former hedge fund manager also said that one lesson from his career was not to look at what happened over a week. He explained that looking at the trading history provided better insights, citing the 1998 bust of Long Term Capital Management, which he claimed had ‘nothing to do with anything’ other than investors acting with excessive leverage. Bessent attributes the U.S. Treasury market decline to ‘normal deleveraging’ The Treasury Secretary also denied that chaos in the bond market over the deleveraging of basis trades forced President Trump to pause his global trade tariffs for 90 days. On the contrary, Bessent said this was Trump’s plan all along. Some market watchers warned of a forced unwinding of the popular basis trade strategy in which hedge funds profited by exploiting the difference between Treasury futures and Treasury bond prices. However, the Morning Star noted that this strategy depended on relatively stable bond market prices. “I’ve seen it very often in my market career – one of these deleveraging convulsions is going on right now in the markets, and I think it’s in the fixed-income market. Some very large leverage players are experiencing losses and have to deleverage.” – Scott Bessent Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also agreed that ‘highly leveraged hedge funds’ had to sell, causing instability in the Treasury market. However, economist Larry Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, said the U.S. was likely headed for a serious financial crisis entirely driven by U.S. government tariff policy. Others argued that different factors related to leveraged positions were at play. Brusuelas blames the recent Treasury market turmoil on the basis trade According to the chief economist at tax consultancy RSM Joseph Brusuelas, the origin of the shock across the Treasury market was the inept rollout of the ‘basis swaps’ trade. He claimed that the loss of credibility and confidence in the current U.S. regime and behavior across financial markets reflected that. As per CNBC, issues causing the jump in yields were ‘multipronged’ but all related to dislocations brought on by, among them, the unwinding of a popular trade that involved swapping floating-rate products such as Treasurys for a futures product like the Federal Reserve’s Secured Overnight Financing Rate, especially by traders looking to pocket the difference between the rates in ‘basis swaps’ trade. Brusuelas emphasized that right now, the unwinding of the basis swaps trade was the primary reason, but not the sole source, of the increase in yields across the Treasury curve. Funds had to raise ‘prodigious quantities of cash’, which resulted in the selling of Treasurys. The rise in Treasury yields often closed the gap and reduced profit opportunities or caused losses, but the situation was even more complicated when hedge funds used leverage for the trades, leading to margin calls and the need for quick cash, which was often obtained by selling government debt. Another reason cited for the bond market sell-off was the Trump administration’s efforts to ‘knock down’ the trade deficit of roughly $800 billion. While the goal in reducing the deficit was to open up the market for U.S. goods and services, it also had a knock-on effect that could affect bond yields.

But while legacy investors celebrate XRP’s comeback, crypto opportunists are looking ahead — toward a fast-growing altcoin project still in its early-stage opportunity phase: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few presales generating serious momentum before hitting the open market. The buzz is growing, the numbers are compelling — and many believe this could be the next 100x altcoin in the making. MAGACOIN FINANCE VS. XRP: WHERE’S THE UPSIDE? XRP hitting $3 would mean a roughly 40% move from current levels — strong, but not groundbreaking. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently priced at $0.0002908 , with a confirmed listing target of $0.007 . That means early buyers could lock in a 25x ROI , or over 2,300% upside — just from presale to launch. It’s this kind of asymmetric potential that has MAGACOIN FINANCE trending in crypto news outlets , with some publications calling it “the best low-cap setup in Q2.” ANALYST PREDICTIONS & VIRAL MOMENTUM Analysts are also jumping on board. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now featured by major crypto publishers , many of whom have highlighted the project’s presale traction, community engagement, and tokenomics model designed for velocity and sustainability. One well-known altcoin commentator noted: XRP has momentum — but MAGACOIN FINANCE has multipliers . If it follows the same early-stage blueprint we’ve seen in previous cycles, 25x might be the floor, not the ceiling. Adding to the hype, sources close to the project say a CMC listing is around the corner , which could spark a major visibility boost just as the final presale stages approach sellout. FINAL THOUGHTS: OLD GIANT VS. NEW GIANT-IN-THE-MAKING 🔥 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X XRP’s run toward $3 is a big story — but it’s a slow burn. For those seeking immediate, high-upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an exciting alternative. With a growing holder base, smart presale mechanics, and a floor price under $0.0003 , the setup is ticking all the right boxes for early-stage investors. And with Stage 7 now LIVE , the window for presale entries is narrowing fast.

Saylor’s Strategy Reports 11.4% Year-to-Date Bitcoin Yield To finance this latest acquisition, Strategy utilized its at-the-market stock program, selling shares to raise capital for further Bitcoin purchases. This strategic move aligns with the firm’s ongoing commitment to expanding its Bitcoin holdings, which have become a cornerstone of its financial strategy. According to Bloomberg, demand for Strategy’s convertible debt has been partly fueled by hedge funds looking to exploit the company’s stock volatility. These funds are reportedly engaged in trades that involve buying the bonds while simultaneously short-selling the shares, effectively betting on the stock’s price movements. Related Reading: XRP Reaches ABC Pattern Top—Analyst Says $6.50+ Targets Still In Play This most recent Bitcoin purchase, which involved acquiring 3,459 BTC at an average price of around $82,618 between April 7 and April 13, brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 531,644 BTC. In a social media update, Saylor revealed that the firm has achieved a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 11.4% as of April 13, 2025. Strategy now holds a total of $35.92 billion in BTC at an average price of $67,556 per Bitcoin. This impressive figure represents approximately 2.5% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever be issued, solidifying Strategy’s status as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. However, the firm’s financial landscape is not without challenges. $42 Billion By 2027 To Fuel Ongoing BTC Purchases Last week, NewsBTC reported that Strategy would register an unrealized loss of $5.9 billion for the first quarter of the year due to an accounting change mandating that digital assets be valued at market prices. In the same quarter, the company reportedly spent $7.79 billion on Bitcoin, reflecting its aggressive purchasing strategy, which has included nine acquisitions during this period.

Looking ahead, Strategy has announced plans to raise $42 billion in capital through 2027, utilizing proceeds from both at-the-market stock sales and fixed-income securities to continue funding its Bitcoin purchases. Since Saylor began investing the firm’s cash into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in 2020, shares of Strategy have surged approximately 2,300%, highlighting the dramatic impact of its cryptocurrency strategy on shareholder value. As of now, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has successfully regained the crucial $85,000 level, reflecting a 7% increase over the past week. However, despite this recovery, the cryptocurrency is currently trading 21% below its all-time high of $109,000, which was reached in January of this year. Experts attribute some of the market’s recent challenges to President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which have impacted overall market sentiment. But with the president’s recent 90-day pause on the so-called “tariff war,” the market has regained long-awaited catalysts that could mean further gains.

IP fell from nearly $4 to $3.27 in a four-hour period, jumping back to over $4 in a couple of hours after hitting the daily low. The majority of the trading volume during this event was concentrated on major exchanges Binance and OKX Spot, with over $40 million in trading volumes before the plunge and $138 million after recovery. The broader crypto market was relatively stable at the time, with bitcoin trading around $84,000 and no clear overarching trend impacting altcoins. This made the IP token’s sudden slump and recovery stand out as an isolated event. Rumors circulated that large volumes of IP tokens , along with other tokens like MOVE and LAYER, were sold at discounted prices through OTC deals. This led to speculation about insider activity or coordinated selling among crypto circles on X. As such, IP-tracked futures showed just $1.4 million in cumulative losses amid the price volatility, a very low figure considering the rapid move and trading volumes. This indicates all trading activity was dominated by actual spot sales and buying. The move led to early fears of a Mantra (OM)-like selloff, which plunged 90% within hours late Sunday in a contentious move whose specific cause is still unclear as of Tuesday.

Sol is not left behind but has yet to signal a trend shift. Losing the important $100 level in the early month crash, Sol later found a solid ground and established support above $95. It initiated a buy and increased for a week. This increase triggered a break out of a descending trendline, serving as resistance since it lost momentum in January. While this breakout triggers a potential bullish move on the daily chart, we may see a trend shift if the crypto reclaims the recent $296 peak. An attempt to retest this broken trendline as support proved abortive yesterday due to a bullish interception, and as we can see, they are now pushing higher on the intraday trading. In the middle of that, the price is approaching a close resistance level, which could halt the latest buying. Breaking higher could bring more recoveries in the price. Otherwise, it may initiate a pullback to retest the trendline before advancing the recent higher high and higher low pattern on the hourly. If this trendline fails to provide support, Sol may slide back to the bottom before the next move. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The close resistance level for the bulls right now is $136.7, followed by the $147.5 resistance. Breaking through it could rally us straight to $161 and potentially $180 – last month’s resistance. Towards the downside, there’s close support at $122.7, along with the hidden $112 support. Below it lies $100 and $95.26. A break below them should set the market up for a massive crash in the long term.

Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment is waiting in the wings with AI,” said Eric Connor on X on April 15. While AI is on a fast track to reshape almost every aspect of our lives, it is “plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor continued. However, these problems create an opportunity for Ethereum to shine, he said. Ethereum offers transparency through verifiable smart contracts, decentralization against big tech monopolies, aligned incentives via token economies, and built-in micropayment infrastructure, he added. Smart contracts can provide transparent records of AI model training processes and data sources, addressing the “black box” problem. However, major AI players may resist open models “as they profit from secrecy and control,” he said. Demand for transparency, fairness, and security will only grow, and that’s where Ethereum “offers an alternative path,” he added. “Ethereum already has the ethos with openness, collaboration and trust minimization, things that ethical and accountable AI needs.” By proactively building the tooling, research and real-world use cases, Ethereum can give AI developers a reason to embrace decentralized approaches, “and that could deliver mainstream adoption far beyond finance,” Connor concluded. The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI, Zain Jaffer, co-founder of Vungle, told Cointelegraph earlier this year. Connor left the Ethereum community in January amid growing leadership concerns to pursue interests in AI. AI agents on Ethereum Ethereum may also be important for the development of agentic AI — an emerging and experimental technology, according to a recent post on the Ethereum blog. AI agents are software programs that use artificial intelligence to autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, learn from data, and adapt to changes, and they are growing in numbers on Ethereum. The Ethereum blockchain provides key advantages for AI agents, including access to transparent, real-time blockchain data, true digital asset ownership, and the ability to execute transactions and interact with smart contracts, it noted. Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto The post highlighted three notable projects, which were Luna, an autonomous virtual influencer that controls its own onchain wallet; ¡` ×\ AIXBT , an AI agent providing crypto market analysis; and Botto, a decentralized autonomous artist creating NFTs guided by community voting. Meanwhile, projects like Bankr and HeyAnon are simplifying blockchain interactions through conversational interfaces, allowing users to manage wallets and execute transactions via simple chat commands.

Major exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC are being targeted, with South Korean regulators already blocking domestic access to their apps since April 11. The statement remarked that foreign virtual business operators that wish to engage in domestic business activities, must report in advance to the Financial Intelligence Unit in accordance with the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. Notably, foreign crypto firms are required to register with South Korea’s FIU before operating in the country. If they fail to do so, they could be subjected to criminal punishment. Crypto companies need to register if they offer a Korean-language website, accept payments in won, or market to Korean users. Failure to follow this rule can result in up to five years in prison or a fine of around 50 million won (about $36,000). The FIU has already been targeting several unregistered platforms as it cracked down on 16 companies in 2022 and 6 companies in 2023 and also blocked domestic access to these platforms through their websites and apps. The FIU also emphasized that in future, it will continue to keep blocking access to the websites and mobile apps of overseas crypto platforms that are not registered, in order to eliminate the risks of money laundering and protect the users, while consulting with other relevant organisations. This comes after Google play blocked several unregistered crypto apps on March 26 including KuCoin and MEXC. The FSC also shared a list of 22 unregistered platforms where 17 are already blocked on Google’s app store. This regulation is part of South Korea’s broader efforts to regulate and control the cryptocurrency market to ensure transparency and prevent illegal activities. Last month, the regulator asked Google to block 17 crypto apps and reports suggest that it is also planning to block some exchange websites to protect users and ensure legal compliance. The sanctions were aimed at well-known overseas exchanges like KuCoin, CoinW, Bitunix and KCEX. The platforms were reportedly running Korean-language websites and actively marketing to Korean users without registering as required. Besides, South Korea has also proposed plans to upgrade its crypto task force into a permanent unit. This follows several high-profile scandals including a public official who was using disaster relief funds to trade crypto and a fake mining site in Gwangju that was actually running illegal gambling. The FSC has also warned users that using unregistered platforms is risky. Currently, only 28 crypto companies are officially registered in the country.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-15 06:09:16

The market sentiment towards Pi is changing fast. The coin is gaining momentum The crypto market is gradually waking up to the potential of Pi Network. What began as a mobile-first mining experiment has now taken a serious step forward, with its native token, Pi Coin (PI), entering the world of futures trading. The listing on Bitunix, a global crypto derivatives platform, is more than just a technical update—it’s a sign that market confidence in Pi is beginning to take shape even before the network fully opens its doors. Pi network is getting into shape post its terrible crash, controversies, and KYC issues, all is fading with a new hope. $PI @PiCoreTeam Trading is now available on Bitunix Futures! Futures Trading https://t.co/oXvKTInRtj More Details https://t.co/VY3xIj4yus pic.twitter.com/qsOZNeWGhk — Bitunix (@BitunixOfficial) April 14, 2025 Futures Launch Sparks Market Interest Bitunix has officially rolled out Pi for futures trading, allowing users to speculate on its future price movements. This doesn’t mean Pi Coin is available for spot trading or withdrawal, but it opens a new path for exposure, especially for traders who want to engage early. The listing enables users to go long or short on Pi, adding a speculative angle to a token that, until now, existed largely in a closed ecosystem. What makes this move notable is that futures trading often serves as a precursor to wider market adoption. It creates liquidity, draws trader attention, and sets the stage for potential exchange listings later on. While there’s no official confirmation from the Pi Network itself, Bitunix’s decision to offer futures on Pi shows growing demand and anticipation in the wider crypto space. Pi Network’s Current Market Outlook With over 60 million users worldwide, the Pi Network has built one of the largest crypto communities through mobile mining. Its social consensus model, where trust circles validate users instead of energy-intensive proof-of-work, has helped it gain traction fast. While it still operates in a closed Mainnet phase, the ecosystem has been expanding quietly in the background. Recent moves, such as integrating Chainlink oracles and ensuring compatibility with Ethereum-based payments like USDT and USDC, show that Pi Network is preparing for a more connected future. There’s also increasing momentum around dApps being built within its ecosystem, setting the stage for real-world utility once the Open Mainnet goes live. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Kraken Launches Commission-Free Stock and ETF Trading in the U.S. , A Step Forward, But Not Without Caution Despite the optimism, the futures listing comes with its risks.

Traders are advised to approach it with proper research, especially as futures markets can be volatile. Still, the listing sends a strong message: Pi Coin is entering serious conversations. With the Open Mainnet launch still pending, the market is keeping a close eye on what comes next. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ETH is now consolidating gains and might aim for more gains above $1,680. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $1,600 and $1,620 levels. The price is trading above $1,625 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,680 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price formed a base above $1,520 and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace for a move above the $1,580 and $1,600 resistance levels. The bulls even pumped the price above the $1,650 zone. A high was formed at $1,690 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $1,640 support zone. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,562 swing low to the $1,690 high. However, the bulls were active near the $1,620 zone. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,625 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $1,625 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,660 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,690 level. A clear move above the $1,690 resistance might send the price toward the $1,750 resistance. An upside break above the $1,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,800 resistance zone or even $1,880 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,660 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,620 level. The first major support sits near the $1,610 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,562 swing low to the $1,690 high. A clear move below the $1,610 support might push the price toward the $1,575 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,500. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

With continuous bears’ dominance and macroeconomic events putting downward pressure on the altcoin, it is down significantly. However, that might change as the ETH price chart shows a bullish sign. Ethereum Price Up for Rally As Buying Signal Flashes Ethereum’s downtrend resulted in the token’s crashing to a low of $1,400 earlier in the month. Experts have attributed this fall to investors’ bearish sentiments and the overall crypto market crash. However, the Ethereum price drop against Bitcoin to its lowest in years indicates underlying performance issues. While the selling sentiments remain, a buy signal has formed in the ETH price chart, presenting the possibility of a rebound. According to the crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s X post , the TD sequential indicator is presenting Setup 9, i.e., an indicator of trend reversal. ETH may be gearing up for a major rebound, with the TD Sequential flashing a buy signal on the weekly chart! The “9” is historically proven to mark the end of the bearish trend and present buying opportunities. Moreover, the smaller body size of the candle suggests weakening selling pressure and traders opting to buy. Besides, no major resistance near the chart exists, so a smooth uptrend can form unless any major macroeconomic event interferes. Symmetrical Triangle Formation Supports Ethereum Price’s Bullish Outlook With a 3% recovery over the week, Ethereum currently trades at $1,639.91 with a market capitalization of $197.88B. Although the recovery is slow, the token moves in a symmetrical triangle formation, simultaneously opening the possibility of an uptrend or a downtrend. If the ETH price moves up, it could rally to $1,900, but a downside move could result in a crash to $1,380. Although uncertainty remains amid Trump’s tariff trade war, the long-term bullish Ethereum price prediction is sustained. Considering the same, a crypto whale has just opened a $12.6M ETH Long with 5x leverage, influencing investors’ sentiments.

Analyst Kevin Svenson tells his 161,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s weekly relative strength index (RSI) indicator, a momentum oscillator that can help traders spot trend reversal areas. According to Svenson, BTC’s weekly RSI is in the early stages of shattering a diagonal resistance that has kept the market bearish since January. He notes that Bitcoin needs to stay above the downtrend line for the rest of the week to confirm the breakout. “BITCOIN | Weekly RSI Breakouts: Once confirmed, weekly RSI breakout signals have proven to be among the most reliable macro breakout indicators. [Five] days until full confirmation.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he appears to point out that weekly RSI breakouts have been signaling the start of strong Bitcoin rallies since the start of 2023. As the weekly RSI attempts to breach its diagonal resistance, Svenson notes that BTC’s price has already taken out a downtrend line on the daily chart. “Bitcoin attempting to break out.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $84,630. Turning to altcoins, the trader says that a real altcoin season will begin once a large-cap crypto asset fully enters bull territory. “A true altseason will only begin once Ethereum pumps. Love it or hate it, it’s just the truth. It’s the reason we haven’t seen one yet.” At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $1,631.

Xapo Bank Clients Buy the Dip, Betting on Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value Despite the downturn, Xapo Bank said its affluent members remained confident in the digital asset’s long-term value and actively “bought the dip” during periods of market turbulence. The bank interpreted this behavior as a sign of growing maturity among seasoned investors in the crypto space. Xapo Bank has continued to expand its suite of crypto-banking services. In March 2025, the firm introduced Bitcoin-backed USD loans of up to $1 million. Earlier in the year, it became the first licensed bank in the UK to offer interest-bearing Bitcoin and fiat banking accounts. Additionally, the bank recorded a 50% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro-denominated deposits, which it attributed to rising concerns about U.S. dollar dominance and fears of a looming U.S. recession tied to policy uncertainty under the Trump administration. The bank also noted changes in stablecoin usage among its members. Deposits in USDC rose nearly 20%, while Tether (USDT) deposits declined by over 13%, a trend likely influenced by new European regulations that have prompted exchanges to delist Tether in order to comply with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). If you could spend Bitcoin anywhere, what would be your first purchase? — Xapo Bank (@xapobankapp) March 11, 2025 “Xapo Bank member data shows that despite short-term headwinds, the bigger picture for Bitcoin remains strong,” said Gadi Chait, head of investment at Xapo Bank. “The opportunity with Bitcoin has always been about long-term performance, not day-to-day volatility.” Bitget Reports Strong Growth Amid Broader Market Activity Elsewhere in the market, Bitget also reported major growth during the same period. According to its Q1 2025 Transparency Report , the exchange’s total trading volume hit $2.1 trillion, with spot trading volume surging 159% to $387 billion. Bitget’s user base expanded rapidly as well, adding nearly 5 million new centralized exchange users and bringing its global user total to over 120 million. The company also drew attention earlier this year for extending a no-interest, no-collateral $100 million ETH loan to rival exchange Bybit following a hack. As reported, the first quarter of 2025 saw a significant market pullback, divergence between price and sentiment, and a shift to the fundamental technology, according to CoinMarketCap’s Q1 2025 Report . The report concluded that Q1 2025 recorded “a broad market pullback.” The reasons lie in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) underperformance, declining retail activity, macro uncertainty, a dropping exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) momentum, regulatory doubts, and decreasing investor interest resulting in thinning liquidity. Overall, trading volume fell 40.65% in Q1, while market sentiment hit its lowest point since early 2023.

As more people seek ways to invest and trade Cryptocurrencies, referral programs that provide incentives for introducing new clients to trading platforms are becoming increasingly popular. In the fast-moving world of Crypto, however, traditional, outdated referral programs simply fall short. Content creators, influencers, bloggers, community leaders, and other individuals with large audiences need a more dynamic system, one that’s both engaging and rewarding. PrimeXBT , a regulated global multi-asset broker, leads the way with its innovative Referral Program, redefining how audiences can be monetised with an engaging high-paying system. While ideal for those with large followings, the program is also designed for regular users looking to earn by referring others. This article will cover the benefits of the PrimeXBT Referral Program and how it can help individuals with large Crypto audiences and everyday users potentially increase their earnings. A Modern System That Rewards Engagement In the past, referral programs were built primarily around passive income, offering little incentive for continued involvement. This often led to reduced earning potential due to lower engagement from both the referrer and those they refer. With its new Referral Program , PrimeXBT has focused on providing a more modern experience that uses interactive elements to make participation more exciting and engaging. The broker offers referrers the ability to earn up to 20% commission on the activity of any traders they refer (T&Cs apply). Commissions are paid daily, encouraging ongoing involvement. PrimeXBT helps fuel engagement with dynamic leaderboards. These allow individuals to track their earnings and see where they rank compared to other top referrers, encouraging a sense of competition. Professional IBs have the opportunity to be promoted to a different program with more exclusive benefits targeted at larger partners. The broker also provides real-time statistics through the referrer’s dashboard including daily earnings, number of invited users, and total commissions. These provide referrers with complete transparency, helping motivate them to continue growing their potential earnings. Dynamic Bonuses & A Unique Gifting Feature PrimeXBT’s Referral Program offers individuals with large trading networks a powerful way to potentially earn some of the highest commissions in the Crypto industry. But the advantages don’t stop there. The broker also gives referrers ways to earn additional income on top of their commissions, including exclusive rewards and dynamic bonuses. Most recently, the broker added an innovative gift feature to its Referral Program. Referrers can now offer their audience a free gift of up to $100 for signing up and trading with PrimeXBT through their unique referral link. The gift is credited as a reward to the user’s dedicated reward account, is subject to the broker’s terms and conditions, and can’t be withdrawn. This incentive helps referrers attract and convert more traders by giving them an extra reason to get started, leading to potentially higher total commissions. Award-Winning Platform & Flexible Trading Incentives Beyond its revolutionary Referral Program, PrimeXBT is a globally recognised and trusted broker that offers access to over 100 markets on an award-winning platform. The broker’s trading ecosystem combines Crypto Futures, its Forex & CFD trading, MetaTrader 5 (MT5), and Crypto wallet and exchange functionality into a single innovative package. This ensures that referrers can be confident their audience will enjoy a stable and secure experience with the latest industry-leading features and functionality. PrimeXBT also offers additional incentives for traders, giving referrers more ways to attract clients. The PrimeXBT Rewards Center has various features that can help clients boost their trading activity. This includes three separate campaigns; the Welcome Bonus, Trader Tasks system, and Trade & Earn, which offer rewards totalling almost $6,000. Rewards earned can be applied across any trading account as a trading bonus or cashback (T&Cs apply). The Future of Referral Programs PrimeXBT’s Referral Program is a game-changing opportunity for everyone from bloggers, influencers, and traders with large networks to active traders and everyday users. By offering industry-leading commissions, daily payouts, and a unique gifting feature, the broker provides referrers with the ultimate way to monetise their audiences, while introducing them to a trusted, world-class trading experience.

Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, said in a podcast interview Monday that the administration is actively weighing ways to increase its Bitcoin holdings, with no options off the table. Gold certificate revaluation proposal Speaking to crypto influencer Anthony Pompliano, Hines praised Senator Cynthia Lummis’ reintroduced Bitcoin Act of 2025 and suggested revaluing the Treasury’s gold certificates could add substantial funds for BTC purchases. Bitcoiners have infiltrated the White House. @BoHines explains tomorrow. 5pm ET. pic.twitter.com/UII10KADXG — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) April 13, 2025 “ We currently value many of our gold certificates at around $43 an ounce, which is drastically lower than the market price ,” Hines said. “ If we revalued those certificates at current gold prices, about $3,100 an ounce, it would generate a massive surplus of untapped capital. ” Hines mentioned that the surplus generated through this revaluation could be used to acquire additional Bitcoin for the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve alongside the collection of tariffs. “ That’s just one idea. But we’ll consider every possibility, including tariff revenue ,” he continued. According to Hines, the administration plans to maximize every legal and fiscal lever to expand the country’s crypto holdings. “ We want as much as we can get ,” he reckoned. Lummis’ Bitcoin Act could help in acquisitions Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the Bitcoin Act earlier this year, proposing that the American government accumulate up to 1 million Bitcoins, roughly 5% of the total supply, over the next five years. Hines, referring to the legislation, called it an “interesting idea.” He acknowledged that the bill’s success would depend on how many co-sponsors Lummis can rally and how effectively she can garner bipartisan support. “ If we realize the gains on the US gold holdings, that would be a budget-neutral way to acquire more Bitcoin ,” Hines stated. When Pompliano asked him about POTUS Trump’s relationship with Bitcoin, Hines responded: “I think he’s made it very clear that he loves Bitcoin. He’s made it very clear that he loves digital assets and the innovation in this space, and so for us, you know, our goal is to deliver on his wishes to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet.” ~ Bo Hines, Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets Since he was appointed executive director of the White House’s crypto advisory council, Hines has held several meetings in the administration’s capacity to bridge ideas that would suit Trump’s digital asset policy. His calendar, obtained by news sources through a Freedom of Information Act request, shows over 50 meetings with industry stakeholders during his first 30 days in office. Those meetings have included major players such as Andreessen Horowitz’s Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and Bank of New York Mellon’s digital assets chief Caroline Butler. The gatherings have occurred in several settings, from Zoom calls and DC cafes to the White House and the historic Old Ebbitt Grill. “ I want to meet with everyone in this space, big players, small player s,” Hines said during a recent sit-down at the Israeli-American café Tatte, just blocks from the White House. “ I want to hear ideas from everyone .” Controversy around Trump-linked crypto ventures Hines was not asked to address any queries surrounding potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump and his family’s involvement in the crypto sector. These concerns include the controversial TRUMP memecoin and business ventures with World Liberty Financial. Several Democratic lawmakers have made the TRUMP token a point in their conflict of interest argument. In a statement last month, Representative Gerald Connolly called the coin a “money grab” that netted Trump-affiliated entities more than $100 million in trading fees. Similarly, Representative Maxine Waters bashed the coin’s launch on January 20, alleging it was a “rug pull” and labelling it an example of the “worst of crypto.” David Sacks coined the Trump Solana-based memecoin as a “collectible” and denied any policy connection to Trump’s official crypto strategy. Another unresolved issue involves the administration’s internal audit of US Bitcoin holdings. Under President Trump’s March 6 executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Treasury must conduct an audit within 30 days, but several sources, including Arkham Intelligence, place the holdings at just over 200,000 Bitcoins. As of this week, the White House has not confirmed if the audit has been completed. Hines was not asked to comment during the podcast, either. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Last Time This Happened Ripple’s Price Dumped by 25%,https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrp-in-trouble-last-time-this-happened-ripples-price-dumped-by-25/,"TL;DR Binance futures traders have turned bullish on Ripple’s cross-border token, opening mostly long positions. However, history shows that such developments have been followed by a price correction. Could history repeat itself now? 66.86% of traders in Binance with open $XRP positions are going long! pic.twitter.com/oDL2NsUzHq — Ali (@ali_charts) April 15, 2025 Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez posted on X that the majority of futures traders on Binance who are betting on XRP’s future price moves have turned bullish, with 66.86% of all positions opened being long. Although this might sound like positive news at first, a deeper look into XRP’s price performance following such developments tells a different story. Recall that Binance futures traders were even more bullish on April 5-6, when the percentage of longs exceeded 70%. Just a day later, though, Ripple’s token found itself dumping below the crucial $2 resistance to a multi-month low of $1.6. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView It’s worth noting that XRP was not an isolated asset when its price tumbled by 25% last week. The entire crypto industry, as well as Wall Street and other financial markets, plunged due to the escalating tension between the US and the rest of the world. Nevertheless, there was another, less painful example from late March. Back then, XRP stood at $2.4 when longs on Binance futures jumped past 72%. In the following hours, XRP actually gained some traction but dropped to $2.05 by the end of the month. Although history is no indication of future price moves, it certainly helps to observe and learn from it. After all, no investor/trader should forget the wise words from Warren Buffett – be greedy when others are fearful, and be fearful when others are greedy. The futures traders on Binance seem greedy now, at least when it comes down to XRP, which might have already priced in the SEC lawsuit closure, according to some analysts. The post Is XRP in Trouble?

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/internet-giant-google-is-imposing-regulation-on-cryptocurrency-ads-across-the-european-union-heres-why/,"Google will begin enforcing a stricter cryptocurrency advertising policy across the European Union starting April 23, aligning with the region’s landmark Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation. Google to Enforce New EU-Wide Crypto Ad Policy Under MiCA Regulation Starting April 23 The move will require advertisers to meet new compliance standards before promoting crypto exchanges and wallet services in all 27 EU member states. According to an official update, any company that wants to advertise crypto-related products such as trading platforms or custodial wallets must first obtain official authorization as a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) under MiCA. Additionally, advertisers must complete Google's verification process to be eligible to run crypto ads within the EU. Google stressed that the implementation will be consistent with its existing ads policy framework, noting that any violations will trigger a warning period of at least 7 days before potential account suspension. “This update reflects the evolving regulatory landscape and is designed to protect users while supporting responsible innovation,” Google said in the announcement. The EU’s MiCA regulation, which came into effect this year, creates a comprehensive legal framework for crypto assets across the bloc and requires licensing, transparency, and investor protections for companies offering digital asset services. Google’s policy update ensures that its advertising ecosystem remains compliant with these sweeping changes. Crypto firms without CASP status will effectively be banned from promoting their services via Google Ads within the EU from April 23. Google’s decision could set a model for how other major platforms are adjusting their ad policies in response to tightening crypto regulations around the world. The tech giant has historically taken a cautious approach to crypto ads, imposing restrictions in jurisdictions such as the US, UK, and Singapore. *This is not investment advice.

In a recent tweet , Farina laid out several reasons why he believes XRP remains a strong long-term asset, particularly in light of ongoing and upcoming developments within the legal, regulatory, and technological environments surrounding the token. The tweet delivers a clear message: Investors should maintain their positions due to legal clarity, institutional interest, political alignment, and product innovation. Legal Resolution of SEC v. Ripple One of the foremost points mentioned by Farina is the anticipated conclusion of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. The case ongoing since December 2020, is approaching its final phase. Farina points to this resolution as a significant moment for XRP holders, implying that the end of the lawsuit may remove a major source of uncertainty that has weighed on the asset for years. While the case remains active, legal experts have indicated that a final judgment or settlement is likely imminent. Farina’s emphasis on the legal milestone reflects a broader market sentiment that regulatory resolution could unlock previously withheld institutional engagement. Prospects of XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Farina also referred to the growing speculation and early movements surrounding the creation of multiple XRP-based ETFs . Although no official ETF has yet been launched, the idea of institutional investment products based on XRP has gained attention as regulatory barriers weaken. The emergence of ETFs would potentially provide traditional investors with more accessible exposure to XRP, thereby increasing liquidity and market presence. Farina’s reference to “multiple XRP ETFs” implies his belief that interest from financial institutions is both real and expanding. Awaiting Price Discovery and Market Adjustment According to Farina, XRP has not yet reached the price discovery phase. This view suggests that the current market price does not fully reflect XRP’s potential value, possibly due to lingering legal concerns and delays in broader institutional integration. Farina’s position is that once the legal and regulatory clouds dissipate, the market will begin to price XRP based on fundamentals and usage, potentially leading to significant valuation adjustments. Political Alignment and Regulatory Clarity Farina identifies the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance as a favorable condition for digital assets like XRP. As Donald Trump continues to align with pro-crypto policies, Farina implies that a supportive political environment could help accelerate regulatory clarity and the adoption of blockchain technologies. He also states that “regulatory clarity” is near, likely referring to the combination of court rulings, pending legislation, and executive posture that could help define the legal status of various digital assets in the United States, including XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Launch of RLUSD and Corporate Expansion In addition to legal and political conditions, Farina mentions Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD , a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin. According to Ripple, RLUSD is designed for institutional and enterprise use cases, and it complements the existing infrastructure built around the XRP Ledger. Farina includes this as a reason to retain XRP, implying that the stablecoin enhances the ecosystem’s utility and potentially drives further demand for the XRP token. He also states that Ripple is “about to announce new partnerships,” indicating that additional corporate collaborations may soon be revealed, which could further strengthen the asset’s market position and credibility. Edward Farina’s tweet delivers a clear position to XRP holders: Now is not the time to sell. By citing the nearing end of the SEC lawsuit, the potential for XRP ETFs, the absence of full price discovery, impending regulatory clarity, political support from the Trump administration, the launch of RLUSD, and upcoming Ripple partnerships, Farina makes a comprehensive case for holding XRP. His remarks reflect a strategic perspective that integrates legal, financial, technological, and political dimensions, aiming to guide the community toward long-term valuation rather than short-term market reactions.

Investors participating in the altcoin presale are buying MUTM tokens at $0.025 while the platform has successfully obtained $6.8 million during this phase. The ongoing presale phase now counts more than 8,300 investors whereas many buyers expect the token price to reach $0.03 when the next phase begins. Buyers during this timeframe will obtain up to 140% in profit gains once the predicted launch price of $0.06 is achieved. MUTM is primed to take over where Solana left off. For those looking to ride the next wave of massive gains, MUTM presents a prime opportunity before it becomes the next crypto sensation. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform collected more than $6.8 million and accumulated 8,300 members in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its initial launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Social media channels will release the results of the Certik smart contract audit after the completion of this audit by the team. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 USD value MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance allows new investors to benefit when they refer members to the platform which creates an inclusive investor community. The first users who join gain complete access to unique staking keys together with voting rights along with premium platform updates which encourages them to stay involved. The Ethereum-based platform achieves price stability by letting users deposit USD funds and operate within it stablecoin system. This transaction system utilizes a resilient solution to eliminate stability problems that typically appear in financial operations. Mutuum Finance leverages modern lending innovations and secure operational platforms to execute permanent changes within Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The Dual-Model Crypto Lending System Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its two-part crypto lending system that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models to bring users better asset availability with enhanced transparency. Smart contract pools in the P2C model enable stablecoin lending by users so platform users can obtain instant borrowing access with passive income opportunities. Automatic interest rate adjustments enabled through smart contracts provide value to lenders through higher returns and lower costs of borrowing to borrowers. Decentralized lending takes place on the P2P model so users can bypass traditional financial institutions during their transactions. The borrowers and lenders can both negotiate specific loan conditions through this system to create an easier and more personalized process. All parties benefit from platform transparency because it provides users full control over their transactions thereby establishing trust and grants them power in their lending and borrowing activities. As Solana (SOL) struggles to repeat its past explosive run, investors are now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the top contender for quick 32x gains in 2025. With a current presale price of $0.025, over $6.8 million raised, and 8,300+ investors, the token is set to climb to $0.03 in the next phase and launch at $0.06. Plus, a $100,000 giveaway and referral bonuses make this presale a can’t-miss. For those seeking the next Solana-like breakout, MUTM might be it.

However, with the year drawing to a close, the tides began to change and the meme coin saw its value rising. One crypto analyst that predicted the rise is World of Charts, who took to X (formerly Twitter), to share with their over 30,000 followers the formation of a falling wedge pattern and the eventual breakout that would lead to new yearly peaks. Calling The Dogecoin Price Bottom In September 2024, the Dogecoin price was still trending below $0.1 after months of consolidation with seemingly no end in sight. At the time, the crypto analyst called out that the altcoin was actually consolidating within a falling wedge pattern and could see a breakout from there. At the time, the target was placed at $0.3, a 300% increase, and once the breakout begun, the price would end up exploding even higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms This Bullish Pennant On Daily Chart That Could Trigger Rise To $137,000 In the months following the prediction, the Dogecoin price would rise rapidly and the crypto analyst adjusted the target to $1. Although this new target was not reached, DOGE did go halfway, hitting $0.5 by November 2024, just two months after the initial prediction. This solidified the legitimacy of the breakout out of a falling wedge pattern, and now, it seems history is about to repeat itself again. In a new post on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst that the Dogecoin price could be seeing a repeat of 2024 again. The post highlighted that the meme coin is on the verge of a massive breakout, giving the same 300% prediction as the previous prediction. Given that the Dogecoin price is currently trending at around $0.17 at the time of this writing, this would put the coin back on the way to $0.5. “Now Again Doge On Verge Of Massive Breakout, It Can Give Move Like Oct, Expecting 3x From Here,” the analyst said. Bullish From Here On Out Another crypto analyst, Jonathan Carter, has also shared the same sentiment as World of Charts and predicted that the Dogecoin price is also headed for a surge. This analysis which was published a day before also points out the breakout from a falling wedge pattern, setting four targets for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP Outflows Cross $300 Million In April, Why The Price Could Crash Further If the break is successful, the crypto analyst puts DOGE at $0.18 first, and then continues on to $0.23.

Today alone, at least nine tokens have officially entered the market, including MBX, MODALAI, MCC and NILA. Many believe that the launch of a new cryptocurrency in the market is a positive sign. To an extent, this is true and it actually reflects the growth-oriented nature of the cryptocurrency sector. However, questioning the credibility of the way new tokens are priced, DeFinance Capital’s Arthur Cheong alleges that project teams and market makers often work together secretly to manipulate token prices. Curious to know more! Read on! Are Crypto Prices Being Artificially Controlled? In an X post, Arthur Cheong, the founder of DeFinance Capital, states that there is a serious problem in the cryptocurrency market . His primary allegation is that project teams and market makers often work together secretly to manipulate token prices. The biggest problem plaguing the liquid crypto market now is the complete blackbox of how projects and market makers can work together to create an artificial price that can sustain for a very long period. You don't know whether the price is a result of organic demand & supply… — Arthur (@Arthur_0x) April 14, 2025 Price manipulation is a serious problem. If the price of a token is manipulated, it will be difficult to accurately analyse which exactly is influencing the market. To make a sensible market decision, a trader or investor should possess a clear idea about the factors affecting that market. CEXs Turning a Blind Eye: How The Altcoin Market Is Affected? Arthur alleges that centralised exchanges are showing no interest to address this market manipulation issue. Criticising centralised exchanges for turning a blind eye to this issue, the founder of DeFinance Capital indirectly accuses the exchanges of playing a key role in this issue. According to Arthur, this issue has allowed the entrance of many low-quality, unreliable assets into the altcoin market. Total Market Capitalization Excluding the Top Ten Cryptos Since the start of this year, the total market capitalization of cryptos, excluding the top ten cryptos , has dropped by no fewer than 38.33%. During the period, the altcoin market cap has declined from $1.34T to $961.7B. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today: Trump Tariff Update, Ripple News, PI Network News, KiloEx Hack , New Crypto Listing Market Scenario: An Overview In the last one year, as per data in coinraking, nearly 12,799 crypto tokens have been listed.

In an April 15 post on X , Connor said Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment” could come through its integration with AI, as the sector struggles with centralization, opaque algorithms, and growing privacy concerns. “AI is plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor noted, adding that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to address these issues. Ethereum Could Offer AI a Decentralized Alternative to Big Tech, Says Former Dev He argued that Ethereum’s decentralized structure, transparent smart contracts, token-driven incentives, and built-in micropayments system could offer a better foundation for AI development, free from big tech monopolies. Connor emphasized that smart contracts could be used to make AI training and data sourcing processes more transparent, mitigating the secrecy that currently surrounds many commercial AI platforms. However, he acknowledged that large AI companies may resist such openness, as their business models rely heavily on data control. Still, he said, growing demand for fairness and transparency could push developers toward Ethereum’s more ethical, collaborative approach. Ethereum has already shown the world trustless, programmable finance through DeFi and stablecoins. But its biggest mainstream moment is waiting in the wings with AI. AI is on a fast-track to reshape almost every aspect of our lives. But it’s plagued by black-box models,… — Eric Conner (@econoar) April 15, 2025 Ethereum’s potential also extends to the fast-evolving field of agentic AI, where autonomous software agents can make decisions, execute transactions, and interact with smart contracts. A recent post on the Ethereum blog highlighted how the blockchain supports these agents with real-time data access, digital asset ownership, and interoperability with decentralized applications. Among the projects already building on this foundation are Luna, a virtual influencer with on-chain wallet control; AIXBT, an AI agent offering crypto market insights; and Botto, a decentralized NFT artist powered by community votes. Additionally, tools like Bankr and HeyAnon are enabling conversational interfaces that allow users to interact with blockchain systems using natural language. Connor concluded that Ethereum must continue building the tools, research, and real-world applications that make decentralized AI viable. If successful, Ethereum could become a driving force in ethical AI adoption, expanding its impact well beyond finance. VC Blames Layer-2s for Ether’s Waning Investment Appeal Last month, crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures pointed to two key issues undermining Ether’s value: the rise of layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and unchecked token issuance. He argued that “greedy Eth L2s” are siphoning off value from Ethereum’s base layer while giving little back. He also criticized the Ethereum community’s acceptance of excessive token creation, claiming that “ETH was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand.” Carter’s comments followed a similarly stark assessment from Quinn Thompson, founder of Lekker Capital, who declared that Ethereum is “completely dead” as an investment. Thompson cited declining transaction activity, reduced user growth, and falling network revenues as signs that ETH no longer offers a strong investment case, despite its utility as a blockchain platform. Make no mistake, $ETH as an investment is completely dead. A $225 billion market cap network that is seeing declines in transaction activity, user growth and fees/revenues. There is no investment case here. As a network with utility? Yes. As an investment? Absolutely not. pic.twitter.com/XjZNjPjy2s — Quinn Thompson (@qthomp) March 28, 2025 Back in September 2024, Carter warned that Ethereum’s fee revenue had plummeted by 99% over six months as L2s captured user activity and revenue without contributing to Ethereum’s base layer.

By 2028, BRETT prediction indicates a maximum price of $0.89. By 2031, BRETT is expected to trade between $1.31 and $1.46. BRETT, or Based Brett, is a meme cryptocurrency launched in February 2024 on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Inspired by the character Brett from Matt Furie’s “Boys’ Club” comic series, BRETT aims to engage users through humor and community interaction. It has quickly gained popularity, boasting a market cap exceeding $1 billion and a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with a fixed supply ensuring scarcity. BRETT operates on a renounced contract, meaning the creator cannot alter its supply or functionalities, which fosters a decentralized governance model driven by community engagement. The token does not impose transaction fees, making it attractive for trading and long-term holding. Its cultural significance and partnerships in decentralized finance enhance its utility and value in the crypto space.

This upward thrust, reinforced by a 6.84% gain, suggests increasing buyer confidence. The RSI stands at 60.58, indicating a shift toward bullish territory without breaching overbought conditions. The recent higher lows and expanding candlestick body sizes point to a strengthening trend. However, resistance around the $0.038–$0.039 range, near the upper Bollinger Band, may cap immediate gains. If buying pressure persists, BRETT could target $0.045 next. Otherwise, consolidation may follow this surge. BRETT/USD 4-hour chart BRETT/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, BRETT appears to be in a short-term uptrend, reflected by consecutive bullish candles and its positioning above the midline of the Bollinger Bands. The price is nearing the upper band, suggesting strong momentum, though a brief consolidation or minor pullback is plausible. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, supporting bullish continuation, albeit with modest separation—implying a gradual trend rather than a breakout surge. However, the Balance of Power remains negative at -0.14, indicating lingering selling pressure. Overall, while upward momentum is evident, caution is advised as overextension near resistance may prompt a pause.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, BRETT displays signs of sustained bullish momentum. On the 1-day chart, the price has broken above the middle Bollinger Band, with RSI climbing above 60, indicating renewed buying interest. The 4-hour chart confirms this uptrend, showing consistently higher lows and bullish candlesticks approaching the upper Bollinger Band. The MACD also signals positive sentiment with the line trending above the signal, though the Balance of Power suggests some underlying bearish resistance. In summary, BRETT appears poised for further upside, but short-term corrections could occur before it establishes firmer ground above key resistance. Is BRETT a good investment? BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and the adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

According to SoSoValue data , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs brought in a modest $1.47 million in net inflows on Monday, breaking a seven-day outflow streak that saw $878 million pulled out. BlackRock’s IBIT led the gains with $36.72 million in inflows, but Fidelity’s FBTC offset most of that by seeing $35.25 million in outflows. The other ETFs had pretty quiet trading days. The overall daily trading volume across all BTC ETFs hit $2.16 billion on April 14, with total net inflows since launch sitting at $35.36 billion. While this small bounce hints at a possible shift in sentiment, things weren’t as positive for Ether ETFs. Ether ETFs saw outflows for the fifth day in a row, losing $5.98 million on Monday. Fidelity’s FETH was the biggest loser, with $7.78 million in outflows, while 21Shares’ CETH helped soften the blow a bit with $1.8 million in inflows. The slight improvement in ETF sentiment came after President Donald Trump announced that certain Chinese tech products, including smartphones and computers, would be exempt from his “reciprocal” tariffs. These exemptions followed weeks of rising tensions between the U.S. and China, where both sides had slapped heavy tariffs on each other, up to 145% from the U.S. and 125% from China, stirring fears of a full-blown trade war. You might also like: U.S. stocks climb, Bitcoin holds gains as Trump softens tariff stance Following the rollback, U.S. stock markets closed higher on Monday, and Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped back above $85,000 after holding strong at $84,000 support. It’s now up nearly 7% over the past week. However, the rollback, issued early on Saturday, may end up being short-lived, as Trump later clarified that these goods were simply being moved into a different tariff group or “bucket.” Analysts at crypto.news say Bitcoin is currently forming a Shark Harmonic pattern , a technical setup that often follows a consolidation phase. If this plays out, BTC might push past its previous all-time high near $110,000 before facing any major pullback. Still, not all macro trends are supportive. Agne Linge, head of growth at decentralized bank WeFi, pointed to rising 30-year bond yields in Japan, which just hit 2.345%, their highest level in 30 years. Linge warned this could signal a shift away from risk assets like Bitcoin, especially from institutions that prefer safer returns. “If the Bank of Japan reacts by raising interest rates, we could see liquidity dry up in both traditional markets and crypto,” Linge told crypto.news. “Crypto tends to do well when there’s more excess liquidity. So if Japan tightens up, it might pressure the space—at least short-term.” However, on a positive note, she added that the U.S. might help counterbalance this pressure. “Since the U.S. is a bigger market, the world may respond more toward the country’s monetary policies than Japan,” she added.

Bo Hines, executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, confirmed the strategy in an Apr. 14 interview with crypto investor Anthony Pompliano. “We’re looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, whether it be from something else,” Hines said. “Everything’s on the table.” The administration plans to acquire as much Bitcoin ( BTC ) as possible without adding to the national debt or increasing taxes. Apart from tariffs revenue, another approach under review is revaluing U.S. Treasury gold certificates, which are still listed at $43 per ounce, far below the market price of over $3,200. This revaluation could generate a large paper surplus, which would then be used to fund Bitcoin purchases without selling the gold itself. Hines said the goal is to build a long-term reserve and not to trade or sell the assets. “We obviously have made it very clear that we want to acquire as much as we can get. We have to acquire Bitcoin in budget-neutral ways that don’t cost a taxpayer a dime.” — Bo Hines, Presidential digital assets adviser You might also like: U.S. stocks climb, Bitcoin holds gains as Trump softens tariff stance The initiative has been previously supported by key figures in Trump’s economic team, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The proposal also aligns with the BITCOIN Act of 2025, backed by Senator Cynthia Lummis. The bill proposes that the U.S. acquire up to one million BTC over five years to establish a strategic reserve . Some of that Bitcoin could come from assets already held by the government, like crypto seized in criminal cases. Hines said the White House is also working on a digital asset strategy expected this summer. It will outline how the U.S. plans to support crypto innovation, regulate sectors like staking and tokenization, and promote U.S. dollar stablecoins globally. In the meantime, the price of Bitcoin has somewhat recovered from weekly lows brought on by worries about Trump tariffs . In the past week, Bitcoin has fallen below $80,000, reaching a low of about $75,000. It has since recovered and is trading around $85,505 as of press time. Short-term bullish momentum is indicated by the cryptocurrency’s recovery of its 50-day moving average. However, that upward trend may be tested by resistance at $88,000.

According to reports, the ADA whales dumped 100 million coins last week, sparking discussions in the market. Besides, analyses from the top experts hint that the crypto could be at a crossroads, which could either trigger a massive rally or a sharp decline from its current level. Cardano Price Consolidates: Here’s A Quick Tour Of ADA Performance ADA price today was marginally up by 0.26% traded at $0.6397 amid a slight recovery recorded in the broader crypto market. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $0.6557 and $0.6301, respectively. Notably, with its recent gains, Cardano price surged nearly 10% in the weekly chart while losing around 13% over the last 30 days. Meanwhile, the crypto has been on the investors’ radar over the past few days, especially after Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said that the ADA network is likely to boost Bitcoin adoption. Besides, he has also hinted towards several partnerships and other developments, which have further fueled the market sentiment. However, amid this, a massive selloff by the ADA whales has caught the eyes of the traders. Renowned expert Ali Martinez has highlighted the trend, saying that Cardano whales have offloaded more than 100 million ADA in the last week. This development has fueled concerns, with many believing a waning risk-bet appetite of the traders. Some have argued that the recent selloff could be due to the profit-booking strategy, after ADA price’s recent surge from a low of $0.51 seen on April 7. What Lies Ahead? As Cardano price recorded a slight recovery, investors are exploring the potential future move of the token. Amid this, top market experts have shared mixed predictions, which might help traders look at critical price levels to watch ahead. For context, analyst Ali Martinez notes that ADA is trading within a descending channel with key support at $0.63. A break below this level could trigger a downswing toward $0.54, potentially extending losses for Cardano price. On the other hand, Trader Tardigrade predicts a breakout above the current resistance, with a potential pullback to $0.6422. However, he has highlighted the $0.64 level as a good entry point. According to Tardigrade, ADA price could target $0.73, a previous consolidation level. Meanwhile, the contrasting predictions have investors closely monitoring the $0.63 support level, which could determine the token’s next direction. Now, the question lingers is if Cardano price can rebound to $0.73 or crash due to the ongoing selling pressure, plummeting to $0.5. Having said that, the coming days will be crucial in determining ADA’s trajectory, with traders eyeing key levels for potential breakouts or downturns. As the market awaits a clear direction, it seems that Cardano is poised to witness a significant price swing ahead. Besides, a recent ADA price prediction also indicates that its price might continue to remain stagnant in the coming days.

According to a recent announcement , the major crypto exchange plans to perform wallet maintenance on the BNB ( BNB ) Smart Chain starting from April 17 at 06:00 UTC. As a result, the network will be down temporarily as repairs are being made. This means that users will not be able to make deposits and withdrawals for the BNB Smart Chain for the time being. The temporarily suspension will take place five minutes before wallet maintenance is set to begin. Therefore, deposits and withdrawals for BNB Smart Chain will be paused on April 17 at 05:55 UTC. However, Binance claimed that users will still be able to trade BNB tokens while the wallet maintenance is taking place, as token trading will not be impacted by the network suspension. Based on information in the notice, wallet maintenance is expected to take about an hour to complete. Though, this is not a guarantee that the suspension will be lifted after an hour. Binance stated that deposits and withdrawals will resume once the network is deemed stable enough.

Pi Network ( PI ) has officially opened its Ad Network to all ecosystem-listed Pi apps. This means that developers whose apps are listed on the Mainnet Ecosystem Interface can now apply to integrate ads and begin earning revenue directly in PI coin. By enabling Pi-based advertising transactions, it creates a circular economy: advertisers spend PI to reach users, and developers earn PI in return for user engagement. The Pi Ad Network was initially piloted with five community apps in 2024. This development comes on the heels of another even bigger update. Just days before this announcement, Pi Network integrated with decentralized oracle provider Chainlink ( LINK ). You might also like: Pi Network price rebounds, but a risky pattern points to a crash What this means for PI price Together, these two developments signal a shift from speculative mining toward real adoption. The Chainlink integration brings Pi Network closer to enabling apps that rely on accurate, real-time data, such as DeFi apps, prediction markets, and blockchain games. As more apps are developed, the demand for Pi increases, as users will need Pi to interact with these applications. For instance, if DeFi apps are built on Pi Network, activities like lending, staking, trading, and liquidity protocols will require users to deposit or use PI, which will reduce the circulating supply, creating scarcity and driving up the token’s value. Then, the Ad Network further amplifies this growth. As more apps are built, developers can earn not just through their services, but also by hosting ads. Advertisers must buy PI to pay for those ads, which increases demand for the token and drives more utility across the ecosystem. The daily chart is already showing some early signs of a potential trend reversal after a prolonged downtrend . Most notably, PI price is attempting to stabilize and push above key moving averages. What’s particularly encouraging is that PI price is now hovering just below the 21-day Exponential Moving Average, currently at $0.7569, and has managed to push above the 20-day Simple Moving Average, which sits at $0.6793. This crossover of price above the SMA suggests that short-term sentiment is beginning to shift.

The lawsuit that was filed in the Southern District of New York, states that the design of the Phantom wallet exposed users to cyber attacks. Liam Murphy, the claimant’s attorney, stated that Phantom’s browser extension had exploitable holes through which hackers drained his crypto, leading to the failure of his Solana-based project known as Wiener Doge. After the attack, the token’s value plummeted to nearly 99% of its initial value, which was over $3 million. According to the complaints filed to the court, Phantom allegedly misconstrued its wallet security. The company reportedly stored users’ decrypted private keys in the browser memory, making it possible to violate most conventional secure practices such as two-factor authentication. Allegations suggest that the attacker managed to use Phantom’s built-in Swapper functionality to exchange Wiener Doge tokens for Solana (SOL), which led to the project’s failure. Because of this event, Wiener Doge which was priced at $3.1 per token, subsequently fell below $0.01. Allegations extend to Phantom’s partner OKX The lawsuit also goes further to accuse OKX of actively participating in the illegal liquidation of Murphy’s account. In that filing, OKX stated that the trading infrastructure that the hacker deployed allowed the movement of assets from Phantom using the wallet integration. The plaintiffs argue that OKX could have reasonably known that Phantom’s Swapper tool was functioning as an unregistered intermediary with the CFTC. The complaint also states that the stolen tokens were converted to SOL through OKX’s routing and pricing structures. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs said that the defendant could not have liquidated the stolen assets without the participation of OKX. Murphy and thirteen other individuals who invested in Wiener Doge through friends and family are suing for damages based on the token’s value during its peak. They also allege that there is a lack of primary protocols like velocity checks and geolocation anomaly detections that should otherwise be observed in similar exchanges to Coinbase. OKX’s prior legal issues are also featured in the case. The lawsuit cites the exchange’s guilty plea in a federal case over $5 billion in money laundering as an example of the exchange consistently disregarding compliance rules. The plaintiff stated that Phantom knew the danger arising from the storage of keys on the browser cache. They state that the company was fully aware that new users became common targets of phishing attacks and malware and yet did not act appropriately. Security experts challenge Phantom’s response Security researcher Cloakd recently claimed that Phantom never engaged with him to address the problem despite informing them of an application flaw. He said that he went for more than 28 days without any reply, though there could be a risk with users. In response, Phantom dismissed Cloakd’s allegations of endangering users’ funds. “I’ve been waiting for over 28 days for a large vulnerability to be fixed in one of the largest apps on SOL,” Cloakd said. Another developer from Taptrade named Andy supported Cloakd’s statements, citing that after he had submitted several reports on vulnerabilities in Phantom, he had never received any reply. Both analysts criticized Phantom for being laid-back regarding security matters. We just mass left a bunch of group DMs where we had been sharing exploits and bugs to teams across the ecosystem.

Some analysts see a breakout brewing, while others suggest more sideways action before a move. Still, many traders are holding firm—expecting XRP to reclaim momentum as the broader market steadies.

The Terra Luna like collapse has left the investors questioning if all of this was planned. The community notes that there were warning signs that were ignored which led to this massive loss. Crypto Jargon in a series of X posts has delved deeper to know what exactly happened in the OM crash and if there is any chance to recover the lost funds. Latest updates (April 14, 2025): • $OM has slightly increased to between $0.65 and $0.80, but trading volume is low—people have lost trust. • Users reported that 1.2 million $OM was moved to an unknown address today. Is there more selling happening? • HTX and Poloniex have… pic.twitter.com/6776VnuA2r — Neel (Crypto Jargon) (@Crypto_Jargon) April 14, 2025 On April 13, 2025, OM was doing fine at $6.70 with a market cap of $5.8 billion. Just a few hours later, at 6:00 PM UTC, its price plunged to $0.37 with the token losing a staggering 93% of its value in an hour. Some traders made huge profits by shorting OM. But what caused the crash? Earlier in the day around 2:00 PM UTC, OM co-founder Mullin tweeted “No wifi, will be offline for a bit.” Coincidentally, four hours later the price crashed. Later at 9:00 PM UTC, MANTRA’s Telegram Channel was mysteriously deleted. Where the matter gets more suspicious is, on April 12th, a day before the crash, 3.9 million OM tokens were sent to OKX. OM’s collapse was triggered by $66.97 million in forced liquidations over 12 hours, but the problems had been growing for months. Notably, the team controls about 90% of the OM supply, which gives them significant power to influence the price. By now, the investor trust was already low. Just a month ago, MANTRA’s OM airdrop blacklisted over 50% of wallets claiming that they were ‘bots’ without any evidence. Besides, the terms for unlocking funds was changed multiple times: first a 20% unlock, then 0.3% per day and finally 10% unlock with vesting period until 2027. This left the investors disappointed. The Warning Signs! The warning signs kept growing. Market makers were allegedly pumping up the token’s price before the crash. And the airdrops kept getting delayed raising concerns over price drop. In the days before the crash, on-chain data showed that 17 wallets sold 43.6 million OM, worth around $227 million, to exchanges, which was 4.5% of the total supply. Who dropped the price of $OM ? Before the $OM crash(since Apr 7), at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6M $OM ($227M at the time) into exchanges, 4.5% of the circulating supply. According to Arkham’s tag, 2 of these addresses are linked to Laser Digital. Laser Digital is a strategic… pic.twitter.com/zB8yAPRPSO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 14, 2025 Laser Digital denied any connection to OM token sales on OKX, claiming that they have not deposited tokens there. Shorooq Investors also denied selling OM tokens, blaming the crash on a large forced liquidation, as shown by on-chain data. Mullin Denies On-Chain Data Besides, Mullin denied Arkham’s data, saying that they didn’t know who owned the wallets selling OM before the crash. He claimed the wallets were “mislabeled” and referenced a transparency report from April 8 with key wallet addresses. Panic broke out in the market when the $3.9 million worth of OM appeared on OKX. Investors feared drop, selling pressure surged which was further aggravated by OTC deals where insiders sold tokens at a 50% discount to large investors who dumped them after crash. Short sellers profited as stop-losses triggered and borrowed positions were liquidated. Community Left In Dark Within 60 minutes, OM lost 93% of its value and over $5.5 billion in market cap was vanished. The community were quick to compared this to the LUNA crash. MANTRA’s Telegram channel was suddenly deleted, leaving behind a creepy last message: “LUNA 2.0”. With no updates and no accountability, the community was left in the dark. The Mantra team claims that the collapse was caused by broader market pressures and centralized exchanges closing positions, triggering a chain reaction of liquidations. OKX added that the price drop started with a spike in trading volume and initial declines on exchanges outside of OKX, before spreading to the entire market. On April 14, OKX announced that Mantra’s tokenomics had changed significantly since October 2024 and warned of suspicious activity across several exchanges. Was It A Rug Pull? Rumors of a rug pull also began circulating with traders fearing that developers might abandon the project. Market investor Gordon warned that it could be biggest rug pull since LUNA/FTX. However Mantra executives have firmly denied the claims providing verification addresses to show that the team’s tokens remain locked as planned. “To be clear, this dislocation was not caused by the team, the MANTRA Chain Association, its core advisors, or MANTRA’s investors selling tokens. Tokens remain locked and subject to the published vesting periods,” the team stated in their community update. In the latest updates, OM is trading between $0.65 and $0.80, while the trading volume remains low. But the trust has now dropped. Besides, 1.2 million OM was moved to an unknown address which sparked concerns of more selling. Major exchanges like HTX and Poloniex have reduced OM trading options and Binance has even issued a warning. Meanwhile, Dubai’s VARA is investigating MANTRA’s license after several complaints. OM Shows No Signs Of Recovery OKX’s CEO has called it a “major scandal,” questioning its lack of transparency despite public on-chain data. Before the crash, OM seemed unstoppable. It even reached an all-time high of $9.04 in February and was up 825% year-on-year, even as the broader crypto market declined. While OM was once a leader in Real-world assets, it still fell apart. Besides, unlike LUNA, OM is showing no signs of recovery.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|OM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-15 08:02:34

This unexpected drop has raised concerns across the crypto space. Prominent Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin has now issued a strong warning to the Pi Network team, urging them to learn from the Mantra crash and avoid making the same mistakes. Mantra Crypto Crash by 95% OM, the native coin of Mantra blockchain, that works to bring real-world things, like houses or land, onto the blockchain in digital form. It was seen as a trusted project and was even ranked in the top 25 crypto by market cap. Perhaps things took a sudden turn, and in just one hour, OM’s price fell drastically from $6.10 all the way down to $0.38 . Due to this, over $6 billion in value was lost, and many people in the crypto space lost their life savings. Thus, Dr. Altcoin said this crash is a big warning for everyone in the crypto world. He warned the Pi Core Team (PCT) to take note of what happened with Mantra OM and make sure Pi Network avoids the same mistakes. Warning for the Pi Network Team Dr. Altcoin also gave a clear warning to the Pi Core Team (PCT), stating that Pi Network is transitioning from the Open Network to the Open Mainnet. That’s a big step and comes with more responsibility. He urged the Pi team to speed up the development of safety features before making the big switch. As they move forward, they need to focus on more transparency, clear rules, and open communication with their users. Community Response over Pi Network Warning After Dr. Altcoin shared his warning about the Pi Network on X, many users gave their opinions. Some strongly believe that the Pi Core Team (PCT) would never do anything that could hurt their name or reputation. One user said that Pi is not like other coins that suddenly rise and fall in price just to trick people. They said the team is still working on building useful things and steadily growing the network. Another user added that the Pi team has been very quiet lately, but maybe that’s part of their plan. They believe the team might be focusing on their work and not ready to speak just yet.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|OM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-15 08:08:49

However, this time, the significance of that 60% dominance is far greater due to the explosive growth in the number of cryptocurrencies and the erosion of formerly prominent altcoins. Back in 2021, the cryptocurrency industry was relatively small, with only around 3,000 to 4,000 active projects. Fast forward to 2025, and there are reportedly millions of cryptocurrencies, an astronomical increase that makes Bitcoin’s dominance much more impactful. While its total crypto market share remains the same, the sheer size of the industry now means that Bitcoin is commanding a far larger portion of a significantly bigger pie. Bitcoin’s Resilience In recent weeks, Bitcoin has seen price fluctuations that highlight its continued dominance. After dipping to a five-month low just above $74,000, the asset rebounded with a surge past $85,000, driven by positive US CPI data and political developments, including relief in tariffs between the US and global trade partners. Despite a brief rejection at $86,000, Bitcoin still maintains its upward trajectory. The impact of this price movement is amplified by the dominance it holds in the market. Unlike in 2021, when altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) were enjoying more significant gains, today’s market paints a different picture. In fact, the ETH/BTC trading pair has fallen to 0.019, its lowest level since January 2020. This signaled a steep decline in Ethereum’s relative strength compared to Bitcoin. The dominance of other altcoins has been eroded, and their market share has failed to recover in a meaningful way. Hayes Forecasts 70% Dominance Bitcoin’s market dominance is further amplified by predictions from prominent figures like Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX. Hayes recently suggested that its dominance could rise to as high as 70%, a forecast supported by the increasing accumulation of Bitcoin whales. Hayes attributes this growing dominance to the crypto asset’s appeal as a hedge against inflation, especially in light of potential shifts in United States monetary policy, such as interest rate cuts and more money printing. As the broader market grapples with these conditions, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a safe store of value, which is further expected to solidify its position at the top of the market. When Altseason? Prominent crypto analyst Rekt Capital has weighed in on the ongoing Bitcoin dominance trend and said that the much-anticipated “altseason” could begin once the metric rejects the 71% level. Rekt Capital highlighted that historical patterns point to a potential turning point for altcoins when BTC’s market share reaches this threshold and then pulls back. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s dominance often peaks around 71%, and once it starts to decline from this level, altcoins typically experience a surge in value and market activity. As such, if history repeats itself, Bitcoin’s current dominance could set the stage for a broader market shift, which would enable altcoins to reclaim some of the market share they’ve lost in recent months.

Bitcoin Eyes Key Liquidity Zones Above $90,000 Crypto analyst CrypNuevo provided insights in a recent update on social media site X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing that despite the chaos surrounding tariffs and potential market manipulation, there are key data points and trends to monitor. The analyst highlighted the importance of liquidity and price action in the days ahead, noting that liquidations are primarily concentrated in the upside range between $90,000 and $91,500—psychological levels for many traders. With Bitcoin gaining 7% on the weekly time frame, potential for a move to tackle these liquidity zones might be expected, further recovering from the cryptocurrency’s crash toward $74,000 experienced last week. Related Reading: XRP Tests Ascending Triangle Resistance – Can Bulls Reach $2.40 Level? CrypNuevo also mentioned that the current liquidation delta is relatively balanced, with approximately $15 billion in long positions at maximum liquidity. He suggested that a threshold of over $25 billion in liquidations would warrant closer attention. The analyst’s ideal scenario for the coming week involves price compression between the daily and weekly 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA), as of now placed at approximately $86,000, which could lead to a significant expansion in price. Rising Wedge Formation Analysts often look for patterns in market behavior, and CrypNuevo speculated that a third retest could occur, following the market’s tendency to move in threes. The analyst alleges that this would further compress prices, potentially leading to a more aggressive breakout later on. He identified a key mid-range support line at $81,000, suggesting that while this scenario may be slightly less likely, it remains a possibility. Another prominent analyst, Ali Martinez, echoed these sentiments on social media, identifying the critical support level for Bitcoin at $82,024, where approximately 96,580 BTC were previously accumulated. Related Reading: Cardano Could Drop To $0.54 If This Support Gives Out, Analyst Says This zone could be of key support for the cryptocurrency in case of CrypNuevo’s scenario of further retests taking place in the coming days for BTC’s price. However, Ali Martinez also pointed out on social media that BTC may be forming a rising wedge pattern, which could indicate a potential retest of the $79,000 support level. While Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $85,000, it still remains over 21% below its all-time high of $109,000, which was reached in January of this year. However, with the current market sentiment indicating a renewed sense of bullishness, this gap may close rapidly over the course of the month.

The S token was trading at $0.50 on Tuesday, up by 35% from its lowest level this month, giving it a market cap of over $1.47 billion. Sonic ecosystem growth is continuing Sonic, a recently rebranded blockchain network, has become one of the fastest-growing players in the crypto industry. It was rebranded from Fantom, a network that was associated with Andre Kronje, one of the most popular developers. Kronje currently leads Sonic Labs and is best known for being the creator of Yearn Finance, a top play Sonic has become popular among developers and users in the past few months. This popularity is mostly because of its significantly lower fees than other layer-1 chains. Sonic also introduced an innovative fee monetization program that has rewarded developers. This model returns about 90% of all the fees that their app generates on the chain, with the remaining 10% going to the validators. This model has helped it to attract developers on the network. It has attracted 116 developers in the DeFi industry, with the total value locked (TVL) rising by 24% in the last 30 days to $1 billion. DeFi dApps on the Sonic blockchain are more than other networks that have been around for years. For example, Tron has only 35 dApps, while Sui and Aptos have less than 60 each. Cardano, one of the biggest players in the crypto industry, has 45 apps. The top dApps on the Sonic blockchain are AAVE, Silo Finance, Beets, Veda, and Pendle. Read more: Top cryptocurrencies to watch: Sonic, XRP, Cardano, Solana More data shows that Sonic’s growth is accelerating. For example, it has over $543 million in stablecoins, most of which are USD Coin. This makes it a top chain in the USDC issuance, a notable achievement since it was launched a few months ago. At the same time, the number of transactions on Sonic has jumped to over 852k, up from 358k in its lowest point in March. Sonic price analysis: is it a safe buy? Sonic token has underperformed the market even after its strong ecosystem growth. One reason for this is that existing holders expect to be highly diluted in the coming months. That’s because Sonic launched with a supply of 3.175 million tokens. This supply will increase by 6% in June, with the newly minted tokens going to Fantom Opera and Sonic users. This airdrop will have a burning mechanism that will reduce the supply count over time. The developers will also mint additional tokens this year, with the new cash going towards growing the team, marketing, and increasing the S adoption. Sonic will mint 47,625,000 tokens annually for six years. The caveat is that Sonic will burn any unused tokens during the year. Sonic price analysis S price chart | Source: TradingView The four-hour chart shows that the Sonic token price has bounced back a bit in the past few days. This rebound happened after the token bottomed at $0.3803 earlier this month. Sonic has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.4088, and a nekline at $0.6327, its highest level on March 26. The token has moved slightly above the 50-period moving average and formed a bullish flag pattern. It has also formed a small inverse head and shoulders pattern. Therefore, the Sonic price will likely have a strong bullish breakout, with the next point to watch being at $0.6327, up by 23% from the current level. A drop below the support at $0.50 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

The primary cryptocurrency endured a highly volatile and painful five-day trading period last week when its price tumbled below $75,000 for the first time since November after Trump’s Trade War took another turn for the worse. After an immediate but brief bounce, BTC dropped to those levels once again on Wednesday. However, the tariff pause for most countries, except China, and the favorable US CPI data for March brought some much-needed relief to the crypto market. Bitcoin skyrocketed past $83,000 on the same day and jumped to $84,000 during the weekend after a brief correction at first. Sunday was even more positive as the asset climbed to $85,000 and tapped $86,000 for the first time in a week on Monday.

In the following lines, we will touch upon these topics in detail. SOL ETFs to go live in Canada Earlier this week, Eric Balchunas (Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg) revealed that the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) approved several spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded funds. These will be the first such investment vehicles to go live in Canada, and the expected launch date is April 16. The issuers include Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, CI Global Asset Management, and 3iQ. The upcoming products will invest in long-term holdings of Solana in physical form but will track different indices. They will also engage in staking activities to earn rewards. Meanwhile, some well-known entities have submitted applications to launch SOL ETFs in the United States. The list includes VanEck, Grayscale , 21Shares, Canary Capital, and more. According to Polymarket, the approval odds before the end of 2025 currently stand at approximately 82%. SOL is now available on OpenSea 2.0 OpenSea, the leading decentralized marketplace for buying, selling, and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs), recently opened Solana token trading on OS2 (short for OpenSea 2.0, the next-generation version of the platform). The initiative is available to some closed beta users and will be rolled out to additional participants in the next weeks. “This is a big milestone in our multi-chain journey. Solana has some of the most passionate users and builders in Web3,” OpenSea stated. Price outlook Earlier this month, Solana’s native token briefly crashed below $100, and some analysts assumed the freefall could continue to much lower levels in the near future. However, the bulls stepped in, and in the following days, SOL experienced a significant revival. As of this writing, it trades at around $131 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 35% increase from the local bottom. SOL Price, Source: CoinGecko Numerous industry participants think the asset has much more room for growth. The X user BitBull claimed SOL “is setting up for a massive move in 2025” and could repeat Ethereum’s performance from 2021. They believe the $120-$130 range is an accumulation zone, setting a target of over $300. For their part, Crypto Tony said they are “back long on Solana” above the $125 support zone. TVL on the rise SOL’s total value locked (TVL) – a key metric referring to the total value of assets locked in DeFi applications operating on the Solana blockchain – has gradually increased in the past few days. The figure stood at around $6 billion on April 9, while over the weekend, it surged above $7 billion. When SOL TVL goes up, it generally means that more capital is being locked into Solana’s DeFi apps, showing rising user activity, trust, and ecosystem growth. It is worth mentioning , though, that the indicator is measured in USD, meaning that if the price of the underlying token heads north, TVL automatically increases even if the same amount of SOL remains locked.

In the past 24 hours, Solana’s DEX volume has reached $2.509 blion, with Ethereum still standing at $1.895 billion. Among the DEXs leading this growth are Orca, PumpFun, Raydium, Meteora, with Orca leading the pack with a 15% increase in trading volume . This news came in as Jupiter, another dominant 2021-built Solana DEX, launched an advanced version of its platform, Jupiter Pro. In a bid to maintain its pivotal role, it has introduced new featured and better trading experience. What’s New in Solana DEX Jupiter’s New Platform? While platforms like Orca, Raydium, and Meteora continue to operate as independent DEXs, their individual trading volumes are significantly lower than Jupiter’s aggregated volume. Solana DEX Jupiter’s role as an aggregator enables it to offer superior liquidity and better pricing. This attracts a larger user base and higher trading activity. Now in its pro version, it has slashed down the gas fees by 10x. The reduced gas fees by 10x will also prove to attractive for users. It can also be a major advantage for traders looking to make frequent trades with lower costs compared to Ethereum-based tokens. This will ultimately end up in making Solana-based tokens potentially more profitable to trade in 2025. Other notable new tools and features in Jupiter Pro include: It includes new token page/terminal for better token analysis of Solana coins. Users can choose between SOL or USDC as their default currency. It provides new momentum metrics like Net Buy Volume and Net Buyers. Further, it has also provided community metrics so that investors can make decisions based on the ongoing narratives/sentiments in their community. Redesigned Token Terminal | Source: Jupiter Pro DEX MEV Protection for Investors Solana DEX Jupiter has also introduced the new option of Quick Buy which will allow investors to trade instantly with a default amount. Jupiter Pro’s ultra mode which it has enabled in Quick Buys and in the token terminal, will also provide the MEV protection to users. The MEV protection ensures that professional traders can execute trades without the risk of malicious actors exploiting transaction reordering for profit, thus, creating fairer trading conditions. Notably, in January 2025, Jupiter DEX experienced a substantial surge in trading activity, with its monthly trading volume reaching $184 billion. This growth was influenced by factors such as the launch of new tokens like the Trump memecoin, which attracted a large number of traders to the platform. This dominance is also attributed to Jupiter’s efficient liquidity aggregation from over 29 protocols, including Orca, Raydium, Phoenix, Lifinity, and Meteora. This together contributes to nearly 90% of Jupiter’s trading volume. This news also come in as MANTRA (OM) Token price looks to rebound after 90% crash. Growing DeFi on Solana Solana DEX Jupiter is launching its pro version at a time when Solana’s DEX and Defi ecosystem continues to grow. This growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Solana in 2025 will likely drive more demand for Solana-based tokens like SOL, USDC, and SRM. And as the Solana community deliberates and implements a new network upgrade, this might also bode well for SOL price in Q2 2025. Further, as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms on Solana grow, tokens like RAY (Raydium) and MNGO (Mango Markets) can see higher trading volumes. Solana DEXs Nonetheless, whether you’re a casual trader or a professional investor, Jupiter Pro promises to be an exciting development in the world of DeFi. Now it remains to be seen how investors and traders adopt to this new interface of Solana DEX Jupiter.

Lookonchain says on the social media platform X that multiple wallets had sent millions of OM tokens to crypto exchanges prior to Mantra’s 90% price meltdown over the weekend. Based on Lookonchain’s data, some of the exchanges that received the deposits include OKX and Binance. “Who dropped the price of OM? Before the OM crash(since Apr 7th), at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6 million OM($227 million at the time) into exchanges, 4.5% of the circulating supply. According to Arkham’s tag, two of these addresses are linked to Laser Digital. Laser Digital is a strategic investor in Mantra.” Source: Lookonchain/X On Sunday, Mantra witnessed a sudden price meltdown, dropping from a high of $6.35 to a low of $0.37 – a whopping decline of 94% in just one day. Simultaneously, its market cap plunged from $6.11 billion to $683.3 million. Crypto asset management firm Laser Digital says that it is not involved in the price collapse of Mantra. “We want to directly address recent speculation around Laser Digital’s involvement in the price action of OM (Mantra)… Assertions circulating on social media that link Laser to ‘investor selling’ are factually incorrect and misleading… On-chain movements of OM linked to Laser wallets have been flagged publicly. We want to be absolutely clear: Laser has not deposited any OM tokens to OKX. The wallets being referenced to OKX are not Laser wallets.” Meanwhile, Mantra CEO JP Mullin blames crypto exchanges for OM’s sudden price collapse, noting that the firms needlessly closed large positions during low-liquidity hours. At time of writing, OM is trading for $0.595, down 32.5% in the past day.

On April 11, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) confirmed that 14 crypto apps, including major names like KuCoin and MEXC, have been blocked from the Apple Store. This move follows a similar takedown on Google Play last month, signaling a coordinated regulatory effort to keep unauthorized digital asset platforms away from Korean users. Apple Store Crackdown Widens After Google Ban A report published by the FSC on April 14 reveals the reason behind the move: the affected exchanges are accused of operating as unregistered overseas virtual asset service providers (VASPs). Under South Korea regulatory framework, any platform offering crypto sales, custody, or management to Korean citizens must be registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The FSC has made it clear that noncompliance isn’t just a minor infraction—it’s a criminal offense. Violators face up to five years behind bars or a fine of 50 million won (about $35,200). The FSC and FIU also announced that they’ll continue blocking access to websites and apps associated with such exchanges to prevent money laundering and protect users from potential losses. Rising User Base Spurs Regulatory Urgency The urgency behind South Korea’s aggressive stance is tied to the nation’s growing crypto user base. As of March 31, more than 16 million Koreans—over 30% of the population—are active users on crypto exchanges. Industry insiders anticipate that number could swell to over 20 million by the end of 2025, prompting regulators to act swiftly in ensuring market stability and consumer protection. The crackdown isn’t limited to apps. South Korea officials have been closely monitoring market players since March, when local media reported that both the FSC and FIU were weighing sanctions against non-compliant operators. The sanctions now materializing include both app and internet site restrictions, making it increasingly difficult for unregistered exchanges to do business in the country. Notably, the influence of crypto extends far beyond retail investors. Recent disclosures show that more than 20% of South Korean public officials own digital assets, with their holdings totaling $9.8 million as of late March. Popular tokens in these portfolios include Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and even Dogecoin—highlighting just how embedded crypto has become in Korean society .

Tether plans to mine Bitcoin through OCEAN Tether❤️Bitcoin https://t.co/MTEof7WW31 — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) April 14, 2025 In an announcement on April 14, Tether, the USDT issuer and the largest company in the digital assets field, revealed its plan to deploy its existing Hashrate on OCEAN, established by Luke Dashjr, Bitcoin Core developer. The firm said it would also deploy its future hashrate on the giant Bitcoin mining pool, which is mainly focused on decentralization. Tether noted that this strategic deployment enhances the company’s ongoing commitment to promoting transparency. The company added that the deployment showcases its commitment to resilience and decentralization of the foundational infrastructure of Bitcoin. The firm revealed that OCEAN allows miners to craft their own block templates leveraging their open-source DATUM protocol.

Zanganeh affirmed that the DATUM protocol is the right software stack, which is aligned with the decentralization ethos of Bitcoin. The VP stated that its architecture enables miners to achieve reliable connectivity even in regions with low bandwidth. Zanganeh said that achieving reliable connectivity in such regions will expand the reach and the resilience of the company’s infrastructure. OCEAN management welcomed the move, terming it a phenomenal moment for the Bitcoin mining industry. OCEAN’s Chairman and CTO Luke Dashjr said that the involvement of Tether in their operations is a good signal that decentralization is a key priority for Bitcoin’s future. Dashjr noted that Tether’s participation highlights the importance of open, censorship-resistant Bitcoin mining operations.

Notably, the crypto market has recorded volatile trading lately, especially as President Donald Trump’s Tariff policy has dampened market sentiment, triggering a massive selloff in the broader financial market. However, with recent indications of further tariff relief, the investors seem to be entering the digital assets space again today. BTC Price Today Soars Amid Trump’s Tariff Relief Bitcoin price surged nearly 2% today as global financial markets reacted to recent comments from Donald Trump. The US President hinted at easing certain trade barriers, sparking renewed interest in digital assets. Investors, previously spooked by tariff escalations, appear to be shifting focus back to crypto. Bitcoin traded at $85,896k, after touching a high of $85,926 in the last 24 hours. However, its one-day volume fell nearly 6% to $28.58 billion while CoinGlass data showed that BTC Futures Open Interest rose around 1%, reflecting renewed market confidence. Meanwhile, this rebound in the financial market comes as Trump suggested possible exemptions from the steep 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. This potential relief for key partners like Mexico and Canada has calmed nerves in a market rattled by protectionist policies. According to reports, Trump’s administration has also walked back some earlier tariffs. Notably, gadgets like smartphones, laptops, and other tech products from China are now off the hook. However, despite the softer rhetoric, uncertainty looms. Reports suggest the administration may target new areas, such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. These sectors are critical to global trade and could face steep duties. Tensions with China remain high, with certain goods still facing tariffs up to 145%, while China maintains retaliatory measures of 125%. Crypto Market In Focus Amid the looming market uncertainty, investors are once again shifting their focus towards the digital assets space, especially Bitcoin. Besides, the Trump administration is reportedly considering using tariff revenues to purchase BTC, which has further fueled market sentiment. Besides, the recent meeting between Donald Trump and BTC president Nayib Bukele has further bolstered market sentiment. On the other hand, the US government is exploring ways to accumulate more BTC, according to Bo Hines , Executive Director of the Presidential Digital Asset Advisory Committee. This move is part of President Trump’s commitment to make the US a global crypto leader. The government is considering using tariff revenues to fund a national Bitcoin reserve, signaling a potential shift in economic strategy. With BTC currently trading near $86K, the administration’s plan could redefine digital assets’ role in the US economy. Besides, it could also help continue its run towards the run ahead. Source: Michael van de Poppe, X Meanwhile, as BTC price today recorded a robust surge, analyst Michael van de Poppe has shared key insights on the potential future trajectory of the coin. In a recent X post, Poppe said that if BTC breaks through $87K, it could potentially target $92K to $94K in the coming days.

However, the crypto market has witnessed significant recovery since Trump put a pause on smartphone and electronics tariffs. However, his recent announcement of “no country is getting off the hook” is re-introducing concerns among investors. Trump to Re-introduces Tariff on Smartphones & Electronics, Time to sell Altcoins? With the ongoing US-China trade war, Bitcoin and altcoins faced a significant downtrend as investors opted to sell them. Even before these assets could regain support, Donald Trump’s Truth post brought uncertainty. Recently, he emphasized that the exemption of smartphones & electronics from tariffs is short-lived. There was no Tariff exception; they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that electronics are only exempted from the reciprocal tariff but are included in the semiconductor tariff. He further claimed that the semiconductor tariff would be coming soon, probably in a month or two. Additionally, Trump has announced a national security tariff investigation in the semiconductor and electronics supply chain. We will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China. As the US has raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and the Chinese government has retaliated with 125%, the new addition of tariffs could bring further volatility. Not only the struggling but also the performing cryptos could struggle. As a result, investors must consider the poor performing and volatility-filled crypto to sell. Top 3 Altcoins to Sell Now Although Trump’s tariff affects crypto prices, a few digital assets could face additional downtrends due to massive token unlocks, creating the need to sell them. According to Tokenomist, more than a billion tokens will be unlocked in the upcoming days, affecting the crypto’s price. This includes Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) coin. This once- trending meme coin is already struggling on the charts, and the upcoming $321.6M worth of tokens that will be unlocked on April 18 could crash its price further due to high volatility. Arbitrum (ARB) and Starkent (STRK) are the two other altcoins to sell due to their $16.40M and $27.20M token unlocks. Notably, these cryptos were impacted by market volatility and are under a significant downtrend. The unlocks would add liquidity, decreasing demand and crashing prices.

Gold remains the top safe-haven asset among global reserve managers. Kiyosaki warns of rising financial risks for stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. A new global survey of central bank reserve managers has shown a decline in interest in digital asset investments over the medium term, contrary to public narratives suggesting increasing institutional adoption. This finding contradicts public narratives about growing institutional crypto adoption, showing banks favoring gold instead. Central Bank Survey Reveals Declining Crypto Interest The annual reserve management survey conducted by Central Banking between January and February 2025 found that only 2.1% of central banks are considering digital asset investments within the next five to ten years.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself for explosive growth in 2025. The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.8 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 8300 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. MUTM is expected to soar to as high as $1.10 in the coming months. If you’re ready to take the plunge into a potential game-changing crypto, now might be the perfect time to invest before the price shoots up. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 8300 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $6.8 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. MUTM has introduced tangible features, including a new dashboard leaderboard that tracks its top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. As investors grow more utility-focused, MUTM’s rise signals what could be the next win in crypto, substance over spectacle. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.025 in Phase 4 presale, is gaining traction with over $6.8M raised from 8,300+ investors. With a projected surge to $1.10 in 2025, early buyers could see 4,300% returns. Its dual lending model (P2P + P2C), staking rewards, USD-backed stablecoin, and $100K giveaway make it a strong under-$1 altcoin pick.

While dollar-backed stablecoins have long dominated the crypto landscape, a challenger is emerging, fueled by global economic shifts and a growing appetite for diversification. We’re talking about Circle’s EURC stablecoin, and its recent surge in demand is nothing short of unstoppable . Are you ready to delve into why euro crypto is suddenly soaring and what this means for the future of digital finance? EURC Stablecoin Demand Surges to Record Highs Recent reports highlight an explosive growth in the demand for EURC, Circle’s euro-backed stablecoin. CoinDesk reported that the supply of EURC reached an all-time high last month, signaling a significant shift in the stablecoin market. Data from RWA.xyz confirms this trend, revealing that the EURC supply hit a remarkable $246 million in March, a staggering 43% increase. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a clear indication that the appetite for euro-denominated digital assets is rapidly growing. Let’s break down the key statistics: All-Time High Supply: EURC supply reached a peak of $246 million in March. Impressive Growth: A 43% surge in supply underscores the escalating demand. Market Position: EURC now stands higher than Paxos’ Global Dollar (USDG) in market capitalization, although it remains smaller than Ripple’s RLUSD. Dominant Euro Stablecoin: EURC holds the title of the largest euro-backed stablecoin currently available. While the dollar-backed stablecoin market still dwarfs the euro counterpart, accounting for a massive 99% of the total stablecoin market, EURC’s rapid ascent cannot be ignored. It begs the question: What’s driving this sudden interest in euro stablecoin demand? Decoding the Drivers Behind Euro Stablecoin Demand Several factors are contributing to the heightened demand for EURC and, more broadly, the rising interest in euro stablecoins. Let’s explore the primary drivers: Rising Trade Tensions: Global trade dynamics are in flux, and uncertainties are on the rise. The specter of increased tariffs, reminiscent of the Trump administration’s policies, casts a shadow over international trade. In such times of uncertainty, investors and businesses often seek refuge in alternative currencies and assets. Weakening Dollar: The U.S. dollar, while still a global reserve currency, has experienced periods of weakness. Concerns about inflation, economic policies, and global economic shifts can erode confidence in the dollar, prompting a search for alternatives. Diversification Strategies: Savvy investors understand the importance of diversification. Just as you wouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket, diversifying away from dollar-centric assets makes prudent financial sense. Euro stablecoins offer a compelling avenue for crypto diversification. Geopolitical Factors: Global events and geopolitical tensions can influence currency valuations and investor sentiment. As different regions navigate their unique challenges and opportunities, the appeal of diversifying into currencies beyond the dollar strengthens. These factors combined create a fertile ground for the growth of euro stablecoins like EURC. As uncertainty becomes the new normal in the global economic landscape, the appeal of diversifying into euro-denominated digital assets becomes increasingly compelling. Stablecoin Market: Beyond Dollar Dominance and Crypto Diversification The stablecoin market has long been synonymous with dollar-pegged tokens like USDT and USDC. These giants have facilitated trillions of dollars in transactions, becoming the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and cryptocurrency trading. However, the recent surge in EURC demand signals a potential shift – a move towards greater crypto diversification within the stablecoin space itself. Here’s why this diversification is significant: Reduced Reliance on a Single Currency: Over-reliance on any single currency, even the dollar, can pose risks. Diversifying into euro stablecoins mitigates this risk by providing exposure to a different economic zone and currency. Access to Eurozone Markets: For businesses and individuals operating within or engaging with the Eurozone, EURC offers a more natural and efficient medium of exchange. It simplifies transactions and reduces currency conversion complexities. Exploring New Opportunities: A more diverse stablecoin market opens up new opportunities for arbitrage, trading pairs, and DeFi applications. It fosters a more resilient and adaptable crypto ecosystem. Geographical Decentralization: While cryptocurrency is inherently global, the dominance of dollar stablecoins has created a certain degree of geographical concentration. The rise of euro stablecoins contributes to a more geographically decentralized crypto landscape. The growth of EURC isn’t just about one stablecoin; it’s about the evolution of the entire stablecoin market towards greater diversity and resilience. It reflects a maturing market that is starting to look beyond dollar dominance and embrace a multi-currency future. Circle EURC: Benefits and Considerations Circle’s EURC stablecoin, as the leading euro-backed stablecoin, offers a range of benefits, but it’s also important to consider potential challenges. Benefits of EURC: Euro Peg: EURC is pegged 1:1 to the euro, providing price stability relative to the euro currency. Transparency and Trust: Circle, the issuer of EURC, is a regulated and reputable company known for its USDC stablecoin. This lends credibility and trust to EURC. Interoperability: EURC is available on multiple blockchains, enhancing its accessibility and usability across different crypto platforms. Diversification Tool: EURC serves as an excellent tool for diversifying crypto holdings beyond dollar-pegged assets. Eurozone Access: Facilitates seamless transactions and access to the Eurozone economic area within the crypto world. Considerations for EURC: Smaller Market Cap: Compared to dollar stablecoins, EURC’s market cap is still relatively small, which could impact liquidity in certain trading scenarios. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins, particularly in Europe, is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact EURC and other stablecoins. Adoption Rate: While demand is surging, EURC’s overall adoption rate is still growing. Wider adoption is crucial for its long-term success and utility. Despite these considerations, the trajectory of EURC is undeniably upward. As the demand for euro stablecoins continues to grow, EURC is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in the evolving digital currency landscape. The Future of Crypto Diversification and the Digital Euro The rise of EURC could be a precursor to a broader trend – the increasing adoption of various currency-backed stablecoins, including potentially a digital euro issued by central banks. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are gaining traction globally, and a digital euro CBDC could further solidify the role of the euro in the digital economy. Here’s what the future might hold: More Currency Options: We could see a proliferation of stablecoins backed by different fiat currencies, offering users a wider array of choices. CBDC Integration: CBDCs like a digital euro could potentially integrate with existing stablecoin ecosystems, creating a hybrid financial system. Enhanced Cross-Border Transactions: Multi-currency stablecoin and CBDC options could streamline and reduce the costs of cross-border payments and transactions. Greater Financial Inclusion: Digital currencies, including euro stablecoins and CBDCs, have the potential to enhance financial inclusion by providing access to financial services for underserved populations. The journey towards a more diversified and multi-currency digital financial system is just beginning. The surging demand for EURC is a significant milestone, signaling a shift away from dollar-centric dominance and towards a more inclusive and geographically balanced crypto future. The euro crypto story is just getting started, and its potential is truly unstoppable . In conclusion, the surge in demand for Circle’s EURC stablecoin is more than just a fleeting trend. It’s a powerful indicator of evolving global economic dynamics, a growing appetite for crypto diversification, and the potential for a multi-currency digital financial future. As trade tensions persist and the global economic landscape shifts, euro stablecoins like EURC are poised to play an increasingly vital role in the world of cryptocurrency and beyond.

In a recent post on April 15, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) advocate said that market structure legislation will be able to open “the flood gates” for capital. He believes that regulatory clarity will lure in more investors to inject capital inflows into the market, paving the way for a bullish season for BTC. “Once signed into law, the flood gates will be wide open and the rush of capital will be like nothing you’ve ever seen before. Massively bullish for Bitcoin,” said Porter. Hear me out. Market structure legislation will be a massive boon to the price of Bitcoin. Once signed into law, the flood gates will be wide open and the rush of capital will be like nothing you’ve ever seen before. Massively bullish for Bitcoin. — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) April 15, 2025 Most recently, Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, said that the administration aims to have a crypto market bill formalized into law by August 2025. Porter echoed this sentiment in a separate post when another X user asked him what the realistic time goal for the bill would be. “The White House wants it done by August. We shall see,” said Porter.

The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading hands at $85,815. It reached a daily peak of $85,903 just a few hours prior. In the past week, BTC has gone up more than 8%. How would a market structure bill benefit Bitcoin? The market structure bill for crypto is a legislation that is meant to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. Dubbed the crypto market bill, it seeks to divide oversight between federal agencies, by assigning securities -related tokens to the SEC and commodity-like tokens to the CFTC . It also serves to create registration categories for crypto intermediaries such as exchanges and brokers. If the crypto market bill gets passed, it has the potential to remove a lot of the regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto that has long hindered institutional players from investing in the space. A massive increase in the flow of capital usually indicates a bullish season for the crypto market, especially BTC which is considered the staple asset. Not only that, a surge in institutional adoption and new players entering the industry could increase demand for Bitcoin. Given its fixed and limited supply, a significant jump in demand push the BTC price to new heights.

KERNEL’s debut on Binance was met with a swift sell-off as Airdrop recipients offloaded their holdings. The token fell by nearly 44% to a session low of $0.262, bringing its market cap down to $48.6 million. The launch triggered a frenzy of activity, with 24-hour trading volume surging to nearly $380 million. At the time, around 149.8 million KERNEL tokens were in circulation. KERNEL began trading on April 14 with multiple pairs, including KERNEL/USDT and KERNEL/BNB. Beyond spot trading, Binance also rolled out KERNEL across other key services, like Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Convert, Margin, and Futures with up to 75x leverage. This listing followed Binance’s announcement that KERNEL was the fourth project on its Megadrop platform , which ran from April 9 to April 13. Users who locked BNB in Simple Earn and completed Web3 quests got a share from the 40 million KERNEL airdrop, 4% of the total supply of 1 billion. You might also like: Binance to suspend deposit and withdrawal for BNB Smart Chain temporarily on April 17 Looking at the tokenomics, 55% of the total supply is set for community rewards and airdrops and 5% for ecosystem growth and partnerships. Meanwhile, 20% of the supply is split between private sales and team/advisors with a 6-month lock-up and 24-month vesting. At launch, about 162.3 million KERNEL or 16.23% of the total supply, went into circulation. KernelDAO had initially planned to launch the token in February 2025 but later pushed the launch to April 14. The TGE coincided with a major coordinated listing across top exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, MEXC, Gate.io, CoinEx, and Bitvavo, all of which began trading KERNEL on the same day. It’s common for new tokens to face early dumps, especially after airdrops. For instance, Tutorial (TUT) pumped over 235% after its Binance listing on March 28, only to lose more than half its value a week later as early investors cashed out. What is KernelDAO? Launched in 2023, KernelDAO is a restaking protocol with over $2 billion in total value locked and supports more than 10 blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Its core products include Kernel, a restaking infrastructure on BNB Chain; Kelp LRT, a top liquid restaking platform on Ethereum; and Gain, a tokenized rewards program that helps users earn high-yield rewards and airdrops. The KERNEL token acts as the governance and utility token. Holders can restake it to help secure the network and unlock more airdrop opportunities. KernelDAO also uses some of its protocol revenue to buy back KERNEL tokens. Since its launch, KernelDAO has secured significant funding, including a $10 million private sale round in 2024 led by Binance Labs (now YZi Labs), SCB Limited, and Laser Digital. In addition, the project has established a $40 million ecosystem fund to expand and develop the restaking infrastructure on the BNB Chain.

The incident reignited concerns about the dependency on cloud infrastructure by centralized crypto platforms and the fragility of even the largest players in the crypto space. What Happened? Binance first acknowledged the issue in a post on X, explaining that a “temporary network interruption in the AWS data center” was causing inconsistent order execution. While some trades went through successfully, others failed, prompting the exchange to suspend withdrawals as a precaution temporarily. However, a short while later, the company reported that services had begun recovering, though it warned that some functions might still experience delays. Several other platforms were also affected, with KuCoin, Rabby, and DeBank users similarly hit with unresponsive services and failed transactions. KuCoin had also notified users of the network outage, saying its technical staff was working on fixing the issue. However, at the time of going to press, they had yet to make a follow-up statement regarding the platform’s status. This wasn’t the first time a major cloud outage disrupted crypto platforms. In 2021, a widespread AWS failure crippled exchanges, trading apps, and even mainstream services, highlighting the risks of relying on a single cloud provider. AWS remains the backbone of much of the internet, hosting over 30% of global cloud workloads, making its stability critical and its outages particularly damaging. Crypto Community Reacts The latest incident sparked a mix of humor, frustration, and calls for decentralization across social media. Longtime Binance users brushed off concerns, with trader Daniel Nita tweeting , “I’ve been using Binance for over 7 years and never had major issues transacting — any problems are fixed fast, and users’ funds are always SAFU.” His comment referenced Binance’s $1 billion Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), an emergency reserve meant to protect customers in extreme scenarios. However, others took a more critical stance. Decentralized cloud project Iagon seized the moment to promote alternatives, tweeting, “Time to switch to distributed computing? We can help. Despite the outage, many praised Binance for its transparency, with one user posting, “Appreciate the updates. Hang tight, fam.” The exchange’s real-time communication contrasted with past incidents where platforms remained silent during downtime, fueling uncertainty.

Obama posted on X, saying Harvard was doing what other schools should do when federal power overreaches. He said the university’s refusal to accept Trump’s terms set a standard for other institutions. “Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions—rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect. Let’s hope other institutions follow suit,” Obama said. Obama made the comment in response to a statement from the Ivy League university that directly accused the government of trying to control the school’s values, its research, and the speech of students and faculty. Trump’s administration warned Harvard late Friday that it had to accept a federal agreement or risk losing its long-standing financial relationship with the government. The warning came after weeks of political pressure over how universities have responded to antisemitism. Harvard confirmed in its letter that it had been threatened along with other campuses. But instead of working with them, Trump’s team delivered a new set of demands that the school said crossed a legal line. Harvard said the demands were not just about addressing antisemitism. Most of them were about forcing the university to hand over control of its internal speech and hiring decisions. The gates that frame Harvard Yard. Source: Harvard.edu Harvard says federal pressure breaks constitutional limits The statement was signed by Alan Garber, who is serving as interim president. He said the demands violate the First Amendment, break federal law, and threaten academic independence. “No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Garber wrote. The university warned that caving to these demands would put millions of lives at risk. It said that for over 75 years, Harvard and other universities have received government grants and contracts to support research. Those partnerships have produced medical treatments and scientific advancements that protect public health and national security. The school listed research on Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes, artificial intelligence, and quantum engineering as key areas that would be affected if the federal government ended cooperation. Garber said the administration’s approach was not about constructive solutions. He said the demands amounted to an attempt to set the “intellectual conditions” under which students and professors could think and speak. The government, he added, was trying to control the Harvard community by force, not by law. The letter said these new terms go beyond the government’s legal authority under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. Garber said the school is already following that law. He referenced the Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision, which banned the use of race in college admissions. The school said it is complying fully with that ruling. Garber also said Harvard has not ignored antisemitism. He said the university had already taken multiple steps in the past 15 months to respond to it and had plans to do more. But he rejected the idea that the government could now dictate how the school functions, who it hires, or how it disciplines people. Garber said the administration was using a real problem as a tool to force a political agenda. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Word is out: the search for the next Federal Reserve Chair is officially on! This development, signaled by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, has the potential to ripple through all markets, including crypto. Let’s dive into what this means and why it should be on your radar. Why the Federal Reserve Chair Appointment Matters for Crypto The Federal Reserve Chair is arguably one of the most influential positions in global finance. Think of them as the conductor of the U.S. economy’s orchestra. Their decisions on interest rates, monetary policy, and how the Fed regulates the financial system can have a profound impact on everything from stock markets to, you guessed it, the cryptocurrency market. Why? Interest Rates and Risk Appetite: When the Fed raises interest rates, traditional assets like bonds become more attractive, potentially pulling investment away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower rates can fuel crypto market growth. Inflation Control: The Fed’s mandate includes controlling inflation. How they manage this directly affects the purchasing power of fiat currencies, which in turn influences the perceived value and adoption of cryptocurrencies as inflation hedges. Regulatory Stance: The tone and approach of the Federal Reserve Chair towards financial innovation, including digital assets, can significantly shape the regulatory landscape for crypto in the U.S., a major global market. In essence, the person at the helm of the Fed can indirectly but powerfully influence the flow of capital, investor sentiment, and the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. That’s why this news about the upcoming Fall Interviews is significant. Fall Interviews for Jerome Powell’s Successor: What We Know According to a report from Walter Bloomberg on X, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that interviews to find a successor to current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will begin in the Fall. Jerome Powell’s current term is set to conclude in May of next year. This timeline means the selection process is about to ramp up. Here’s a breakdown of what we can infer and what to watch for: Aspect Details Potential Implications for Crypto Timeline Interviews in Fall, Powell’s term ends May next year Increased market speculation and volatility as potential candidates emerge and their views on monetary policy and crypto become clearer. Process U.S. Treasury Secretary likely plays a key role in the selection process The Treasury’s perspective on financial innovation and digital assets could influence the type of candidate favored. Current Chair Jerome Powell ‘s term ending Possibility of a shift in monetary policy approach and regulatory philosophy depending on the successor chosen. It’s crucial to understand that while Secretary Bessent mentioned interviews, this doesn’t automatically mean Jerome Powell will not be re-nominated. Incumbent chairs are often re-appointed. However, the initiation of interviews signals that the administration is at least considering other candidates, introducing an element of uncertainty and anticipation. US Treasury Secretary ‘s Role: A Glimpse into Future Policy? The involvement of the US Treasury Secretary in announcing the interview process is noteworthy. The Treasury Department plays a vital role in shaping financial policy and has been increasingly vocal about the need for responsible innovation in the digital asset space. The Secretary’s perspective will undoubtedly influence the selection criteria for the next Fed Chair. Consider these points regarding the Treasury’s potential influence: Economic Priorities: The Treasury’s current focus on economic growth, inflation, and employment will shape the desired qualities in the next Fed Chair. Financial Stability: Post recent banking sector events, the emphasis on financial stability and regulatory oversight is heightened, potentially influencing the choice towards a candidate with a strong regulatory background. Digital Asset Policy: The Treasury’s evolving stance on digital assets and their integration into the financial system could lead to a preference for a Fed Chair who is knowledgeable and forward-thinking about crypto and blockchain technologies. By paying attention to the statements and priorities of the US Treasury Secretary , we can gain insights into the potential direction of future monetary and financial policy, and consequently, the potential impact on the cryptocurrency markets. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what should crypto investors and enthusiasts do with this information about the upcoming Central Bank leadership transition? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on financial news and commentary, particularly as the Fall approaches and more details about the interview process and potential candidates emerge. Follow reputable sources like Walter Bloomberg and major financial news outlets. Assess Candidate Views: As potential candidates are discussed, research their past statements and positions on monetary policy, inflation, and digital assets. This can provide clues about their potential approach as Fed Chair. Prepare for Volatility: Historically, periods of leadership transitions at major Central Bank s can bring market volatility. Be prepared for potential fluctuations in crypto prices as market sentiment shifts based on news and speculation. Diversify Your Portfolio: Uncertainty in traditional markets can sometimes drive interest in alternative assets like cryptocurrencies. Consider portfolio diversification as a strategy to manage risk during these periods. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that leadership changes are a normal part of the financial landscape. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of the crypto market and individual projects you believe in, rather than reacting impulsively to short-term news cycles. Conclusion: An Anticipated Shift with Potential Ripple Effects The announcement of Fall Interviews for the next Federal Reserve Chair marks the beginning of a period of anticipation and potential change in U.S. monetary policy leadership. For the cryptocurrency market, this development is significant.

According to crypto asset manager Bitwise , total corporate Bitcoin holdings climbed to approximately 688,000 BTC by the end of Q1, with companies adding 95,431 BTC over the three-month period. Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin—representing a 2.2% increase in value. Public Companies Holding Bitcoin Rises to 79, with 12 New Entrants in Q1 The number of public companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets also rose, from 67 to 79, with 12 firms making their first Bitcoin purchases during the quarter. Among the new entrants was Hong Kong-based construction group Ming Shing, whose subsidiary Lead Benefit acquired a total of 833 BTC in two transactions. Another notable buyer was video platform Rumble, which purchased 188 BTC in March. Interestingly, Hong Kong investment firm HK Asia Holdings Limited bought just a single Bitcoin in February, yet saw its share price nearly double following the announcement. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet added 319 BTC at an average price of 11.8 million yen ($82,770) per coin, bringing its total holdings to 4,525 BTC—valued at approximately $383.2 million. The company has spent nearly $406 million in total on its Bitcoin purchases to date. Following the announcement, Metaplanet’s stock rose 3.71% on April 14, before edging slightly lower the next trading day. With its recent acquisition, Metaplanet now ranks as the tenth-largest public holder of Bitcoin, just behind Block, Inc.—Jack Dorsey’s fintech company—which holds 8,485 BTC, according to Coinkite data.

The cryptocurrency has rebounded by about 2.3% since the end of March, following a temporary dip below $75,000 on April 7, which was triggered by renewed global tariff tensions. The steady accumulation of Bitcoin by public companies suggests growing confidence in the asset’s long-term value, even amid ongoing regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty. 47 Bitcoin Reserve Bills Emerge Across 26 States The adoption of Bitcoin has also found momentum statewide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law—making the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Other states are making similar moves. Oklahoma’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB 1203), introduced by Representative Cody Maynard, recently passed the House with a 77-15 vote and is awaiting a Senate decision. According to Bitcoin Laws, Oklahoma now ranks alongside Texas in second place in the race to establish state-level Bitcoin reserves. Missouri is also in the mix , with its Special Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs reviewing its own Bitcoin reserve proposal. Likewise, two key Bitcoin bills in Arizona cleared the House Rules Committee on March 24.

The usually serene world of Pokémon has been stormed by the turbulent debates of AI benchmarking . Yes, you heard it right. The quest to be the very best, like no one ever was, now extends to Artificial Intelligence models. But is this playful foray into gaming revealing crucial truths, or just muddying the waters of AI performance evaluation? The Pokémon Benchmark Battle: Gemini vs Claude Last week, the internet buzzed with a viral X post claiming Google’s Gemini AI model had decisively outmaneuvered Anthropic’s Claude in the classic Pokémon Red and Blue games. The claim? Gemini reached the eerie Lavender Town, while Claude was seemingly stuck in Mount Moon. This sparked excitement, with many seeing it as a clear victory for Gemini in a real-world AI benchmark scenario. Gemini is literally ahead of Claude atm in pokemon after reaching Lavender Town 119 live views only btw, incredibly underrated stream pic.twitter.com/pAvSovAI4x — Jush (@Jush21e8) April 10, 2025 However, as with most things in the AI world, the devil is in the details. Before we declare a champion in this Pokémon benchmark , let’s unpack what really happened. Unpacking the Controversy: Minimaps and Modified Benchmarks The viral post conveniently omitted a crucial detail: Gemini wasn’t playing Pokémon entirely unaided. Sharp-eyed Reddit users quickly pointed out that the developer streaming Gemini had implemented a custom minimap. This minimap essentially spoon-fed Gemini information about the game environment, allowing it to easily identify ’tiles’ like cuttable trees. This significantly reduced the cognitive load on Gemini, eliminating the need to visually analyze screenshots to make gameplay decisions. Claude, on the other hand, was playing with a more standard setup. Think of it like this: Feature Gemini (Modified Benchmark) Claude (Standard Benchmark) Gameplay Assistance Custom Minimap (Tile Identification) Standard Game Interface Analysis Required Reduced (Minimap provides direct tile data) High (Screenshot analysis for decision making) Benchmark Fairness Potentially Skewed in favor of Gemini More representative of raw AI capability This raises a critical question: Is this still a fair comparison of AI models , or have we inadvertently created a biased scenario? While Pokémon might seem like a lighthearted example, it highlights a serious issue plaguing the AI world: the inconsistent implementation of benchmarks. Why Benchmark Implementation Matters for AI Performance Let’s be clear, Pokémon isn’t going to replace industry-standard benchmarks like SWE-bench for evaluating coding prowess. However, this playful example vividly illustrates how variations in benchmark setup can drastically influence results and complicate the comparison of AI performance . Consider the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, designed to assess a model’s coding skills. Anthropic themselves reported two different scores for their Claude 3.7 Sonnet model: 62.3% accuracy : Standard SWE-bench Verified 70.3% accuracy : SWE-bench Verified with a “custom scaffold” developed by Anthropic That’s a significant jump! Similarly, Meta reportedly fine-tuned a version of their Llama 4 Maverick model specifically to excel on the LM Arena benchmark. The ‘vanilla’ version of the model performed considerably worse on the same evaluation. The Growing Challenge of Comparing AI Models The core problem is this: AI benchmarks , even the most rigorous ones, are inherently imperfect. They are snapshots, approximations of complex capabilities. When we introduce custom implementations and non-standard setups, we risk making these already imperfect measures even less reliable. This ‘benchmark controversy’ isn’t just about bragging rights in Pokémon; it has serious implications for how we understand and compare the rapidly evolving landscape of AI models . As AI technology advances at breakneck speed, the challenge of objectively comparing different models is only going to intensify. The Pokémon example, while seemingly trivial, serves as a stark reminder: we must be critically aware of the nuances of benchmark implementation and avoid drawing definitive conclusions based on potentially skewed results. The quest for truly reliable and universally accepted AI benchmarking methods continues, and the stakes are higher than ever.

Compared to previous Launchpool events, the share of BNB and USDC stakers was increased, while the share of FDUSD holders was reduced. This move was due to the fact that FDUSD recently temporarily lost its peg to $1 and fell below $0.90. In previous Launchpool events, users who staked $1,000 worth of FDUSD earned an average of $1.78. Related News: Bo Hines, One of Trump's Advisors, Said: ""The U.S. Can Buy Bitcoin With Tariff Revenues"" On the other hand, WCT has already started trading on some pre-launch markets. On the decentralized cryptocurrency platform Aevo, WCT is currently trading at around $0.4. Since the FDUSD reward rate from previous events is similar to the current USDC reward rate, we can now estimate it as USDC. According to our estimates, a total of 1.69 WCT was distributed per 1,000 USDC held by users in the WCT Launchpool event. This means that an average of $0.67 in WCT rewards will be given per 1,000 USDC. Of course, let's remember that these are not exact figures, they are estimates. According to estimates, the value of the rewards distributed in this Launchpool is below average compared to previous events. *This is not investment advice.

However, Bitcoin reached an oversold condition, and could now be heading back to the highs. Market fear remains strong The market is still not convinced. Fear remains strong in traditional as well as crypto markets. The tariff situation, especially in the case of China, appears to be going nowhere. Two intransigent presidents are waiting for the other one to back down. This could take a long time. 10-year yield has to come down At the same time, the Trump administration has to roll over around $7 trillion in debt that matures this year. In order for this to be done so that future interest payments can be accommodated, Treasury Secretary Bessent needs to bring the 10-year bond yield down. Trying to get big money investors to roll their funds into government paper bonds rather than equities, gold, or Bitcoin, is not going to be an easy task. The days of money fleeing into the relative safety of government bonds during market crashes probably aren’t over, but a willingness to buy and hold more than short term bonds just doesn’t appear to be there. A monetary reset? It’s in this kind of environment that the term “monetary reset” has started to be increasingly mentioned. Scott Bessent, has even said that he wanted the job of Treasury Secretary so that he could play a part in designing a new monetary world order. So what role could Bitcoin play in this? This is one for the likes of Bessent, and his global counterparts to figure out. An asset that cannot be controlled by any government runs counter to every single monetary system in the history of the world, and would therefore perhaps not be embraced gladly by most, although the US has gone a long, long way in a very short amount of time to show that it now understands the power of Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin should go up Putting aside all this future conjecture for now, one has to look at Bitcoin and decide whether it’s worth backing over a time frame of more than just a few weeks. While there is always the possibility that Bitcoin could go down to $69,000 if there is another stock market crash, huge horizontal support at that level would be likely to hold. Yes, in particular circumstances it could even lose that support and go into a bear market, but this is not likely to happen. The reason why is that Bitcoin is the hardest form of money. This means that it cannot be debased by an entity issuing more of it than the original 21 million supply. On the other hand, as far as fiat currencies are concerned, governments are preparing to print massive amounts more, in order to be able to have the liquidity to fund budget deficits, stimulate economies, and manage their debts. Why would the market sell off Bitcoin into a bear market when the alternative assets are just so inferior, and especially given that fiat currencies are debasing so rapidly? $BTC consolidates above breakout Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for Bitcoin is showing that the price is now beginning to consolidate above the descending trendline. A double bottom was made at $74,500, and the next target for the bulls is a trend break. This will occur if the price can get above $88,630. If this takes place, the next big resistances are at $91,000 and then $95,000. Mini disbelief phase playing out Source: TradingView After a nigh-on 3-month correction since the all-time high at $109,000, most traders might be forgiven for thinking that this was going to continue, and it’s probably for this reason that many are holding back now. A mini disbelief phase might be playing out, but once Bitcoin gets back above $88,000, and for many the round figure of $100,000, they will probably be rejoining the train. The small and solitary candle, that is above the descending trendline, looks fairly insignificant as yet, but with the RSI indicator line also punching through a descending trendline, and with the Stochastic RSI indicators approaching the confirmation of a cross up of the 20.00 level, things could start to play out quickly.

However, everyone in the crypto community is putting up the various allegations of Insider selling, Rug Pull, Big scam, and Lack of Transparency from the Mantra team. To clear the community concerns, Mantra’s CEO, John Mullin, spoke up and shared how they plan to address these issues and brought a token recovery plan. Let’s take a look at what he said. No Insider Selling, Says Mullin In a recent AMA session, Mullin addressed the rumors head-on. He firmly denied claims that early investors like Laser Digital dumped their tokens before the price crash. He also shut down the idea that the Mantra team controls 90% of the token’s supply. Calling the accusations “baseless,” Mullin pointed to a transparency report released by the team. The report, he says, shows all wallet holdings and aims to give the community a clear look into Mantra’s token management. What Caused the Crash? According to Mullin, the crash wasn’t due to any inside scam, but rather a chain reaction of exchange liquidations. Meanwhile, some traders had used OM tokens as collateral for loans. When the price dropped, those tokens were automatically sold off by the exchange to cover losses, causing even more price drops. Mantra’s OM Token Recovery Plan Mullin made it clear that recovering the OM token is their number one goal. To support this, Mantra is looking at two major steps; Mullin said they are implementing a buyback option to increase demand. However, the team may start buying OM tokens from the market using their own funds to increase the demand. $109 Million Fund Ready to Support Recovery One of the more promising updates is that Mantra has a $109 million ecosystem fund. This money is now being focused on reviving the project and supporting the OM token. It shows a strong commitment to bounce back stronger. Since the crash, OM has started to recover slightly, now trading around $0.60 with a market cap of $585 million. While the road ahead may be tough, the Mantra team says they’re not backing down.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|OM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-15 09:59:02

At around 08:05 AM UTC Tuesday, Binance posted on X that “they were aware” of the problem affecting its services and that they had suspended withdrawals. “Our team is working closely with AWS to resolve this as quickly as possible,” the Binance support team posted. KuCoin also gave its statement on the outage, stating: “ Due to a large-scale network outage with AWS services, our platform is experiencing temporary disruptions. Our technical team is urgently working on a fix, and the recovery time will be announced separately. Rest assured that your assets remain secure and all data is intact. We kindly ask you to stay tuned to official announcements and be wary of false information .” AWS outages solved, crypto services restarted Thirty minutes after Binance made their announcement, the exchange followed up with an update on the continuation of all services, including withdrawals. “ Please note that some services might experience delays while the system fully recovers. We will continue to monitor to ensure that all operations run smoothly. Thank you for your patience and understanding ,” the follow-up post noted. We are aware of an issue impacting some services on the #Binance platform due to a temporary network interruption in the AWS data center. Some orders are still successful, but some are failing. If users failed, they may keep retrying. Our team is working closely with AWS to… — Binance (@binance) April 15, 2025 KuCoin has not yet made any comments or updates after their initial post. The outage also impacted other crypto-affiliated entities, including DeFi interface DeBank and multi-chain wallet Rabby, although the specific disruptions to their services were not detailed. Gate.io’s Chief Business Officer, Kevin Lee, told his followers that the exchange’s users may encounter slowness when accessing their website or mobile app. “ However, trading, deposits, and withdrawals are business as usual, ” Lee added. AWS breaks silence over incident, promises updates Amazon Web Services issued a status update to tell the public the issue had been resolved, noting that multiple services had been affected. “ We are seeing initial signs of recovery but continue to monitor and work toward full recovery, ” AWS wrote in a public update at 8:50 AM UTC. The company promised to provide more updates within 30 to 60 minutes. AWS is one of the primary cloud infrastructure providers for about 12 centralized exchanges, including Binance, Crypto.com, Coinbase, Kraken, Huobi, and BitMEX. The entities prefer using the company’s infrastructure for high-volume transactions with low latency. The company has yet to specify the root cause of the data center issue but has continued to assure clients of its ongoing recovery efforts. It also did not indicate how many clients were affected or which regions experienced the heaviest impact. Public in angst over AWS reliance On social media, several commentators lamented about CEXes using a centralized cloud provider for financial platforms claiming they are decentralized. One user asked , “ AWS? Thought you guys were all about decentralization. Maybe time to look at that Lightning Network thing I keep hearing about .” Others, like the co-founder of Auki Network, Santeri Aramo, coined the incident as an example of the structural weaknesses of centralized infrastructure. “ Centralized fragility on full display. Binance and KuCoin just went down due to an AWS outage. Withdrawals suspended. Billions at risk… again, ” he beckoned. Aramo advocated for using decentralized alternatives that remove single points of failure. “ This is exactly why we build decentralized infrastructure, ” he added. “ No gatekeeper. No lock on your funds. Own your keys. Own your future. ” The April 15 outage is the latest reminder of the tight coupling between centralized cloud services and the daily functioning of crypto exchanges. The dependence on a single cloud provider means that a technical hiccup in one data center could cripple crypto exchanges that millions use, halt withdrawals, and freeze interfaces. “ People complain about stablecoins being centralized while an AWS outage would take all of DeFi down ,” said blockchain expert and former Citibank contributor Austin Campbell.

This enables the network to automatically scale based on the supply of validators, making it highly efficient and accessible. With a strong community-first ethos, Shardeum has attracted over 171,000+ validators, 81 million+ testnet transactions, and 1.4 million+ community members globally. Its astonishing testnet metrics have made Shardeum one of the best-performing Layer 1 testnets. Backed by top-tier investors, the project recently concluded its Incentivized Testnet, launched its token sale, and is on track to launch mainnet very soon. Functionland This decentralized platform aims to transform the cloud computing and AI industries by leveraging blockchain technology to offer user-owned data storage and processing solutions. Functionland uses a decentralized infrastructure network that lets businesses contribute their unused computing and storage resources which helps reduce costs – and also has an additional benefit of enhanced data privacy. The company has other additional features which are attractive to users, such as FxBlog hardware nodes, earning potential for participants, as well as its Fula Network – a blockchain-based system which can support various dApps for storage, sharing and file management. Thus far, the platform has seen significant support with more than 1,000 nodes deployed and a waitlist of over 100,000. There is a lot of community buzz behind it, and it is well-known in the industry because of its notable partnerships with the likes of Filecoin, IoTex and Dfinity. Akash Network Akash Network is a decentralized cloud computing marketplace which allows users to lease computing resources from underutilized data center capacity, and it’s making waves. It’s used by businesses looking for alternatives to traditional cloud, and it has also found traction among the AI developer community looking to reduce vendor lock-in and decrease their costs. Akash integrates with the broader Cosmos ecosystem, enabling inter-blockchain communication and cross-chain support so it’s poised for scalability across networks. With various community grants and validator participation, the company has built a strong contributor base with open-source and decentralized principles.",Crypto News|Investing|Press Release|2025|Exciting Projects|Web3|Web3 Projects,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|AKT|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-15 10:00:42

According to data reviewed by EFE from the Central Reserve Bank (BCR) , 89% of the 181 registered Bitcoin service providers are currently listed as inactive. Out of the total, 161 providers are marked as “non-operating,” with at least 22 of them failing to comply with key regulatory requirements outlined in Article 4 of the Bitcoin Law Regulations. These rules require providers to uphold standards such as maintaining anti-money laundering programs, proper financial recordkeeping, and cybersecurity measures tailored to their services. Only 20 Bitcoin Providers Remain Active in El Salvador Only 20 providers are still active, including the state-run Chivo Wallet, Crypto Trading & Investment, and Fintech Americas. The data raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the Bitcoin ecosystem in the country. El Salvador made global headlines in 2021 when it became the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. However, following a $1.4 billion agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , the government rolled back key aspects of the Bitcoin Law, removing Bitcoin’s legal tender status and the state’s role in mandating its acceptance. Despite the IMF’s recommendation to restrict state involvement, President Nayib Bukele’s administration has continued to purchase Bitcoin . The country now holds more than 6,100 BTC, valued at over $500 million. Critics argue that this strategy could jeopardize the IMF agreement and pose financial risks to the country. Bukele Aims to Transform El Salvador Into Regional Tech Hub Beyond cryptocurrency, President Nayib Bukele is pushing for El Salvador to become a regional tech hub. He recently met with Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) co-founders Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen to discuss AI investment opportunities.

As reported, El Salvador has also begun building “Bitcoin City Airport,” an air transport hub that will supposedly one day link Bitcoin City to the rest of the world. The nation’s official press agency published a video on its YouTube page showing the Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at a press event at the construction site, laying the first foundation stone on what will one day become Pacific Airport (official name).

That’s exactly what’s happening with MAGACOINFINANCE . While most eyes remain fixed on larger caps like Solana (SOL) , Cardano (ADA) , and Ethereum (ETH) , this emerging altcoin is picking up real momentum behind the scenes. Meanwhile, utility-driven tokens like SUI continue expanding developer ecosystems, keeping altcoin portfolios balanced with long-term potential. STAGE 6 SOLD OUT — STAGE 7 LIVE NOW MAGACOINFINANCE – Quiet Now, But Not for Long Stage 6 of the MAGACOINFINANCE rollout sold out quickly, and Stage 7 is currently live at $0.0002908 per token. With a listing target of $0.007 , the project offers a clear 25x ROI potential for early buyers who move before Stage 7 closes. Momentum is real. This isn’t just another pre-sale—it’s turning into a community-driven altcoin with organic traction. Social media threads, pre-sale monitors, and crypto groups are starting to mention MAGACOINFINANCE more frequently, and that typically signals an inflection point. Early traders see the setup: a fixed supply, a motivated community, and no distractions—just clear forward momentum. 50% Bonus Available with MAGA50X Stage 7 participants can still claim the MAGA50X bonus for a 50% boost in token allocation.

When it comes to everyday payments, however, it’s still on shaky ground. Although the idea of paying for your groceries or coffee with Bitcoin or Ethereum sounds modern, it’s a logistical nightmare for merchants and users. The reasons are obvious––volatility, high fees, and system incompatibilities. They have all stopped crypto from being a serious player in the retail economy. SpacePay: A Real Answer to Crypto’s Retail Problem SpacePay (SPY) is a London-based fintech startup that aims to make crypto payments as easy and seamless as swiping a card. If the fast-moving presale that just crossed the $1 million mark is any sign, the idea has resonated with investors. What makes SpacePay ($SPY) more than just another altcoin? What makes it a catch even during the bear market? The concept behind SpacePay is simple but powerful. It enables everyday purchases using cryptocurrency, while discarding the usual headaches. For merchants, that means solving some very real challenges. Instant Settlements to Tackle Volatility From the perspective of merchants, crypto’s biggest issue is price volatility. When you accept crypto today, there is an underlying risk that its value might crash tomorrow. Most businesses can’t afford this risk. Let’s say a business owner sold a product for $1000, only to find it’s worth $845 by the time the crypto is converted into fiat. That could bring the business to ground in a few days. SpacePay gets rid of this uncertainty by instantly converting crypto payments into local currency. This happens at the point of sale so that regardless of market swings, merchants get the full value. Ease of Integration: No New Hardware or Complex Onboarding Processes Another obstacle that stands in the way of crypto adoption? The difficulty of integration. The thing is, existing crypto payment systems require new hardware. If not that, they at least demand complex onboarding processes. SpacePay changes that. The solution integrates directly with Android-based POS systems that many businesses already use. That means: No extra devices No steep learning curve Instead, it supports a smooth transition into crypto payments. That’s not all. While credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard charge anywhere from 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, SpacePay is much more affordable. It offers a flat transaction fee of 0.5%. Lower transaction fees lead to higher adoption, as it greatly benefits businesses operating on thin margins. What is the Role of $SPY? A lot of altcoins come with bold promises and vague roadmaps. But SpacePay takes a different approach. It already has a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and is building a payment ecosystem with real, functional utility. The project is not hype. $SPY token is central to this ecosystem. Rather than being a speculative asset with no clear purpose, $SPY is designed to drive actual engagement and adoption. Here’s how: Loyalty rewards: Users holding $SPY can access exclusive rewards as part of the broader SpacePay ecosystem. Governance rights: Token holders can participate in decisions about the platform’s future, giving the community a say in development. Revenue sharing: Long-term holders can benefit from a share of SpacePay’s revenue, aligning token value with platform growth. Incentivized use: Users who interact with SpacePay’s services can earn additional $SPY tokens, further encouraging adoption. This multi-layered utility gives the token relevance beyond trading—it has the potential to function as a key within a growing payments network. Why This Presale Matters Crypto doesn’t need more coins. It needs more utility. But most new crypto projects begin raising funds with little more than a white paper and a wishlist. SpacePay is an exception. The team has built a working MVP. It is now inviting early supporters to be part of its journey ahead. It is a solution to one of crypto’s most persistent challenges: usability in the real world. The presale is now past the $1 million milestone and investor interest is continuing to grow. $SPY is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins this week. SpacePay offers both merchants and users a reason to finally say yes to crypto payments. It addresses the real-world barriers that have long kept crypto from going mainstream in retail. It combines instant conversions, simple integration, and low fees. Investors can join the presale using both crypto and fiat through the official SpacePay website.

The cryptocurrency surged from $75,000 to over $85,500 within a few days, followed by a 90-day pause on tariffs . This move calmed global market fears and gave Bitcoin a chance to recover. According to market platform Santiment, traders are feeling more optimistic , and blockchain data supports this shift. Big investors like Michael Saylor’s Strategy are still buying Bitcoin in huge amounts, showing long-term confidence. However, fewer Bitcoin are being kept on exchanges, which usually means investors prefer to hold rather than sell. Santiment also noted that many Bitcoin holders are now in profit, which lowers the pressure to sell and helps support the price. Sudden Bitcoin Price Rise Linked to Trade News In a recent video analysis by Altcoin Daily, the analyst explains that this happened after an update on President Donald Trump’s campaign website. The update said that, if elected, Trump would pause some tariffs on Chinese goods. Since the crypto market is always open, it reacted faster than the stock market. However, confusion followed shortly after. Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, saying no changes to tariffs had been officially announced. This mixed message created uncertainty in the market and made it hard to know whether the price rise was based on real news or not. Meanwhile, even though Bitcoin had a short-term rise, large investors are still cautious. Many are waiting for clear signals from the government before making big moves. Uncertainty around trade policies and the upcoming election is making these investors stay careful. Morgan Stanley Suggests a Flat Market The analyst also mentions a recent report from Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Wilson. He believes that both the stock market and the crypto market are currently stuck in a sideways trend. He says this could last another three to six months. Wilson also says that the government and the Federal Reserve are not doing much to support the economy right now, which could lead to more price swings in all markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today: Trump Tariff Update, Ripple News, PI Network News, KiloEx Hack , Will Bitcoin Revive or Crash? Bitcoin may be entering a cooling phase after what Bloomberg’s senior strategist Mike McGlone calls the “biggest money pump in history.” Following a dramatic price surge, Bitcoin is now showing signs of fatigue, with McGlone warning that it could be losing its status as “digital gold” as traditional gold makes a strong comeback. He points to continuous outflows from Bitcoin ETFs and a shift in investor preference toward gold as signs of a market hangover after the recent crypto frenzy. He further adds that despite Bitcoin’s 8% rally over the weekend to around $85,000, investors are leaning back toward safer, time-tested assets. PLEASE LISTEN to Gold, Silver, & Bitcoin.

The SOL/ETH pair is essentially used to determine the strength or weakness of the underlying coins. In this case, Solana’s strength relative to Ethereum is high. Additionally, ETH performance has been lackluster in 2024 and that trend is continuing into 2025, which also explains why the SOL/ETH ratio is continuing to hit new highs. Currently, SOL/ETH ratio stands at 0.08 at press time, after recording a 23% gain in the last seven days from the weekly low of 0.065. SOL/ETH: 1-Week Chart This surge comes after Solana price rebounded from $108 to $131 after posting a 21% seven-day gain. During the same period, Ethereum gained by only 5%. The gains posted by SOL/ETH have fuelled speculation among analysts that Solana will flip Ethereum by market cap listing. Analyst Tony noted that the SOL flippening was closer than everyone anticipated. Meanwhile, TraderSZ opined that besides outperforming Ethereum, Solana price was also outperforming Bitcoin, pointing out that SOL/BTC had flipped resistance at a descending trendline. This further strengthens the case that Solana can realistically reach $300 in April. SOL/BTC: 1-day Chart These projections come as a recent Coingape article noted that Solana was on the verge of reaching $300. This prediction follows an analysis by BitBulls who noted that the SOL CME futures chart mirrored the Ethereum bullish breakout in 2021, suggesting Solana price may is on the verge of a massive upswing. For Solana to reach $300 by the end of the month, it will have to surge by 129% in the next two weeks. Such a rally is not impossible for SOL given that in mid-January, it rallied by 80% within a week. Solana Blockchain Outpaces Ethereum Besides outperforming Ethereum in price, Solana is also dominating blockchain activity. Data from DeFillama shows that Solana has recorded the highest DEX volumes in the last three consecutive days. At press time, SOL DEX volumes stood at $2.43 billion, which is notably higher than Ethereum’s $1.75 billion. Solana DEX Volumes However, the daily DEX volumes on Solana have dropped by more than 90% since hitting a peak of $35 billion in January this year. This decline follows reduced activity for Solana meme coins on the PumpFun launchpad. Solana Technical Analysis Solana’s four-hour price chart shows that bulls are fully in control. The 20-day EMA has formed a bullish crossover with the 200-day EMA. At the same time, SOL continues to trade above the short-term and long-term moving averages, which signals that the uptrend is strong. The CMF indicator is also positive further suggesting that the buying pressure is currently stronger than the selling pressure. This further highlights a positive outlook and strengthens the bullish case for Solana price. Amid these bullish signs, the short-term Solana price prediction suggests that a rally to the critical resistance level of $180 is likely to occur. SOL/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Considering the gains that Solana is making against Ethereum after the SOL/ETH ratio recorded its highest weekly close, SOL price can reach $300. Moreover, the bullish outlook on the four-hour price chart indicates that Solana may attain this target soon.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced a delay in its decision on whether to permit staking in two of Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs, pushing the timeline to June 1. Canada to Launch First Spot Solana ETFs on April 16, Setting Stage for Altcoin Fund Expansion Spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are officially set to launch in Canada on April 16. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas broke the news in an April 14 post on X, revealing that the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has given the green light to asset managers Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, CI Global Asset Management, and 3iQ to list funds directly holding Solana. The development comes amid intensifying global interest in cryptocurrency-based financial products, particularly as regulators begin to recognize digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. While US regulators remain hesitant to approve similar products tied to altcoins, Canada is once again leading the charge in North America’s crypto ETF race. Canada has no centralized securities authority, with each province or territory applying its own regulatory framework. However, Ontario’s OSC—one of the most influential provincial regulators—has emerged as a trendsetter in digital asset oversight. According to TD Bank’s private client note cited by Balchunas, the OSC granted approval to the four firms to proceed with the launch of spot Solana ETFs on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) or other recognized Canadian exchanges. These new ETFs are not only backed by direct SOL holdings but will also include staking mechanisms, allowing fund managers to earn yield on a portion of the SOL holdings. Balchunas described the inclusion of staking as ”our first look at the alt coin race” in ETF structures, signaling a possible diversification of yield-generating strategies in regulated markets. The OSC recently said that the new ETFs are consistent with regulatory amendments outlined in a January notice regarding cryptocurrency holdings in publicly traded funds. The changes reflect a broader recognition of crypto assets as investable financial instruments—provided that they meet investor protection standards. US Still Cautious Amid Altcoin ETF Push While the OSC’s move will likely stir interest from both retail and institutional investors, it also throws into stark relief the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) sluggishness in approving altcoin-based ETFs. To date, the SEC has only approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, while applications for products tied to Solana, XRP, and other alternative cryptocurrencies remain under review. Staking remains another regulatory stumbling block in the United States. Currently, US-based crypto ETFs are prohibited from staking their assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart recently noted that staking for Ether ETFs could be approved as early as May, though procedural delays may extend that timeline. If approved, it could open the door for future staking-based ETFs in the US, but regulatory hurdles remain significant. The Canadian spot Solana ETFs may be launching into a skeptical North American market. In March, asset manager Volatility Shares debuted the first Solana futures ETFs in the US, but the response has been tepid. As of April 14, the firm’s SOLZ ETF has accumulated just around $5 million in net assets, according to its website. Volatility Shares’ SOL futures ETF has roughly $5 million in net assets (Source: Volatility Shares ) Balchunas noted that the two US-listed Solana futures ETFs have underperformed in terms of assets under management (AUM), even when compared to recently launched leveraged XRP ETFs. “FWIW, the 2 Solana ETFs in US (which track futures so not a perfect guinea pig) haven’t done much,” he wrote on X. “Very little in AUM… Wouldn’t read a ton into it [as a predictor] for spot SOL ETFs.” His caution highlights a crucial point: while regulatory approvals are necessary, investor appetite is equally important. Katalin Tischhauser, research head at crypto bank Sygnum, echoed this sentiment in an August interview. “There is all this frothy excitement in the market about these ETFs coming, and no one can point to where substantial demand is going to come from,” she warned. Solana’s Market Standing and the Road Ahead Solana, currently trading at around $130, has established itself as one of the leading altcoin networks due to its high throughput, low transaction costs, and growing developer ecosystem. Its appeal among institutional and retail investors alike could make it a strong candidate for mainstream financial products—especially if these ETFs prove successful in Canada. If Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ see significant inflows following the April 16 launch, it could prompt other jurisdictions to accelerate approval processes for altcoin-based ETFs. The launch may also rekindle investor conversations around diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, especially in light of growing interest in blockchain technologies beyond simple digital currency use cases. SEC Delays Decision on Ether Staking for Grayscale ETFs Until June 1, Extending Uncertainty for Investors In related news, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially delayed a decision on whether to allow Ether (ETH) staking in two of Grayscale’s Ethereum-focused ETFs, extending the timeline of regulatory uncertainty for investors and asset managers alike. According to an April 14 announcement , the SEC now plans to make its next move on or before June 1, with a final deadline set for the end of October. The delay impacts Grayscale’s proposed rule change for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF. If approved, these vehicles would become the first publicly traded Ether ETFs in the US permitted to stake investor assets, potentially unlocking yield opportunities for fund holders and raising the appeal of Ether-based investment products in an increasingly competitive ETF market. At the heart of the matter is whether Ether ETF issuers can participate in staking — a process native to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus mechanism where holders lock up their ETH to validate network transactions and secure the blockchain. In exchange, participants earn yield rewards, making staking an attractive option for passive income seekers and long-term holders. The SEC’s hesitation is not surprising. While staking is integral to Ethereum’s network economics, the practice raises complex questions about custody, delegation, risk disclosures, and how yield distributions are classified under US securities laws. Yet, for investors, the potential rewards are clear: according to data from Coinbase, staking ETH currently yields approximately 2.4% annually, while Kraken’s staking services report ranges from 2% to 7%. Grayscale’s Feb. 14 proposal, filed on behalf of the asset manager by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), aims to incorporate these benefits into the ETF structure. However, with the SEC’s decision now delayed for at least another six weeks, the wait continues for both retail and institutional investors hoping to capitalize on ETH’s staking capabilities through regulated products. Competing Filings and a Crowded Race Grayscale isn’t the only asset manager vying for a green light from regulators. Industry titan BlackRock, in partnership with 21Shares, is also pursuing the ability to stake ETH held within its iShares Ethereum Trust. That application remains pending, though the firm has made significant progress elsewhere in the Ethereum ETF space. Indeed, the SEC has shown some willingness to engage with the evolving demands of crypto ETFs. On April 9, the Commission approved options trading for multiple spot Ether ETFs, including products from BlackRock, Bitwise, and Grayscale. This move allows investors to utilize derivatives contracts—such as calls and puts—on Ether ETFs, enhancing the sophistication and flexibility of these vehicles for institutional strategies. While the approval of options trading is a meaningful step forward, it’s not a substitute for staking. The ability to generate yield via on-chain mechanisms is seen by many as essential to the long-term viability of Ethereum ETFs, especially given the underwhelming investor response compared to Bitcoin-based funds. Comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin ETF Traction Since their launch in 2024, Ether ETFs have attracted a cumulative net inflow of $2.28 billion, according to blockchain analytics firm Sosovalue . While a respectable figure, it pales in comparison to the success of Bitcoin ETFs, which have pulled in more than $35.4 billion. Part of the disparity stems from market dynamics. Bitcoin remains the dominant narrative in crypto among institutional investors, widely perceived as a hedge against inflation and a digital store of value. Ether, despite its robust ecosystem, is often seen as more complex due to its broader utility in smart contracts and decentralized applications. That complexity is only heightened when staking is added to the mix. Market performance hasn’t helped Ethereum’s case. As of April 15, Ether is trading below $2,000—well beneath its all-time high of $4,866 set in November 2021 and still lagging behind its 52-week high of $4,112. Other altcoins like XRP and Solana have outpaced ETH during this bull market, adding further pressure on Ethereum-based products to innovate or risk being overshadowed. The SEC’s ongoing reluctance to approve staking features in ETFs highlights broader regulatory tensions in the US crypto landscape. While other jurisdictions—such as Switzerland and Canada—have permitted more flexible fund structures, US regulators continue to proceed with caution. That conservative approach may offer investor protections, but it also risks ceding innovation and capital to more forward-thinking regions. If the SEC eventually approves staking within Ether ETFs, the move could set a powerful precedent. Not only would it enable passive income generation through regulated vehicles, but it would also signal a broader shift in how US regulators view the integration of blockchain-native features into traditional financial products. Until then, the market remains in limbo. For now, staking in Ether ETFs is a promise still waiting to be fulfilled.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-15 11:30:00

MiCA is now the law of the land across all 27 EU countries. It means that all the exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and token platforms have to follow the same playbook. It’s been 100 days since MiCA’s full application kicked in and only 11 stablecoin issuers have bagged the approval. The cumulative stablecoin market is inching toward the $250 billion mark and Tether remains at the top of that tally. Germany dominates in MiCA application Patrick Hansen, Senior Director of EU Strategy and Policy at Circle dropped a list of authorized stablecoin issuers and crypto-asset service providers under the MiCA regime. He mentioned that 11 entities across 6 EU countries got approval to issue e-money tokens (EMTs). This includes single fiat currency-backed stablecoins. Around 16 EMTs have been issued so far, consisting of 10 euro-denominated and 6 dollar-denominated tokens. It highlighted that it has authorized 15 MiCA CASPs (Crypto-Asset Service Providers) from 6 EU countries. Germany is leading the way with 6 CASP s while Malta is just behind with 5 CASPs. The approvals allow the platforms to offer services in trading, custody, execution, exchange, and transfers, among other services. BBVA, Clearstrea, and Flatex are some notable TradFi entrants, he added. Meanwhile, some Dutch firms like MoonPay, Hidden Road, Zebedee and Bitstaete are missing from the interim register.

Meanwhile, there are 15 firms listed on the non-compliant entity list by Italy’s CONSOB. He added that there are 25 white papers notified for crypto-assets that are neither EMTs nor ARTs. These platforms mostly cover major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and others. Google Ads now gatekept by EU crypto law MiCA has become crucial for these platforms as there is no passporting of services across the 30 EEA countries with the license. The next update on the growing list might come in six months time. This comes in when the digital assets market is stuck in the crossfire of the tariff. The cumulative crypto market cap regained the crucial $2.7 trillion mark as Bitcoin price jumped by over 8% in the last 7 days. The stablecoin market race continues to heat up tough as Tether holds steady in first position with a $145 billion market cap, while Circle comes in at second with a market cap of over $60 billion. Recently, Google gave crypto ads in Europe a reality check as the deadline ticks towards April 23. From that date, if a crypto exchange or wallet provider wants to run ads on Google then it will need more than just good vibes and a logo. It is being asked for a license under the EU’s MiCA framework or to be registered as a Crypto Asset Service Provider. There’s a Google certification in the process as well. This comes after the EU’s MiCA rules officially kicked in, aiming to clean up crypto’s mess and bring it into full regulation. However, Google isn’t going into full reject mode. If a platform messes up, then they’ll be served a warning and a 7-day grace period before suspension. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Despite the current volatility in the crypto market, fueled by macroeconomic uncertainty induced by the ongoing trade war, capital continues to flow into the ecosystem through stablecoins. A chart released by Matrixport on April 15 highlights sustained growth in the market caps of the two biggest stablecoins Tether ( USDT ) and Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ) over the past eight months. This suggests that liquidity keeps flowing into crypto even though digital assets’ prices have bled considerably over the past few months. From August last year to April, USDT’s market cap surged from approximately $113 billion to over $143 billion, marking a 26% increase. This growth has persisted despite Tether facing partial delistings across some European platforms due to non-compliance with the MiCA regulations, which require tighter disclosure and asset backing standards. As for USDC, it has increased from just over $31 billion to roughly $60 billion, marking an 93% increase. Matrixport analysts interpret these inflows as a sign that stablecoins are becoming increasingly embedded in the digital economy, even without a parallel bull run in crypto assets themselves. Source: @Matrixport_CN You might also like: What happens on day one after the GENIUS Act passes? | Opinion The continued inflow of stablecoins occurs against a complex regulatory backdrop in the United States.

However, this stance remains in contrast with legislative proposals like the STABLE Act , which seeks to impose bank-like regulatory requirements on all stablecoin issuers, and the more innovation-friendly GENIUS Act , which proposes a federal charter system to regulate stablecoins without stifling private-sector innovation.

33767162,[object Object],1744716727,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,3 Meme Coins to Watch After Bitcoin Whale Moves $84M From Exchange,https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-to-watch-after-bitcoin-whale-moves-84m/,"A Bitcoin whale has just pulled off a serious move. They withdrew 1K $BTC, worth over $84M, from the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, according to blockchain tracking service Whale Alert. Now, before you assume someone’s cashing out, let’s clarify: this kind of move usually signals the opposite. Whales don’t move funds off exchanges to sell. They move them to cold storage – to sit tight and wait. It’s a security move and a sign they believe $BTC is going up, not down. And they might be right to think so. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital says $BTC has broken out of a downtrend and is hovering on the edge of a big breakout. Historically, when $BTC leads the charge, altcoins aren’t far behind . Let’s take a closer look at three new meme coins that could ride the wave if $BTC breaks out. What’s Going On With Bitcoin Whales and Why It Matters This $84M Bitcoin whale move is big – but it’s not random. It comes as market sentiment around $BTC is shifting in a big way. After months of choppy trading and hesitation, $BTC has broken past a key downtrend, according to popular analyst Rekt Capital. That’s technical speak for: $BTC might be ready to pump again. And whales know it. They don’t wait for headlines to tell them when to act – they often make the headlines. When a massive amount of $BTC leaves an exchange, it’s a sign that someone big is playing the long game. At the same time, trading volume is spiking – up 37% on the same exchange where the whale made the withdrawal. This kind of volume jump usually happens when traders are bracing for something big. If history repeats, we’re on the edge of one of those classic $BTC moments where the charts flip and everything else follows. And by everything, we mean altcoins. Especially meme coins and crypto presales right now. They’ve always been faster, riskier, and more dramatic in the way they react to $BTC momentum. With Bitcoin whales betting big and the market warming up, now’s the time to watch those small-cap projects that could ride the breakout wave. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) — The Ultimate High-Voltage $BTC Bet BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a new crypto project built around the idea that Bitcoin is unstoppable – and that bulls are charging straight through 2025. It’s loud, it’s proud, and it’s 100% leaning into the hype of the $BTC cycle. But instead of boring charts, you get a coin with meme energy and the chance to get in early. Right now, you can buy $BTCBULL for just $0.00246. That’s less than a cent for something that’s riding the coattails of $BTC’s momentum. And people are clearly buying into the idea. The project raised over $4.6M in the presale to date. That’s not small-time money. That’s enough to show there’s demand – and community – in the works. What makes it stand out is the roadmap. The team has tied major token events to $BTC price milestones. When $BTC hits $125K, they’ll trigger a token burn. At $150K? A $BTC airdrop. $175K brings another burn, $200K another $BTC airdrop, and so on. There’s a third token burn at $225K, and a final airdrop of $BTCBULL tokens if $BTC hits $250K. All you have to do is buy and hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet in order to receive free tokens. In short, BTC Bull Token blends meme energy with a clear plan. It’s made to move when $BTC moves, with $BTCBULL price prediction targeting $0.008 by year-end – and reward the faithful along the way. 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) — Where Meme Culture Meets Digital Philosophy MIND of Pepe ($MIND) isn’t just another frog coin. It’s the first meme coin backed by a fully autonomous AI agent – and it’s already turning heads. The presale just crossed $8M in funding, and the price per token is sitting at $0.0037115. That’s early enough to be interesting, but clearly far enough along to show people are paying serious attention. The $MIND token gives holders exclusive access to a self-evolving AI with a mind of its own – literally. This AI agent doesn’t just sit in the background. It interacts with Twitter, analyzes trends using hive-mind logic, and drops alpha before it hits the mainstream. Only $MIND holders get access to its insights through private token-gated channels. But it doesn’t stop at chatter. MIND of Pepe can interact with dApps, launch tokens, and even distribute first-access opportunities directly to holders. It’s basically a meme coin that comes with its own research assistant, community strategist, and launchpad – all powered by AI. With $BTC on the edge of a breakout, meme coins like $MIND are in a prime position to ride the momentum. This means now is the best time to buy $MIND as analysts predict it to hit $0.00535 by the end of the year. 3. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) – Where Meme Culture Meets AI-Driven Trading Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is a meme coin that combines the playful spirit of dog-themed tokens with the power of artificial intelligence. With one token currently priced at $0.004, the project has raised over $3.2M in its presale, reflecting strong investor interest.​ At its core, Dawgz AI utilizes advanced AI-driven trading bots designed to analyze market trends and execute trades automatically. This approach aims to provide passive income opportunities for token holders without the need for manual trading. The platform’s AI algorithms are developed by experienced analysts and are intended to react to market fluctuations in real time, optimizing yield generation.​ The project’s tokenomics model is structured to support long-term growth and community engagement. With a total supply of over 8B tokens, allocations include 30% for the presale, 20% for staking rewards, and 15% for community incentives. As $BTC approaches a potential breakout, projects like Dawgz AI are positioned to benefit from increased market activity. Final Bark Before the Breakout: Why Meme Coins Could Howl Next Bitcoin whales are moving big money off exchanges. Analysts say Bitcoin is about to break out. And the market’s starting to feel like it wants to get loud again. When that happens, it’s not just $BTC that goes vertical. Meme coins tend to follow – and sometimes outpace – the king itself. If you’re looking for early entries with strong narratives, BTC Bull Token , MIND of Pepe , and Dawgz AI should be on your watchlist.

43367838,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=392378,1744716851,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/43367838.jpeg,Bitcoin Rebound Backed by On-Chain Strength Despite Trade War Uncertainties,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-rebound-backed-by-on-chain-strength-despite-trade-war-uncertainties/,"Bitcoin experienced a notable rebound this week, briefly touching $86,000. This was a welcome recovery after dipping to a low of approximately $75,000 on April 8th. According to Santiment’s latest insight, this surge appears to be fueled by a mix of improving blockchain fundamentals and a temporary easing of global tariff concerns. However, market analysts note that retail investors remain less concerned with the macro reasoning behind these price moves and are more focused on momentum. As such, the recent breakout has visibly boosted trader confidence, marking the most bullish sentiment since trade tensions reignited at the start of April. Bullish On-Chain Metrics In the wake of BTC’s rally, prominent crypto advocates such as Michael Saylor have gained renewed attention. His firm, Strategy (MSTR), added an additional $285 million worth of Bitcoin to its holdings, which signaled continued long-term conviction. Broader tech markets also reflected this optimism, with companies like Apple rising 2.37% on Monday, following announcements of temporary tariff exemptions. Despite the upward trend, experts caution against reading too much into the short-term relief. President Trump reiterated that no sector or country will be exempt from the upcoming trade measures, reaffirming that national security tariffs – particularly those impacting semiconductors and the electronics supply chain – remain on the table. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that these tariffs are still expected to roll out within the next two months, which means ongoing uncertainty that could dampen market momentum in the near future. Despite lingering market volatility, Santiment said that the recent price resilience is supported by several on-chain metrics. One of the standout indicators is Network Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL), which is now consistently trending upward. Historically, sustained rallies in Bitcoin often require this metric to rise, signaling that participants are realizing profits in a healthy, non-panic-driven way—the increase in NRPL points to renewed confidence among long-term holders and traders alike. Another critical signal is the ongoing decline in supply on exchanges. This suggests that fewer traders are preparing to sell and are choosing to move their BTC into cold storage or hold for the long term. Lower exchange balances often indicate reduced short-term selling pressure, which is typically a bullish sign. Additionally, key stakeholder accumulation continues to intensify. Wallets holding 10 or more BTC have reached an all-time high, now collectively holding 16.36 million BTC. This rise suggests that larger holders – often viewed as more strategic or institutional players – are accumulating during the volatility. Meanwhile, retail investors appear to be offloading, reflecting a familiar pattern of smaller holders capitulating while whales accumulate. Blockchain’s Value Beyond Bitcoin As tariff debates escalate, the crypto ecosystem is offering a unique solution to supply chain transparency. Blockchain technology is being used to track goods’ origins and movements more accurately than traditional systems, helping customs officials detect tariff circumvention. Projects like Truebit are working with government vendors to integrate blockchain into trade compliance systems, broadening crypto’s utility. Globally, tensions persist – China halted rare-earth exports, and the EU paused retaliatory tariffs. President Trump plans a tariff review, while President Xi strengthens Southeast Asian ties. Public sentiment remains sour. A CBS News poll from April 13th revealed that 59% of Americans believe the economy is worsening, and Trump’s economic approval ratings have declined. While crypto investors are marginally more hopeful, the sector remains closely tied to traditional markets, and Santiment believes that any signs of decoupling are likely to be short-lived.

According to the latest data updated on April 14, US Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded $1.47 million in daily net inflows. This has broken the negative trend that dominated much of early April. Bitcoin ETF performance breakdown shows mixed results A look at the performance of specific ETFs reveals mixed results across different Bitcoin spot ETFs. SoSoValue data shows BlackRock’s IBIT remains the market leader with $48.58 billion in net assets. IBIT’s one-day price change was 1.28%, and the value traded was $1.57 billion on April 14. IBIT still leads in net assets, including one-day net outflows of $36.72 million. Fidelity’s FBTC is second with $16.63 billion in net assets and appeared to have slightly better short-term momentum than IBIT, as FBTC had a price increase of 1.32% the same day, net inflows of $35.25 million, and value traded of $305.73 million. Bitcoin ETF data. Source: SoSoValue Grayscale’s GBTC has $16.14 billion in net assets and is the third largest Bitcoin ETF, comprising 0.96% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. However, it continues to see a decline in assets for cumulative net outflows totaling $22.78 billion since converting from a Trust to an ETF in January. Ark Invest’s ARKB controls $4.01 billion in assets with a daily price change of +1.33%. The fund saw no new inflows on April 14 but has accumulated $2.58 billion in total cumulative inflows since its launch. Smaller ETFs in the ecosystem include BITB, HODL, and BRRR, which hold $3.18 billion, $1.20 billion, and $486.69 million in net assets respectively. VanEck’s HODL saw a daily price increase of 1.35% but experienced outflows of $0.07 million on the reported day. The fee structure across these products varies, with FBTC offering the lowest fee at 0.00%, while GBTC charges 1.50%. Crypto market sentiment turns after prolonged outflows The recent positive inflow is a change in market sentiment after several weeks of consistent outflows from Bitcoin investment products. According to CoinShares data, crypto investment products had experienced three consecutive weeks of outflows , with $795 million exiting the market in the previous week alone. Bitcoin-specific funds bore the brunt of these outflows and accounted for $751 million or about 94% of all withdrawals. This negative trend since early February had resulted in cumulative outflows reaching $7.2 billion. This nearly eliminated all inflows recorded since the beginning of 2025. Prior to the recent turnaround, year-to-date inflows stood at just $165 million. The outflows were broadly distributed across major fund providers. Data shows that iShares ETFs lost the largest amount of funds at $341.64 million, followed by Grayscale Investments with $186.69 million in outflows. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund saw $74.63 million exit, while Bitwise Funds Trust lost $43.78 million. ProShares ETFs were the only major provider to record positive inflows during this period, attracting $3.70 million. The reversal of this trend coincides with Bitcoin finding support near the $85,000 level. The stabilization in Bitcoin’s price appears to have restored some investor confidence in spot ETF products, leading to the positive inflows recorded on April 14. Trading volume across Bitcoin ETFs remain strong Despite the fluctuations in inflows and outflows, trading volume across Bitcoin ETFs remains strong. According to the data from April 14, the total value traded across US Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $2.16 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT led trading activity with $1.57 billion in daily value traded and accounted for more than 70% of the total ETF trading volume. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded the second-highest trading volume with $305.73 million traded on April 14. This is about 14% of the total daily trading value across all Bitcoin ETFs. The fund also saw 4.14 million shares change hands during the trading session. Grayscale’s GBTC kept up a significant trading volume of $96.29M daily, although net outflows persist. In addition, Ark’s ARKB had $76.13M of volume, and Bitwise’s BITB traded $32.47M. In general, the data reveals a positive correlation between price movement in Bitcoin and ETF prices on April 14, with most funds showing daily price increases in the 1.25-25% range.

While 2025 has already seen significant Web3 developments globally—from the United States’ plans to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve to unprecedented cryptocurrency market valuations—the regional dynamics across Asia reveal a more textured reality. As Western regulatory frameworks gradually adapt to digital assets, Asian nations are taking a different approach toward blockchain integration, balancing innovation with varying degrees of regulatory caution. “The relationship between Asia’s diverse markets and Web3 technologies cannot be reduced to simple narratives of adoption or resistance,” said Erica Kang , CEO and Founder of Kryptoplanet . “Through BUIDL Asia and ETH Seoul, we’re creating spaces where global and local perspectives can engage in meaningful dialogue, acknowledging both the transformative potential and implementation challenges that blockchain technologies present across different societal contexts.” South Korea exemplifies this nuanced approach, where consumer enthusiasm for technological adoption intersects with governmental oversight. The country’s exploration of blockchain applications extends beyond speculative investment into practical realms—blockchain gaming ecosystems evolve alongside experimental tourism initiatives such as Jeju Island’s NFT tourist card concept. Indigenous platforms like Zepetto, with its established base of 20 million monthly users, represent potential gateways for blockchain technology that respect cultural sensibilities while addressing practical use cases. BUIDL Asia will take place from 15th – 16th April at Signiel Hotel, with keynotes, fireside chats and discussions between projects and thought leaders from across the blockchain spectrum, including Eigenlayer, NEAR Foundation, Noble, Succinct, and Aztec Network. The two-day gathering will explore trending Web3 topics such as: Critical examinations of AI-blockchain integration: promise versus practical limitations Real-world asset tokenisation: balancing innovation with regulatory considerations Zero-knowledge technology’s resurgence: technical advancements and implementation hurdles Asia’s heterogeneous blockchain landscape: contrasting approaches across regulatory environments The speaker lineup for this year includes Zachary Williamson , CEO of Aztec Network ; Uma Roy , Co-Founder and CEO of Succinct ; Robert Drost , CEO and Executive Director of Eigenlayer Foundation ; Pedro Gomes , Founder of WalletConnect; Jelena Djuric , Co-Founder and CEO of Noble ; Ilia Polosukhin , Co-Founder of NEAR Protocol ; Himanshu Tyagi , Co-Founder of Sentient ; Nick White COO of Celestia , and more. BUIDL Asia continues to serve as one of the largest community-led events in Asia where the global blockchain leaders work with local projects, recognizing the region’s potential.

Greg Cipolaro, the global head of research at NYDIG, notes in a new analysis that crypto markets have remained largely stable despite the “carnage” in traditional financial markets. “Perpetual swap rates have been persistently positive. Liquidations spiked on Sunday and Monday [last week], but the two-day total of $480 million was well below other notable liquidation events. The basis on on-shore and off-shore futures has remained positive. Finally, the price of USDT, while below $1.00, has not experienced a sharp decline. Historically, in broad risk-off moves, we tend to see stresses show up in crypto markets. We have yet to see that.” Cipolaro notes Bitcoin has largely fared better than Ethereum ( ETH ) and other altcoins, noting that BTC remains the number one hedge against currency debasement. “The ETH-BTC cross continues to plumb levels not seen since 2019, for example, and many other cryptocurrencies have yet to find their footing in this volatile environment. In a world of global uncertainty and a loss in faith of fiat currencies and sovereign nations, there does not appear to be a second-best option to fiat debasement.” Source: NYDIG BTC is trading at $84,984 at time of writing.

Despite the dip, some analysts remain optimistic, with one X user predicting a potential surge to $5. The native token of Pi Network witnessed a substantial resurgence towards the end of last week, with its price rising to $0.77. This represented a whopping 92% increase compared to the all-time low of $0.40 observed at the beginning of April. PI started the new business week on the right foot, hovering close to $0.75. Just over an hour ago, though, the bears stepped in again, and the price collapsed by nearly 12% to as low as $0.63. In the next minutes, there was a slight rebound, and currently, PI trades at around $0.67. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko The exact reason behind the sudden nosedive remains unclear. However, it coincides with the major token release that started today (April 15), when 6.8 million PI will be freed up. As CryptoPotato previously warned , the unlocks will speed up in the next few weeks. April 18 is expected to be the record day, with almost 10 million tokens scheduled for release. Such events generally trigger increased selling pressure, giving investors the chance to offload coins they’ve waited for a long time. While not all may cash out, the risk of a wave of exits remains. Despite the price retreat in the past hour, some industry participants remain bullish. The X user MOON JEFF, who frequently touches upon PI’s performance, noted the start of the big unlocks but assumed that skyrocketing to an all-time high of $5 is still possible. “Don’t sell cheap,” they advised.

The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has approved four asset managers to offer the new spot Solana: Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ. The Solana ETF will invest in physical $SOL long-term and stake them to earn more rewards. This will result in better returns than Ether staking. Read on to discover how this development could affect the larger crypto market. We’ll also talk about the Solaxy presale and how it’s at the center of Solana’s potential rise. ETF Race Heats Up The SEC approved a Bitcoin-pegged ETF in the US back in January 2024. However, it’s still mulling over a staking-enabled ETF, and Grayscale’s proposal to introduce staking in its spot ETH ETFs is on hold. Canada has always been a step ahead of the US in this aspect. For instance, it launched its first Bitcoin ETF back in 2021. But it’s likely only a matter of time before the US follows suit. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart says that it may happen as soon as the end of 2025. A lot of this development can be credited to the pro-crypto Trump administration. The president’s open support for crypto, backed by increasingly relaxed legislation, promises to propel crypto to new heights. The global ETF race is now heating up, with multiple applications pending with regulators. For example, the SEC is sitting on multiple applications for ETFs backed by different cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin, XRP, Solana, and more. Hong Kong and Australia have also also launched their own crypto ETFs. Solana’s Price Showing Strength Besides the ETF buzz, Solana has also shown some technical strength over the last month. $SOL gained over 30% last week and is now trading at $133. Although still far from the $300 mark, a positive mini-rally has investors hopeful. The SOL/ETH pair has also rallied over 45% since the last week of February. It surged 25% in April alone and is currently trading at around 0.08012, close to its all-time high. The growing strength of $SOL over $ETH shows that it may outperform the latter in the coming weeks, which is exactly what the OSC thinks. BitBull, a popular crypto trader, compared the current $SOL setup with $ETH in 2021. Ethereum was trading around $1,600 in March 2021 and formed the same pattern as Solana has formed now. Post this, $ETH made a new high of around $4,500 in just 3 months. $SOL may follow a similar path, which means the $300 level may not take long. What’s Stopping Solana? Solana’s potential to rise to the ranks of $ETH and $BTC is undeniable. However, so far, it’s been unable to realize its true potential due to the network’s scalability issues. For context, Solana has always been perceived as the meme coin blockchain, thanks to its lightning-fast speeds and low costs. However, this changed after the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA. These two hyper-successful meme coins brought loads of new investors onto the Solana blockchain. A sudden spike in traffic overloaded Solana to the point where transactions either took a long time to go through or failed outright. In other words, Solana is in dire need of improved scalability. This is where a new cryptocurrency, Solaxy ($SOLX), comes in. Solaxy Promises to Breathe New Life Into Solana Don’t mistake Solaxy for just another meme coin on Solana. It’s a revolutionary token designed specially to solve Solana’s network congestion. It’s a meme coin with real utility. By building Solana’s first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol, $SOLX will be Solana’s new support system. It will batch-process many of Solana’s total transaction requests on a sidechain, significantly reducing the burden on Solana’s mainnet. This will enhance throughput and ultimately crank up Solana’s scalability and speed back to, or even beyond, the levels it was always renowned for. It’s also worth noting that $SOLX , Solaxy’s native cryptocurrency, comes with multi-chain compatibility. It combine the benefits of Ethereum and Solana, merging the former’s vast liquidity pool with the latter’s speed and low fees to rejuvenate the home of the meme coins . $SOLX Could Be the Next Crypto to Explode Solaxy ‘s one-of-a-kind mission has been all the talk. The crypto went into presale just a few months ago and has already surpassed $30M in funding, making it easily one of the best crypto presales on the market right now. Moreover, Solaxy’s large presale purse comprises both retail crypto investors and large whale buyers alike, which shows market-wide interest in the project. The best part, however, is that you can still buy $SOLX at a very low presale price of just $0.001694 per token. Additionally, we predict $SOLX could reach $0.2 by 2030 – a markup of over 11,800% in less than five years. No wonder it’s primed to be the next crypto to explode . To help you with the purchase process, here’s a guide on how to buy Solaxy . For more technical information about the project, check out Solaxy’s whitepaper .

Despite positive chain usage data, including record-high DAAs and transaction trends, XRP's market value appears inflated relative to its realized value. The MVRV ratio suggests XRP may be overvalued, with historical peaks indicating potential price tops, warranting caution. I reiterate a 'hold' rating on XRP, as current prices may reflect excessive optimism ahead of potential ETF approvals. Back in December, I covered the XRP ( XRP-USD ) token for Seeking Alpha and reiterated a 'hold.' I've covered XRP a few times for SA in the past and have always listed the coin as a 'hold.' XRP has been around for a long time relative to the broader digital asset market. The token is utilized for transaction payments on the XRP Ledger which is developed by Ripple Labs. Data by YCharts Though XRP is down about 20% since my December article, it is one of the best performing assets in the crypto space year to date and is specifically beating the returns for native tokens on leading smart contract blockchains. In this update, we'll explore what is likely driving this outperformance and get into chain usage to assess whether or not XRP is moving more on hype or on utility. Catalysts: The SEC's White Flag & ETF Expectations The biggest reason XRP has been a major outperformer in 2025 is likely due to the SEC dropping its appeal against Ripple Labs in March - essentially clearing the path for XRP Ledger development and adoption from a market that has been highly cautious the token due to regulatory concerns for years. Ripple Labs subsequently purchased a prime brokerage firm for $1.25 billion that could potentially use Ripple's dollar-stablecoin product Ripple USD (RLUSD-USD) as collateral. Given the clearly improving regulatory setup for XRP, it's perhaps no surprise that XRP is now a coveted spot-ETF product from TradFi asset managers: Applications By Asset (Kaiko Research, SEC, EDGAR) According to tracking by Kaiko Reserach, there are already 10 ETF applications for XRP-based products - this puts XRP as far and away the leader in pending applications and more than double the next major asset. The investment demand story is telling as well: Investment Flows (m$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) -$890 $545 $112,961 Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) -$89 $241 $7,844 Multi-asset $2 -$143 $5,898 Solana ( SOL-USD ) -$6 $79 $1,087 XRP $2 $176 $883 Source: Coinshares, Bloomberg, as of April 12, 2025 Capital allocators are bullish XRP judging by the $176 million in year to date positive net flows as of April 12th - 20% of the total investment AUM for XRP has come from this year alone. Solana's YTD net flow of total AUM is just 7% by comparison. I believe this signal is clear; the investment community believes it has been underweight XRP and is now making up that ground before spot ETFs hit the market. For instance, Standard Chartered has a $12.50 price target for XRP and sees ETF approval happening next quarter. The firm believes XRP will eventually overtake Ethereum by market capitalization. Should it, though? Network Data/Stablecoin Supply In my view, XRP's market capitalization relative to ETH is already quiet telling. At a $123.3 billion in total market cap, XRP is only behind ETH by about $73 billion and is almost worth as much as Solana and Binance ( BNB-USD ) combined. From a stablecoin supply standpoint, there is $94 million RLUSD in circulation. This puts Ripple as the 29th ranked stablecoin chain and well behind market leader Ethereum - which has over $122 billion in stables. On this alone, it's difficult to argue XRP should have a larger valuation than ETH. But admittedly, there are several positive signs for XRP in the usage data. XRP, 30 Day Fees (CoinMetrics) 30 Day Fees recently hit an all-time high in February. Bear in mind, XRP is a low-cost chain and the fees paid to the network are very low comparatively to other networks. Usage of the chain is also spiking when measured by Daily Active Address, or DAAs: XRP, 30 Day DAAs (CoinMetrics) The chart above shows 30 day DAAs peaking at 246.5k in March. That's an all time high in the average and comes with a daily transaction trend that is also very promising: XRP, 30 Day Txs (CoinMetrics) The 30 day average transaction trend for XRP has been in an uptrend for over a decade. Not every public chain has a transaction trend that looks like this. I think this is a positive sign for XRP usage longer term, especially given the changing regulatory environment in the United States. The question ultimately comes down to what should XRP be worth? One way we can look at valuation is through the market value to realized value, or MVRV: XRP, 30 Day MVRV (CoinMetrics) The market value to realized value is high. At 1.7 MVRV ratio, XRP is quite a bit 'overvalued' relative to what has actually been paid for each token in existence. Furthermore, when the token hit a MVRV ratio of 2.3 in February it may have actually been a top signal if history is a guide. Back in May 2021, the 30 day average MVRV ratio hit 2.3 and that turned out to correlate perfectly with the top in the price of XRP during the last cycle. That certainly doesn't mean it has to play out the same way again this cycle. But I think MVRV is a strong indicator and shouldn't be ignored. XRP, Q4 YoY Change (Messari) If we look at the usage data from a quarterly vantage, we can get a better sense of where the year over year trends have been stronger. And perhaps to no real surprise, price is growing faster than DAAs or transactions. Again, a lot of this is likely due to capital allocators trying to get XRP exposure before ETFs hit the US market. Final Takeaways I'm still going to reiterate a 'hold' on XRP. For me, the chain usage data is actually pretty encouraging. We see transactions up over time, DAAs making highs, and even fees have noticeably increased in recent months. Still, price is well ahead of all of this action. It's understandable to me that speculators would want to buy XRP before ETFs hit the market, but I do wonder if Ethereum serves as a warning sign with these types of hype-driven rallies. ETH ETFs hit the US market last summer and the token has fallen by over 50% since. Some of that is because ETH's fundamental story faces challenges, but there was also a significant runup in the price of ETH in the months prior to the ETF approvals. I would be careful chasing XRP on ETF hopes. All too often, these types of catalysts are 'buy the rumor, sell the news' events. I think the MVRV ratio shows we may have already hit the peak in XRP for this cycle. And at a $123 billion market cap, XRP is pricing in a lot of network success that may not actually happen. Again, I think there are clearly positives here, but I think those bullish XRP may be able to wait for a better price.",ETH-USD|SOL-USD|XRP-USD,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-15 12:00:00

A close above $2.25 may confirm the bottom set on April 7. XRP’s failure to meet key levels could lead to renewed selling pressure. XRP is trading above $2.10 and its 21-week exponential moving average (EMA), levels closely watched by traders. But according to analyst Egrag Crypto , a weekly close above $2.25 may confirm a reversal from the April 7 low. If these conditions are not met, XRP may face renewed bearish volatility. XRP Holds Key Support, But What Level Confirms a Bottom? XRP is trading at $2.17, a 1.8% rise in the past day. The token has risen by 16.2% in the past week, reclaiming its 21-week EMA. This level has acted as resistance in recent months, making its reclaim a significant technical development. Related: April 15 XRP Forecast: Analysis Focuses on $2.10 Support Holding Firm Egrag’s analysis highlights this progress but stresses only a full-body weekly candle close above $2.10, the 21-week EMA, and especially $2.25 provides strong confirmation that the dip to $1.64 on April 7 marked the cycle bottom.

This decision was made in response to the recent actions of the U.S. president to impose a 25% tariff on cars and parts imported to the country. Trump said in the Oval Office that his administration is “looking at something to help car companies” as they adjust their operations. Car companies have relocated sourcing to Canada, Mexico, and other countries, and they may be given more time to relocate production back to the United States. USMCA rules offer partial protection from Trump tariffs With reference to the USMCA trade agreement, automobiles, and automotive parts manufactured in Canada and Mexico are partially protected from the new tariffs. It is imperative to note that the 25% levy only applies to non-United States content if the vehicles meet the agreement’s rules of origin. This decision could be related to increasing concerns within the White House that some of the tariffs may adversely affect local manufacturers rather than help them. Shares of Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis rose after Trump’s remarks. General Motors Company and Ford Motor Company increased by nearly 4%, while Stellantis jumped by 5% in the U.S. trading session. The Detroit 3 have repeatedly called on the White House to exclude automobiles and parts to meet USMCA from tariffs. According to Matt Blunt, th e Am erican Automotive Policy Council president, existing tariffs present some social costs to manufacturing. He pointed out that the current tariffs on steel, aluminum, and car parts hamper the ability to assemble automobiles in the country. “I think there is a growing awareness that some of these parts tariffs are having unintended consequences and make it more difficult to assemble vehicles in the United States.” ~ Matt Blunt. Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 20% tariff on goods from China, which is an additional pressure on the automotive industry. Blunt reiterated that although the administration’s objective is to support manufacturing in the US, towering tariffs on critical components may disrupt the objective. Tech industry secures critical exemptions While carmakers will have to wait for clarity, the technology sector has been given some breathing moment. The Trump administration has spared smartphones, laptops, semiconductors, and other electronics from the massive tariffs on imports from China. US Customs Border Patrol later established that these exceptions hold from April 5. The exceptions cover products that were undergoing the 10% tariff across the globe as well as the 125% tariff on goods sourced from China. The decision has been widely categorized by delegates as a game changer for a number of tech firms because they will be shielded from public pressure of pricing down consumer devices. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called the tariff reprieve ‘a dream scenario’ and said it benefits clients with a focus on technology giants such as Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft. The move is timely as more and more Silicon Valley firms step up attempts to diversify production from China. Apple, for instance, produces about 80% of its iPhones for the U.S. market in China. The remaining 20% comes from India. Trump’s tariffs had triggered worries that the price of the iPhone could soar significantly. Some projections estimated that the iPhone’s cost in the U.S. would triple if it were to pass the costs to consumers. The White House stated that the exemptions are temporary and allow companies to move their manufacturing lines to the States or any other nation of their choice, such as India or Vietnam. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump’s objective has been doubled to minimize purchasing goods from China. However, tariffs on technology products have been slightly eased, but Trump has not been very friendly towards China. The new measures also consist of a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, while other countries that have not responded to U.S. tariffs face a 10% across-the-board tariff up to July.

The analyst, Alex Becker, shared his expert analysis on these points in a recent livestream where he was talking about Ethereum’s price action and what that may portend for the wider market. Related Reading: Whale Alert: Ripple Sends 200 Million XRP Into The Shadows Ethereum Displays Signs Of Recovery Ethereum has risen nearly 5% in the past 24 hours, trading at $1,675, which is a 10% rise in the past week. The second-largest cryptocurrency recovered strongly after touching a multi-year low of $1,380 recently. The recovery has been very rapid, with Ethereum rising almost 20% in a five-day timeframe. In spite of this rise, current prices still indicate a steep 50% fall from where Ethereum had been trading at the start of 2025. Analyst Asserts 90% Probability Of Shattering Past Records The cryptocurrency also has a way to go before it hits its all-time high of $4,890, which is around 60% lower than the peak. Ethereum would have to more than double its current price to hit its previous record. Becker voiced strong optimism regarding Ethereum’s future, saying there’s a “90% chance” it will break its prior record high. He even dared viewers to come back in three years and ridicule him if his prediction fails to materialize. The analyst is optimistic in part due to what he perceives as widespread negativity in regards to Ethereum, with most investors writing it off as “dead.” However, Becker is going the other direction, indicating the cryptocurrency is overvalued and offers a good buying opportunity for those who had the willingness to accept the risks. Without hype there is a 90% chance ETH returns to its old ATH… Which will trigger huge gains in alts from these prices… Making this the easiest way to 3-8x your money in history. Ever. This isn’t even the best case scenario where it gets a true bull past aths. — Alex Becker 🍊🏆🥇 (@ZssBecker) April 11, 2025 Possible Ripple Effect On Other Cryptocurrencies According to Becker, an Ethereum “comeback” would have profound implications on other leading cryptocurrencies. He believes coins positioned just below Ethereum to experience explosive growth in case his expectations come to fruition. The analyst outlined specific cryptocurrencies he thinks will gain, such as Cardano (ADA), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), SUI, Avalanche (AVAX), and Solana (SOL). Though stressing the risks involved with cryptocurrency investing, Becker recommended such coins could be worth holding by long-term investors willing to deal with high-risk assets. Related Reading: Crypto Holders Beware! New Malware Drains ETH, SOL, XRP Wallets Price Targets And Growth Projections Becker drew a number of scenarios for growth in cryptocurrencies. For Ethereum, he predicted that a four-fold ROI on present levels can happen, and prices can possibly touch as much as $10,000 under a highly optimistic scenario. The analyst was even more optimistic about XRP, indicating that it could beat Ethereum by 25%-50% if it starts to close the market capitalization gap between the two cryptocurrencies. Even with his positive view, Becker admitted that investing in cryptocurrencies is still very risky. He cautioned that in the worst-case scenario, Ethereum can fall to $500, which is a 50% decline from current prices for investors.

A $250 position in Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , or Ethereum (ETH) is still holding solid ground.

Here's What It Takes to Rise",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-is-ready-for-a-rise-according-to-bitwise-chief-investment-officer-matt-hougan-heres-what-it-takes-to-rise/,"Bitcoin is behaving “quite differently” during the current market downturn, according to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, which suggests increasing maturity and resilience. Bitcoin Shows Signs of Maturity, Ready to Gain If Macro Headwinds Ease In a client note published early Tuesday, Hougan highlighted that Bitcoin has remained virtually unchanged over the past month. “Bitcoin is trading at $84,379. A month ago it was $84,317. That’s a 30-day return of 0.07%,” Hougan wrote. “From the US creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve to President Trump imposing tariffs on the entire world, there have been huge forces affecting the crypto market from every angle, and we’ve gone right sideways.” U.S. stocks have fallen since their February peak, with the S&P 500 down 12%. Bitcoin followed suit with a 12.4% drop, but that still represented significant performance compared to previous macro sell-offs, Hougan noted. For example, during the market crash of 2022, Bitcoin lost 58.3% of its value, compared to the S&P’s 24.5% decline. Similarly, during the pandemic crash of early 2020 and the 2018 US-China trade war, Bitcoin’s losses far exceeded those of stocks. “Since Bitcoin broke $1 in 2011, it has never outperformed the stock market during a full-blown market correction. This time, I think it has a chance,” Hougan said. While gold has overshadowed both stocks and Bitcoin during the current correction, Hougan emphasized that Bitcoin’s recent resilience — holding above $80,000 amid global uncertainty — is a testament to its growing role as a resilient asset. “The world is unraveling and Bitcoin is trading above $80,000. If that doesn’t give you confidence in its staying power, I don’t know what will,” he said. While Hougan stopped short of calling Bitcoin a full-fledged hedge asset, he suggested that the crypto’s behavior signals a structural shift. With increasing institutional and regulatory interest, the cryptocurrency is shedding its high-risk asset tag and increasingly being viewed as digital gold. *This is not investment advice.

According to several technical analysts, a sustained recovery daily close above $2.20 will signal a strong trend reversal that could put double digits within reach. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView XRP price must reclaim $2.20 After the cryptocurrency market experienced a relief rally due to US President Donald Trump’s announcement of tariff exemptions for a range of tech products, traders are optimistic about the possibility of XRP price breaking into double digits. Analyst DOM said XRP’s recent retest of the support at $1.96 saw it regain a key “value area” above $2.00, established in December 2024. “$2.20 is now the only objective here,” the analyst said in an April 13 post on X, adding that a decisive move above this level would lead to a rise toward $2.50. An accompanying chart showed that the price has also reclaimed the election VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) at $2.03, suggesting a potential for further gains. “If $2.00 and election VWAP stay as support, this chart looks very constructive.” XRP/USD chart. Source: Dom XRP’s immediate support at $2.10, also the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), is especially important, according to the liquidation heatmap. A wall of bid liquidity is building around this level, suggesting that a retest of support and a liquidity grab here is becoming increasingly likely in the short term. XRP liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass Will XRP price hit $20 in 2025? Following the recent recovery in XRP price, Maelius, an anonymous crypto analyst, said that the altcoin could reach $10 and an “optimistic” target of between $15 and $20, according to the Elliott Wave Theory on the weekly time frame chart. “Conservative case assumes XRP has completed its W3, currently in the process of finalizing W4, before expanding to a final W5.” He added that the price action and RSI were mirroring the 2017 cycle, with the RSI topping out in the resistance area (in red), suggesting overbought conditions. If the current cycle repeats, Maelius predicts XRP could reach a W5 target of around $10 toward the end of the year. “Conservative assumption is for a magnitude of W5 to replicate the one of W3, thus targeting $10.” XRP/USD weekly chart. Source: Maelius Continuing, the analyst argued that there is a possibility that the W3 top is not in just yet. Related: Price analysis 4/14: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LEO The reason given is a larger accumulation period compared to the 2017 cycle in terms of both price and the RSI. “Therefore, there is a possibility we have just completed W3 out of larger W3, meaning it is just taking a bit more time than previously,” Maelius explained. If it is taking longer this time, Maelius expects the RSI to retest the resistance to confirm the completion of the third wave. Also, the Eliott Wave count would be in line with the previous cycle, with a longer fourth wave within the third wave as before. “In such a case, the final W5 top could easily get prolonged to Q1-2 of 2026, with higher targets than in the conservative case, i.e. likely in the range of $15-$20 or even higher. ” XRP/USD weekly chart. Source: Maelius Meanwhile, fellow analyst XForceGlobal noted that XRP is still in a “major bull market,” with its price action standing out dramatically from the rest of the crypto market from an Elliott Wave Theory perspective. “If we have all the ideas aligned together with even the simple technical analysis, there is a very good chance that we’re are gonna be working for all-time highs at the very minimum expectation.” XRP/USD daily chart.

Arthur Cheong, founder of crypto investment firm DeFiance Capital, said in an X post that market makers and crypto projects work together to create artificial prices that can be sustained for long periods. Cheong wrote: “You don’t know whether the price is a result of organic demand & supply or simply due to projects and market makers colluding to fix the price to achieve other objectives.” He added that if the industry’s players don’t step up and improve the situation, a big part of the crypto market will remain “uninvestable for the foreseeable future.” Centralized exchanges turning a “blind eye” Cheong said it was strange that centralized exchanges (CEXs) are “turning an absolute blind eye” to the issue. He described the altcoin market as a “lemon’s market,” a term in economics that describes a market where low-quality products drive out the good due to information asymmetry. In addition, Cheong described most token generation event pricing in 2025 as an “absolute joke” where the assets’ prices went down by 70% to 90% a few months after listing. “Anyone that bought is down massively,” Cheong added.

This means that 88% of the tokens have declined since listing. The price drops ranged from 19% up to 90%. Deutscher said this was the reason why retail investors were quitting.

A similar deposit of 12,500 ETH was made on April 12. The firm has sent a total of 25,000 ETH worth over $40 million in the last three days. Galaxy Digital moved the tokens in two separate transactions. First, 2,500 ETH worth $4.05 million, followed by 10,000 ETH valued at $16.32 million, both sent to Binance. Galaxy Digital deposited another 12,500 $ETH ($20.36M) to #Binance 5 hours ago. That's 25,000 $ETH ($40M+) moved to #Binance in just 3 days. https://t.co/owM3zRHpAx pic.twitter.com/tBtHImGwwO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 15, 2025 On April 12th, 4,500 ETH worth $7.11 million and 8,000 ETH worth $12.63 million were sent to Binance in two separate transactions. Ether’s price dropped from $1,677 on April 14 to $1,641 after the latest deposit. This dip in price highlights how large institutional transfers could affect market prices. Galaxy Digital Moves Millions in Crypto; Holds 8 million in stablecoins Besides, Galaxy Digital also moved 5 million USDT to Binance, along with 100,000 USDC and $1,000 work of AVAX. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the firm now holds about 200 ETH worth $328,000 and 18,150 AVAX worth $363K after the recent transfers. The firm still holds $7.97 million in stablecoins: 4.2 million in DAI and 3.75 Million in USDC. Yesterday, lookonchain reported Ether whale movements as a mysterious whale purchased 4,208 ETH worth $6.87 million from OKX using 4 different wallets. Besides, the whale also borrowed 4.85 million USDT from Aave and deposited into OKX, likely to buy more Ethereum. In a latest update from Lookonchain, a new wallet recently withdrew 3,000 ETH ($4.92M) from Kraken, then moved it to Aave and Compound. The wallet borrowed 3M USDC and deposited it back into Kraken, likely to purchase more ETH.

Notably, the New York Attorney General had accused the firm of selling its LUNA holdings without proper disclosure. In 2020, Galaxy Digital promoted LUNA and secured a deal to buy it at a discount. When the price of LUNA rose, the firm sold its holdings for huge profits but the transactions were not disclosed properly. Ether ETF Record Outflows On April 15, the Ethereum spot ETF experienced a net outflow of about $6 million. Fidelity’s FETH led the outflow with $7.8 million, while 21Shares’ CETH saw a net inflow of $1.8 million as per data from Sosovalue . Notably, Ether has struggled to keep up this market cycle. Although Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, Ether did not show similar gains. Infact, the ETH/BTC trading pair has dropped by 80% since 2022, which highlights its underperformance relative to Bitcoin. Analyst Signals Potential Rebound for Ether It had its worst quarter in five years in Q1 2025, dropping to $1,400 due to market downturns. However, analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a positive sign on the price chart which could suggest a potential rebound. He shared that Ether might be preparing for a big rebound as the TD Sequential Indicator on the weekly chart is showing a buy signal.

Although market downtrends can often provide ways for buying, the hunt for the next best growth investment usually leads traders toward potentially lucrative yet risk-prone early-stage token sales. This analyzes what we learned from Mantra's demise, determines the current state of crypto presales, and evaluates FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a new initiative that seeks to merge meme culture and AI, as a case study. The Grim Reminder of Mantra’s Collapse The staggering 90% drop in value for Mantra (OM) is emblematic of the pervasive volatility in the crypto ecosystem. This cryptocurrency, like many others during the crypto winter, has experienced a loss in market capitalization, further eroding investor confidence while highlighting the lack of sufficient market research, especially for projects still in the presale stage. Mantra’s downfall serves as a lesson on the importance of analyzing a crypto project’s core fundamentals, including adequate transparency and utility, before investment. Crypto Presales: Still a Golden Ticket or a Minefield? These early investments, aimed at presale token offerings within new cryptocurrencies, come at a highly discounted price prior to exchange listings, providing a path toward substantial returns for investors. Although Ethereum and Cardano have shown the possibility of life-changing payoffs, the presale market is unregulated and fraught with hurdles. These hurdles include absolute project failure, price volatility after listing, greasy cash grabs, scams, and insufficient liquidity. All of these dangers are further worsened during market downturns, highlighting the outsized risk to real investment return. Therefore, investors must meticulously scrutinize a project's team, technological innovation, practical application, tokenomics, and security measures. In subsequent sub-presale phases, there's mounting evidence of investors requiring guaranteed utility independent of presale and unsponsored tokenomic and utility coffers as long-term viability indicators. Enter FloppyPepe (FPPE): AI Meets Meme Culture Meme coins, especially those themed on Pepe the Frog, have marked a viral potential. FloppyPepe (FPPE) seeks to enter this oversaturated yet complex arena by aiming to blend practical utility with meme appeal, driven by artificial intelligence. FPPE intends to cultivate an ecosystem that enhances creativity and community participation while contemplating more than just speculative assets. Centered around this are AI-based tools such as ""Meme-o-Matic,"" an AI meme generator that allows creators to NFT monetize their work, and ""FloppyX,"" an AI video generation framework. This initiative also wants to form a ""Meme DAO"" that will enable token holders to possess governance rights. The application of AI provided purpose that goes beyond the typical meme coin hype cycle appeal, which is often unsustainable. Floppynomics & Security: Building Trust This section explores tokenomics and the security of the FloppyPepe project . Holding rights, redistribution, and charity hippo conservation aids are bundled into a 3% transaction fee from the 120 trillion max supply of FPPE tokens. Driving down the supply of tokens, as explained in the tokenomics, is the limited total supply and the process of burning tokens. While these structures theoretically incentivize holding and help support token value, Binance pegged stablecoins proved otherwise. As a form of securing common vulnerabilities associated with crypto projects during the presale stage, FloppyPepe highlights the SolidProof audit of their smart contract. Although a positive audit does not guarantee complete safety, it bolsters trust toward requested security. The following table summarizes the core tokenomic details: Feature Detail Total Supply 120,000,000,000,000 FPPE Transaction Fee 3% on every transaction Fee Breakdown 1% Burn (Deflationary) 1% Redistribution (Holder Rewards) 1% Charity (Wildlife Conservation) Token Allocation Team: 20%, Marketing: 20%, Ecosystem: 20%, Liquidity: 20%, Community: 20% FloppyPepe vs. Mantra: A Study in Contrasts Reflecting on Mantra’s downfall, it seems to stem from issues of utility, security, or tokenomics imbalance. Unlike Mantra, FloppyPepe focuses proactively on AI-driven utility, tokenomics, and third-party security audits, adding more emphasis on proactive utility. To a certain degree, this highlights the attempt to create a more robust and trusted structure, especially in an environment shaken by previous failures. Nevertheless, trust without execution is meaningless, and it’s FloppyPepe’s roadmap that will require untold effort to achieve sustained trust in the long run. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Token Presale Opportunity FloppyPepe’s current token presale has FPPE tokens offered at a low initial price in early stages, with increased allotments purportedly incentivizing early participation. Reports seem to suggest significant early interest alongside large-scale participation by retail copycat investors. FloppyPepe presale subsequently aims for major listing phases on centralized and multi-chain listed decentralized exchanges, bestowing the first presale participants with a high schematic return on investment (ROI). Claiming interest during the presale, FloppyPepe's purported marketing strategy employs standard techniques to elevate perceived demand through generated hype. Mitigating Potential Hazards in a Changing Market The emergence and rapid decline of Mantra illustrate the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, particularly in the presale phase. Crypto presales , or offering tokens before the project launches, certainly present an opportunity for enormous earnings, but reputation management overshadows trust, meaning they require extensive due diligence and a significant appetite for risk. FloppyPepe is trying to revolutionize the meme coin concept by incorporating AI functions, token-deflationary mechanisms, and a safeguard system. The ongoing presale presents an opportunity, but its success hinges on proper execution and market acceptance. The FPPE case study demonstrates a trend pertaining to newer crypto projects, especially within speculative niches as they attempt to capture elusive hype, that realize they need substance to attract investor dollars given today’s more risk-off environment. In any case, those interested in participating in a crypto presale should be prepared to perform extensive due diligence, as participating in a presale is a sophisticated gamble.

You hear about it everywhere – from cryptocurrencies to secure supply chains. But beyond the buzz, there’s a real, tangible opportunity, especially here in India. The big question on many aspiring tech professionals’ minds is: how much money can Indians make via blockchain skills? The answer is encouraging: quite a lot, potentially. India is rapidly becoming a global hub for technology and innovation. With government initiatives like Digital India and a massive pool of tech talent, the adoption of blockchain is accelerating across various sectors like finance (FinTech), logistics, healthcare, and even entertainment. This surge creates a significant demand for skilled professionals who can navigate this complex yet rewarding field. If you’re considering a career pivot or starting fresh, understanding the blockchain jobs salary in India is a crucial first step. Why are Blockchain Skills So Valuable in India? Before diving into the numbers, let’s understand why these skills command premium salaries: High Demand, Limited Supply: While the demand for blockchain expertise is skyrocketing, the number of truly proficient professionals is still catching up. This imbalance naturally drives up salaries. Transformative Technology: Blockchain isn’t just an upgrade; it’s a fundamental shift in how we handle data, transactions, and trust online. Companies across Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), supply chain management, and cybersecurity are investing heavily. Global Relevance: Blockchain skills are globally transferable. Indian professionals often work with international clients or in multinational corporations, aligning salaries with global standards to retain talent. Innovation Driver: Companies pioneering Web3, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), and NFT (Non-Fungible Token) projects need experts to build and maintain these cutting-edge applications. Key Blockchain Roles and Their Earning Potential Salaries can vary significantly based on role, experience, location (metros like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, and NCR often pay more), company size, and the specific skillset. However, we can outline some general ranges for blockchain jobs salary in India as of early 2025: Blockchain Developer (Entry-Level): Skills: Understanding blockchain fundamentals, proficiency in languages like Solidity, Rust, or Go, basic smart contract development. Estimated Salary: ₹6 Lakhs Per Annum (LPA) to ₹12 LPA. Freshers with strong internship experience or exceptional projects might command figures towards the higher end. Blockchain Developer (Mid-Level): Skills: 2-5 years of experience, deploying complex smart contracts, integrating blockchain solutions with existing systems, understanding various consensus mechanisms. Estimated Salary: ₹12 LPA to ₹25 LPA. Professionals who can lead small projects or contribute significantly to larger ones fall into this bracket. Senior Blockchain Developer / Architect: Skills: 5+ years of experience, designing entire blockchain systems, leading development teams, deep expertise in security, scalability, and specific platforms (like Hyperledger Fabric or specific Layer 1/Layer 2 protocols). Estimated Salary: ₹25 LPA to ₹50 LPA, and potentially much higher (£60 LPA+) for niche experts or principal architects in leading tech firms or well-funded startups. Blockchain Consultant: Skills: Strong understanding of blockchain’s business applications, ability to advise companies on implementation strategies, excellent communication skills. Estimated Salary: Highly variable, often ₹20 LPA to ₹45 LPA+, depending on experience and client portfolio. Blockchain Quality Engineer / Security Analyst: Skills: Focus on testing smart contracts, identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring the security and integrity of blockchain applications.

XRP is diversifying niche markets in cross-border payments and currently sits at $2.16. Cardano (ADA) is also building a robust $0.6614 platform, and not without challenges to traditionalism is a new wave of presale projects. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , with its unique focus on artificial intelligence and a staggering presale price of $0.0000002, begs attention and raises questions about how precisely value is defined in the crypto world. Investor Focus Shifting: Presales vs. Proven Players FloppyPepe piques the interest of speculative investors eager to join the presale projects and is anticipated to become a publicly listed cryptocurrency. Alongside XRP and Cardano, holders of these are willing to participate in the more mature market. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Building an AI-assisted community ecosystem FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers a new type of value based on constructing an AI-powered community ecosystem intended for sustained engagement and participation. This blueprint encompasses sophisticated artificial intelligence features like ‘FloppyAI,’ which is a conversational market insight AI user bot aimed at boosting user engagement, and ‘FloppyX,’ an automated dynamic content video generation system. User empowerment is placed at the core of this philosophy with prospective plans for easy-to-use content creation tools as well as a Meme DAO for patrician-style decentralized governance where community members control how the project develops. Additionally, FloppyPepe sets itself apart with its novel tokenomics through a 3% transaction fee set to support wildlife fundraising, reward holders, and burn tokens to increase scarcity out of 120 trillion tokens in circulation. Explosive ROI Potential Analysis: The FloppyPepe Prep Sale The issuance strategy is perhaps the single most suspicious feature for deeming FloppyPepe a frontliner during this entire crypto presale project. Firstly, presale tokens amount to only 20% of total units offered on the market, but 60% of circulating supply is meant for early bird rounds, thus making funding targets at $20M/$45M incredibly optimistic, indicating growth after a conservative start priced at $0.0000002. Based on these assumptions, it is easy to see the return possibilities are 10,000% if they burn post-presale anchors at $0.01, which translates to $100 transforming into $5 million under speculative conditions. Selling these tokens will, of course, mark the price value-defining zero recoil at around 5M%, propelling the profiles’ high-risk returns predictions. XRP: Strategizing the Payments Warzone Pegged XRP’s price , putting them under $2.16 while trading. Attempts to revalue cross-border trade through bank-centered finance systems priced it—beneficiary, low exchange fee borders. With XRP, it was able to trade cheaper, faster, and more focused towards breaking traditional lending system concepts while giving value in return to business-centered asset positives. Even with harsh restrictions, this concept is pursued, which guarantees the target market's earnings are further pushed by the eagerness of actual financial institutions to gain attention. Solved problems on functioning infrastructure finance make specific and broad scalability existing XRP holders value deemed. Cardano (ADA)—Systematic Development Approaches to Future Goals Cardano (ADA) , currently trading at approximately $0.6614, continues to command market attention due to its blockchain-based platform that prioritizes security, sustainability, and scalability through a uniquely engineered proof-of-stake protocol. In contrast to existing smart contract solutions, Cardano aims to address security, scalability, and sustainability through innovative engineering while guaranteeing technological robustness and adherence to the peer review model. Benefitting from the support of a vigorous community, Cardano systematically continues to grow and expand. FloppyPepe's Ecosystem: Creating Value Beyond High Volatility Most importantly, this strategy develops value through user participation rather than through selling hype during presale events. AI tools are designed to do more than just provide novelty. They can also drive ongoing engagement within the platform. In a similar move, the actively participative FloppyPepe stakeholders and community-driven governance model could motivate people to use the content creation tool and turn into stakeholders, sustaining the community's vibrant engagement well past the platform's initial launch. Strategic Reflection on Opportunities: Balancing Risks and Rewards On the 13th of April, investors consider multiple sources of crypto value. XRP has a payment utility, while Cardano has a favorable platform technology based on research. Through bulky community engagement AI, self-governance, purpose-driven economics, and a stunning financial return only available during the presale phase, FloppyPepe (FPPE) redefines these frameworks. Although highly speculative, the self-sustaining ecosystem model is an intriguing proposition for what’s to come and must be evaluated alongside cryptocurrencies with established utilities like XRP and Cardano.

According to the report “The State of Stablecoins 2025,” active stablecoin wallets increased by 53% year-over-year, from 19.6 million in February 2024 to 30 million in February 2025. Source: Dune/Artemis Stablecoin DAS Piece Institutional participation is a major driver. Companies increasingly utilize stablecoins for real-time payments, settlements, and yield generation in DeFi protocols. The report also pointed to a significant increase in stablecoin supply, which jumped from $138 billion to $225 billion within a year, a 63% rise. Monthly transfer volume more than doubled, hitting $4.1 trillion in February 2025 compared to $1.9 trillion the year before, with a peak of $5.1 trillion in December 2024. These numbers paint a picture of growth and diversification. While average transaction sizes stayed relatively stable, occasional spikes suggested large-scale institutional activity. The dual use case, for both retail and whales, has made stablecoins a flexible tool in modern finance. Solana, Tron, and the Global Surge Zooming out, the broader blockchain growth tells a story of rapid development and regional adoption. Following the November U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance revived investor enthusiasm, and stablecoin deposits surged across several ecosystems. Solana, in particular, witnessed a wave of inflows, with over $1 billion in USDC deposits recorded in December 2024 alone . Solana’s total value locked (TVL) reached $8.57 billion by January 2025, marking a sixfold increase since the beginning of 2024. Tron, meanwhile, stole the spotlight in February 2025 with a staggering $824.5 million increase in stablecoin reserves in just one week. @trondao leads stablecoin inflows with an $824M surge in USDT and USDC, while Avalanche and TON see major outflows. #Tron #Stablecoins #USDT #USDC https://t.co/CSbCYL4d3z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 24, 2025 Its dominance in emerging markets, low fees, and strong presence in payment infrastructure have made it a preferred network for USDT transactions. Other Ethereum-compatible chains, such as Base, Polygon, and Optimism, also posted stablecoin inflows. Conversely, Avalanche and TON faced significant losses, $506 million and $280 million in stablecoins, respectively. Despite its foundational role in DeFi, Ethereum saw a $208 million outflow during the same period, hinting at liquidity rotation toward more agile or cost-effective networks. For this month, SUI seems to be the leading blockchain. $SUI saw the highest stablecoin inflows among all blockchains, with an increase of $18.1 million in the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/x0PxGo1owa — ToreroRomero (@Torero_Romero) April 15, 2025 The most telling thing is the increasing reliance on stablecoins in emerging markets. Chainalysis and Visa-backed research data indicate stablecoins outpacing Bitcoin in key regions like Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. In these areas, stablecoins are used for savings, remittances, and business transactions in countries grappling with currency devaluation and unstable financial systems. A survey conducted in Nigeria, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, and India found that stablecoins are central to financial inclusion.

This year, gold has surged 22% because of haven bids and arbitrage plays involving traders moving physical gold from overseas destinations to the U.S. to take advantage of premiums on Comex. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has dropped over 8%. That has led to over 25% slide in the bitcoin-gold ratio, representing the per unit USD price of bitcoin relative to the per ounce USD price of gold. However, the downtrend, represented by trendlines drawn off Jan. 20 and March 3 highs, has been invalidated this week. The ratio topped the trendline over the weekend in a bullish breakout that suggests the cryptocurrency may not outperform gold, potentially catching up with the rally in the yellow metal. The message is consistent with analysis by Theya Research's Joe Consorti, which shows bitcoin tends to lag gold by 100 to 150 days. The trendline breakout is accompanied by the MACD's histogram's positive flip, signaling a bullish shift in momentum. The bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-day simple moving averages (SMA), seen in the lower pane, suggests the same. XMR's golden cross The outlook for privacy-focused monero (XMR) appears constructive following the past week's sharp recovery from $165 to over $200 that left a ""long-tailed"" candle on the weekly chart, a sign of dip demand. The token has broken out of a prolonged consolidation pattern, with the 50-week SMA moving above the 200-week SMA to confirm a golden crossover, an indicator representing a long-term bullish shift in momentum. The immediate resistance is seen at $242, the February high, followed by $289, the April 2022 high, with support at $200 and last week's low of $165.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Monero|Technical Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XMR,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-15 12:22:29

The program aimed to remove fees from particular futures trading pairs while simultaneously boosting user interaction and substantial growth throughout essential platform metrics. During the first three months of the year, the platform witnessed an increase of 17.8% in monthly active traders and a 170.2% surge in trading volume, driven by the introduction of popular trading pairs such as SOL/USDT , HYPE/USDT , and S/USDT . These listings matched user preferences and overall market trends, reinforcing MEXC’s position as a leader in both exchange performance and liquidity depth. Top Performing Pairs: SOL/USDT and ADA/USDT The campaign’s most active trading pairs included SOL/USDT together with DOGE/USDT , ADA/USDT , TRUMPOFFICIAL/USDT and SUI/USDT . SOL/USDT achieved the highest trading volume increase of 185.62%, comprising 19% of total futures trading volume and becoming the leading pair of the quarter. ADA/USDT showed outstanding growth through a 369.44% increase in trading volume accompanied by a 393.05% increase in daily average share, highlighting the effectiveness of zero fees in boosting interest for promising assets. Market Share Growth: Dominance in Key Trading Pairs In terms of market share growth, AIXBT/USDT led the rankings with a 331% increase, followed by DOGE/USDT (+283%) and SOL/USDT (+209%). Notably, DOGE/USDT and SOL/USDT achieved the highest market share in their categories on CoinMarketCap, at 30.5% and 30.3%, respectively. ADA/USDT followed with a 20.6% share, securing second place in its category, while HYPE/USDT posted a 165% increase in market share. AIXBT/USDT (+331%) DOGE/USDT (+283%) SOL/USDT (+209%) ADA/USDT (+186%) HYPE/USDT (+165%) A Breakthrough in Campaign Performance and Exchange Leadership During Q1 2025, the Zero Trading Fee Campaign established MEXC as a leading force behind market volume and activity for both well-known and up-and-coming tokens. MEXC achieved wider trader participation and increased liquidity by eliminating fees on popular trading pairs. The campaign’s success is attributed to precise timing, well-chosen trading pairs, and a clear, simplified fee structure — rather than external incentives or large-scale marketing. These results suggest that subtle adjustments to cost structures can have an outsized impact on user engagement and trading dynamics. MEXC continues to evaluate the results of the initiative and explore further opportunities to enhance user experience in the upcoming quarters.

The total crypto lending market stood at $36.5 billion at the end of 2024, including loans backed by crypto-collateralized stablecoins, according to the report. That's a steep decline from the $64.4 billion peak seen at the height of the 2021 bull run when borrowing against crypto soared amid a wave of speculative fervor. The downturn, fueled by the collapse of major lenders such as Celsius, BlockFi and Genesis, left a few large players to dominate the centralized finance (CeFi) sector of the lending space. According to the report, Tether boasts the largest market share, followed by Galaxy and Ledn. These three entities account for nearly 90% of the outstanding loans in the $11.2 billion CeFi loan book. Notably, CeFi loans are down 68% from the early 2022 peak of $34.8 billion. The real growth is playing out onchain, the report found. Decentralized lending protocols, which allow users to borrow crypto by locking up collateral operating around the clock and without relying on a centralized entity, have expanded rapidly. Since the market bottomed in late 2022, open DeFi borrowings have soared 959%, climbing from $1.8 billion to $19.1 billion across 20 applications and 12 blockchains, Galaxy said. ""Looking ahead, the cryptocurrency lending market appears poised for a new phase of growth, characterized by improved risk management frameworks, greater institutional participation, and clearer regulatory guidelines,"" Galaxy research analyst Zack Pokorny wrote. ""As the sector continues to mature, it may well serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the emerging digital asset ecosystem, facilitating broader adoption of cryptocurrency-based financial services,"" he added.

What powers the world isn’t raw crude—it’s the refined outputs: jet fuel, diesel, gasoline, heating oil. Each serves a different market, use case, and risk profile. Public companies that hold Bitcoin are now discovering something similar. Bitcoin, held on the balance sheet, is not just a passive reserve. It is a raw monetary resource—one that can be refined into multiple financial instruments designed to meet the specific needs of different market participants. From structured debt to yield-bearing assets to equity tied to Bitcoin appreciation, the treasury is no longer just a place to store value. It becomes a refinery , capable of producing diverse capital market outputs from a single, scarce input. This shift is subtle, but transformative. And it represents a new paradigm for capital formation, investor access, and corporate treasury strategy. From Idle Reserves to Active Refining Traditional treasury strategy has long centered around capital preservation. Corporations hold cash, short-term bonds, and liquid equivalents as a defensive buffer. While this conservatism may preserve optionality, it often erodes shareholder value in real terms—especially in inflationary or low-yield environments. Bitcoin changes the equation. Bitcoin is liquid, globally fungible, and transparently auditable. More importantly, it is programmable capital—a bearer asset with no counterparty risk and a fixed supply. When placed on the balance sheet, it enables new forms of financial expression. Just as oil companies refine crude into differentiated energy products, corporations can now refine their Bitcoin reserves into structured financial products that meet demand across the capital stack. This turns the treasury from a static safety net into a strategic source of capital access. Four Outputs of a Bitcoin Refinery When Bitcoin is the reserve, the treasury can produce refined outputs designed for different investment mandates, risk tolerances, and regulatory constraints. These outputs fall into four core categories: 1. Convertible Debt Instruments Bitcoin-backed convertibles offer exposure to BTC upside, often with capped downside. They appeal to institutional investors who want long-term optionality but are constrained from direct Bitcoin exposure. These structures can be calibrated for volatility, duration, and dilution profiles. 2. Yield-Bearing Instruments Corporations can structure instruments that generate predictable yield, collateralized by Bitcoin reserves. This opens access to fixed-income markets while retaining treasury flexibility. These are especially attractive to allocators seeking returns without navigating custody or BTC volatility. 3. BTC-Linked Equity When equity performance is visibly tied to the growth of BTC reserves, public shareholders gain a clear, directional thesis. Investors seeking asymmetric upside can participate via equity that tracks Bitcoin exposure, combining macro conviction with liquidity and governance. 4. Future BTC-Backed Income Streams Products like $MSTY and Bitwise’s new covered call ETFs are paving the way. These generate income from Bitcoin-linked equities—offering downside protection, monthly yield, and mandate-friendly exposure for pensions, insurers, and endowments. Each product is a refined output—a market-facing instrument designed to deliver value from the same underlying reserve. Serving Investors Who Can’t Hold Bitcoin—But Want Exposure A major, often overlooked dynamic in capital markets is the regulatory constraint on asset mandates. Large institutional allocators—pension funds, endowments, insurance companies—are often prohibited from directly owning Bitcoin due to internal policies or custodial limitations. Yet many of these same allocators seek indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s long-term upside. Refined bitcoin treasury products offer a bridge. They deliver tailored BTC exposure through familiar structures, removing the operational risk of custody. These instruments allow allocators to participate in the thesis—while remaining compliant with existing mandates. For the issuing company, this unlocks entirely new pools of capital and enhances investor reach without changing the underlying business. The Refinery Model Requires No Pivot in Core Business One of the most compelling aspects of this model is that it does not require a company to become something it’s not. The refinery model is complementary to existing operations. A company’s products, services, and business lines remain intact. What changes is how it manages and mobilizes its treasury. A Bitcoin treasury unlocks the balance sheet: New capital formation tools : Securities that were previously unavailable, now built on BTC collateral Broader investor reach : Including institutions that can’t hold BTC directly but can hold refined instruments Alternative valuation frameworks : Moving from traditional earnings per share to Bitcoin per share as an emerging metric of capital density Stronger capital markets narrative : A story that aligns with macro trends and investor conviction around scarcity This model also avoids pitfalls common in traditional treasury strategy—such as currency debasement, reliance on underperforming fiat reserves, or excessive dilution during capital raises. It delivers optionality without operational complexity. The result is not disruption—it’s a strategic upgrade.
