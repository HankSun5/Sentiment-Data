38730454,https://coingape.com/?p=232821,1736460186,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Ripple Labs Moves 300 Million XRP, What’s Happening?",https://coingape.com/ripple-labs-moves-300-million-xrp-whats-happening/,"American blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc. has transferred 300,000,000 XRP from one of its internal wallets to an anonymous one. Known for related transactions, the market is now left wondering what Ripple is up to with this new move. Ripple and XRP Transfer Consistency According to data insight from Whale Alert, the payments company transferred 300,000,000 units. This total XRP moved is valued at $682,584,540, implying that each coin was moved at an average price of $2.275. 300,000,000 #XRP (682,584,540 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet https://t.co/d5Vu4aasU6 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 9, 2025 According to the bithomp explorer , the Ripple address received a 300 million XRP inflow on New Year’s Day. This is likely the XRP Ripple Labs transferred, as spotted today. As reported earlier by Coingape, this latest transfer marks one of the high-profile transactions initiated since a major escrow fund movement earlier this month. At the time, the escrow movement and whale activity led to the XRP price jumping 15% . This shows why large Ripple transactions can impact XRP’s market sentiment. Meanwhile, the motive behind the latest transfer remains unknown. Still, this particular wallet has activated a series of addresses for Ripple, implying it is likely used for general-purpose transactions. The Push for XRP Utility Since its inception, XRP has occupied a pivotal position as a payments firm in Ripple Labs’ business. On its part, the company is helping to develop the coin’s ecosystem in different ways. Besides the liquidity control through the escrow releases, the firm is also developing the XRP Ledger. As a smart contract protocol, the XRPL has gained widespread adoption amid sustained upgrades from core developers. Recent rumors even suggested Bitstamp may be building an exchange on XRPL . In addition, the advent of the RLUSD stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum has further solidified the utility push for the coin. Beyond Retail Traders, the ETF Pursuit The broader crypto ecosystem expects a regulatory turnaround once President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. One of the major signs of this shift is the expectation for the approval of new crypto ETF products. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launched in 2024, top asset managers have filed for altcoin alternatives, expecting XRP ETF approval . If approved by the US SEC, this product will expose the coin to more whale-like transactions. Ultimately, this can impact the long-term growth prospect of XRP as an asset.

The category is still relatively small but saw a recent spike in volumes and total market capitalization. AI agents are trying to stand out with specific capabilities. Most early agents focused on personality, content, or entertainment. A few offered utility, by aggregating data or performing on-chain analysis. The most attractive feature of DeFAI would be the potential for personalized portfolio management and automated revenues. AI agents with trading capabilities are also shortened to DeFAI tokens. The collection is relatively small, with a total market capitalization still under $1B. However, the last few days saw the beginnings of more lively trading and a potential breakout for the sector. The DeFAI sector may follow the scenario of DeSci , a sector that grew its market capitalization by 500% within weeks. Only around 1% of DeFAI tokens have posted net gains, with most in various levels of correction. For those tokens, a reversal may boost a new selection of AI assets. For now, the sector remains subdued, as AI agent platforms are still the bigger and more liquid narrative. The appearance of DeFAI follows the saturation of the market by reply bots and an inflow of unwanted content. Trading or profit-maximizing agents aim to bring utility and real use cases to what otherwise looks like another meme market. DeFAI trend taps Solana, Base chains Despite Ethereum being the leading hub for DeFi, AI agents with trading capabilities have chosen Solana and Base. Those two chains offer smaller fees when testing out agentic behaviors. So far, there is no standard on how AI agents can interact and produce safe, verifiable actions with no human oversight. AI agents have only owned tokens, usually donated from other projects. Some DeFAI projects focus on building an abstraction layer to receive human instructions. The leaders in that space are also some of the top tokens, including GRIFFAIN, Hey Anon (ANON), and ORBIT (GRIFT). DeFAI tokens increased their volumes, signaling a potential breakout for a new category of assets. | Source: Coingecko Autonomous trading agents are just appearing, with the ambitious goal of tracking the market much faster than a human, and then implementing a trading strategy to achieve the prompt’s goals. Projects like Almanac are trying to find the tools to allow AI agents to access decentralized trading or other forms of DeFi. Can DeFAI outperform the market? In the early stages, all DeFAI tokens may be extremely volatile. The whole category followed Thursday’s market dip, erasing some of its valuations. The small number of tokens in that category is one of the factors for the low valuation. For the coming months, the category is expected to establish more influence and reach a higher valuation. AI agents as a whole peaked above $17B in total capitalization, later sinking to $13.4B. Tokens like GRIFFAIN and ANON have rallied previously, boosted by whale activity. Tokens like NEUR and QUAIN are also inviting early investments. The appearance of a new sector can bring more retail traders out of FOMO, expanding the category as a whole. The Griffain project has the most ambitious approach, starting with swaps based on natural language inputs. The agent may also be able to independently launch tokens on Pump.fun, with the potential to increase human-driven traffic. An AI trading agent may be able to perform actions such as identifying whale wallets, tracking social media, and noticing trends. ANON expands the potential actions with DeFi, including borrowing and staking. DeFAI agents may also be capable of participating as liquidity providers, managing pools and returns. All DeFi actions are potential tools for the agents, including bridging, staking, seeking out the best yield, and more. Some of the AI agent projects also branch out into the NFT market, unleashing faster analysis abilities. DeFAI projects also include a social media module for tracking trends and posting replies, data, or trades. AI agents may add to the bot-driven traffic on multiple chains. In general, automated trading is one of the key elements of Solana, where speed is essential. The question of agentic trading raises both technical and regulatory concerns.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides trusted and secure data to blockchains, and it is a popular solution in the Web3. This integration will improve scalability, reliability and security of applications that are developed on Aptos. Aptos Partners With Chainlink For Web3 Applications In its most recent blog post, Aptos revealed that it is now collaborating with Chainlink Data Feeds to further complement its blockchain community. This integration enables the Aptos developers to integrate reliable off-chain data in their dApps. To avoid the risk of a single point of failure, Chainlink’s infrastructure combines data from several premium sources. The integration will improve the credibility of the data required to design and build intricate applications. As a result, Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network will be utilized by Aptos to enable a secure and high throughput dApps environment. This will go a long way in helping to attend to the increasing needs of the Web3 ecosystem. Thodoris Karakostas, head of blockchain partnerships at Chainlink commented, “We are excited that Aptos has adopted the Chainlink standard. Chainlink Data Feeds will greatly enhance the reliability of applications built on the network, and we look forward to seeing the innovative ways developers leverage it.” It is worth noting that Aptos Labs co-founder and CEO, Mo Shaikh recently resigned , with co-founder Avery Ching taking over as CEO. Scalability and Security With Aptos’ Modular Architecture Aptos has positioned itself as a high-performance blockchain with a focus on scalability and security. Its use of the Move programming language and Block-STM engine allows for efficient execution of complex transactions. This modular architecture supports reduced latency, ensuring fast and seamless user experiences. With the addition of Chainlink Data Feeds, Aptos strengthens its ability to support enterprise-grade applications. Developers can now build decentralized solutions with enhanced security and scalability, addressing the evolving needs of blockchain users. Chainlink has become a trusted standard for delivering verifiable data to blockchains, supporting major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Its decentralized infrastructure eliminates manipulation risks by providing tamper-proof data through a network of reliable nodes. Chainlink’s technology plays a critical role in advancing Web3 by enabling real-time and accurate data delivery. Ripple Leverages Chainlink for RLUSD Stablecoin Notably, earlier this week, Ripple partnered with Chainlink to enhance its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin. Consequently, Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network now delivers secure price feeds for RLUSD on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s adoption underscores the growing importance of secure data delivery in blockchain-based finance. The collaboration will boost RLUSD adoption by ensuring real-time, accurate pricing data. This will actively bridge the gap between blockchain technology and traditional finance.

Whale Transfers $45.7 Million Worth of SOL to Binance On January 10, 2024, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale transferred a significant 246,064 SOL, worth $45.76 million, to Binance. 246,064 #SOL (45,761,912 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binance https://t.co/xYzdg5gB7Y — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 9, 2025 This data from Whale Alert indicates a potential sell-off and reflects investor sentiment, as they appear unwilling to go long or hold positions due to the continuous price decline over the past three days. According to the data, SOL has experienced a price drop of over 16% during this period and has now reached a crucial support level. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Following its significant price decline over the past three days, SOL has reached a crucial support level at $178, which aligns with the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. This level appears to be a make-or-break situation for SOL in the coming days. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, if SOL breaches this support level and closes a daily candle below the $175 mark, it could potentially decline by 11% to reach $156, or even lower if the bearish sentiment persists. Conversely, if sentiment shifts and SOL manages to hold above the $178 level, a similar upside rally to what was previously observed on the daily chart may occur. Increased Whale Activity and Exchange Outflows However, this bearish outlook has not impacted just one whale. In the past 24 hours, aside from this whale’s transaction, exchanges have witnessed an outflow of over $60 million worth of SOL. Combined with the $45.7 million transfer, this market sentiment has witnessed another dump of $60.7 million worth of SOL.

On Jan. 8, Mr Pichai questioned why Thailand should not embrace cryptocurrencies, which are being exchanged globally with strong demand, answered: “With growing demand and ongoing geopolitical issues worldwide, people are increasingly seeking alternatives to conventional currencies,” he said. Thailand to Embrace Crypto? However, “Thailand is not fully prepared for digital currency at the moment,” he said, adding that the country is “trying to create a platform to identify potential users and establish a market where they can exchange and engage.” He suggested allowing tourists to use local exchanges to make property purchases in Thailand, something that is currently not possible. “For example, if tourists come to Thailand, they could register their coins on a local platform that ensures verification or allows for know-your-customer protocols. When making purchases, they could pay using coins through an exchange house of their choice,” “Buyers and sellers would not know what kind of money they are receiving, but those coins would be transferred into the app and could then be converted into Baht via the clearing houses,” he added. Mr Pichai also confirmed that a crypto payments pilot would be launched in a controlled sandbox environment on the tourist island of Phuket later this year. He emphasized that the experiment would be conducted within existing legal frameworks. Barriers Remain However, some barriers remain since Thailand’s central bank remains vehemently against decentralized digital assets, having outlawed crypto payments in 2022. Additionally, foreigners visiting or residing in the country cannot access local payment platforms or crypto exchanges such as Binance Thailand because they cannot register without a citizen’s ID card. Moreover, the Thai government is currently in the process of implementing sweeping tax reforms that will impact all money coming into the country from overseas, which could hamper foreign investment. Finally, Thailand’s digital assets market is undergoing a transition from retail to a more institutional focus, said Binance Thailand CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul in October. At the time, the Thai SEC proposed rules that would allow institutional-grade mutual and private funds to invest in crypto products such as US spot crypto ETFs, but with limits on retail access.

The market for meme coins has been buzzing with activity, and some tokens have shown they’re more than just hype—they’re serious opportunities. With the crypto world on the edge of another bull run, everyone’s talking about the best new meme coins for significant returns in 2025.

Its unique, community-driven model ensures it’s more than just another meme coin—it’s a cultural phenomenon. 3. Memecoin (MEME): The OG Meme Economy Disruptor If there’s a coin that knows memes, it’s Memecoin (MEME). This project takes the meme economy seriously, transforming viral trends into tokenized opportunities. MEME has been on a roll, with consistent community engagement and impressive developments. At the heart of MEME is its governance model, where the Meme Council votes on major decisions. This ensures the coin evolves with its community, staying relevant in the ever-changing landscape of internet culture. Memecoin allows users to create, trade, and earn from viral memes, turning what’s often seen as internet fluff into serious gains. This gamified approach has brought fresh excitement to the space, attracting artists and meme creators alike. MEME makes the cut for its ability to blend cultural relevance with economic utility, cementing its spot as a cornerstone of the meme coin world. 4. Ponke (PONKE): The Innovator Behind PonkeSwap Ponke has been shaking things up with its recent innovations, including PonkeSwap, a decentralized exchange tailored for meme coins. By addressing liquidity issues that often plague smaller tokens, Ponke is building a robust ecosystem for traders. Ponke’s recent listing on Binance Futures has catapulted it into the spotlight, proving its staying power.

He has hit a decisive legal dead end. A UK High Court judge recently dismissed his attempt to sue Newport City Council for access to a landfill. Howells claimed a hard drive containing £600 million, equivalent to $739 million in Bitcoin, is buried there. The decision marks a dramatic setback in Howells’ years-long effort to reclaim the lost fortune. James Howells’ Costly Mistake In 2013, James Howells, an early Bitcoin adopter, unknowingly lost access to what could have been one of the most valuable digital wallets in the world. His ex-partner accidentally threw away the hard drive, which he believed contained over 7,500 Bitcoin units. Bitcoin was worth nothing back then, but its explosive rise in value has turned it into a multi-billion-dollar fortune. Determined to recover his lost fortune, James Howells has spent years appealing to Newport City Council. He believes the hard drive containing his appreciated BTC fortune is buried in a South Wales landfill. Despite his efforts, the council has repeatedly denied him access to search the site. Howell Faces Legal and Environmental Hurdles Newport City Council stood firm, arguing that the hard drive became its property upon entering the landfill. The Council also cited environmental regulations prohibiting the excavation of waste from the site, which holds over 1.4 million tonnes of waste. Howells mentioned that he had narrowed his search area to 100,000 tonnes. He even offered the council a share of the asset if recovered. At a December hearing, Howells’ team presented their case, but Judge Keyser KC found the legal arguments unconvincing. The judge ruled that the case lacked reasonable grounds and had no realistic prospect of success. A Lost Fortune, but a Gift to the Bitcoin Community Judge Keyser’s decision has ended Howells’ legal fight for now, and the Bitcoin fortune he hoped to recover is still lost. The hard drive, buried in a landfill, will likely never be found. Even though Howells’ efforts failed, the value of his lost Bitcoin shows how much cryptocurrency has grown. Digital assets are changing the world economy, and Fidelity predicts Bitcoin is poised to be part of national reserves by 2025 . This shows how crypto assets are becoming more important in traditional finance.

38731380,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=640628,1736462782,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38731380.jpeg,Polymarket under fire for California’s wildfire market betting,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-under-fire-californias-wildfir/,"Blockchain-based predictions platform Polymarket has been criticized for allowing users to bet on the Palisades wildfire in California. The wildfire, which has forced nearly 200,000 to evacuate, killed five people, and covered almost 30,000 acres, has become a subject of gambling on Polymarkets. A quick search on the platform shows that there are currently nine bets relating to the fire, all with varying interests. Two bets – “How many acres will Palisades wildfire burn by Friday?” and “Will Palisades wildfire spread to Santa Monica by Sunday?” have over $90,000 in volume each. Other bets on the subject also had volumes varying from $53,000 to as low as $8,000. Despite the clear interest in some quarters, many believe the bets are in bad taste and that an environmental disaster should not be turned into a gambling opportunity. Users on X questioned the reasoning behind such a bet, with one user describing it as immoral for anyone to bet on the spread of fire. Perhaps what is even generating criticism is that Polymarket seems to have no scruples about these bets. It has been posting about them on its social media pages, a move seen as more publicity for the bets. Some users also believe such bets could even incentivize someone to start a fire in Santa Monica and are calling for Polymarket to be banned. Writer and podcaster Tyler Harper noted that everything has been turned into a wager opportunity, which is evil and depraved. He posted: “The gamblification of everything is Evil in fullest sense of the word. Capital-E Evil.” Meanwhile, some users consider those gambling on the Wildfire markets to be sick, with one person noting it is a sign of addiction and such people should check into rehab. Polymarket defends wildfire markets Despite criticisms about creating bets based on natural disasters, the platform has insisted that the predictions serve those who want unbiased and accurate information. Each bet on the Palisades wildfire contains a note stating that the predictions market only harnesses market wisdom to create unbiased forecasts. The note reads: “The promise of prediction markets is to harness the wisdom of the crowd to create accurate, unbiased forecasts for the most important events impacting society. The devastating Pacific Palisades fire is one such event.” It added that users can get real-time and accurate information about such events from Polymarket in ways they cannot from traditional media. The platform noted that it does not charge any fees on the market. Although some, including business and tech reporter Thomas Maxwell, have called for Polymarket to be shut down, that is unlikely to happen as the platform does not even operate in the US. Politics, sports, and economics driving Polymarket volume Nevertheless, the predictions platform is not new to controversy. Since gaining popularity for correctly predicting the US presidential election in 2024, Polymarket has been at the center of a few controversies over market manipulation, with the FBI even raiding the home of its founder as part of an investigation. Its latest controversy occurred a few weeks ago after some bettors alleged market manipulation over a bet on whether Israel will invade Syria in 2024. The oracle provider for the bet, UMA, failed to settle the market in favor of those who picked YES, as UMA voters voted against the settlement on two occasions. This led many to claim that it’s the major UMA token holders, i.e., the UMA whales, who are delaying the resolution for their advantage. Meanwhile, Polymarket continued to thrive even after the election and has become one of the leading prediction platforms, with almost every issue open to wager in its markets. Although most of the wagers focus on sports events and political/economic news, users continue to bet on a wide range of topics. One bet about how many times Elon Musk would tweet within a week currently has $1 million in volume.

The subpoena, unsealed today, seeks “public customer information” tied to Polymarket, a blockchain-based prediction platform that has been gaining traction ahead of the November election. A screenshot of an email sent from Coinbase to specific users regarding the CFTC request was shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Eric Conner, founder of Ethereum information site ETHHub. The email advised users that Coinbase “may be required to submit information” to the CFTC due to upcoming regulatory procedures. Conner declined to comment on whether he personally uses Polymarket’s platform. A source confirmed that the CFTC subpoena is real and is linked to Polymarket, a platform that launched in 2020 and allows users to make predictions on the outcome of events ranging from sports to politics. Polymarket rose to fame with its predictions for Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. Related News: Experienced Analyst Says He Targets $ 10 For XRP, $ 7,000 For Ethereum - Here Are His Opinions This isn’t Polymarket’s first brush with regulators. The CFTC filed a sanctions lawsuit against the platform for failing to register its services in 2022. The case resulted in a $1.4 million fine, and the platform subsequently blocked US citizens from accessing its services. Polymarket scrutiny intensified after Trump’s victory, when the FBI raided the New York apartment of CEO Shayne Coplan. At the time, Polymarket spokespeople claimed the raid was “political retribution.” Bloomberg News later reported that the Justice Department was investigating. In response to the subpoena, Coinbase stated its commitment to protecting user data while complying with legal requirements. “Requests for information from a government are carefully reviewed by a team of trained experts,” a Coinbase spokesperson said. “In some cases, if a request is legally insufficient, the firm will object to producing information or attempt to narrow the request. However, in some cases, we may be required by law to share necessary data that is lawfully requested by a government.” *This is not investment advice.

The bearish sentiment has left many investors disheartened, with Ethereum struggling to reclaim higher price levels. Frustrated by the consistent underperformance, some investors are beginning to lose faith in the altcoin giant, seeking opportunities elsewhere. Related Reading: Expert Sets $1 Target For Dogecoin Once It Breaks A Multi-Year Trend – Details Despite the negative sentiment, top analyst Ali Martinez has shared an optimistic outlook for Ethereum. Martinez’s analysis suggests that a downswing to the $2,900 level could present a highly favorable “buy-the-dip” scenario for long-term investors. According to Martinez, this potential decline would lay the groundwork for Ethereum to target significantly higher levels, with a bullish price goal of $7,000 in the coming cycle. The current market conditions have sparked uncertainty, but many experts believe the upcoming months will prove pivotal for Ethereum. As the altcoin leader grapples with its recent declines, investors and traders alike are closely watching key support levels to assess whether ETH can rebound from this downturn. With Martinez’s bullish target on the horizon, could this dip pave the way for Ethereum’s next big rally? A Rocky Start in 2025: Optimism Remains Ethereum has faced a tough journey through 2024, with lackluster performance trailing behind Bitcoin’s dominance. The new year hasn’t offered much reprieve, as Ethereum started 2025 with additional declines, leaving many investors frustrated. While Bitcoin continues to command attention, fueling what some are dubbing a “Bitcoin cycle,” altcoins, including Ethereum, have struggled to gain momentum. However, not all hope is lost. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a more optimistic perspective on X, suggesting that Ethereum’s current price action might be setting the stage for significant future gains. Martinez’s analysis points to a potential downswing to $2,900 as a highly bullish opportunity for Ethereum. He emphasized that this level would represent an ideal “buy-the-dip” scenario, potentially setting the stage for Ethereum to target a remarkable $7,000 in the next cycle. According to Martinez, the ongoing bearish price suppression is a natural part of the market cycle. Once this phase ends, Ethereum could be primed for a substantial rally. However, for this bullish narrative to materialize, Ethereum must first reclaim key demand levels to reignite investor confidence and build momentum. Related Reading: Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point As Ethereum navigates these turbulent times, analysts and traders are keeping a close watch on critical support levels, waiting to see if this dip truly becomes a launchpad for Ethereum’s next major move. Ethereum Price Holds Key Support Amid Bearish Pressure Ethereum is trading at $3,300 after enduring a sharp sell-off that drove the price down to $3,206, creating a sense of fear and uncertainty in the market. Despite the aggressive downturn, Ethereum’s price action is showing resilience, setting a higher low on the daily time frame. This subtle shift in structure offers hope for a potential recovery, signaling that demand might be quietly building. For Ethereum to regain its bullish momentum, bulls need to reclaim the $3,900 level promptly. This critical zone acts as a gateway to reestablishing a strong upward trend and boosting market confidence. However, the path to recovery may take time as Ethereum stabilizes and recovers from its recent bearish phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown? While the market sentiment remains cautious, Ethereum’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests that a swift surge could follow if demand rises.

For now, patience is key as Ethereum navigates its way through this challenging phase, aiming to position itself for stronger price action in the weeks ahead.

Enthusiasts and investors are eyeing the market for coins with solid development plans and influential partnerships. This month, certain cryptocurrencies like BlockDAG (BDAG), Tron (TRX), Bittensor (TAO), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Cronos (CRO) are at the forefront, captivating the community with their potential and market appeal. This overview highlights why these most popular crypto coins are worth your attention, whether you’re a veteran in the investment arena or just beginning to explore the crypto space. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Decade’s Most Prominent Crypto Presale BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a significant player in the crypto arena, with a presale that has skyrocketed to over $177.5 million, selling more than 17.7 billion coins. With the current batch priced at $0.0248 nearly sold out, BlockDAG is clearly a frontrunner in the market. An attractive feature of BlockDAG is its Refer & Earn program, which rewards community members for referrals. Referrers receive a 6% instant cashback in USDT for each purchase made by their referrals, with potential increases to 10% based on further purchases within 24 hours. Buyers also get a 6% cashback per transaction, incentivizing participation in the community. With a minimum buy-in of $30, the platform ensures that rewards are easily accessible and stored directly in BEP-20 compatible wallets. BlockDAG’s impressive growth, combined with its innovative features and rewards program, makes it one of the most popular crypto coins in 2025. 2. Cronos (CRO): Connecting Conventional Finance & DeFi Cronos excels in linking traditional financial systems with decentralized technologies. Celebrated for its quick transactions and minimal fees, Cronos is increasingly preferred by developers and users. Its ecosystem, which includes diverse DeFi and non-fungible token (NFT) solutions, underscores its importance in these expanding fields. Even with an 11.78% drop in price to about $0.1409 recently, Cronos’ integration capabilities and adoption trajectory suggest it remains a compelling project in the evolving crypto landscape. 3. Tron (TRX): A Titan in Decentralized Finance Tron continues to solidify its position in the cryptocurrency market through significant strides in decentralized finance (DeFi) supported by its high-performance blockchain. Processing thousands of transactions per second, Tron is indispensable in the DeFi landscape. It distinguishes itself with efficient smart contract capabilities and lower transaction costs, trading at about $0.2545 currently, down slightly by 0.84% from last week. Despite this, Tron maintains strong investor interest due to its robust technical foundations. 4. Bittensor (TAO): Fusing AI with Blockchain Bittensor is making waves by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, establishing a decentralized network for machine learning. This platform incentivizes developers to create, share, and profit from AI models, fostering a decentralized marketplace. Collaborations with leading AI experts and tech companies bolster Bittensor’s growth prospects. Despite a recent 12.20% drop in price to approximately $440.56, Bittensor’s unique proposition in AI and blockchain integration remains appealing for forward-thinking investors. 5. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Speedy & Cost-Effective Transactions Known for its rapid and economical transaction capabilities, Bitcoin Cash is a favorite among businesses looking to enhance their payment processes. Its comparative advantage in speed and cost over Bitcoin ensures its continued use and relevance in various markets. Currently priced at $433.25, BCH has experienced a slight market adjustment with a 6.46% decrease in value last week, yet it continues to be a dependable choice for efficient digital transactions. A Recap of The Most Popular Crypto Coins to Watch The year 2025 presents a range of leading cryptocurrencies. Tron excels in DeFi, Bittensor pioneers decentralized AI, Bitcoin Cash is the choice for swift payments, and Cronos integrates traditional finance with DeFi innovations. Despite recent dips reflecting market volatility, BlockDAG leads with a groundbreaking presale achievement, amassing $177.5 million, a 2380% ROI, and unique features such as the Refer & Earn program. Its vibrant growth and robust community engagement position it as one of the most popular crypto coins in 2025.

Render, for instance, has risen by 32%, surpassing the $8 mark with its sights set on reaching $9 soon. A recent Filecoin update revealed a 12% increase following its successful listing on Bithumb, and a significant 200% boost in futures trading volume, indicating more possible growth if it surpasses certain levels. Among these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is creating its niche in decentralized eCommerce. By raising over $480K in presale and selling 138 million tokens, this project merges blockchain technology with a fresh vision for online shopping. As traders eye future gains, Web3 in eCommerce promises significant potential in the digital currency space. Render Price Analysis: Could Render Reach $9? Render price analysis is drawing focus as the RNDR value climbs over the $8 hurdle after a 32% increase in two weeks. This price point is both a psychological and technical challenge, as previous attempts to go beyond it often led to sales. Yet, confidence in Render’s potential is high, with 65% of its holders seeing profits and trading activity regaining momentum. On-chain data shows ongoing growth in active addresses and transactions, hinting at increasing network use and investor participation, crucial for continued price increases. While Render price analysis confirms a strong move above $8, traders remain watchful for the consistent buy-in required to reach and possibly exceed $9. Filecoin Update Draws Attention with Bithumb Listing and 12% Surge The latest Filecoin update has grabbed attention, as FIL saw a 12% uptick following its introduction on the South Korean exchange Bithumb. Its futures trading volume surged by 200%, signaling a growing trader interest. Presently valued at $6.06, FIL is approaching a crucial resistance at $6.95. Overcoming this could set the stage for a rise towards $8.50. This update also underlines important support levels, with $5.75 acting as a buffer for the coin’s positive trend. The wider market’s movements will likely influence outcomes, with FIL’s ability to sustain its momentum and break through upcoming barriers determining its path forward. Web3Bay Charts a New Course for Web3 in eCommerce Web3Bay (3BAY) is capturing attention as it transforms online shopping with a decentralized approach. Presently in its third presale phase, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $480K and sold 138 million coins. The price of its native token, 3BAY, stands at $0.0039675 in this ongoing stage, reflecting increased market confidence in its potential to innovate eCommerce through the integration of Web3 blockchain technology. The strategic roadmap of Web3Bay is well-defined, beginning with platform development and the execution of a 28-stage presale in Phase 1. Phase 2 is set to activate the marketplace, introduce cryptocurrency payments, and establish liquidity pools. The ambition extends into Phase 3, which will focus on expanding the ecosystem to include features such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and staking options for 3BAY holders. Looking ahead, Web3Bay’s objectives encompass the integration of an NFT marketplace, DeFi services, and cross-chain functionality, providing a wide array of opportunities for both traders and consumers. Its decentralized framework offers enhanced transparency, ownership, and security, effectively eliminating the reliance on traditional centralized platforms. As the Web3 eCommerce sector, Web3Bay stands poised to lead this shift, offering traders a valuable entry point through its competitive presale pricing and a visionary approach to redefining the standards of e-commerce with blockchain technology tailored to the needs of end users. Wrapping Up The cryptocurrency arena continues to unveil unique opportunities, from Render’s push towards $9 to the recent Filecoin update highlighting a 12% boost post-Bithumb listing.

Lummis",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/senate-banking-committee-to-launch-first/,"The U.S. is taking big steps to include cryptocurrency and financial technology in its official plans. Key leaders like Congressman Bryan Steil, who now heads the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, and Senator Tim Scott, are leading the Senate’s first crypto-focused subcommittee. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong supporter of Bitcoin, is also set to play a major role. These moves show the U.S. is serious about becoming a global leader in the digital economy while working on clear rules and encouraging innovation. The U.S. government has made efforts to fully implement cryptocurrency and financial technology in the official framework of the government. Crypto takes center stage in U.S. policy The latest examples include Congressman Bryan Steil, who has been selected as the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence. The scope of work includes digital assets, such as Bitcoin, new types of financial technology, and expanding use of artificial intelligence in the financial sector. Senator Tim Scott will be the first leader of a dedicated subcommittee to cryptocurrencies in the Senate, and Senator Cynthia Lummis, a bitcoin advocate, will lead the same. Congressman Andy Barr (KY-06) has been reappointed as Chairman of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee for the 119th Congress. He will oversee financial regulators to ensure balanced rules that support small businesses, expand consumer access to financial services, and promote economic growth. “I am honored to continue serving as Chairman of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee,” said Congressman Barr. “ His leadership focuses on transparency, credit access, and ensuring U.S. financial institutions thrive in a competitive global landscape. The Senate Banking Committee, led by Senator Tim Scott, is creating its first subcommittee focused on cryptocurrency. This is similar to the effort by Patrick McHenry in 2023 with the Financial Services Committee, showing how important crypto has become in U.S. policymaking. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong supporter of Bitcoin, has been picked to lead the subcommittee, though her role will need a final vote next week. The committee will also decide on other members at the same time, alongside the nomination hearing for Scott Turner, Trump’s pick for HUD secretary. Digital Asset Economy The U.S. is now approaching cryptocurrency. Two years ago, discussions surrounding crypto were negligible, and governmental interest was minimal to nothing except in very broken pieces of legislation. Now, it is reflected in official meetings, new subcommittees, and leadership appointments, signaling an effort to be taken seriously by making the U.S. a global leader in the digital asset space. This is a period when other countries are also considering frameworks for crypto governance, and it is imperative that the U.S. stays ahead of them. Under the guidance of the new SEC chair and with Senator Lummis, the United States is looking forward to creating an open regulatory space for Bitcoin and other digital assets. It protects the consumers, encourages innovation, and helps the country to maintain its place in the global arena in the monetary financial space. Regulation along with a reserve in Bitcoin will allow the United States to step up to the challenge of being the pioneer for the future of money. However, the public has been somewhat divided about this approach. Some consider it is long overdue and actually puts weight to including digital assets within the economy. It could improve innovation for many while ushering the way toward a possible trusting attitude in the industry.. Some, however, point to issues, such as market volatility, and even consider proposals like that of Lummis’s Bitcoin reserve. However, bottom line, these actions bring much-needed order and stability to the industry on the whole. As Trump’s inauguration approaching, his support for Bitcoin is still ruling the market. He has promised to create a national Bitcoin reserve, with proposals already in Congress and backing from states like Texas and Ohio. This could be a big step forward for crypto in the U.S. From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-09 23:09:33

The move suggests Moscow hopes to trade over BTC 1,000 for fiat. Per the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the Russian Treasury has “begun the transfer” of the funds. Moscow will initially sell off almost $10 million worth of BTC it seized from the former Russian Investigative Committee investigator Marat Tambiev, the news agency confirmed. Moscow Bitcoin Selloff: Will Russia Sell Entire BTC 1,032 Stash? Tambiev was found guilty of taking a bribe from the hacker group last year. Prosecutors found hundreds of Bitcoin tokens on his computer and storage devices. Marat Tambiev during his trial in Moscow Oblast last year. (Source: Vedemostvo/VK/Screenshot) The former investigator was found guilty of taking BTC 1,032.1 from the group and was jailed for 16 years. However, bailiffs’ efforts to liquidate the entire BTC 1,032.1 have been complicated by legal hurdles. Tambiev appears to have divided the coins into several smaller amounts. This means bailiffs will have to file separate court rulings to grant Moscow access to the coins.

They say Tambiev stored these coins on a Ledger Nano X hard crypto wallet . The news agency quoted “a source familiar with the case” as stating that prosecutors also want to sell off a further cache of Bitcoin “worth several million rubles.” They also hope to sell off “several real estate properties in the Moscow region” and a “Honda motorcycle,” the source claimed. A Russian victory in Ukraine would be far more expensive for the US than the military aid it now provides, the American Enterprise Institute argues in a new report https://t.co/sgOylwnmXD — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 9, 2025 Legal Challenges Prosecutors’ efforts to sell off the entire Bitcoin haul have been complicated by legal obstacles and suggestions that Tambiev may have passed some assets to family members. At the end of November 2024, the Prosecutor-General filed a case against Tambiev and his uncle Shagaban Kubanov. It demanded courts allow much of his property “to be sold” to “the state’s benefit.” The office launched a second case on December 20, 2024. In 2023, a court in Nikulinsky ordered bailiffs to seize a record total of BTC 1,032.1 from Tambiev’s computers and other hardware devices. Tambiev is now serving his sentence in a maximum security penal colony. He was also fined 500 million rubles (almost $5 million) and stripped of his rank of major. His former colleague Kristina Lyakhovenko was also found guilty of accepting a bribe. A court jailed Lyakhovenko for nine years.

A street in the Tverskoy District of Moscow. (Source: Elisa.rolle [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Prosecutors told the court last year that Tambiev extracted a series of Bitcoin bribes “from 2020 to 2022.” In exchange, Tambiev helped divert police investigations into the group. He also let the hackers hide crypto funds worth “14 billion rubles” ($137 million). In July last year, Marina Odintsova, the head of the Kirov branch of the Association of Lawyers of Russia, spoke of a sharp recent rise in “non-cash” bribery using crypto and other assets .

(COIN) is warning customers that a U.S. regulator is demanding information about interactions with prediction market firm Polymarket, according to a person familiar with the situation, and Coinbase has sent messages to customers saying the exchange may have to share that data. Copies of the emails shared with some customers have circulated on social-media sites , and those warnings about the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requests are accurate, the person said. The U.S. derivatives regulator has conducted a drawn-out legal battle with prediction markets firms, and this latest move comes just days before the leadership of the agency will flip from Democratic to Republican when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. ""When we receive requests for information from a government, each request is carefully reviewed by a team of trained experts using established procedures to determine its legal sufficiency,"" a Coinbase spokesperson said in an emailed statement, though the company declined to confirm receipt of the specific subpoena. ""Where necessary, we will seek to narrow requests that are overly broad or vague in order to provide a more appropriately tailored response, and in some cases we object to producing any information at all."" The CFTC lost an initial case against prediction market firm Kalshi when a U.S. federal judge ruled late last year that the agency couldn't bar the company from listing election contracts. However, the regulator quickly filed an appeal with a higher court, and Polymarket argued in that new legal clash that only Congress can halt election betting .

QUAN Unveils Web3-Based Payment Platform Quantum International (QUAN) is launching LootUpApp, a Web3-based payment platform designed to streamline cryptocurrency transactions for everyday use. Leveraging blockchain’s decentralized nature and AI capabilities, LootUpApp aims to make digital payments as intuitive as traditional systems. This innovative platform addresses common issues like wallet complexity and transaction errors, enhancing accessibility for newcomers and experienced users alike. By integrating AI, LootUpApp ensures secure, optimized transactions within a transparent Web3-based payment ecosystem. As the crypto market rebounds, Quantum International’s strategic focus on Web3 technology positions LootUpApp as a transformative tool, paving the way for broader blockchain adoption in the global financial space. Filecoin’s Bullish Trend Sparks Investor Optimism Filecoin is showing signs of a strong upward trajectory after breaking out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle, signaling the start of Filecoin’s bullish trend. Backed by a 204% surge in trading volume and rising open interest, FIL has gained significant attention from traders and investors alike. The sustained buying interest and accumulation at current price levels highlight confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Filecoin’s bullish trend aligns with technical indicators suggesting a midterm rally toward $30. Increasing accumulation and positive technical indicators strengthen the view that Filecoin’s bullish trend signals undervaluation, presenting an exciting opportunity for traders aiming to capitalize on its rally. Why Traders Are Betting Big on Web3Bay’s E-comm Platform in 2025 Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce with its decentralized model, blending Web3 blockchain technology with a future-forward ecosystem that offers unparalleled benefits to traders. As the backbone of this decentralized marketplace, the 3BAY token not only allows users to sell and buy digital assets with ease but also empowers them with governance rights and exclusive rewards. Its presale, which has already raised over $480,000 and sold over 138 million tokens, positions early adopters for a remarkable 6430% ROI at launch. Currently in presale Stage 3, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.1959. The platform ensures transparency and user ownership, alongside allowing users to sell and buy digital goods with minimal transaction costs. This makes its decentralized platform a powerful alternative to traditional marketplaces like Amazon. 3BAY tokens also provide exclusive access to discounts, loyalty rewards, and staking opportunities, driving both utility and long-term value. The buzz surrounding Web3Bay is undeniable, with its ecosystem set to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized e-commerce. As traders look for opportunities in 2025, 3BAY offers more than just an investment—it’s a gateway to a transformative Web3 e-commerce experience. This is the chance for traders to be part of a project reshaping digital trade. The Highlights The future of blockchain is unfolding through projects like Quantum International, Filecoin, and Web3Bay. While Filecoin’s bullish trend and a $30 coin forecast and Quantum’s LootUpApp demonstrate the transformative power of blockchain, Web3Bay is capturing the imagination of forward-thinking traders. Positioned as a leader in decentralized e-commerce, Web3Bay isn’t just an investment; it’s a movement reshaping how people sell & buy digital assets. Having raised $480,000 in its presale and sold over 138 million tokens, Web3Bay is capturing a lot of attention in the crypto community. Early adopters are already primed for a 6430% ROI upon launch, presenting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for traders. As momentum builds, waiting could mean missing out on the next big breakthrough in Web3 e-commerce.

This came as he revealed why BTC could still rally to as high as $200,000 in this market cycle. Bitcoin Price Set To Rally To $200,000 Despite Recent Crash In a TradingView post, TradingShot predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to $200,000 despite the recent market crash. The analyst noted that Bitcoin has started this new year with high volatility amid geopolitical and economic news input. He added that this year is the last year of this bull cycle. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board However, the recent Bitcoin price crash doesn’t mean that the flagship crypto is close to its market peak, as TradingShot remarked that the cycle top could start forming around November. He made this prediction based on historical trends, as the three previous tops have been either in November or December. The crypto analyst also noted that the last cycle top formed above the Pi Cycle Top and on the LGC Zone from the top. In line with this, TradingShot predicted that the Bitcoin price could be close to $200,000 even if BTC barely tests the bottom for the LGC 2nd Zone from the Top by November 2025. TradingShot added that, technically, the projected Peak Zone for the Bitcoin price should be between $180,000 and $200,000. He remarked that this range may still be below the Pi Cycle, so it looks to be a fair scenario. Standard Chartered also shared a similar prediction last year, stating that a rally to $200,000 by year-end 2025 is “achievable.” Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts described a $200,000 prediction by year-end as a “conservative” estimate. A Price Rebound Could Be On The Cards The Bitcoin price has suffered a terrible start to the year, dropping to as low as $93,000. However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared some positives that suggest a price rebound may be imminent. In an X post, the crypto analyst revealed that more than 22,000 BTC, worth $2.10 billion, were withdrawn from exchanges over the past week. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidations Cross $24 Million As Bulls Suffer Double-Digit Beat Down This presents a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price since heavy Whale accumulation typically precedes a price recovery. Meanwhile, Martinez mentioned that 63.92% of Binance traders are now going long since BTC dropped to as low as $93,000. These traders were previously shorting BTC when the flagship crypto was trading above $100,000. With these traders now going long, a rebound may be imminent. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,000, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The EU’s MiCA rules and the rise of USDC and RLUSD,https://crypto.news/usdt-losing-the-eus-mica-rules-and-rise-of-usdc-rlusd/,"Is the EU’s MiCA framework forcing investors to rethink their allegiance to Tether’s USDT and explore alternatives like Circle’s USDC and Ripple’s RLUSD? Table of Contents USDT under radar Competitors closing In: USDC and RLUSD’s strategic advances Ripple’s big Moment as RLUSD gains momentum in a changing era What to expect next? USDT under radar For years, Tether’s USDT (USDT) has been the go-to stablecoin for traders and investors. Yet, as we step into 2025, its dominance is starting to waver, particularly in the European Union, where mounting regulatory scrutiny and growing competition are challenging its unshakable reputation. The turning point came on December 30, 2024, with the full implementation of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. Designed to bring order to the unpredictable crypto market, MiCA has imposed stringent compliance requirements on stablecoin issuers, including a mandate for major players like Tether to hold 60% of their reserves in EU banks. As these regulations take effect, Tether is grappling with a wave of redemptions, new regulatory hurdles, and intensifying competition from rivals like Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) and Ripple’s RLUSD ( RLUSD ). In the past, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, raised concerns over the risks of “bank failures,” arguing that such requirements could expose stablecoin issuers to systemic vulnerabilities rather than reducing them. Just to correct the statement: we're still discussing with the regulator about our concerns that I expressed in our interview, that would pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in EU. Uninsured cash deposits are not a good idea. We should learn from what happened with… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖🍐 (@paoloardoino) April 11, 2024 But the market seems less concerned with Tether’s reasoning and more with its actions — or lack thereof. In the days leading up to MiCA’s implementation, nearly $4 billion worth of USDT was redeemed, marking the largest outflow since the 2022 crypto winter. Back then, scandals like the collapse of FTX and revelations of fraud across the industry sent shockwaves through crypto, shrinking USDT’s market cap from $83 billion in May to $65 billion by November — a 21% drop. The recent decline, while smaller, carries deeper implications. As of Jan. 9, Tether’s market cap stands at $137.5 billion, down from $141 billion just two weeks earlier. The question now is not just whether Tether can adapt but whether the market will wait for it to do so. With USDC cementing its regulatory foothold and RLUSD rapidly gaining momentum, could this be the beginning of a sharp decline for the world’s largest stablecoin? Let’s try to decode. Competitors closing In: USDC and RLUSD’s strategic advances Tether’s reluctance to comply with its strict reserve requirements has raised red flags among investors, while its competitors are thriving under the new framework. Even though EU member states have up to 18 months to fully enforce MiCA, the market isn’t waiting. Investors and exchanges are already repositioning, and USDT’s grip on the market appears to be slipping. For context, exchanges like Coinbase and OKX have already delisted USDT for European users, citing non-compliance with MiCA. Circle’s USDC stands out as a prime beneficiary of the regulatory shift. Having secured MiCA approval in mid-2024, USDC has positioned itself as the stablecoin of choice for exchanges looking to align with EU rules. Binance’s partnership with Circle, aimed at accelerating USDC adoption globally, is a direct response to growing demand for transparency and compliance. This move has already begun to pay off; USDC’s market cap has grown by $2 billion since securing the license. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD, launched on December 17, 2024, is also gaining traction as a regulatory-compliant alternative. Designed to operate seamlessly on the XRP Ledger ( XRP ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), RLUSD processed 33,953 transactions on the XRP Ledger and 1,690 on Ethereum during its testing phase alone. Ripple’s big Moment as RLUSD gains momentum in a changing era The year 2025 could be a turning point for Ripple, as a convergence of legal victories, strategic partnerships, and a crypto-friendly administration in the U.S. creates ideal conditions for expanding its foothold in the stablecoin market. With Donald Trump’s presidency expected to usher in crypto-friendly policies, Ripple may finally resolve its long-standing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, lifting a major obstacle to its growth. Already, Ripple has scored key wins in the SEC case, including reducing a potential $2 billion penalty to just $125 million. This resolution provides the company with the breathing room needed to refocus on innovation and the rollout of RLUSD. Monica Long, Ripple’s president, has hinted at ambitious plans for RLUSD, including imminent listings on major exchanges to broaden its reach and utility. “We are continuing to expand distribution and availability of Ripple dollars on other exchanges. So, I think you can expect to see more availability, more announcements coming soon,” Long shared in a recent Bloomberg interview. Ripple President Monica Long expects to see their new stablecoin RLUSD on more platforms ""imminently"" and says we will see an XRP ETF soon https://t.co/e4TuV4XPv3 pic.twitter.com/LhfIMNDDs9 — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) January 7, 2025 Ripple’s well-established payments business is also a crucial driver for RLUSD’s adoption. Over the past year, Ripple’s payment solutions have doubled their transaction volume, reflecting their value in facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. Stablecoins like RLUSD could enhance this ecosystem by offering businesses an efficient alternative to traditional banking systems. As Ripple expands RLUSD’s availability, businesses already relying on its payment solutions could likely adopt the stablecoin, further accelerating its growth. Beyond payments, partnership with Chainlink, a leader in blockchain oracles, could propel it into the decentralized finance space. Chainlink’s infrastructure, which has supported over $18 trillion in transaction value, positions RLUSD to integrate effectively with DeFi ecosystems, offering new opportunities for both traditional and DeFi users. The stablecoin market, now valued at $206.2 billion, continues to remain dominated by USDT, which holds 66% of the market share. What to expect next? USDT’s struggles have been years in the making, marked by its unmatched dominance but shadowed by persistent questions about transparency. While Tether has consistently maintained its peg to the U.S. dollar, its reluctance to provide full-scale audits and ongoing accusations of under-collateralization have fueled mistrust. Amid this, USDC has positioned itself as the “safe” alternative, building its reputation on monthly attestations and a compliance-first approach. Its recent approval under Europe’s MiCA regulations has further strengthened its foothold in the region. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD, though a newer entrant, is also gaining traction with Ripple’s strong payment infrastructure, rapid exchange listings, and seamless integration into DeFi markets. As MiCA sets a clear regulatory benchmark in the EU, the U.S. would soon follow suit. Signals from the Trump administration suggest an acceleration of crypto-friendly policies, likely pushing the U.S. toward an accountable regulatory framework. With these shifts, 2025 may mark the beginning of a power transition in the stablecoin market. While USDT remains the leader, for now, the momentum of its competitors signals that change is upcoming.

Over the past few years, they’ve gone from being quirky novelties to serious players in the market. Remember when Dogecoin took off? Or how everyone was scrambling to get a piece of Shiba Inu? Those who hopped on those trends made a killing, while others were left wondering what just happened. If you couldn’t grab the Pudgy Penguins opportunity, don’t sweat it. The next big thing is here, and it’s called BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin is primed to take the meme coin popularity to a whole new level. With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game launching on January 1, 2025, a robust referral program, and an eye-popping 90% APY on staking, this is not just another meme coin; it’s a full-fledged investment opportunity. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join today, BTFD Coin deserves your attention. The presale is already creating a buzz, and analysts are predicting some impressive price surges ahead. As of now, the BTFD presale started at a mere $0.000004 per coin and has surged to $0.000142 in Stage 13. With over $5.1 million raised and 63 billion BTFD coins sold, it’s clear that the momentum is building. Analysts are forecasting a listing price of around $0.0006 at the end of the presale. If you’re ready to dive into the world of meme coins, BTFD Coin could be your next big win. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is not just another token on the block; it’s an entire ecosystem designed with its community in mind. One of the standout features is its P2E game, which is set to launch on January 1, 2025. This game isn’t merely for entertainment; players can earn BTFD coins while they play. Imagine leveling up in a fun game and stacking up your coins at the same time. It’s a win-win situation, and it adds a whole new layer of utility to the coin. But that’s just scratching the surface. The staking rewards are where things get really exciting. With a staggering 90% APY available, staking your BTFD coins isn’t just a way to hold; it’s a smart investment strategy. Staking went live on December 2, and the buzz around it has been palpable. Who wouldn’t want to earn while they snooze? This kind of return is a game-changer in the meme coin landscape, and it’s attracting a lot of eyes. Let’s not overlook the referral program. This is designed to reward you for sharing the BTFD love. Every time you bring someone new into the fold, both you and your friend can earn rewards. It’s like building your own little community of Bulls—those are BTFD holders—where everyone gets a piece of the pie. This sense of camaraderie is invigorating and makes investing feel more personal and fun. Now, let’s talk numbers. If you decided to invest $30,000 when the price was at $0.000004, you’d end up with a jaw-dropping 7.5 billion $BTFD coins. If the analysts are right and the price reaches $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your initial investment could soar to a staggering $4.5 million! That’s the kind of potential that has people buzzing. With over 8,000 holders already on board, BTFD Coin is making waves and could be one of the best new meme coins to join today. Pudgy Penguins: A Look Back Now, let’s take a moment to appreciate the Pudgy Penguins phenomenon. Launched as a fun, whimsical NFT project, Pudgy Penguins quickly gained traction for its adorable designs and vibrant community. Those who snagged these cute critters early on saw their investments soar, turning them into some of the hottest digital collectibles around. The charm of Pudgy Penguins lies in their community-driven approach and the engaging narratives that surround them, making them an attractive investment for many. However, while Pudgy Penguins were flying high, the market has shifted. The NFT craze has cooled down a bit, and many investors are left wondering if they missed the boat. The question on everyone’s mind is: Can Pudgy Penguins maintain their momentum in a landscape that’s becoming increasingly competitive? While the project still has a dedicated following, newer options like BTFD Coin are emerging with exciting features that could outshine the classic meme project. Pudgy Penguins certainly created a lot of buzz, but the volatility in the NFT market is something to keep in mind. Many investors are now looking for alternatives that offer more than just cute designs. They want utility, community engagement, and, most importantly, the potential for growth. BTFD Coin, with its robust features like the P2E game and staking rewards, presents a compelling case for those searching for the best new meme coins to join today. Conclusion: Don’t Let the BTFD Coin Opportunity Slip Away In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, meme coins have carved out a unique niche that blends fun and potential profit. BTFD Coin is here to shake things up with its innovative P2E game, remarkable staking rewards, and an inviting referral program. It’s not just another meme; it’s a community-driven investment opportunity that’s hard to ignore.

Bitcoin Hasn’t Surpassed Last MVRV Pricing Band Yet In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about the extreme euphoria threshold of the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands. The MVRV Pricing Bands is a pricing model for the cryptocurrency that’s based on the MVRV Ratio. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $690 Million As Bitcoin, Ethereum Crash The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of how the value held by the Bitcoin investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value that they initially put in (the realized cap). When the metric is greater than 1, the investors are holding more value than their initial investment, meaning that they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the market as a whole is underwater. Historically, the holders being in too much profit has often signaled overheated conditions for Bitcoin, due to the fact that mass selloffs with the motive of profit-taking become probable in such conditions. Similarly, the dominance of loss has led to bottoms, as there aren’t many sellers left during these periods. The MVRV Pricing Bands aim to capture this relationship. It defines certain price levels for the cryptocurrency that correspond to important levels in the MVRV Ratio. Here is the chart for the model shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in these Bitcoin pricing bands over the last several years: From the graph, it’s visible that the 0.8 pricing band, which is where the MVRV Ratio assumes a value equal to 0.8, has been around where bear market bottoms have formed for the asset. Right now, BTC is far above this level, situated at $33,100. The coin’s price is also at a significant distance from the 1.0 level of $41,300, which corresponds to the cost basis of the average address or investor on the network. The pricing bands that BTC is currently trading under are the 2.4 and 3.2 levels, located at $99,300 and $132,400, respectively. The former of these has historically served as a signal that the bull market is getting heated. Related Reading: Less Than 1% Of Bitcoin Investors In Loss After BTC Reclaims $100,000 BTC can stay inside this zone for a while, but once the market cap surpasses the 3.2 level, it becomes very likely that some type of top is going to be hit soon. The chart below illustrates just how rare it is for the asset to trade in the region above 3.2: “BTC price has historically spent only ~5% of trading days above the 3.2 MVRV level,” notes the analytics firm. “This highlights how rare such peaks are and reinforces why it’s often considered an “extreme euphoria” zone.” So far, Bitcoin hasn’t been able to surpass this line in the current cycle. If the past bull markets are anything to go by, the top would only occur above this level, which would imply more room still left for the asset to run in the current cycle. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the pattern would actually hold this time or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $93,400, down more than 3% over the last seven days.

Yoshitaka Kitao, a proponent of the XRP ecosystem, said in a recent interview that Shigeru Ishiba is the “only one who is not convinced” about lowering rates to 20%. In politics — and politically embedded big business — you never know who is on what side. It might be safe to say they are all against you, pretending to be against one another. Perhaps that is why Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of the $7.6 billion-dollar financial services firm SBI Holdings, not only lambasted the country’s new prime minister about high crypto tax rates in a recent interview , but also threw pro-crypto leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki, under the bus, claiming he is manipulating the minority ruling party. Either way you slice it, Japan is in trouble when it comes to money and keeping up with the rapid innovations of cryptocurrency, and SBI’s Kitao directed strong words toward the government’s lead figurehead on the issue. SBI’s Kitao to prime minister: ‘The only one not convinced [about crypto] is you’ While Japan’s parasitic tax system currently wrings out individuals for up to 55% of their crypto gains (and even over 100% in cases where inheritance is factored in), The SBI CEO wants to implement a separate 20% taxation system for digital assets, similar to how stocks are taxed. Kitao pointed to the dire condition of the economy, telling the publication AERA: “The fundamental reason for the weak yen is the decline of national power.” He went on to cite rising food prices not keeping up with wages, and emphasized: “I’m really worried about Japanese politics.” When asked about the PM’s administration, Kitao stated that the ruling party is being manipulated by the likes of opposition party leader Tamaki and the DPP, and brought up Ishiba’s public antipathy toward crypto. “For example, when (Prime Minister) Ishiba is asked about his opinion on lowering the tax rate on crypto assets to 20%, the same as stocks, he says, ‘Will the people be convinced?'” Kitao prefaced, declaring boldly: “From my point of view, I would say that the only one not convinced, is you.” He then reminded the interviewer that Japan is the only country that taxes crypto gains at 55%. Kitao’s stance on XRP Yoshitaka Kitao has become an influential figure not only in Japanese finance in general, but also when it comes to the world of cryptocurrencies, thanks to his company’s involvement with Ripple and XRP. In May 2024, for example, SBI VC Trade, part of SBI Group, announced it had begun operation as a validator for the XRP ledger. The financial services giant also uses XRP to reward shareholders, and has just launched a collaboration with Solana Superteam Japan, to issue exclusive NFTs to users of SBI VC Trade’s Web3 Wallet.

However, market analysts have recently observed a shift in sentiment toward negativity, with discussions around DOGE showing that a higher percentage of the community is pessimistic about DOGE’s upside potential. While negative sentiment might seem like a bearish indicator, this analyst argues that this could actually be a positive development for the Dogecoin price. Historically, market downturns driven by fear and doubt have often set the stage for strong recoveries as weak hands exit and long-term investors accumulate at lower prices. Interestingly, this sentiment shift is also drawing attention to an AI altcoin, PCHAIN, the utility token of PropiChain. PropiChain is a blockchain-based, AI-powered real estate platform designed to revolutionize the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. According to expert analysts, the negative social sentiment on the Dogecoin price drives savvy investors to crypto assets like PCHAIN , with real-world utility. However, the negative social sentiment could also be a blessing in disguise for DOGE, but that will be a long shot since the Dogecoin price primarily thrives on community hype. The Social Sentiment Impact on the Dogecoin Price and PCHAIN Social sentiment analysis involves evaluating public opinion by gathering data from social media platforms, forums, and other online communities. In the context of the Dogecoin price, social sentiment can significantly influence market dynamics, as memecoins like DOGE are heavily swayed by public perception. According to technical and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez , the Dogecoin price-weighted social sentiment has turned negative. With a score of -0.60, the result indicates a prevailing pessimistic outlook among social media users. While the analyst suggests a contrarian investment strategy for the Dogecoin price, many top market analysts have a different opinion. Going against the prevailing market sentiment for a crypto asset with solid fundamentals and real-world utility is completely different from doing the same for a memecoin like DOGE. This is why whales and retail traders are flocking to PCHAIN, as the public perception of DOGE is negative. With solid fundamentals and a unique value proposition in the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market, investors see PCHAIN as the ideal asset for potentially massive gains in the 2025 bull run. PCHAIN and DOGE: Comparative Analysis Amid Negative Social Sentiment on the Dogecoin Price Looking at the Dogecoin price movement over the past 30 days, CoinGecko data reveals that DOGE has lost 15% of its market value. This further aligns with the negative social sentiment that saw the majority of the DOGE community say they don’t believe in its upside potential. The result is a big blow to the Dogecoin price as the memecoin relies heavily on hype rather than an intrinsic value proposition. This is completely the opposite of PCHAIN, which is backed by the number one asset class in the world. PCHAIN offers investors early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate. The token combines the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets. An Economic Times publication revealed that the real-world asset tokenization market is projected to grow to $16 trillion, and real estate is the largest market share contributor. Such market growth will undoubtedly drive up the value of PCHAIN, attracting savvy investors who are skeptical about the Dogecoin price movement. PropiChain: Redefining Real Estate Investment with Cutting-Edge Technologies PropiChain is the parent project behind the AI-driven altcoin PCHAIN. Designed as a blockchain-powered ecosystem, it integrates artificial intelligence, the Metaverse, smart contracts, and RWA tokenization to reshape the global real estate industry. Using AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots, PropiChain provides all-round support for real estate investors. Its predictive AI-driven market analysis tool delivers real-time insights and predictive trends, equipping investors with the data they need to make strategic, informed investment decisions. Through the Metaverse integration, PropiChain redefines property exploration with immersive 3D visualization. This eliminates the need for physical site visits, creating a borderless digital marketplace where buyers and sellers can seamlessly connect, negotiate, and finalize transactions globally. The platform automates essential processes such as lease agreements and renewals with its smart contract technology feature. Property owners gain greater autonomy over their investments by removing intermediaries like agents and brokers while significantly reducing transaction and management costs. PropiChain digitizes real estate assets through RWA tokenization, allowing fractional ownership in high-value properties. This innovation makes premium real estate more accessible, enabling investors with smaller capital to participate in high-yield opportunities previously reserved for the wealthy elite. Conclusion While the negative social sentiment on the Dogecoin price might present an opportunity for contrarian investors, it is also dicey. On the other hand, PCHAIN presents a great opportunity for early investors to have a share of the $600 trillion global real estate market. After raising over $1.3 million in its first presale round, this token has also crossed the $700,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This highlights the growing investor confidence in the profit potential of the project. Top analysts have revealed that a $1000 investment in the ongoing presale would yield over $253,430 in profit. At the end of this presale round, the token price will increase to $0.023 from the current $0.011. Join the presale now for optimal returns on your investment. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , reiterating the project’s readiness to take the crypto space by storm.

Explore TON & AVAX Prices Trends,https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-refer-earn-program-unlimited-usdt-cashbacks/,"The cryptocurrency market is evolving rapidly, with Toncoin (TON), Avalanche (AVAX), and BlockDAG (BDAG) at the forefront of this shift. Current forecasts for Toncoin price prediction indicate a potential climb to $16.65 this year, following a notable 140% increase in 2024. Meanwhile, AVAX price trends are also looking up, with projections suggesting a rise to $81 in 2025, fueled by robust DeFi and dApp engagement. Concurrently, BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn program is gaining traction, providing 6%-10% instant USDT cashback without limits to both referrers and buyers. A mere $30 purchase is enough to participate, making the offer accessible to a broader audience. This program has propelled BlockDAG’s presale to over $177.5 million, considerably broadening its user base. Let’s dive deeper into these developments and identify the next big crypto. AVAX Price Trends: Could Reach $81 by Year-End? Avalanche (AVAX) is poised for significant growth, potentially benefiting from the expected 2025 altcoin season. The network’s increasing use in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps) could propel its price. Current AVAX price trends suggest a possible peak at $81 by year-end 2025, assuming market conditions remain favorable. However, potential bearish corrections or restrictive regulations might lower its value to $44, with an average price possibly settling at $62. Projections also indicate that ongoing adoption, partnerships, and innovations might elevate AVAX’s value to $100 by 2026, despite potential economic downturns or market obstacles. The outlook for AVAX’s long-term growth remains positive. Toncoin Price Prediction: What Lies Ahead After a 140% Increase? Toncoin continues to capture interest following its substantial growth and support from major backers such as Pantera Capital. Currently trading at approximately $5.57, the latest Toncoin price prediction highlights a significant 140% rise in 2024, pushing it into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Looking ahead to 2025, the Toncoin price prediction reveals potential growth driven by broader blockchain uptake and ecosystem achievements, possibly reaching $16.65. Nevertheless, prices might fall to $7.26 in adverse market scenarios, averaging around $12.95. The forecast from 2026 to 2030 suggests continued growth for Toncoin, with potential prices reaching $22 in 2026. BlockDAG’s Unlimited USDT Cashback Program: Only $30 to Start! BlockDAG, a leading Layer-1 blockchain, is creating waves with its interesting referral program, which provides immediate USDT cashback rewards that are both rewarding and inclusive. Participants referring others can secure a starting cashback of 6% for each purchase made through their link, which can increase to 10% from the fifth purchase onwards within the same day. At the same time, buyers get a consistent 6% cashback on each transaction they complete. This cashback is instantly deposited into wallets that accept BEP-20 USDT tokens. This program encourages ongoing participation, thus enhancing the ecosystem’s growth. Importantly, both referrers and buyers gain from every transaction, fostering a continuous cycle of rewards and setting new benchmarks in crypto referral programs. The ease of entry is also a key feature, with only a $30 minimum purchase required, enabling broader participation and benefiting even smaller buyers. This approach makes the referral program a powerful tool for financial empowerment and broadens access to the crypto rewards system. The excitement around this referral initiative continues to elevate BlockDAG’s presale, positioning it as the next big crypto of 2025. So far, the platform has collected over $177.5 million in revenue from selling more than 17.7 billion coins, demonstrating solid community trust and buyer enthusiasm. Moreover, early participants in BDAG have seen an impressive 2380% ROI as the price per coin increased from $0.001 in the first batch to $0.0248 in the latest, batch 27. Seize the Potential of the Next Big Crypto Now! Avalanche and Toncoin remain compelling prospects, with AVAX price trends indicating a potential rise to $81 by year-end and Toncoin price prediction suggesting an ascent into double-digits, spurred by increased adoption and ecosystem developments. Simultaneously, BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn program is transforming how users interact with crypto, providing up to 10% instant USDT cashback for as little as a $30 purchase.

Cardano’s current price of $0.8577 signals the close of its downward trend, with future estimates suggesting a rise to $2.50 by 2025. Meanwhile, the XRP price surge has brought hope, climbing 10% in a day with the potential to reach $3.20 amid positive market sentiment. BlockDAG’s impressive $177.5 million in presale funds and its dual EVM-WASM support underscore its position as the top crypto to buy now. The anticipated Mainnet launch further strengthens BlockDAG’s sophisticated ecosystem, captivating both developers and traders. Cardano Price Update Reveals a New Price Target Cardano’s recent correction phase has stirred discussions about its next move, with ADA now trading at $0.8577 after a 40% drop from its peak following a 300% rally. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests that ADA is nearing a recovery, identifying the $0.74–$0.98 range as a strong entry zone for investors. Long-term projections remain bullish despite the pullback, with potential price targets of $2.50 to $3.00 by 2025. As the correction phase winds down, Cardano could be set for a fresh upward trend, driven by technical indicators and ongoing ecosystem advancements. XRP Price Surge: Market Eyes Potential Highs The recent 10% leap in XRP’s value to $2.31 has kept it in the spotlight, positioning it as a market leader with traders eyeing a potential peak near its highest-ever value of $3.84. Crypto analyst The Moon Show , posting on X, noted a symmetrical triangle pattern, hinting that XRP’s price might aim for $3.20 soon, driven by robust purchasing activity. This surge in XRP reflects a growing optimism and speculative interest among traders, potentially setting the stage for XRP to surpass the $3 mark by January. Market observers are keenly watching this upward trend. BlockDAG’s Developer Base Grows With ‘EVM and WASM’ Integration! BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM technologies promises to redefine its platform, positioning it as a prime choice for developers and traders. Its compatibility with EVM allows for smooth transitions of Ethereum-based decentralized apps (dApps) to BlockDAG, encouraging swift adoption and reducing technical challenges. This functionality attracts developers from the bustling Ethereum community to BlockDAG, while WASM integration opens new possibilities in gaming, artificial intelligence, and finance, offering exceptional adaptability and performance. These innovations lay a solid groundwork for ongoing growth. BlockDAG’s fundraising success, accumulating $177.5 million with 17.7 billion coins sold, underscores its market appeal, with BDAG coins currently at $0.0248 in batch 27. Early supporters have seen an ROI of 2380%, emphasizing strong market demand. Analysts foresee BDAG reaching $30 by 2030, bolstered by its advanced technology and community support. The anticipated 2025 Mainnet launch adds a sense of urgency for those looking for the best crypto to buy now, predicting a significant uptake in BlockDAG’s adoption and value increase. This strategic blend of technology and market strategy secures BlockDAG’s position as a noteworthy project. As it pioneers EVM and WASM integrations, BlockDAG is poised to transform blockchain applications and establish itself as a decentralized technology leader.

Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says an anonymous trader moved 427 billion Pepe tokens worth $8.5 million at the time of the transfer to US-based crypto exchange Kraken where the crypto trove could potentially be sold on the open market. Meanwhile, the whale continues to hold one trillion PEPE worth $18.4 million at the time, showing a profit of about $2 million. According to Lookonchain, the same trader just last month gained millions of dollars in profit by selling all his Pepe holdings during the initial stages of a December market correction. The sale came after the trader had accumulated more than one trillion Pepe tokens between March and September of 2024. The trader subsequently bought more than one trillion PEPE again in late December as the memecoin’s price stabilized. Said Lookonchain at the time, “This smart whale sold all his PEPE during the market drop on December 19th, making a total profit of $11.7 million on PEPE! Over the past six days, after the market decline, the whale accumulated 1.42 trillion PEPE ($24.5 million) again.” Source: Lookonchain/X Pepe is trading for $0.000018 at time of writing, down 4.2% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $7.5 billion, Pepe is the 29th-largest crypto project.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 01:16:28

While last year’s crypto headlines were dominated by Shiba Inu and SPX6900, 2025 has already ushered in a new wave of investment opportunities. The race to scoop up the best altcoins is on, with traders and investors setting their sights on projects with revolutionary utility and growth potential. From institutional investors to crypto rookies, everyone’s asking the same question: what are the top altcoins to buy this month? Enter Qubetics ($TICS), XRP, and Celestia—three altcoins offering game-changing solutions in the blockchain space. With Qubetics stealing the spotlight through its ongoing presale success, this article dives into what makes these tokens stand out and why they deserve a spot in your portfolio. But let’s zoom in on Qubetics first. This altcoin doesn’t just promise change; it delivers practical, real-world solutions that predecessors like XRP and Celestia have merely scratched the surface of. By tackling inefficiencies in asset tokenisation and digital finance, $TICS is setting the gold standard for blockchain innovation in 2025 and beyond. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Asset Tokenisation If you haven’t heard of Qubetics , you’re missing out. Currently in its 16th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 408 million tokens, raising an impressive $9.1 million from more than 13,800 holders. At just $0.0455 per token, the window to buy $TICS at a discount is closing fast, with prices set to surge by 10% over the weekend. So, what makes Qubetics worth your attention? At its core is the Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace—a groundbreaking feature that’s poised to redefine how businesses and individuals interact with blockchain technology. This platform allows users to tokenize physical assets like real estate, art, or commodities, making them easily tradable on the blockchain. Imagine a small business owner in Toronto tokenising a commercial property to secure funding or an artist in New York digitising their work for global sales—Qubetics makes these scenarios a seamless reality. Qubetics also boasts a strategic partnership with SWFT Blockchain, ensuring smooth and efficient cross-chain transactions. This collaboration enhances liquidity and accessibility, making $TICS a truly versatile asset. Whether you’re a real estate mogul or a solo entrepreneur, Qubetics simplifies complex financial processes, bringing blockchain tech to everyday life. But the presale isn’t just about early-bird pricing; it’s about entering a world of untapped potential. Analysts are already predicting a jaw-dropping 32,816% ROI for $TICS by the time of its mainnet launch. With $10-15 valuations on the horizon, Qubetics isn’t just an investment—it’s a movement. XRP: The Pioneer with Staying Power Next up is XRP, the OG of cross-border payments. For years, XRP has been a staple in the crypto world, thanks to its speed and efficiency. Unlike traditional payment systems that can take days to process international transactions, XRP completes them in mere seconds. It’s like upgrading from snail mail to email—you can’t go back. What’s keeping XRP relevant in 2025? Ripple’s relentless focus on partnerships and adoption. Major banks and financial institutions continue to integrate Ripple’s technology, making XRP a reliable choice for businesses looking to streamline global payments. Plus, its low transaction fees are a lifesaver for small businesses and freelancers who can’t afford to lose chunks of their income to fees. Celestia: Modular Blockchain Magic Last but not least, Celestia is shaking up blockchain architecture with its modular approach. While traditional blockchains like Ethereum bundle all functions together—from consensus to execution—Celestia unbundles them. It’s like building with LEGO blocks rather than pouring concrete. This modularity offers unparalleled flexibility and scalability, solving issues that have plagued blockchain networks for years. But why is Celestia on our radar for January 2025? Simple: its commitment to decentralisation and customisation. While other blockchains try to be a one-size-fits-all solution, Celestia embraces diversity. This approach makes it a favourite for niche projects and large-scale applications alike. For investors, Celestia represents the cutting edge of blockchain evolution. While it might not have the presale hype of Qubetics or the legacy of XRP, its disruptive potential makes it a worthy contender in any portfolio. The Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: The Game-Changer Tokenising real-world assets isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the future of finance. This concept allows individuals and businesses to convert tangible assets into digital tokens, enabling fractional ownership and effortless trading. Think about it: why should only billionaires own a Picasso or skyscraper? With asset tokenization , anyone can invest in a fraction of high-value assets, democratising wealth creation. Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is leading this charge. By simplifying asset tokenization, Qubetics bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. From small-scale farmers in Texas tokenizing crop yields to tech startups in Seattle issuing equity as tokens, the possibilities are endless. This isn’t just a tech upgrade; it’s a societal shift. For blockchain enthusiasts and sceptics alike, the marketplace highlights why blockchain is more than just crypto. It’s a tool for empowerment, transparency, and efficiency in a world desperate for smarter solutions. Conclusion: Invest in Tomorrow, Today January 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal moment in crypto history, with Qubetics, XRP, and Celestia leading the charge. Each project offers unique strengths, from Qubetics’ innovative asset tokenization to XRP’s payment solutions and Celestia’s modular flexibility. But if you’re looking for a token with the perfect blend of innovation, utility, and growth potential, $TICS is the one to watch. With the Qubetics presale in full swing and $ TICS poised for a 10% price hike this weekend, the time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to be part of a blockchain revolution that’s set to transform industries and redefine digital finance. Get your $TICS tokens today and secure your stake in the future.

Tron has earned its stripes by decentralising the entertainment and content industry, while Tezos stands out for its self-amending blockchain and governance model. However, Qubetics ($TICS) is taking centre stage, delivering next-level interoperability solutions that simplify how users and businesses interact across multiple blockchains. As of its 16th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 408 million tokens to more than 13,800 holders, raising an impressive $9.1 million. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.0455, this is your chance to invest in a project that’s solving blockchain’s most significant challenges and creating a unified ecosystem. In this article, we’ll dive deep into why Qubetics, Tron, and Tezos deserve a spot in your portfolio and why they’re the top cryptos to buy this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain with Seamless Interoperability Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s a bold vision for unifying the fragmented world of decentralised technologies. At the core of this mission is Qubetics’ interoperability feature, which makes it possible for different blockchains to communicate and share data effortlessly. Currently, blockchain users often face roadblocks when transferring assets or interacting with decentralised applications across different ecosystems. For instance, a trader might need to convert Ethereum-based tokens to Binance Smart Chain assets, often relying on third-party exchanges that can be slow, expensive, and vulnerable to security breaches. Qubetics eliminates these inefficiencies by enabling direct, secure, and cost-effective interactions between blockchains. Think about a freelance designer who’s paid in one cryptocurrency but wants to use another to invest in NFTs or trade on decentralised exchanges. With Qubetics, they can effortlessly bridge their tokens without leaving the platform. Businesses, too, gain from interoperability. A global retailer using blockchain for supply chain management can seamlessly integrate multiple systems, ensuring data flows smoothly between suppliers, warehouses, and customers. The platform’s partnership with SWFT Blockchain further enhances its cross-chain capabilities , allowing users to move assets quickly and securely across networks. But what truly sets Qubetics apart is its vision for the future. By addressing the pain points of interoperability, it’s creating a foundation for a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem, where users and developers can operate without limits. The presale success, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0455, reflects the growing confidence in its mission. Tron: Redefining Content and Entertainment on the Blockchain Tron has made a name for itself by disrupting the entertainment industry with its decentralised content-sharing platform. Founded by Justin Sun, Tron enables creators to connect directly with their audience, cutting out intermediaries and ensuring that artists and writers keep more of their earnings. At its core, Tron operates on a high-speed blockchain capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for content-heavy applications. Imagine a musician who wants to sell their album directly to fans without involving record labels or streaming platforms. Tron makes this possible, ensuring that artists receive fair compensation while fans enjoy lower prices. The platform also hosts a growing number of decentralised apps (dApps), particularly in gaming and DeFi. With its energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Tron has positioned itself as a sustainable alternative to older blockchain platforms. However, Tron’s focus on entertainment and content creation doesn’t address the broader challenges of interoperability—a problem that Qubetics tackles head-on. Even so, Tron remains one of the top cryptos to buy this weekend, especially for those interested in decentralised content ecosystems. Tezos: Leading the Way with Self-Amending Governance Tezos is a unique blockchain that prioritises governance and adaptability. Unlike most cryptocurrencies that rely on hard forks to upgrade, Tezos has a self-amending mechanism that allows stakeholders to vote on and implement changes directly within the network. This innovation reduces disruptions and ensures the platform evolves alongside its community’s needs. For example, imagine a DeFi protocol built on Tezos that needs a new feature to comply with regulatory changes. Instead of undergoing a risky hard fork, the Tezos community can vote on the update, ensuring a seamless transition that keeps the network running smoothly. Tezos also boasts energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus, making it an environmentally friendly choice for developers and users. The blockchain has found applications in tokenisation, DeFi, and NFTs, with several high-profile partnerships demonstrating its potential. While Tezos excels in governance and adaptability, it doesn’t directly address interoperability challenges like Qubetics does. Nonetheless, its innovative approach to blockchain evolution makes it one of the top cryptos to buy this weekend, particularly for those who value sustainability and user-centric design. Why Interoperability is the Future of Blockchain Interoperability is no longer just a buzzword; it’s a necessity for blockchain’s continued growth and adoption. As more blockchains emerge, each with its strengths and limitations, the ability to transfer assets and data seamlessly across networks becomes critical. Qubetics’ interoperability feature is a game-changer in this space. By enabling different blockchains to communicate without relying on centralised exchanges or bridging services, Qubetics simplifies user experiences and eliminates inefficiencies. Here’s how it works: The platform acts as a universal translator for blockchains, allowing them to share information and transfer value securely. This capability opens the door to countless possibilities. Developers can create dApps that tap into the strengths of multiple blockchains, such as combining Ethereum’s smart contracts with Solana’s high-speed transactions. Users, meanwhile, enjoy a smoother experience, whether they’re trading tokens or accessing services across different platforms. Interoperability is the key to creating a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem. By addressing this challenge, Qubetics is not just keeping up with the times—it’s setting the pace for what’s to come. Conclusion: Why Qubetics ($TICS) Leads the Top Cryptos to Buy This Weekend Qubetics, Tron, and Tezos each bring something unique to the crypto table. Tron is transforming content and entertainment, while Tezos is setting the standard for governance and sustainability. But Qubetics stands out with its focus on interoperability, solving a critical issue that affects everyone in the blockchain space. With over 408 million tokens sold and $9.1 million raised in its 16th presale stage, Qubetics is capturing the attention of savvy investors. At $0.0455 per token, it’s an exciting opportunity to be part of a project that’s building a connected blockchain future. If you’re looking for the top cryptos to buy this weekend , Qubetics deserves to be at the top of your list.

Solana trading volume remains robust, sustaining its strong presence in both spot and derivatives markets, even with minor fluctuations from prior peaks. Meanwhile, a significant Dogecoin whale transfer involving a hefty 466 million DOGE has ignited discussions regarding its impact on market trends and trading tactics. Adding excitement to the crypto market, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as one of the top cryptos to buy, following a $178 million presale and a limited-time $1M New Year’s Raffle that is drawing to a close in just 3 days. These developments demonstrate the interesting methods traders use to navigate the growing cryptocurrency market. Solana Trading Volume Demonstrates Stability Solana trading volume remains an essential indicator as the blockchain continues to be one of the top-performing networks. Recent figures show Solana reaching $112 billion in spot trading volume for December, a commendable achievement despite a slight decrease from November’s peak of $132.3 billion. This performance puts Solana’s trading volume ahead of many major industry rivals. In the derivatives market, Solana trading volume also remains solid at $34.1 billion, affirming its position as the second-largest blockchain for on-chain derivatives trading. While there are slight declines, Solana’s trading volume highlights the network’s persistent relevance to traders in Q1. Dogecoin Whale Transfer Fuels Market Conversation A noteworthy Dogecoin whale transfer of 466,890,148 DOGE, worth roughly $149 million, has prompted speculation about its market consequences. The transfer occurred between unidentified wallets and coincided with a 3.1% drop in price, setting Dogecoin’s rate at $0.3238. The Dogecoin whale transfer has led to mixed interpretations. Some analysts see it as a sign of institutional interest, possibly indicating intentions for long-term holdings that could reduce the circulating supply. Others consider the transfer as a precursor to potential sell-offs, which could exert downward pressure on DOGE’s value. Despite the short-term pessimistic view, Dogecoin’s whale transfer fits patterns that have historically led to price increases. Observers remain split on its significance, underscoring the challenges of deciphering such major movements. Countdown to BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle Finale BlockDAG’s $1M New Year’s Raffle is swiftly approaching its conclusion, presenting an exciting opportunity for participants to win big. The platform has already gathered over $178 million from its crypto presale, with 17.7 billion coins distributed. With the price per coin at $0.0248, early participants have seen a staggering 2,380% return, positioning BlockDAG as one of the top crypto to buy this season. The raffle includes a tiered ticket system catering to a variety of spending levels: Bronze Ticket ($250): Provides $250 in BDAG plus a 200% bonus, with potential winnings up to $250,000 USDT. Silver Ticket ($500): Grants $500 in BDAG along with the same bonus, offering a chance to win up to $500,000 USDT. Gold Ticket ($1000): Delivers $1000 in BDAG, improved winning odds, and the possibility to snag the grand prize of $1 million USDT. A minimum holding of $100 in BDAG is required for participation, setting a fair yet thoughtful threshold for entry. Winners will be announced on BlockDAG’s official platforms, maintaining transparency throughout the process. With the raffle nearing its end, traders are hurrying to secure their tickets and maximize their winning potential, ushering in an exhilarating start to the new year for BDAG holders. Final Say As the first quarter of the year unfolds, the cryptocurrency domain continues to offer diverse possibilities for traders.

In this ever-growing ecosystem, standout projects continue to push boundaries and offer practical applications that shape the future. This list explores the top 4 blockchain innovations that highlight the diverse potential of this technology. Featuring Web3Bay, Chainlink, IoTeX, and Hedera, these projects showcase unique advancements that cater to a wide range of industries and needs. 1. Web3Bay: Gateway to High ROI & Decentralised Shopping Experience Web3Bay ’s decentralized e-commerce platform is one of the top 4 blockchain innovations right now in the market. This new project offers an e-commerce platform that leverages blockchain to offer security, transparency, and decentralization. Designed to cater to the modern shopper, it allows users to purchase a wide range of items, including luxury goods, game cards, sneakers, and more, all while maintaining control over their data. Shoppers also get a 20% discount on every purchase on the Web3Bay platform, further enhancing the platform’s appeal as a cost-effective and future-forward solution. By incorporating cryptocurrency payments and integrating mainstream options like PayPal, Web3Bay bridges the gap between traditional online shopping and the next era of e-commerce. The presale of its 3BAY tokens is already generating impressive excitement. Web3Bay has already raised over $480,000 and sold over 138 million tokens. Plus, early adopters are set to gain a 6430% ROI when the token launches post-launch. These figures reflect the growing confidence in the platform’s potential to become a leading player in the e-commerce space. As the presale progresses, the opportunity to join this project at a $0.0039675 price tag won’t last long. Web3Bay’s commitment to redefining e-commerce positions it as an essential investment for those looking to support cutting-edge solutions. With its ability to combine blockchain security, mainstream payment methods, and exclusive shopping benefits, Web3Bay is set to reshape the way users interact with online markets. 2. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchain & Real-World Data Chainlink has established itself as one of the top 4 blockchain innovations and a cornerstone of the blockchain oracle ecosystem, seamlessly linking decentralized networks with real-world data. Its reliable data feeds support key decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, securing over $41 billion in total value across various networks. However, Chainlink has faced challenges, including a noticeable drop in its token price, which fell by 16.52% over the past month, reaching $20.76. While this decline reflects market volatility, Chainlink’s consistent efforts to expand its use cases and maintain its leadership position in oracles suggest its long-term relevance remains strong. 3. IoTeX: Building Bridges Between Blockchain & IoT IoTeX stands at the forefront of connecting blockchain with the Internet of Things (IoT), providing a platform that supports over 50 Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) projects. By enabling decentralized solutions for infrastructure management and cloud services, IoTeX continues to integrate real-world applications with blockchain technology. Despite its technological progress, IoTeX has encountered recent price volatility, with its token value falling by 31.41% in the last month to $0.03725. While this reflects broader market trends, IoTeX’s involvement in regulatory discussions through its membership in the Blockchain Association underscores its commitment to shaping the future of blockchain IoT integration. 4. Hedera: Redefining Blockchain Performance Hedera has become one of the top 4 blockchain innovations in the market due to its advanced hash graph consensus mechanism that delivers an impressive throughput of over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). Its unique architecture, featuring asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) and a leaderless design, ensures a secure and efficient environment for enterprise use cases. The recent launch of Hedera’s Asset Tokenization Studio introduces a comprehensive solution for managing tokenized assets on-chain. Despite a 9.85% drop in its token price over the past month to $0.2779, Hedera continues to focus on enterprise adoption and advancing blockchain technology for real-world applications. Which of These Top 4 Blockchain Innovations Lead? The blockchain ecosystem is filled with top blockchain innovations succeeding in different domains. Chainlink continues to lead the way in connecting blockchain networks with real-world data. IoTeX is breaking new ground by merging blockchain with the IoT. Hedera offers unparalleled transaction speeds and innovative tools for enterprise blockchain applications. However, among these, Web3Bay stands out as a game-changer in e-commerce with its decentralized platform, secure blockchain foundation, and integration of both cryptocurrency and mainstream payment options. The platform’s impressive presale performance highlights the confidence it has garnered from early adopters.

The rally, which many investors hoped would solidify Bitcoin’s bullish structure, quickly reversed, driving the price down to a low of $92,500. The sudden downturn has rattled market sentiment, leaving investors cautious about the immediate direction of the crypto market leader. Related Reading: Expert Sets $1 Target For Dogecoin Once It Breaks A Multi-Year Trend – Details Top analyst Axel Adler has shared crucial data on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s nearest support levels. According to Adler, the key levels to watch are between $86.8K and $89.7K, representing the short-term holders’ realized price. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin is approaching a significant demand zone, where accumulation might take place if the selling pressure eases. As Bitcoin consolidates near these levels, the market waits for signs of stabilization. Whether Bitcoin can recover from this setback or extend its correction remains uncertain. However, the current support levels could serve as a turning point, offering a foundation for bulls to regain momentum. Bitcoin Consolidates Between Key Levels Bitcoin is navigating a critical consolidation phase, with the price fluctuating between $100K and $92K. While there have been brief deviations above the $100K mark, the market leader has struggled to maintain momentum, raising concerns about a potential drop to lower demand zones. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring this range, with expectations of Bitcoin finding stronger footing below the $90K area. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, shedding light on Bitcoin’s nearest support levels. According to Adler, the Short-Term Holders 1M-3M Realized Price is currently $89.7K, while the broader Short-Term Holders Realized Price sits at $86.8K. These levels represent key demand zones that could provide Bitcoin with the fuel needed for its next rally. A dip into these areas would likely attract buyers, setting the stage for a potential reversal.

While the broader market sentiment remains cautious, a drop into these lower support zones could offer a significant accumulation opportunity for long-term investors. The coming days will be crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin can stabilize and prepare for a renewed bullish push. BTC Faces Critical Support Test Below $95,000 Bitcoin is trading at $93,400, navigating a precarious position as it faces increasing risk with each moment spent below the $95,000 mark. After a brief surge above $100K earlier this month, the bulls lost control, failing to sustain support above this psychological level. This decline has left Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside, with investors closely watching key support levels. For bulls to regain momentum, reclaiming the $95K level is crucial. Beyond this, the $98K mark must also be retaken to confirm a bullish consolidation and signal strength in the market. Until then, uncertainty looms, with Bitcoin’s current range reflecting a lack of decisive control by either side.

However, losing this level would expose Bitcoin to lower demand zones around $85K, a key area that could attract buyers and stabilize the price.

BNB & AVAX Insights,https://nulltx.com/bdags-evm-wasm-drive-bdag-to-1-aim-bnb-avax-insights/,"Explore Latest BNB & AVAX Price Predictions – BlockDAG’s Dual Power with EVM & WASM Propels BDAG to $1 Goal! Price projections for major assets are catching the attention of traders and analysts. The BNB price forecast displays a hopeful tone, with potential to reach $750 resistance while keeping support beyond $680. Simultaneously, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction offers a varied view for 2025, straddling hopeful advancements and possible regulatory challenges. These views mirror the wider market dynamics of risks and prospects. Meanwhile, the combined efforts of EVM and WASM are pushing BlockDAG (BDAG) ahead as a standout venture among top crypto coins for 2025. BlockDAG’s impressive crypto presale, amassing over $178 million, along with robust ecosystem growth, highlights its interesting aspects and strong potential for adoption. This positions BDAG as an attractive option for forward-looking traders. BNB Price Forecast Stays Optimistic Despite Hurdles The BNB price forecast shows hopeful prospects, with the cryptocurrency now trading at $708. Analysts predict a positive trend could elevate BNB to $750 or even $800, assuming it remains above the 21-day SMA. Nonetheless, the $750 resistance level has been a notable obstacle, limiting upward progress. If downward pressure increases, the BNB price forecast suggests a potential drop to $635 or less, if downward momentum breaks the support. Recent technical signals show prices fluctuating between $680 and $720, restricted by moving average lines. The BNB price forecast highlights the need for a clear breakout to set its future course as the market awaits further developments. Avalanche Price Prediction Indicates Possible Growth The Avalanche price prediction portrays a diverse outlook for 2025, with analysts pointing out factors that could shape its path. Projections vary from $50 to $150, influenced by market dynamics and the adoption of the Avalanche network. Positive movements in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could significantly elevate AVAX’s value. The Avalanche price prediction also stresses the importance of network scalability and compatibility. As more dApps and users join the platform, its value could increase. Analysts remain watchful, recognizing competition from other blockchain platforms and regulatory uncertainties as potential hurdles. Whether the future leans towards optimism or caution, Avalanche continues to be a critical asset to monitor. Driving BDAG’s Ascent: BlockDAG’s EVM & WASM Technologies BlockDAG is capturing attention with its dual technologies, EVM compatibility and WASM integration, paving the way for potential price increases for BDAG. These technological integrations facilitate the easy migration of Ethereum-based dApps and expand the developer base by supporting multiple programming languages, including Rust and C++. This positions BlockDAG as a formidable contender among top crypto coins for 2025. With a current price of $0.0248, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has garnered $178 million, selling 17.7 billion BDAG coins since its inception. Early supporters have enjoyed an ROI of 2,380%, highlighting its growing appeal. The EVM allows Ethereum developers a smooth transition, and WASM enhances performance and scalability for demanding uses like gaming and DeFi. BlockDAG’s comprehensive roadmap underscores BDAG’s potential for a substantial increase—particularly after its launch. Analysts predict a possible $1 price in 2025, indicative of the strength of its technological and ecosystem development. As the ongoing presale’s batch 27 approaches completion, traders are encouraged to participate soon. BlockDAG’s EVM and WASM compatibility is attracting developers and purchasers alike, making BDAG a top crypto to consider. Analysts anticipate considerable returns for early participants as the project advances towards its $600 million funding target. Key Trends in Top Crypto Coins! Binance Coin (BNB) price forecast shows hopeful expectations, focusing on overcoming resistance levels to foster growth. In contrast, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction presents a balanced view, weighing promising network adoption against challenges like competition and regulatory uncertainties. BlockDAG emerges prominently with its community-driven approach, burgeoning ecosystem, and clear trajectory toward a $1 valuation. BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM technologies solidifies its status as a project poised for remarkable growth, delivering functionality and scalability that meet market demands. These elements combine to offer a compelling opportunity for proactive crypto traders.

Trump Rally (TRUMPRAL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Rally by entering its contract address – 9sawQZwuqdxzgtn2ZhD1eeRit425XtaXfdn57RJY6bcM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 02:19:00

Nevermined, a decentralized AI payment infrastructure provider, has secured $4 million in early investment to enhance AI-to-AI transaction capabilities. Generative Ventures led the funding round, which also included Polymorphic Capital, Halo Capital, and Arca. Today, we're thrilled to announce Nevermined's $4MM seed round led by @genventurecap along with @polymorphiccap , @halo__xyz , @arca , & more. https://t.co/HPLn55a5sp — Nevermined (@Nevermined_io) January 9, 2025 Self-proclaimed as the “PayPal for AI Commerce,” Nevermined aims to create a financial system designed for self-governing AI agents . AI agents are self-governing software programs created to carry out certain activities, frequently on behalf of humans or other systems. These agents use artificial intelligence to react dynamically to their surroundings by negotiating, making decisions, and acting on their own. They are being used more and more in industries including banking, healthcare, logistics, and e-commerce to manage processes, streamline operations, and complete transactions. You might also like: Crypto VC funding set to surge: PitchBook predicts $18b in venture capital for 2025 However, the shortcomings of human-centric payment systems have been made clear by the emergence of these agents. Because AI interactions are dynamic, high-frequency, and autonomous, current financial infrastructures are not prepared to handle them. To overcome these obstacles, Nevermined’s protocol allows AI agents to price, negotiate, and settle payments on their own. This invention opens the door to a time when billions of transactions powered by AI may happen without any human involvement. The company plans to use the new funding to develop features such as Multi-Agent Payments (MAP) and a dynamic pricing engine for AI services. These MAP tools are expected to enhance the platform’s ability to manage dynamic AI interactions, promoting a decentralized and open infrastructure for the emerging AI economy. The development of Nevermined’s protocol reflects the growing focus on creating infrastructures that facilitate autonomous economic transactions between AI agents . By combining AI and blockchain technologies, the initiative leverages blockchain’s transparency and trust mechanisms to address the unique requirements of AI-driven interactions. The funding round, led by Generative Ventures with contributions from other notable investors, highlights the increasing demand for scalable and efficient solutions in the evolving landscape of AI-driven commerce. As artificial intelligence continues to expand its capabilities, the need for payment systems tailored to autonomous agents is becoming more pronounced. Nevermined’s work represents a step toward building decentralized payment systems designed to accommodate AI agents operating independently. These systems aim to address existing gaps in traditional infrastructures, supporting the anticipated growth of AI-based economic activity across various industries.

This initiative comes amid increased government attention on digital assets, including the recent sale of $6.7 billion in Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road case by the U.S. Department of Justice. The move is seen as part of broader efforts to provide regulatory clarity for the rapidly growing cryptocurrency industry. According to a report shared by FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, Senator Cynthia Lummis has been tentatively selected to chair the subcommittee. Senate Banking Committee Pushes for Dedicated Crypto Subcommittee The new cryptocurrency subcommittee is similar to the one established in the House Financial Services Committee in 2023 by Patrick McHenry. The decision made by the Senate Banking Committee is in line with the efforts made by both parties to fill the gaps in the regulation of cryptocurrencies, which has been a concern within the digital asset industry. A Senate aide stated that a vote to formalize Senator Lummis as chair with new Republican and Democrat members will most probably take place next Thursday. This vote is to occur before another confirmation hearing for Scott Turner, the person chosen by President-elect Donald Trump for the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. NEW: The Senate Banking Committee, led by @SenatorTimScott , is set to establish its first ever subcommittee dedicated to #crypto . The subcommittee will mirror the @FinancialCmte version established by @PatrickMcHenry in 2023. A Senate aide confirmed that @SenLummis has been… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 9, 2025 Senator Lummis has been one of the biggest proponents of the growth of digital assets and blockchain technologies. Her leadership in the subcommittee may be able to help bring more attention to addressing industry issues, for example the uncertainty of regulation that has led some companies to shift operations overseas. Industry Seeks Clearer Regulations Amid Government Action Senator Lummis has been one of the biggest proponents of the growth of digital assets and blockchain technologies. Her leadership in the subcommittee may be able to help bring more attention to addressing industry issues, for example the uncertainty of regulation that has led some companies to shift operations overseas. The formation of the Senate’s crypto subcommittee is likely to make the process of enacting coherent and comprehensible legislation even easier. This follows other actions by the government in the crypto sphere such as the sale of Bitcoin that was seized from Silk Road. The DOJ’s auctioning off of $6.7 billion worth of Bitcoin not only represented a significant enforcement action, but also highlighted the government’s increasing presence within the asset class. As the change of government admin looms, the cryptocurrency industry is also putting pressure on the incoming President of the United States, Donald Trump, to support friendlier policies. Moreover, sources indicate that industry leaders have called for formation of a US Bitcoin reserve and executive orders to foster advancement of the blockchain technology. Expectations for Senator Lummis’s Leadership If approved as chair, Senator Cynthia Lummis will have a pivotal influence on setting up the new course for the U.S. cryptocurrency policies. Lummis has long been a proponent of digital assets, often campaigning for their acceptance into the US financial system. This comes amidst appointments by the Trump administration to replace important regulatory heads such as SEC Chair Gary Gensler with others that are more liberal in the cryptocurrency space. There has also been a suggestion of a new White House position called the “Crypto Czar” within the transition team’s plans. The creation of the Senate’s cryptocurrency subcommittee has been seen as a significant move to help combat the problems facing the sector. This is anticipated to help promote discussions between the government and businesses to support growth and coordination on regulations. The vote to set the final list of the members of the subcommittee will be held on Thursday.

For the breakout to be confirmed, XRP needs to break above the $2.51 level. This level is an important first indication that the low is likely in and the market could begin to move higher. Although there was a rally yesterday, the price failed to exceed this key resistance level, meaning the breakout is not yet fully confirmed. The $2.72 level is even more critical. If XRP surpasses this level, it would mean a full breakout from the triangle pattern, signaling a potential bullish move. Understanding the Difference Between Indication and Confirmation It’s important to differentiate between indication and confirmation. If XRP moves higher but fails to break above the high of $2.72, it could be an extension of the triangle rather than the completion of the pattern. Breaking above the high is crucial for confirming that the triangle pattern is complete and that the price is ready to move in a new direction. However, until we see this level broken, there is still a possibility the triangle could extend. Critical Support: $1.96 Level Another important level to watch is $1.96, which serves as a key support area. If XRP falls below this level, the triangle pattern would be invalidated, and the market could enter a larger bearish structure. This level remains a critical point for the bullish thesis to hold. Patience is Key These consolidations are often slow and boring, which is the case with XRP right now. However, patience is required during this phase. As long as XRP stays above the support levels between $2.24 and $2.23, the market could still focus on higher price action.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 02:59:49

Lightchain AI , which is currently priced at $0.004875, is being compared to Cardano’s success in 2021, with many predicting it could experience similar explosive growth in the coming years. This combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence is drawing the attention of early investors, as they see the potential for massive gains once Lightchain AI is fully launched. With its presale deadline fast approaching, investors are flocking to seize the opportunity before the price increase. Why Lightchain AI’s Presale Is Generating Massive Attention The growing momentum behind Lightchain AI’s presale is a clear indicator of the excitement surrounding its technology and future prospects. As Lightchain AI combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, it offers a unique solution for businesses and developers seeking secure, scalable AI applications. Unlike typical blockchain-only projects, Lightchain AI integrates AI-driven capabilities to address real-world challenges, making it more appealing to investors looking for a project with sustainable long-term growth. The presale’s success, with $8.5 million raised, reflects the confidence investors have in the project, and the impending price increase is fueling the rush to secure tokens at the current price. Lightchain AI Compared to Cardano’s 2021 Success Cardano’s quick rise in 2021 gave investors big gains and now, Lightchain AI is compared to a Cardano for its chance to copy s͏uch success. Cardano has a strong group of supporters and new tech that helped it get really popular, and Lightchain AI has the same chance because of its smart blockchain solutions. Lightchain AI comes into the market at an important time when people are using AI more than ever, and it is in a good spot to take advantage of the need for shared AI technologies. If Lightchain AI keeps getting speed, it might take a like way to Cardano’s quick rise, giving investors the chance to join soon before the project gets all market notice. Why Investors Should Act Fast Before the Price Increase With only two days left before the price increase, this is a critical moment for investors to act fast and secure their stake in Lightchain AI . The $0.004875 presale price is incredibly affordable, and with over $8.5 million raised, the presale is proving that investors see the potential for massive returns. As Lightchain AI continues to develop its platform and gain wider adoption, its value is set to increase significantly. This makes now the ideal time to invest, as prices are expected to rise once the presale ends, potentially locking out those who wait too long. The two-day window is quickly closing, and investors rushing in now could see the value of their tokens increase as Lightchain AI continues to grow.

This new token and its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, RCO Finance (RCOF) , aims to utilize state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to revolutionize the digital assets environment, all inside a secure and accessible platform. Caught In A Downtrend: Ethereum Must Overcome This Key Resistance While excitement builds for RCO Finance, the Ethereum price currently faces significant challenges with its latest movements. The second-largest digital asset behind Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break through important resistance walls, remaining below the $4,000 mark since mid-December. Currently, the Ethereum price is stuck in a downtrend, oscillating between its most crucial support now at $3,300, which has prevented additional losses for the altcoin, and short-term resistance at the $3,700 level. Recent evaluations suggest that the price has faced a rejection at this upper limit, hindering any efforts at recovery. As stated by crypto specialist Man of Bitcoin, ETH has lately broken important micro-support levels, indicating a possible short-term downtrend. The specialist claims that resistance seems to range from $3,505 to $3,659, with a consistent break above $3,659 indicating the development of a bullish wave pattern. Nonetheless, optimism remains, with analysts such as Ash Crypto forecasting that Ethereum might rise to $15,000 by 2025 if it follows the growth pattern of past bull runs. In this scenario, RCO Finance is generating excitement that investors cannot ignore. With more than $10 million raised to date and over 65% of its RCOF tokens sold in the IPO, the enthusiasm is clear. Transforming Investing: RCO Finance Empowers Everyday Investors With Innovative AI Solutions The new RCO Finance platform aims to deliver both conventional and decentralized financial services to everyone, utilizing advanced AI technology to enhance the user experience. The project offers multiple financial services, such as staking, yield farming, lending, and token swapping, all within a safe and decentralized setting. RCO Finance’s AI-powered Robo Advisor—an advanced investment manager utilizing extensive market data to create customized investment plans that match personal financial objectives and risk preferences. This groundbreaking tool enables both novices and experienced investors to adeptly manage the intricacies of the financial landscape and enhance their prospects of achieving even greater returns. However, that’s not everything! RCO Finance provides access to an impressive 120,000+ digital assets spread over 12,500 asset classes, such as stocks, derivatives, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Historically, these profitable assets have been the domain of institutional investors because of significant liquidity obstacles. RCO Finance challenges this standard by dividing these assets into smaller, more manageable portions. Get Ready For Gains: RCOF Projected To Soar Up To 500% User experience is also paramount, and RCO Finance excels with a user-friendly interface designed for traders of all skill levels. Plus, with no know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, the platform ensures that user privacy and anonymity are top priorities during transactions within the ecosystem. RCO Finance’s robust tokenomics model fosters community engagement, allowing token holders to propose and vote on pivotal platform changes. Its liquidity pools and yield farming incentives actively reward participants, making it a win-win for everyone involved. Currently, RCOF is priced at just $0.077 in the fourth stage of its token presale, but don’t blink—it’s projected to leap to $0.214 in the next bonus round, signaling a potential 175% increase for early investors. Once it hits major exchanges, forecasts suggest that the upcoming RCOF altcoin could soar to between $0.40 and $0.60, offering nearly 500% gains, outperforming established cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Conclusion As RCO Finance continues to build momentum, its innovative AI features and dedication to user accessibility position it as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency arena, potentially rivaling established giants like Ethereum. With a forward-thinking approach, RCO Finance is poised to disrupt the digital asset landscape in a way that you won’t want to miss. Keep a close eye on this electrifying project in the months ahead—it’s ready to redefine the future of finance!

Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder Vitalik Buterin has lately expressed both hope and caution on artificial intelligence. He highlighted the dual potential of AI in a series of tweets on X: as an existential threat due to the unfettered growth of autonomous systems, or as a revolutionary instrument to improve human skills. AI done wrong is making new forms of independent self-replicating intelligent life AI done right is mecha suits for the human mind If we do the former without the latter, we risk permanent human disempowerment. If we do the latter, flourishing superinteligent human civilization — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 10, 2025 Buterin expressed concern over the potential for “independent self-replicating intelligent life” to emerge from poorly designed AI systems. He warned that such developments could lead to the permanent disempowerment of humanity. However, he also painted an optimistic vision for AI, describing it as “mecha suits for the human mind” that amplifies human creativity and intelligence. You might also like: Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining traction for bullish 2025, Solana looks stagnant: Nexo The idea of AI agents, which Vitalik Buterin mentioned in his posts, is central to this conversation. AI agents are computer programs created to carry out activities on their own. They can include user-friendly interfaces like chatbots that streamline interactions with technology or instruments that autonomously carry out intricate, long-term plans. Buterin praised the potential of the latter, pointing out that substituting chat-based systems for conventional graphical user interfaces may completely transform how people engage with the digital world, even as he warned against the dangers of the former. Buterin’s larger worries about the future of AI are reflected in these series of tweets. In the past, the ETH co-founder advocated for careful development of brain-computer connections to preserve human control, warning about the risks of superintelligent AI overtaking human capabilities. Vitalik Buterin’s comments add to the worldwide discussion on ethical AI development by highlighting the necessity of AI systems that enhance human agency. He urges that designs that empower users be given priority so that technology advances humanity rather than displacing it.

From Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to the meme coin frenzy of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, we’ve seen fortunes made in the blink of an eye. Yet, one story continues to haunt those who were too slow to jump in—Pepe Coin (PEPE). It started as a joke but turned into a financial revolution for those who believed in its potential. If you’re kicking yourself for missing out on PEPE’s rocket to riches, here’s some good news: history doesn’t just rhyme—it repeats. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the latest contender in the meme coin mania. With a presale that’s already raised over $5.1 million and a price trajectory that’s bound to turn heads, BTFD is the best new meme coin with 100x potential. This might just be your ticket to financial independence. BTFD Coin: Seize the Dip, Ride the Bull BTFD Coin (BTFD) is making waves in the crypto scene, combining the irresistible charm of meme coins with practical features that pack a punch. Its name, an acronym for “ Buy The Dip ,” perfectly encapsulates the mindset of its community: turn downturns into opportunities. With over 63 billion coins sold and 8,000 holders on board, this project is already making waves before it even hits major exchanges. The BTFD Presale: Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the presale has reached its 13th stage, with coins now priced at $0.000142. Once the presale wraps up, BTFD will list at $0.0006, giving early investors a massive head start. To put it in perspective, an investment of $2,000 today could yield over $8,450 once BTFD hits its listing price. Features That Set BTFD Apart: Referral Program: Earn 10% of all purchases made using your referral code while your referrals enjoy 10% extra tokens. The leaderboard’s top 20 get even juicier rewards—this isn’t just a presale; it’s a movement. Staking Rewards: With a whopping 90% APY, BTFD’s staking program promises lucrative gains for the long haul. Play-to-Earn Game: Launched on January 1, 2025, the BTFD P2E game blends fun with finance, offering players real crypto rewards. Community-Driven Ecosystem: The Bulls Squad , led by their iconic mascot Baby Bull, fosters a sense of camaraderie and collaboration among investors. With such an arsenal of features, analysts are calling BTFD a game-changer in the meme coin market. The buzz is real, and the window of opportunity is closing fast. Pepe Coin: The One That You Missed Before we dive deeper into BTFD, let’s take a moment to reflect on Pepe Coin (PEPE)—the meme coin that turned heads and bank accounts. Launched in April 2023, PEPE rode the wave of internet culture and quickly became a sensation. Early adopters saw jaw-dropping returns, with PEPE’s market cap soaring past $1 billion in mere weeks. However, as with any skyrocketing crypto, the dream wasn’t equally kind to all. Many hesitated, unsure if PEPE could sustain its momentum, and by the time they decided to join, the rocket had already left the launch pad. Missing out on PEPE became a cautionary tale, a constant reminder that in the crypto world, timing is everything. Today, PEPE continues to hold its own, maintaining a robust community and a place in the top meme coins. But the true glory days of 100x returns? Those belong to the past. The question is, will you let the next big opportunity pass you by too? Why BTFD Could Be Your Redemption The cryptocurrency landscape has shifted dramatically since PEPE’s heyday, but BTFD Coin is here to rewrite the rules. Where PEPE leaned heavily on internet culture and memes, BTFD adds tangible utility and a long-term vision. Its Ethereum-based infrastructure ensures security, scalability, and accessibility, while its staking and gaming mechanics create sustainable value. The buzz around BTFD’s referral program alone is enough to get excited about. Imagine earning passive income simply by sharing your unique referral code. One friend invests $500? That’s 10% in your pocket, and they get extra tokens too. It’s a win-win that keeps the community engaged and the ecosystem thriving. BTFD: The Best New Meme Coin with 100x Potential Let’s not beat around the bush—crypto is risky. But the rewards? They’re undeniably tempting. BTFD Coin offers a rare blend of community-driven energy, real-world utility, and the excitement of a presale that’s gaining traction fast. Whether you’re staking, playing to earn, or riding the referral wave, this is a coin that’s got something for everyone. Still wondering if it’s worth the plunge? Consider this: while others wait on the sidelines, you have the chance to grab a seat at the table before the real feast begins. Remember, the ones who bought PEPE early are sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere. The question is, where will you be when BTFD hits $0.0006? Conclusion: Don’t Wait for the Dip – It’s Here In crypto, hesitation is the enemy. BTFD Coin is primed for the kind of explosive growth that turns skeptics into believers and investors into millionaires. With its presale nearing the final stages, staking rewards rolling in, and a play-to-earn game already live, this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the best new meme coin with 100x potential. Don’t be the person who looks back in regret. Connect your wallet, grab your referral code, and dive into the BTFD presale today . The future isn’t just coming—it’s waiting for you to seize it. Act now. Buy The Dip. Your millionaire moment could start today.

ETH is struggling and might continue to move down if it stays below $3,400. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $3,400 zone. The price is trading below $3,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,300 resistance level. Ethereum Price Extend Losses Ethereum price failed to start a recovery wave above the $3,400 level and extended losses like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $3,350 and $3,320 support levels. There was a clear move below $3,250 and $3,220. A low was formed at $3,159 and the price is now consolidating below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,159 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,300 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,300 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $3,400 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,450 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,742 swing high to the $3,159 low. A clear move above the $3,450 resistance might send the price toward the $3,500 resistance. An upside break above the $3,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,550 resistance zone or even $3,650 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,300 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,160. A clear move below the $3,160 support might push the price toward the $3,080 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

Amid this movement, the market seems to be witnessing a notable trend among miners as they grapple with the effects of rising values and selling pressure. Insights from XBTManager, a CryptoQuant contributor, shed light on the challenges facing Bitcoin miners and the broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Rally In Q1 2025 Driven By US Fed’s Money Printing, Predicts Arthur Hayes Miners Feel the Pressure As Bitcoin Remains Below $100K In a post titled “The Strong Remain, the Weak Exit the Market,” XBTManager highlighted that Bitcoin’s appreciation has placed miners in a “precarious” position. The recent price surge above $100,000 initially brought substantial gains for miners, but subsequent corrections have intensified selling activity. According to the analysis, miners have entered a state where their positions are “extremely underpaid,” leading to significant financial strain. XBTManager wrote: Following a sharp pullback in Bitcoin’s price, it entered a correction phase and rose again to the 102k levels, only to trigger another wave of heavy selling. As Bitcoin climbed to 102k, miner positions, which were in a “fairly paid” state, transitioned to an “extremely underpaid” state as selling pressure intensified at that level. Notably, as weaker miners exit the market, those with greater resilience are expected to persist, potentially opening opportunities for investors. XBTManager’s outlook suggests that assuming the current bull market remains intact, the ongoing challenges for miners could present favorable conditions for strategic buying. MVRV Indicator Hints At Bitcoin’s Continued Growth Potential Another CryptoQuant contributor, CryptoOnchain, offered an additional perspective on Bitcoin’s market cycle. Analyzing the 100-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio, CryptoOnchain argued that Bitcoin has “yet to reach its peak” for this cycle. Historical data shows that the MVRV ratio reached a value of 3 during the market tops in the last two cycles. At present, this ratio stands at 2.14, indicating potential for further upward movement. 100-day moving average of MVRV: Bitcoin has not yet reached the top price of this cycle “MVRV metric reached the value of 3 at the market tops in the past two cycles, whereas it currently stands at 2.14… it can be said that Bitcoin is preparing to move towards the top price of… pic.twitter.com/YlNLQwgE3w — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 9, 2025 The MVRV metric, which helps identify market tops and bottoms, signals that Bitcoin may be preparing for another price surge in the coming months.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 03:33:00

The speech, which gave Ethereum a regulatory pass, has raised serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest within the SEC. What’s the Issue? Empower Oversight, an independent watchdog group, had asked the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to investigate possible conflicts of interest related to Hinman’s speech. The investigation has been completed, and the report has been sent to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. However, it hasn’t been made public yet. Deaton’s Message to the SEC In response to the delay, Deaton, who represents 75,000 XRP holders in the Ripple case, took action by calling the SEC Chairman’s Office directly. In a respectful but firm message, he asked Gensler to release the report within the next 10 days. He also pointed out that the findings are of major interest to the public, especially to those following the Ripple case. Deaton’s message was clear: “This is a respectful request for you to release the report to the public. 75,000 XRP holders are waiting for this.” A Call for Action Deaton encouraged others to join him in pushing for transparency. He urged people to call the SEC or send emails to ask for the report’s release. The goal is to send a clear message that the public deserves to know what’s in the report. Gensler will resign as SEC Chairman on January 20, the same day as Donald Trump’s inauguration. Paul Atkins will take over as the new head of the SEC. As the deadline approaches, the crypto community is rallying together in hopes of getting the SEC to release the Hinman report and ensure that government actions are held accountable.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 03:44:13

The $BEST presale reached this milestone at a time when everyday crypto users are looking for a next-generation Web3 wallet solution to capitalize on the upcoming bull run. As we enter 2025, early signs clearly show that more institutional players and mainstream adopters are entering the market. So, savvy investors who want to capitalize on this momentum will need tools to help them effectively manage their crypto portfolios. This is where Best Wallet steps in. With features like an innovative Upcoming Tokens finder, user-friendly UI, and affordable transactions, Best Wallet looks well on its way to overshadowing legacy wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. According to the team, its user base has grown by around 50% each month—an adoption curve that’s hard to ignore. One reason behind this popularity is $BEST, the platform’s utility token. It’s priced at just $0.023525 at press time but will increase when the current presale stage ends. This will occur in less than 48 hours, so it’s best to grab the tokens at their current price to get the lowest possible entry point. What’s Driving Best Wallet’s Growth? One of the main reasons behind Best Wallet’s early growth is that it goes beyond what traditional wallets offer. A great example of this is the wallet’s Upcoming Token feature. With over 16,000 cryptos in the market currently, finding legitimate low-cap gems can feel quite challenging. This is why Best Wallet has launched its Upcoming Tokens feature. It aims to simplify the search process by showing curated tokens with strong fundamentals. The success rate of these picks is already drawing attention. Let’s take Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) as an example. It surged from its presale price of $0.008 to a high of $0.068 during the initial phase of its launch, seeing a nearly 700% upside. Another project featured in the Upcoming Tokens section was Catslap ($SLAP). This coin surged over 2,500% from its fair launch price after being featured in Best Wallet. All the tools you need, in one place. From managing your assets to trading with confidence, Best Wallet makes crypto simple and secure. Insights, tools, and enhanced features—all at your fingertips. Download now! https://t.co/he5kzra7TY pic.twitter.com/03A5Ws1Iwi — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) January 2, 2025 It’s worth noting that Best Wallet connects to over 200 decentralized protocols and 20 cross-chain bridges. Moreover, the wallet supports easy off-ramping so users can convert crypto into over 100 fiat currencies and deposit the funds straight into their bank accounts. Best Wallet’s iGaming feature offers exclusive benefits like free spins, loot box access, deposit bonuses, and lower fees for online gaming enthusiasts. Since these perks are integrated directly into the wallet, Best Wallet is quickly winning over users who previously relied on platforms like MetaMask. It’s roadmap outlines more exciting features, including leveraged derivatives trading and an NFT gallery. Could $BEST See a 10x Jump After Launch? At the heart of Best Wallet’s ecosystem is $BEST. It’s the utility-packed native token of the wallet that unlocks exclusive perks for its holders. These include potential perks in the soon-to-launch Best Wallet DEX and Best Card. Early demand for these tokens has been quite promising, which is evident from the presale numbers. This momentum shows no signs of slowing anytime soon. Crypto analyst ClayBro recently told his 134K YouTube subscribers that $BEST could see a 10x surge after its launch. In fact, early investor support can set the stage for multiple top-tier listings sooner than expected. It’s worth mentioning that $BEST token holders can also earn a high APY of over 290% at the time of writing. This rate will decrease as more investors join the staking pool. How to Join the $BEST Presale Visit Best Wallet Token’s official presale page to buy $BEST tokens. The page has a buying widget that allows you to swap $BEST for ETH or USDT. Simply enter the amount you wish to swap, and the widget will automatically display the number of $BEST tokens you’ll get. Card transactions are also supported, but watch out for third-party fees. Alternatively, you can buy the tokens directly on the Best Wallet app. If you already use another wallet, you can import it into Best Wallet to manage all your crypto under one platform. You can download the Best Wallet app from the App Store or Google Play . Join Best Wallet’s socials on X , discord , and Telegram for the latest updates.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 04:42:00

Experts Say Wall Street Pepe Can 100X As Presale Hits $44 Million,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/experts-say-wall-street-pepe-can-100x-as-presale-hits-44-million/,"The post Next Millionaire-Maker? Experts Say Wall Street Pepe Can 100X As Presale Hits $44 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has raised over $44 million in its ICO and earned recognition from top industry analysts. Many of whom estimate that $WEPE could be the next 100x meme coin. The new project, which introduces a trading insights ecosystem and masquerades it behind Pepe and Wolf of Wall Street-themed branding, is on track to raise more funds than any other meme coin ICO. Its $44 million total raise milestone comes approximately one month after the presale began, showing incredible demand among investors. At the pace at which the presale is selling, the total supply will be exhausted by February or sooner, leaving many would-be $WEPE holders forced to buy tokens from those who successfully entered the presale, potentially at a much higher price. The presale operates on a multi-tiered pricing structure, in which the price gradually steps up at the beginning of each round. The current $WEPE price is $0.00036644, but the next increase will occur in 22 hours or when the total raise hits $44,926,750. Here are 3 reasons analysts say $WEPE can 100x: Excitement is in the air. This is reflected not only in Wall Street Pepe’s successful presale fundraising efforts but also in the opinions of respected industry analysts. Whispers of a 100x rally are rife, and there is good reason why. First, Umar Khan from 99Bitcoins , which boasts 700K subscribers, said $WEPE could 100x based on its rampant presale momentum and the fact that Elon Musk is “shilling Pepe memes.” He refers to Musk’s new alter ego on his social media site X, where he posts memes about a Pepe the Frog character sporting gladiator attire, dubbed “Kekius Maximus.” Meanwhile, an analyst from the Cryptonews YouTube channel looked at Wall Street Pepe’s fundamentals, hailing its trading insights ecosystem alongside the staking and trading rewards on offer. Within the trading insights ecosystem, the project will offer trading insights, meme coin picks, and a trading insider group. Returning to the project’s presale success, analyst ClayBro noted that Wall Street Pepe is “surpassing anything Pepe Unchained did,” which he believes gives it 100x potential. Pepe Unchained is another utility-based Pepe alternative that underwent a presale in 2024 and provided a 10x gain after launching on exchanges in December. It took over four months to raise the amount that Wall Street Pepe has raised in one month. With considerably higher presale demand, ClayBro suggests that $WEPE could also outperform Pepe Unchained once it hits exchanges. 29% staking APY and trading competition Wall Street Pepe’s bread-and-butter is equipping its community with the tools for success in the crypto market, but it will also ensure that holders are subsidized with free $WEPE tokens. One way it’s doing this is the project’s live staking mechanism, which currently provides a 29% APY. The team will also release a trading competition feature soon, inviting users to test their skills and potentially earn $WEPE tokens. More details will be released later. Missed Pepe? Join the Wall Street Pepe presale Pepe the Frog meme appears across the internet in all shapes and forms. Many cryptocurrencies have been created about it, including the multi-billion dollar titan Pepe coin and the 10x launch Pepe Unchained. For those who missed the gains of earlier Pepe-themed tokens, Wall Street Pepe offers another opportunity to capitalize on the viral frog meme. Investors can participate in the presale using the Wall Street Pepe website or the Best Wallet application. The project has been audited by smart contract expert Coinsult , who found no issues with its code. Follow Wall Street Pepe on X or join its Telegram for updates.

A Tenure Marked by Crypto Scrutiny In the sit-down with David Gura, the 67-year-old, who is due to depart the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in about a week, outlined the challenges posed by the digital asset industry, which, despite making up less than 1% of the $120 trillion U.S. capital markets, has attracted significant attention from regulators and the public. Since taking office, Gensler has overseen 100 enforcement actions related to crypto, building on the work of his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who initiated 80 such cases during his tenure. The actions targeted fraud, scams, and non-compliance with securities laws. According to him, most digital currencies meet the criteria for securities and should be regulated as such. Additionally, he claimed that many crypto projects operate outside legal boundaries, which exposes investors to significant risks. “Right now, the crypto market is rife with bad actors. We’ve seen this over the last few years, with intermediaries—whether they call themselves exchanges, brokers, or custodians—not complying with securities laws and putting the public at risk,” said Gensler. The former MIT professor also questioned the viability of most cryptocurrencies in the market, suggesting that many of them won’t survive. Further, he called out the sector for being overly driven by sentiment rather than fundamentals, a factor he believes hugely contributes to its volatility. Debunking the “Anti-Crypto” Label The SEC chair has faced considerable criticism from pro-crypto figures for his regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry. Some, like Minnesota lawmaker Tom Emmer, previously described his tenure as “the most destructive and lawless” in history. Others, like Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, described it as a ” reign of terror ,” pushing the industry to rally behind pro-crypto candidates in the November polls, which saw Donald Trump return to the White House and the United States gain the most crypto-friendly Congress ever. On his part, Gensler accepted the personal challenges of leading a high-profile regulatory body, remarking, “If you’re not willing to be attacked, you can’t debate policy.” However, he rejected his characterization as anti-crypto, pointing to his academic background at MIT, where he studied and taught blockchain technology, as evidence of his interest in the sector. “My role as SEC Chair is to ensure investor protection and market integrity. It’s not about being pro or anti-crypto; it’s about ensuring that intermediaries and projects comply with the law,” he explained.

The company has recently ventured into commodity lending and made a $775 million investment in the online video platform Rumble. In an email , Paolo Ardoino, the chief executive officer, confirmed the move. He said: “AI-based roles, particularly in filmmaking, bring unique advantages that align with Tether’s vision of innovation and efficiency , from scale to speed and cost being a few examples.” – Paolo Ardoino The CEO added that artificial intelligence is a significant focus area for the firm, and it must adjust to fit into the fast-paced world of AI. The adjustments must include the roles it seeks to hire. Tether acquires more experts to design and build an AI platform The firm is already taking steps to set up its filmmaking artificial intelligence platform. According to the email, the firm has always maintained lean staffing and added 30 experts in the past few months to ensure the project’s success. The company has made online job postings targeting filmmakers from Europe, Asia-Pacific, Argentina, Colombia, and Brazil. It plans to double its staff headcount to 200 by mid-2025. The unfolding builds up to Tether’s move to obtain part of an artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm, Northern Data. Although details of Tether’s upcoming AI platform are scarce, the firm’s determination to have the site up and running shows how the intersection between crypto and artificial intelligence is growing. Tether has a promising profile in the cryptocurrency ecosystem Tether is a leading firm in the world’s stablecoin market. Crypto traders rely on its token, the USDT, to facilitate digital assets transactions and leverage from the sector’s volatility. It accounts for 67% of the total stablecoin market, with $138 billion USDT in circulation. Tether is among the top-performing companies in the cryptocurrency industry, raising billions of dollars in profits. At the end of last year, the company CEO mentioned that the firm would likely make more than $10 billion in profits. However, it is difficult to ascertain these statements as the firm doesn’t release audited financial outcomes. Despite its smooth operations and the respect Tether commands in the cryptosphere, the firm has had its share of problems. The firm’s token, USDT, has always been linked to criminal activities from the notorious Irish gangsters, Russian arms dealers, Hamas, and North Korean hackers. From its end, the team has been open to working with authorities to freeze tokens used for illegal activities. The firm has also faced investigations in Europe, where its token is suspended in several crypto exchange platforms due to a regulation framework set by the European Union.

BITB has maintained a top 5 position among US-based Bitcoin ETFs by assets under management, and generally trades close to its net asset value. Despite some short-term network development declines, Bitcoin's main layer activity and alternative uses like NFTs have shown positive long-term trends. I believe Bitcoin has not peaked this halving epoch; BITB is a sensible investment for those expecting further price appreciation, with strategic buys under $90k. Back in April, I initiated coverage of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF ( BITB ) through Seeking Alpha with a 'buy' call and noted how the fund was slightly different from some of the other Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs that were approved last January. In my closing Summary of that piece, I argued that BITB might actually be a way to buy BTC through the ETF wrapper while still staying moderately consistent with some of the philosophical principles Bitcoiners have historically adopted - namely, buying the fund shares can indirectly help decentralize the broader network: Ultimately, Bitcoin remains largely an anti-fiat trade. And despite there being an enormous amount of competition in the anti-fiat realm both in and out of crypto, BTC and its many proxies are probably still the fastest horses in that race. If one can accept holding Bitcoin with no less than three layers of intermediaries, than BITB might be one of the more principled options in the market as the company will be funding non-profit developers not named Blockstream. More specifically, a portion of revenue paid to Bitwise through the fund's management fee would be donated to further the development of Bitcoin through Bitcoin-focused non-profits Brink, OpenSats, and Human Rights Foundation. In this update, we'll briefly revisit the fund details and look at how the broader Bitcoin network has developed over the last few months. Fund Details & Objective BITB is one of roughly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission last January. With nearly a year of availability in the market, BITB has consistently remained a top 5 US-based ETF by assets under management. Fund Name Inception Expense Ratio AUM iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) 01/05/2024 0.12% $52.58B Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) 01/10/2024 0.25% $19.58B Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) 09/25/2013 1.50% $19.20B ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) 01/10/2024 0.21% $4.54B Bitwise Bitcoin ETF 01/10/2024 0.20% $3.85B Source: Seeking Alpha As of market close, January 8th, BITB is holding just under 40,794 BTC in the fund. The objective is quite simple, BITB offers traditional investors a straightforward, inexpensive way to get Bitcoin exposure in a traditional brokerage account or investment portfolio. In the year since the fund launched, it has generally traded within a few bps of net asset value: Premium/Discount (Bitwise) In 245 sessions last year, BITB traded at a discount 112 times and a premium 123 times. Through 5 sessions in 2025, BITB has traded at a discount 80% of the time. But it should be noted that this is a small sample size and the deviation from NAV has typically been very small. From a liquidity standpoint, BITB is generally in-line with the other top 5 spot ETFs with more than 3% of shares trading daily on average: Fund AUM Average Daily Dollar Volume Average % of Fund Traded Daily IBIT $52,580 $2,700 5.14% FBTC $19,580 $491 2.51% GBTC $19,200 $307 1.60% ARKB $4,540 $155 3.42% BITB $3,850 $126 3.29% Source: Seeking Alpha, author's calculations, $ in millions There are other spot Bitcoin funds that are bigger, slightly more liquid, and cheaper than the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. Yet, BITB does offer a compelling selling point that similar funds lack; funding Bitcoin development through non-profit donations. Bitcoin Development and Usage For ten years, 10% of the profit Bitwise earns from managing BITB has been pledged to funding development of the Bitcoin network through Brink, OpenSats, and Human Rights Foundation. While the recipients of grants from each of these non-profit organizations can vary, they generally fund Bitcoin Core development, third-party wallet application developers, privacy-focused endeavors like GrapheneOS and The Tor Project, as well as various Nostr clients. Broadly, network development has been consistent over the last 4 or 5 years: Bitcoin Development (Santiment) 30 Day average contributor count has generally held firm between 45 and 55 going back to 2020. While the long-term trend is headed in the right direction, weekly development activity has declined sharply since November. This isn't necessarily unusual and we've seen similar development declines near the end of the year in the past as well. Scaling network growth hasn't been nearly as positive. Lightning Network Capacity (mempool) Bitcoin's Lightning Network growth has generally failed to live up to expectations. Not only has the BTC-denominated spending capacity of the network been flat at a little over 5k BTC for over two years, but channels have been in decline for nearly three years. There were 82k Lightning Network channels in March 2022. Today there are about 46k. Blockstream's other project Liquid isn't doing any better with just 3.8k BTC. To put this into context, there is about 15x the amount of BTC on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) through the Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC-USD ) contract than is deposited to Liquid and Lightning combined. Bitcoin main layer activity growth has been a bit more interesting. Bitcoin 'L1' Transactions (Dune Analytics/cryptokoryo_research) I've covered the network activity on the Bitcoin blockchain regularly for Seeking Alpha over the last several months. But it has been a while since I've explored some of the alternative ways that the network is being utilized. Specifically, NFT projects like Ordinals and Runes. The combination of which have helped propel Bitcoin to the third largest NFT network by all time sales volume at $5 billion per data from CryptoSlam . However, even when factoring in the sporadic pops in transactions from BRC-20 tokens and Runes, main layer Bitcoin transactions have been down since October: Weekly (Artemis) Over the last five years, the general trend in weekly transactions has been very positive. More recently, that figure has fallen dramatically as the price of Bitcoin has risen. Bitcoin did 20.5 million transactions during the month of October. That number fell to 12.8 million in December. In my view, this is a clear indication that Bitcoin is being hoarded due to market expectations of further price rises. Perhaps strengthening that view is BTC supply migration away from centralized exchanges: BTC Exchange Supply (CoinGlass) CoinGlass tracks the aggregate balance from centralized exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ) and Binance. The total BTC held through exchanges has fallen by almost 20% from 2.7 million BTC this time last year to just 2.2 million today. Risks Despite the market optimism, Bitcoin doesn't have the greatest looking chart at the moment: TrendSpider Bitcoin's daily chart shows RSI divergences going back to November. The coin has also given back the 50 day moving average and appears poised to go below $90k per coin for the first time in nearly two months. Furthermore, the fear and greed index is still very elevated at 69. In my view, it is very possible that what is widely expected to be a multi-year rally is taking a temporary breather. Worst case, Bitcoin's top is already in - though, to be clear, I don't hold that view presently. Summary As a fund, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF is a fine way to speculate on price appreciation in BTC. BITB has decent liquidity and a highly competitive management fee. A portion of management's profits have been pledged to fund network development through Bitcoin-focused non-profit organizations for ten years. If you believe Bitcoin is going higher, my view is BITB is a perfectly sensible way to express that trade. The question then is whether or not each individual reader believes Bitcoin has peaked for this halving epoch. Personally, I don't believe that it has. That said, I also see a deeper short term pullback before a new high is made. I think dips under $90k BTC are buys. But I'd be strategic with those buys. It's been a long time since BTC has sniffed its 200 day MA.",BTC-USD|BITB,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-10 04:58:37

Tambiev, who was convicted for accepting the largest recorded bribe in the history of Russia, had over 1,000 Bitcoin seized during an investigation into his involvement with a hacker group. The Seizure of 1032.1 BTC In 2023, the Nikulinsky Court, upon the request of the prosecutor’s office, ordered the confiscation of 1032.1 BTC, which was deemed to have been acquired through unconfirmed sources of income. This seizure has now led to the transfer of the Bitcoin into Russia’s treasury, with the initial stage of the process involving the conversion of the cryptocurrency into over 1 billion rubles. The investigation revealed that Tambiev used his position to divert police investigations and help the hackers hide illegal funds. Despite his conviction, Tambiev denied all charges during his trial. He rejected any offers of cooperation with the authorities and refused to admit guilt. He even defended his associate, Lyakhovenko, labeling her “a child and a victim” during court proceedings. Legal Hurdles in Selling Seized Assets While Russia has started converting the seized Bitcoin into rubles, the process has not been without its challenges. Tambiev had divided the Bitcoin into smaller amounts, making it necessary for the authorities to file multiple court requests to access and sell all the coins. In addition to Bitcoin, Tambiev’s assets, including real estate and a motorcycle, are also under review for liquidation. Despite these complications, the Russian government is determined to reclaim the stolen assets and ensure they are funneled back into the state’s revenue.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 05:00:28

While meme coins like Dogecoin continue to attract attention, investors are heavily betting on the PropiChain presale, with projections of up to 30,000% returns by the end of 2025. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Should You Buy DOGE? Dogecoin has become the internet’s favorite meme coin, earning mainstream recognition and even business acceptance as a payment method. However, its limited utility as a speculative asset has led investors to seek more practical alternatives. Many now turn to AI altcoins with real-world applications, hoping for better long-term potential. While Dogecoin continues to attract attention, the growing interest in utility-driven altcoins is undeniable. As investors look beyond Dogecoin, a standout AI altcoin is emerging, offering a more tangible value proposition in the evolving crypto market. PropiChain: The Dogecoin Alternative Revolutionizing Real Estate with 30,000% Rally PropiChain is an AI altcoin rapidly transforming the real estate market by integrating blockchain technology and tokenization. PropiChain offers a unique solution by enabling fractional ownership through Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, unlike other altcoins that serve limited purposes. This means that investors can now participate in high-value real estate with only a fraction of the capital traditionally required. PropiChain’s AI altcoin capabilities go far beyond simple asset tokenization. The platform uses advanced AI analytics, providing investors with real-time data and predictive insights. Additionally, PropiChain includes a fully integrated metaverse marketplace, which allows users to engage in virtual property tours, meetings, and property staging, eliminating the need for costly inspections. This integration of the metaverse into real estate sets PropiChain apart from other AI altcoins, offering unmatched utility and appeal. By incorporating these digital innovations, PropiChain ensures that its AI altcoin technology remains relevant in virtual and real-world financial ecosystems. PropiChain is one of the AI altcoins that is miles ahead of most other altcoins when it comes to providing comprehensive real estate solutions. Its ability to address key challenges in real estate, such as high financial barriers, market access, and fraud prevention, positions it as a game-changer in the blockchain and AI altcoins spaces. As the project progresses, projections suggest that PropiChain could see as much as 30,000% growth by the end of 2025. The platform’s innovative use of AI altcoins, blockchain technology, and metaverse integration presents a compelling case for investors looking for exposure to high-growth opportunities in the evolving altcoin market. PropiChain stands out as one of the best AI altcoins and a transformative force in real estate and blockchain technology. With the growing interest in AI altcoins, PropiChain’s unique combination of real-world applications and cutting-edge technology ensures it remains a standout in the crypto space. For those looking to invest in AI altcoins with significant long-term growth potential, PropiChain represents an opportunity that’s hard to ignore. It’s a shining example of how AI altcoins can be used to solve real-world problems while offering massive returns to early investors. Forget Dogecoin: Don’t Miss Out on PropiChain’s Round Two Presale We are already in 2025, and the hunt for the next altcoin that will mint millionaires is on, especially after the number of crypto millionaires doubled in 2024. While meme coins like Dogecoin are losing steam, PropiChain is set to replicate Dogecoin’s early explosive growth, positioning itself as a standout among AI altcoins. With over $1.7 million raised in the PCHAIN presale, investors are eager to secure their stake in this AI altcoin at $0.011, the lowest price it will ever be. PropiChain’s 30,000% growth projection for 2025 is driving excitement. Still, the anticipated 6,600% rise in the next 30 days, fueled by Trump’s inauguration and another bullish crypto surge, is even more compelling for short-term investors. For instance, a $1,500 investment in round two could grow to $99,000 by January and reach $600,000 by the end of 2025. But with the presale nearing its final rounds, the opportunity to capitalize on these gains is closing fast. Along with a BlockAudit security audit and listing on Coinmarketcap , the presale’s early success is creating a buzz in the crypto community. Round two has already raised over $700,000, bringing PropiChain closer to its final round. Don’t miss your chance to acquire PCHAIN at its lowest price—click the link below to join the presale now.

This is due to a remarkable 4,100% surge in its burn rate within just 24 hours, resulting in the removal of nearly 21.7 million SHIB tokens from circulation. The cryptocurrency is once again capturing attention in the digital asset space as this extraordinary increase highlights its significant combustion rate. Related Reading: Bitcoin As The New S&P 500 Of Our Time? This CEO Thinks So A Closer Examination Of The Burn Rate The burn rate is an essential metric for Shiba Inu, as it indicates the quantity of tokens that are irrevocably removed from circulation. The purpose of this standard procedure is to establish scarcity, which has the potential to increase the value of the remaining tokens. The most recent surge was predominantly driven by a single transaction, which resulted in the burning of nearly 21 million tokens in a single instance. A reduction in supply of this magnitude can have a beneficial effect on investor confidence and market sentiment. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE$SHIB Price: $0.00002372 (1hr -0.06% ▼ | 24hr -2.13% ▼ ) Market Cap: $13,977,981,987 (-1.97% ▼) Total Supply: 589,257,014,659,157 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 21,709,094 (4100.35% ▲) Past 7 Days: 104,230,574 (86.58% ▲) — Shibburn (@shibburn) January 8, 2025 Still, it’s important to recognize that SHIB’s price did not line up with the notable rise in burn rate. Actually, SHIB’s price dropped 11% over this period, coming out to roughly $0.00002168. This decline in the market value of the meme coin was a result of a larger trend influencing the whole digital currency market that saw over $711 million in liquidations among other assets. Shiba Inu: Whale Activity Increases Interestingly, there have been a lot more whales in the Shiba Inu environment at the same time that the burn rate has gone up. Over 2,000% more transactions involving substantial holders happened, resulting in the exchange of around $750 million in SHIB in a 24-hr period. This rise means that big buyers are either buying more tokens or giving them to other people in response to changes in the market. Future Prospects And Market Sentiment Many members of the Shiba Inu community are optimistic about the future of the coin, despite the present price decrease. The substantial incineration rate is perceived as a proactive measure to increase scarcity and potentially result in price appreciation in the future. Investor sentiment can be unpredictable; however, community members frequently gain confidence in the project’s long-term viability when they witness significant fires. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Fuels $585 Million Crypto ETP Inflows In 2025 The recent increase in the Shiba Inu’s combustion rate stimulates optimism about its future potential; nonetheless, market realities are complex. The simultaneous price fall and macroeconomic factors that lead to market volatility serve as a reminder to investors to be cautious. In the world of cryptocurrencies, volatility are unavoidable, and monitoring both whale activity and burn rates will be critical in determining SHIB’s likely future path.

Solana (SOL) for its lightning-fast transactions, XRP for its impressive cross-border payment solutions, Lightchain AI for its exciting AI-blockchain integration, and Kaspa (KAS) for its unique blockDAG architecture. Let’s dive into what makes these cryptos the favorites for whales in this bullish climate. Solana (SOL) Speed and Scalability Champion Solana has made a name as one of the quickest and largest blockchains in the market. With speed of up to 65,000 trades each second (TPS) and cheap costs, Solana is now a favorite for DeFi sites, NFTs and games on blockchain.

However, analysts at Citi share a positive sentiment. How will 2025 turn out to be for altcoins, then? CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju tweeted on Jan. 10 that the altcoin market is in a “zero-sum PvP game”, where the gains are largely internal, with no new capital inflow in the market. This means that in the current altcoin market, for one person to win, another has to lose the exact amount. It’s reminiscent of a competitive game in which the overall money pool is not really increasing. Ju says that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market value has doubled while the total market capitalization of altcoins is still under past all-time highs, with “only 3-5 altcoins” that have a real use case and robust narratives being the ones that can survive.

Only a few alts with strong use cases and narratives will survive. https://t.co/d5I0gyg14f pic.twitter.com/XArcEd9uKe — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) January 9, 2025 However, altcoins’ fate is predicted to have a different outlook. Citi analysts argue that the sector could be in for a much brighter future. Ethereum ( ETH ), the only cryptocurrency besides BTC given the go-ahead for spot ETFs , is considered an increasingly likely target of rotation within the market, reported Jinshi on Jan. 8, 2025. Citi analysts believe that BTC’s 2024 breakout was something to behold, soaring 116% on the year, with major catalysts including the approval of spot BTC ETFs, the halving event that took place mid-April, and Donald Trump winning the U.S. election. However, ‘altcoin season’ in 2025 after a “strong year for Bitcoin” is more probable, says analysts, as ETH has been up 59% in a month’s time. Analysts also foresee growth for Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Tron ( TRX ). You might also like: 5 altcoins under $1 that could make someone a crypto millionaire in 2025 How will altcoins perform in 2025? In 2025, new narratives are likely to emerge and VC activity could rebound significantly. According to Pitchbook , crypto fundraising in Q1 2024 surged to $2.4 billion across 518 deals, reflecting a 40.3% increase in invested capital and a 44.7% uptick in deal volume compared to the previous quarter. AI, for example, landed the largest funding in Q3 with $106 million at a $1.1 billion pre-money valuation. These numbers indicate an increasing appetite from investors for early-stage projects. Early-stage deals experienced a 148.3% year-on-year increase in median pre-money valuation. If these trends continue, investments in particular projects and categories that are well-positioned to succeed in the long run would see a surge, reinforcing both Ju’s focus on robust narratives and Citi analyst’s prediction of a wider “altcoin season”.

This is a good development for crypto since CIS is heavily regulated. The order from the Treasury amends part of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which concerns group investments. It clarifies that “arrangements for qualifying crypto asset staking do not amount to a collective investment scheme”. The order, which will take effect on January 31, states that “qualifying crypto asset staking” means authenticating contracts on the blockchain, a distributed ledger technology network, or “other similar technology.” Blockchain technology operations present a cybersecurity issue According to Bill Hughes, director of global regulatory matters and Consensys’ lawyer, the amendment is a good development for crypto staking because there are strict regulations on managing and promoting CIS. He added that the way blockchain operates shouldn’t be construed as an investment but rather as cybersecurity. Good news frens. It looks like that, by the end of the month, proof of stake mechanisms underlying certain blockchains (e.g. #Ethereum #Solana ) will not be considered collective investment schemes under UK law. This is a good development because the management and promotion of… pic.twitter.com/JJgEO5rmPP — Bill Hughes : wchughes.eth 🦊 (@BillHughesDC) January 9, 2025 The UK categorizes collective investment schemes as any disposition where participants earn profits or income, including investment funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs.) The Financial Conduct Authority takes its mandate very seriously in regulating CIS. Before venturing into collective investment schemes, one must register and get authorization. Also, agency-approved monitors will continuously check the ongoing compliance commitments. Staking is a process that allows network participants to earn rewards by locking their native coins to validate transactions in blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana. UK takes a step towards achieving a crypto regulatory framework In November 2024, the Treasury promised to deliver a crypto regulatory framework by early 2025. The latest order appears like a headstart towards the Treasury promise. “For me, it doesn’t make sense for staking services to have this treatment. The government intends to proceed with removing this legal uncertainty accordingly.” – Tulip Siddiq In the same period, Tulip Siddiq, economic secretary to the Treasury, informed a London conference that the framework would cover staking services, stablecoins, and crypto. The local crypto industry had advocated against crypto staking being included as a collective investment scheme because of the strict regulations, and Siddiq agreed.

Meanwhile, economist Timothy Peterson has set a bold 2035 price target of $1.5 million per Bitcoin, attributing the projection to Bitcoin's expanding network value. US Bitcoin Reserves Dominate Offshore Holdings Amid Institutional Demand Surge Bitcoin reserves held by US-based entities have soared to unprecedented levels, significantly outpacing those held offshore, according to recent data from CryptoQuant. As of Jan. 9, the reserve share of US entities has reached an all-time high, with reserves 65% greater than those held by offshore players. This marked dominance represents a significant shift in the distribution of Bitcoin ownership, reflecting the growing institutional demand and regulatory clarity in the US market. CryptoQuant data highlights a steady climb in the ratio of Bitcoin reserves held by US entities compared to offshore counterparts. The ratio, which stood at 1.24 in September 2024, surged to a peak of 1.66 in December, holding steady at 1.65 as of January 2025. This means that for every Bitcoin held offshore, US entities now hold 65% more. The metric considers Bitcoin holdings of major US players, including corporations like MicroStrategy, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchanges, miners, and the US government. This data sheds light on the significant impact of US-based institutional and governmental involvement in the Bitcoin market. The surge in US Bitcoin holdings coincides with a robust rally in Bitcoin’s price. In September 2024, when Bitcoin was trading at $60,000, offshore entities held a majority of reserves. However, as Bitcoin soared past $100,000, peaking at $108,135, US reserve dominance reached record levels. MicroStrategy, a key player in the corporate adoption of Bitcoin, exemplifies this trend. The company disclosed a recent purchase of 1,070 BTC between Dec. 30 and Dec. 31, 2024, at an average price of $94,004 per Bitcoin. This $101 million acquisition brought MicroStrategy’s total holdings to an astounding 447,470 BTC, worth approximately $28 billion—accounting for 2.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, funded by convertible note sales, indicates a growing appetite among US institutions for Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The introduction of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has also fueled the surge in US-held Bitcoin reserves. According to Sosovalue , these ETFs have attracted inflows of $106.8 billion to date, offering both institutional and retail investors a regulated and accessible route to Bitcoin exposure. These ETFs, combined with growing regulatory clarity in the US market, have provided a fertile ground for institutional adoption, driving the dominance of US entities in Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin Price Corrections and Market Dynamics Despite the positive momentum, Bitcoin has faced a healthy price correction after crossing the $100,000 milestone. Bitcoin’s price retraced to $93,000 following a brief dip to $92,500, triggered by concerns over the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening for 2025. According to CoinGlass , the crypto market saw $521 million in liquidations during this correction, with $345 million stemming from long positions. The sell-off was exacerbated by hotter-than-expected US job data, with JOLTS job openings rising to 8.1 million against a forecast of 7.74 million. The labor market strength spurred risk-off sentiment, causing long-term bond yields to spike and triggering a sell-off in risky assets like Bitcoin. CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno described the ongoing price correction as “healthy,” noting that traders’ unrealized profit margins have declined, which is expected after such a robust rally. Analysts believe the $95,000 level serves as a critical support zone, potentially setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next upward move. With institutional interest showing no signs of waning, and US entities continuing to accumulate Bitcoin at an aggressive pace, the outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish in the long term. The current dominance of US entities in Bitcoin reserves marks a new chapter in the cryptocurrency’s evolution, underscoring the pivotal role of institutional adoption and regulatory clarity in shaping the market’s future. Bitcoin's Bold Future: Analyst Predicts $1.5 Million Price Tag by 2035 Bitcoin has always been a magnet for bold predictions, and the latest forecast is no exception. Timothy Peterson, a renowned network economist and author of the influential paper Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value, has set a new benchmark for Bitcoin’s long-term potential. In a post on X dated Jan. 8, Peterson confidently forecast that Bitcoin will reach a staggering $1.5 million per coin by 2035. Peterson’s projection is rooted in his model, which applies Metcalfe’s Law—a principle that correlates the value of a network to the square of its number of users—to Bitcoin’s expanding global adoption. “The year is 2035. Bitcoin is at—and you can hold me to this—$1.5 million,” Peterson declared, hinting at the inevitability of Bitcoin’s dominance as its network effect strengthens. Peterson’s bullish outlook isn’t new. His 2018 paper argued that Bitcoin’s value is best understood through models that account for network connectivity rather than traditional currency valuation metrics. He has consistently championed Bitcoin as an asset class poised for exponential growth. Peterson’s confidence isn’t without precedent. In 2020, his “Lowest Price Forward” indicator accurately predicted that Bitcoin would never again trade below $10,000—a claim that has held true to this day. Last year, he pinpointed Bitcoin’s local price bottom in September to within eight days, further bolstering his reputation as a reliable analyst in the crypto space. His confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory was reiterated in a Jan. 2 post where he described recent market conditions as “nothing special,” expressing his belief that Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition far outweighs short-term price fluctuations. While Peterson’s long-term projection paints a bright future for Bitcoin, the near-term outlook remains a topic of debate. Bitcoin, currently trading at $93,535, has faced mixed market sentiment as it consolidates following a bullish Q4 in 2024. Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, summarized the current sentiment succinctly: “This dip isn’t done dipping.” Alan pointed to ongoing price suppression, with buyers waiting for lower entry points around $86,500—a level that represents a 20% correction from Bitcoin’s recent all-time high of $108,135. Alan also highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to fill a CME gap at $77,900, indicating a significant downside risk before the next bullish rally can take hold. The Role of Macro Events and Institutional Momentum The upcoming inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump has added another layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Market observers are watching closely for policy changes that could impact Bitcoin’s trajectory, particularly as institutional players continue to play an outsized role in shaping its price. Institutions have fueled much of Bitcoin’s recent rally, with spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and corporate treasuries accumulating substantial reserves. These developments align with Peterson’s thesis that Bitcoin’s value will scale alongside its adoption and integration into mainstream financial systems. Peterson’s forecast of $1.5 million per Bitcoin by 2035 is a strong indication of the transformative potential of Bitcoin as a network-driven asset. His prediction serves as a reminder of the groundbreaking changes Bitcoin has already undergone and the revolutionary possibilities it still holds. However, as with any investment, the path to Peterson’s target is unlikely to be linear. Market corrections, regulatory shifts, and macroeconomic factors will continue to create volatility. For traders and investors, this means balancing optimism about Bitcoin’s future with a clear-eyed view of its present challenges.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-10 05:30:00

According to a Bloomberg report , Ned Finkel, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, said in a statement, “The extreme ‘country cap’ policy will affect mainstream computers in countries around the world, doing nothing to promote national security” but will instead encourage global markets to leverage alternative technologies. The soon-to-be-announced rules stipulate that US-made artificial intelligence chips will be sold only under a strict limit. These restrictions, applied to both countries and individual companies, would shrink exports across much of the globe. The restrictions are part of a much longer effort by the United States to get China and Russia to stop accessing advanced technology. Nvidia pushes back on AI Chip Restrictions, cites misguided policy According to the top seller of AI accelerators used by data centers to build cutting-edge AI models, the technology behind those chips is actually derived from GPUs that were initially designed for gaming and other uses. “It makes no sense for the Biden White House to control everyday data-center computers and technology that is already in gaming PCs worldwide, disguised as an anti-China move,” Finkle added. Sources familiar with the matter say the US is preparing to enforce new chip export restrictions as soon as Friday, splitting products into three tiers. Under the plan, American semiconductors would be fully available to US allies. However, most other countries would be restricted in new ways, including caps on the total amount of computing power that could be shipped to a country in any given year. The White House’s National Security Council declined to comment on the pending rules announcement.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto investors are shifting focus from giants like Ripple and Solana to emerging gems like Remittix, a promising platform poised to redefine cross-border payments. Table of Contents What is Remittix? Solana crypto whales want better prospects Ripple goes mainstream The bottom line Crypto market sentiments are starting to shift from established projects to small, upcoming gems with strong potential. Of course crypto whales are still into the big guys, coins like Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and so on. However, there’s renewed interest in projects like Remittix, dubbed to be the ‘next XRP’ due to its groundbreaking use case for cross border transfers. What is Remittix? R emi ttix is a game changing payment platform that can be used by anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world. It allows users to essentially send fiat to bank accounts right from their crypto wallets. In other words, Remittix lets users convert over 50 crypto assets into more than 30 different fiat currencies, enabling them to transfer to bank accounts all over the world. It offers faster transactions, lower costs and is more convenient than traditional money transfer institutions like Stripe and MoneyGram. In fact, as money transfer methods evolve over time, this new platform looks set to become an important player, making it a top investment opportunity for crypto whales and retail investors. Currently in presale, Remittix is priced at $0.0193 and has raised $2.2 million from investors already. Alongside this, over 130 million RTX tokens have been snapped up by ambitious traders and with its current trajectory it is expected that Remittix’s presale will sell out quicker than initially anticipated. Solana crypto whales want better prospects Solana price has shown strong resilience in the last couple of weeks. After suffering a major drop last December, SOL has now bounced back up above $200. However, this price level is still miles off its all-time high of $263 achieved last year. With such a strong start to the year, analysts are quite optimistic about Solana’s future. Several experts predict that the Solana price could hit $330 in the short term while others suggest a rise to $1000 in the long run is possible. Also, Solana’s Fear and Greed index is off the charts, with loads of people picking up SOL. You might also like: Forget Solana and XRP: Remittix gains attention in the crypto market Ripple goes mainstream The Bank of America uses XRP for 100% of its internal transactions, according to Sound Planning Group CEO David Stryzewski. This makes Ripple a crucial tool in the financial industry potentially, as institutional investors continue to take special interest in XRP. Ripple’s stablecoin launch also improves its standing in the payment industry, and XRP could potentially be the track that everything runs on in the future. These positive developments only point to an XRP rally in the near future, and crypto whales are ready to pounce. The bottom line Solana and Ripple are both looking like sound investment options right now. Both tokens have a broad following and are well-poised to benefit significantly from pro-crypto government regulations introduced by the incoming Trump administration. However, to maximize profits, crypto whales are adding Remittix to their portfolios. It provides superior ROI and is set to dominate the global remittances market. Dubbed the “next XRP”, it is the ideal crypto investment option, and many people are flocking to its presale. For a price as little as $0.0193 per token, smart investors looking for a great investment in 2025 are joining the Remittix presale. With a massive projected gain of 430% once launched, Remittix is putting investors in the position to more than quadruple their initial investment. Crypto analysts have earmarked incredible ROI for early RTX investors, but given its potential and rising status, the actual profits could be higher.

Arthur Hayes Predicts March Meltdown,https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-price-crash-arthur-hayes-predicts-march-meltdown/,"Elon Musk’s warning triggers a sharp Bitcoin price drop, heightening market uncertainty. Arthur Hayes predicts a significant Bitcoin crash by late March due to liquidity pressures. Tightening liquidity and rising interest rates may prolong Bitcoin’s market weakness. Bitcoin was recently above $100,000, but now it’s down to around $93,000. This drop has made the crypto sell-off worse. The trigger for this downturn comes from none other than Elon Musk, the tech billionaire, who unexpectedly warned about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. His cautionary message spooked investors, leaving many to reconsider their positions. The broader market, including stocks, has followed suit, reacting to this new uncertainty. With crypto investors on edge, the outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appears increasingly volatile.

Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) are commonly top choices due to their strong track records. However, those seeking the highest returns are increasingly investing in Remittix (RTX). While SOL could potentially rise above $300 and XRP may trade between $4 and $5, RTX is poised for significant growth. Analysts predict that Remittix (RTX) , a new player in the PayFi sector, could yield over 50 times gains due to its potential impact on the multi-trillion-dollar remittance industry. Solana (SOL) To $300 Still in Play As Bulls Defend Key Support The crypto market was hit with its first major dip of 2025, with Solana (SOL) joining other top crypto coins with double-digit losses. From being rejected at the $200 resistance, the Solana price has plunged back to the $190 range, price data from CoinMarketCap shows. Investors may have been worried about the price drop, but one of the biggest crypto analysts, CryptoWizardd , is feeling upbeat. The Solana crypto price chart shared by the analyst shows that $SOL is still in the bid range. $SOL is also trading within a descending trendline pattern, with $190 being the key level to watch for investors. If Solana breaks above this level, then analysts predict a rally could erupt that will take the altcoin price above $300 for a new ATH. Bullish Continuation To Send Ripple (XRP) To $4-$5 In Q4 2024, the Ripple price action caught the attention of investors, pumping by more than 4x. However, the altcoin has lost a bit of steam, consolidating between the $2.30 and $2.60 range on the weekly timeframe on CoinMarketCap . The partnership with Chainlink is a major XRP news that investors expected to swing the trend. While it hasn’t happened yet, Trader_A_A has shared a Ripple price chart showing that it has been trading in a bull flag pattern since early December. $XRP is expected to break out of this bull flag pattern very soon, and it will mark the continuation of the bull run for Ripple (XRP). Based on the analysis, if $XRP breaks out of this pattern, it could rally to new highs between $4 and $5. With this potential increase of 75 – 110%, Ripple (XRP) is one of the best altcoins to buy in Q1 2025, as it will fetch good returns. Investors Shift Attention To the Innovative PayFi Giant, Remittix (RTX) 2017 was one of the most iconic rallies recorded by XRP, as prices rose by more than 50x. Investors believe Remittix (RTX) could do this again because it’s in the cross-border market just like Ripple, but it comes up with some innovative features that could change the $190 trillion market. Remittix is building the perfect bridge between cryptos and the traditional financial industry. It will give everyone access to 50+ cryptocurrencies, more than Ripple’s $XRP. In addition, they will be able to swap cryptocurrencies for 30+ fiat currencies. Individuals and businesses will also be able to instantly send fiat in their Remittix accounts to bank accounts all over the world. It operates with a flat charge and no extra transaction fees on FX or wire transfers. These features are focused on bridging the gap between TradeFi and DeFi to make crypto payments easy for everyone in the DeFi space and beyond. This is why many DeFi market experts believe Remittix will grow to more than $1 from its current price of $0.0193. Why Remittix Beats Solana and XRP As the Best Crypto To Buy Investors are likely to experience significant gains from Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) over the next few weeks. However, financial experts anticipate even more explosive growth from Remittix. This newer project is well-positioned in a large market and has a lower market cap than both SOL and XRP. With these factors in mind, it’s easy to understand why experts believe that RTX could become the next 50x crypto gem.

Chainalysis claims the program has been successful after it led them to uncover an estimated $25 million in losses and over 1,100 victims of fraud. Operation Spincaster was first launched in 2024 to deal with the rising threat of cryptocurrency scams. At the time, the most pressing issue was approval phishing — a tactic used to deceive users into authorizing malicious blockchain transactions granting the scammers access to the victim’s funds. The estimated losses from approval phishing ranged from $1 billion to $2.7 billion between May 2021 and mid-2024. This alarming trend necessitated the need for Operation Spincaster. The operation was conducted across six countries, one of which was Canada, and led to the recovery of an estimated $162 million in losses. This year, Chainalysis teamed up with law enforcement in Delta, Canada, and has once more achieved great success. Chainalysis teams up with law enforcement in Delta The joint collaboration of the blockchain analytics firm, Chainalysis and Canadian law enforcement outfits put about 240 crypto addresses under the microscope. This led the team to uncover an estimated $25 million in losses and over a thousand victims. A significant number of these victims were Canadians. Nearly 100 leads were shared, which led to investigations of scams involving approval phishing. The operation brought together seven different law enforcement agencies and two cryptocurrency exchanges, including Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Victoria Police, the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC), the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA), the British Columbia Prosecution Service, the Vancouver Police Department, Shakepay, and others. Chainalysis training results Chainalysis provided hands-on training to the LEAs during the collaboration. The participating agents were then able to apply the new techniques they had learned to a previous investigation. The newly trained agents identified new stolen cryptocurrency funds in a blacklisted address containing $1.2 million. The account was already in the process of being seized by an overseas LEA. The cybercrime unit at Delta police department also identified an additional 70 transactions with a total value of $800K sent from Canadian exchanges. Those exchanges are currently in the process of notifying the victims and retrieving the funds so they can be returned. Chainalysis maintains its commitment to advancing blockchain intelligence and continued cooperation with law enforcement agencies to protect users. The early success of Operation Spincaster could make fighting cybercrime and fraud less challenging for law enforcement and equip them to reduce the number of future victims.

The decision follows Ahlgren’s conviction in a groundbreaking case focused on tax-related cryptocurrency fraud last year. This marks a significant moment in the enforcement of digital asset laws. The Court’s Ruling U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ruled that Ahlgren must reveal the encryption keys to his crypto wallets and identify all storage devices holding digital assets. This measure is intended to recover $1 million in restitution owed by Ahlgren after his conviction. JUST IN: TEXAS MAN ORDERED BY FEDERAL JUDGE TO SURRENDER PRIVATE KEYS TO $124M IN CRYPTO — BSCN Headlines (@BSCNheadlines) January 9, 2025 While the court allows limited access to funds for living expenses, it has prohibited Ahlgren and his associates from moving or hiding the assets without prior approval. Background of the Case Nicknamed “Paco,” Ahlgren faced a seven-count indictment in 2023 for misreporting capital gains from $3.7 million in Bitcoin transactions. Prosecutors from the Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed that Ahlgren used sophisticated blockchain techniques to hide the extent of his gains and lied to his accountant about his earnings. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg highlighted Ahlgren’s efforts to obscure his activities, calling it a critical case for cryptocurrency tax compliance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Plunging Down: Is Ethereum Sliding Below $3000 as Bitcoin Heads to $88,000? , Why This Matters This case sets an example for how tax violations involving cryptocurrency are handled.

The decision also reflects the increasing focus on cryptocurrency enforcement. According to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic, U.S. regulators are stepping up their efforts while lawmakers work on creating clearer crypto rules. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The crypto advisory council is anticipated to be established after Trump assumes office, and with his inauguration just under two weeks away, crypto executives are hastily making contributions to the inaugural committee. Multiple crypto CEOs have pledged tokens to the inaugural committee Securing a position on the proposed crypto council has become a top priority for many industry leaders eager to shape the new administration’s policies on digital assets. With the council expected to include around two dozen CEOs and founders, executives are rushing to curry favor with President-elect Donald Trump. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, has already donated $1 million USDC tokens to Donald Trump’s inaugural committee. In an X post on January 9, he commented : Circle has contributed 1M USDC to President Trump's Inaugural Committee. We are excited to be building a great American company, and the fact that the Committee took payment in USDC is an indicator of how far we have come, and the potential and power of digital dollars. — Jeremy Allaire – jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) January 9, 2025 Moreover, in December, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek met with Trump at the Florida golf resort, Mar-a-Lago. Sources say they talked about crypto appointments in financial departments, Congress, and the incoming administration and even discussed the national Bitcoin reserve. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, has also promised to give $1 million to the inaugural committee. Its CEO, Brian Armstrong, has been actively in talks with Trump over the past few weeks. Kraken and startup Ondo also pledged $1 million each to the president-elect’s inaugural committee, while Ripple announced its plan to contribute $5 million worth of XRP tokens in December. The crypto industry supports Trump’s new administration The crypto industry will host an event just before Trump’s inauguration to show support for the new government.

However, market analyst James Van Straten argues that fears of a dramatic impact on Bitcoin's price may be overblown. Van Straten explained that while the amount of Bitcoin involved is significant, any liquidation is likely to be conducted in a calculated and orderly manner to maximize returns. “If the Justice Department were to sell this Bitcoin, it would likely be done in a manner that minimizes market disruption,” he said. Moreover, the potential for such a sell-off has been known by the market for some time, reducing the likelihood of a sudden shock. “The possibility of these Bitcoins being sold may have already been priced in by market expectations,” he added. Related News: Will Solana Spot ETFs be Approved in the US? One of the Largest SOL Companies Commented Van Straten also highlighted the market’s ability to absorb large amounts of Bitcoin. Since September, more than 1 million BTC has been absorbed by the market, even as long-term holders (those who have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days) have reduced their positions. “Long-term holders currently own 13.1 million Bitcoins. Despite this change, the price of Bitcoin has risen from around $60,000 in September to over $100,000 today,” Van Straten said, emphasizing the resilience of the market. To further support his argument, Van Straten pointed to a similar situation in 2023 where the German government sold around 50,000 BTC worth $3.5 billion at the time. “The market reacted before the sell-off, with Bitcoin bottoming out at around $55,000 on July 7.

Veteran Wall Street investor Raoul Pal expects the Global M2 Money supply to expand once again, triggering a strong recovery in BTC from here onwards. Will Bitcoin Price Follow Global M2 Expansion Similar to 2016-17? The Global M2 money supply has been falling in the last two years, which led to discussions that Bitcoin doesn’t have enough liquidity support for the price rally to continue. Founder of Global Macro Investor and Wall Street veteran Raoul Pal said investors should not panic from the recent market movements. The global money is exactly similar to the 2016-17 charts and could probably witness a strong expansion moving ahead, he added. Source: Raoul Pal However, the major concern among investors is that while the global money supply has shrunk in the last 2 years, Bitcoin price hasn’t retraced enough to stage a trend reversal. For several years, BTC has been closely following the M2 supply. Thus, if it repeats this pattern, we might see a drop to $70,000 before resuming the uptrend. Several market analysts are already stressing this possibility considering macro headwinds ahead. Source: Raoul Pal BTC Follows 2016 Pattern However, Pal counters this fear rhetoric by showing that Bitcoin price is showing an exactly similar move to that in 2016. Sharing a chart of the current BTC movement and the 2016 pattern, Pal wrote: “It’s all going to be just fine. Maybe a bit lower or maybe it’s done already. Either way, higher over time. Don’t expect an exact repeat but a rhyme. Valhalla waits. Don’t Fuck This Up”. Source: Raoul Pal Bitcoin Will Be Gold on Steroids Chris Kuiper , the Director of Research at Fidelity Digital Assets, recently noted that the US economy could see a stagflation-like condition similar to the 1970s. The report draws parallels between the current economic environment and 1977, predicting a surge in inflation over the next three years. However, Kuiper believes that Bitcoin can play a crucial role in this scenario while acting as “gold on steroids”. As per historical data, Gold and CPI experienced significant spikes in the three years following January 1977. The Fidelity report that this time we could see a Bitcoin price surge repeating this pattern. Source: Fidelity Bitcoin Price Volatility Ahead? With the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data due on January 15 next week, investors are bracing for BTC price volatility ahead. With Bitcoin already correcting more than 15% from its all-time high levels, it is currently trading at a crucial support level. Speaking on the current price action, popular crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted: “Bitcoin has dwindled to pretty much the very bottom of its $91000-$101165 range. Needs to hold the $91k Range Low as support (blue) to avoid further downside and actually deepening this multi-week corrective period”. Source: Rekt Capital As analysts predict a BTC price recovery ahead, the Bitcoin open interest shows a decline in the speculative momentum. “The mid-term trendline (30-day SMA) peaked and is now slightly declining, while the short-term trendline (7-day SMA) has fallen below it.

This week’s expiry event is very similar to last week’s , which did not have any direct impact on spot markets. Bitcoin has been in retreat for the past few days following its latest foray into six-figure territory. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.65, which means that there are more long (call) contracts expiring than short (put) contract sellers. Open interest, or the value or number of options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $120,000 strike price, with $1.48 billion in OI, according to Deribit. There is also over $1 billion in OI at the $100,000 and $110,000 strike prices, with speculators remaining relatively bullish. “In terms of options data, short-term IVs (implied volatility) rebounded slightly but remained at low levels, with the market pricing in future volatility unchanged,” commented crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live earlier this week. Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit “We do not see the same level of exuberance in leveraged positions that had marked the first two forays above the key psychological 6-figure mark,” reported Deribit in its weekly insight. It added that futures trading is profitable for those betting on short positions against Bitcoin (puts). However, more traders are still buying calls. In addition to today’s Bitcoin options, around 140,000 Ethereum contracts are expiring today. These have a notional value of $455 million and a put/call ratio of 0.47. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2.2 billion. Crypto Market Correction Deepens Total crypto market capitalization has tanked a further 4.4% on the day to $3.37 trillion at the time of writing. Markets may have been rattled by the premise of the US government selling billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin but the asset remains within its rangebound channel. Bitcoin slid to an intraday low of $91,250 but recovered to reclaim the $93,000 level during Friday morning trading in Asia. However, it has lost another 2% over the past 24 hours and is down 9% since it topped six figures on Jan. 7. The asset is approaching the lower bounds of a sideways channel that began in mid-November and it needs to hold this level to prevent a larger break to the downside. #BTC Bitcoin has dwindled to pretty much the very bottom of its $91000-$101165 range Needs to hold the $91k Range Low as support (blue) to avoid further downside and actually deepening this multi-week corrective period $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/Bn24aJuxtd pic.twitter.com/doIFyA6qYU — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) January 9, 2025 Ethereum and the altcoins were all in the red this Friday morning as the market correction deepened on US inflation fears and FUD over the potential selloff.

With the market expected to react positively as he reassumes office for his second term, the top altcoins on whales’ radars are Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and IntelMarkets (INTL) . Given their large market size, popular cryptos like ETH and SHIB are expected to be at the forefront of this upswing. Meanwhile, INTL, a new and promising AI gem, has great upside, tipped to go as high as 25x after the scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next AI Coin to Explode IntelMarkets (INTL), one of the fastest-rising AI cryptos, is on whales’ radars for its bullish narrative and huge growth prospects. This week, it skyrocketed over 10% from $0.073 to $0.082, combining with the 700% rally in the past few months. Early participants in the presale are already in profit, with more anticipated. This quarter, the scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges might be followed by a 25x jump in value, set to outperform Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH). This contributes to the rising presale interest, pushing early funding past $6.3 million in the eighth ICO round. Meanwhile, it will be different from existing protocols as it will combine AI technology with blockchain and DeFi. Its unique offering will be an AI-powered trading platform, offering users unmatched computing power, automated trading bots, and an AI-based blockchain. Additionally, users can trade diverse asset crypto pairs with up to 1000x leverage on select assets—the next big thing, perhaps. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Eyes a Big Leap Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading dog-themed cryptocurrency alongside DOGE, is among the top crypto coins. The rising whale interest can be linked to its retail appeal, simple narrative and growth prospects, not forgetting its budget-friendliness. It hovers around $0.00002, eyeing a breakout above the next resistance. This is supported by key technical indicators like the 200-EMA and 200-SMA, suggesting a bounce in the Shiba Inu price. Experts are also confident about a rally, placing it among the altcoins to watch. A top crypto analyst, InvestingHaven, maintains a bullish stance, predicting a rally toward $0.0000743 and $0.000088. Despite the significant upside potential, investors favoring IntelMarkets (INTL) over Shiba Inu (SHIB) is understandable, considering the former’s projected 25x upswing in Q1. Ethereum (ETH): Poised for a Breakout Above $4,000 Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin, consolidates below $4,000, with a breakout expected any moment. Key technical indicators like the MACD Level (12, 26) and 100-EMA hint at a bounce, positioning it among the best coins to invest in. JabaTheX, a top analyst, expects a rally past $7,200—January might be a great start for this jump. Nilesh Rohilla, another top analyst, expects a breakout above $3,500 and $4,100, making Ethereum (ETH) a top crypto to invest in. However, to make the most of the upcoming bull run, IntelMarkets (INTL) might be a better bet. The anticipated 25x upswing after Tier-1 exchange listings positions it as a more compelling alternative to Ethereum (ETH). IntelMarkets (INTL): Whales Top Pick Alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH) IntelMarkets (INTL) , the novel AI coin, is on whales’ radars for its significant upside potential. The projected 25x rally after its scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges this quarter, coupled with its novel AI-powered trading platform, makes it a must-have alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ethereum (ETH).

Despite this sudden collapse in BTC & other altcoins, whales seem to be taking advantage of this volatility to accumulate 25,000 ETH. What’s next? A market bottom and a rally or collapse in ETH’s value? Let’s explore. Ethereum Price Today: ETH is up No data found for ethereum on 1 hour ago% Ethereum (ETH) price today trades at No data found for ethereum on 1 hour ago as of No data found for ethereum on 1 hour ago. Although the token showed strength at the end of 2024, it has dropped nearly 16% since Monday this week. Whales and top holders took advantage of this crash and accumulated roughly 25,000 ETH. From a daily high of No data found for ethereum on 1 hour ago ETH price is down No data found for ethereum on 1 hour ago% on January 10. Ethereum Price Chart Today Ethereum price chart today shows a recovery from $3,220 to roughly $3,260 *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 1 hour ago. Ethereum Whales Accumulate 25,000 ETH After Recent Crypto Market Crash Data from Santiment shows that the supply of ETH held on exchanges dropped from 10.67 million on January 7 to $10.42 million today. Roughly 25,000 tokens were transferred off centralized platforms, which shows confidence and hints that long-term holders are forecasting a price rally. Interestingly, The same chart also shows top holders’ (other than exchanges) balance increased by 25,000, which is a clear sign of accumulation by whales ETH Supply on Exchanges, Top Holder Balance Generally, investors with more than $100,000 in capital are considered high net worth or whales. If transactions worth more than $100K spike after a rally, it can be seen as these whales looking to book profits. Hence, often, a spike in whale transaction count after a rally can be viewed as a sell signal. However, an uptick in such transfers after major crashes often indicates accumulation from these investors and markets a bottom. During the late Thursday crash, whale transactions worth more than $100K and $1 million saw a significant increase, further adding credence to our notion of an accumulation from smart investors. Ethereum Whales Buy the Dip Is The Bottom In Yet? With such strong evidence of smart money accumulation, retail investors must prepare for a potential reversal. This recovery rally and resumption of the bull run will occur if Bitcoin bottoms. As noted, the January 9 swing low at $91,151 could be the bottom. If BTC slides lower, with a bullish swing failure pattern at $90,835, it could signal that a reversal is imminent. Hence, Ethereum could also be close to forming a stable bottom that could kickstart a bull rally. Is Bitcon Bottom In? Most likely. January 9’s swing low ($91,151) could be the bottom. If not, then a sweep of $90,835 with a bullish swing failure pattern could suggest that a bottom is imminent. https://t.co/H2Spj0mvEM pic.twitter.com/ohZ0zmlIsB — MAXPAIN (@Mangyek0) January 10, 2025 Ethereum Price Analysis and Strategic Targets For January 2025 The daily chart shows an inverse head-and-shoulder setup forming on Ethereum. This setup hints at a bullish reversal and the end of a downtrend or consolidation. It contains three distinctive bottom formations, the central one lower than the other two, denoting the head. While the one on either side of the head is termed the shoulders. Hence, the namesake. In this case, the technical formation forecasts a 44% rally to $5,825, obtained by adding the head’s depth to the breakout point at $4,000. However, investors can expect the bull run to resume if Bitcoin ends the ongoing downtrend by forming a bottom on January 9 or 10. In such a scenario, Ethereum could go beyond $5,825 and potentially tag the $6,000 psychological level before January 2025 ends. Some key support levels include $3,278, $3,029, $3,000 and $2,739. While the inverse head-and-shoulder setup is bullish, it needs to finish forming even before a breakout can be considered. Hence, some key resistance levels that Ethereum price needs to overcome are $3,600, $3,843, $4,000. Ethereum price prediction notes some strategic levels for January 2025 for investors to book profits : $4,500, $5,000, $5,500, $5,825 and $6,000. ETH/USDT 1-day chart On the other hand, a breakdown of the $3,029 support levels will invalidate the inverse head-and-shoulder setup mentioned above. Such a development could knock ETH down to $2,800 and lower levels. In conclusion, despite Ethereum’s recent 16% drop, whales have taken advantage of the volatility to accumulate 25,000 ETH. S trong evidence suggests smart money accumulation which retail investors need to pay attention to and look for a potential reversal. The target for Ethereum in January 2025 includes a local top formation at $5,825 or $6,000.

However, market experts like Wizz and Alek are still bullish, as they made some bold price predictions for them. Nevertheless, DTX Exchange (DTX) , a new player in the game, is swiftly taking over the crypto market. This token is now in phase seven of its presale and has rewarded early investors with a 600% return. Moreover, its recently launched hybrid trading platform has already onboarded over 300K users. This level of interest is rare in the crypto sphere. Therefore, some analysts hint that DTX could be the next 5x crypto coin in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Stuns Early Buyers With a 600% Surge As Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are experiencing price dips, DTX Exchange (DTX) is showing bullish momentum. Many traders are rushing to its crypto ICO event, which has been on fire lately. Notably, early investors in DTX Exchange are already 600% richer. Recently, DTX Exchange made headlines by launching its hybrid trading platform, which combines the best of CEX and DEX. On it, people will get access to over 120K asset classes at up to 1000x leverage. These will include CFDs, crypto coins, stocks, etc. Furthermore, no sign-up KYC checks will be needed, meaning traders will always remain anonymous. This launch was preceded by the CoinMarketCap listing of its native token, DTX, which could bring millions of new eyes to this presale. Currently, this crypto coin costs only $0.14 in phase seven of its presale, but its value will rise to $0.16 after phase eight begins. Additionally, traders are waiting for a top-tier crypto exchange to list DTX, triggering a rally to $0.20. Wizz: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) Will Reach $1 Dogecoin (DOGE) is the most well-known name in the meme coin market. However, it has seen some turbulence recently. According to CoinMarketCap, its value has dropped nearly 20% in the past month alone. During that time, the Dogecoin price moved between $0.40 and almost $0.30. Nevertheless, crypto analyst Wizz remains optimistic about Dogecoin (DOGE). He criticized those who did not hold this meme coin in his X post. As a Dogecoin price prediction, Wizz foresees a potential pump to $1 soon. But, the high Dogecoin market cap of around $49B could be a problem for its long-term growth. In other words, this meme coin will need a lot of new money for its price to see a noteworthy jump. Because of this, many investors are gravitating to tokens like DTX instead. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Looks Ready To Go Past Resistance, Analyst Claims Shiba Inu (SHIB) is another meme coin showing some bearish movement. On the one-month chart, its value fell from around $0.000027 to nearly $0.000021. In other words, as per CoinMarketCap, the Shiba Inu price dropped over 20% in just a few weeks. But the crypto community is still keeping an eye on Shiba Inu (SHIB) following market expert Alek’s statement. According to his X post, this meme coin has set a cup and handle pattern that could lead to price growth. He predicts a jump to $0.000080 in his Shiba Inu price prediction. Although the Shiba Inu coin may see a price increase soon, some traders are still cautious. Since SHIB has already surged over 120% on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. As a result, traders choose to focus on DTX more. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Gain the Upper Hand Over Dogecoin (DOGE) & Shiba Inu (SHIB)? Although Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) could see big price gains soon, their lack of utility as meme coins could hinder their long-term growth potential. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) is a utility token that will give traders governance voting rights and a portion of the trading fee revenue made on this platform. Therefore, adoption may increase faster. Because of this, experts forecast a potential 5x surge for DTX this year.

However, at deeper levels beneath the surface, bargain hunters are quietly waiting to snap up coins and potentially put a floor under prices. On the major spot and perpetual futures exchanges, the uptrend at the quote level, the going market rate, has flipped to a downtrend, indicating more traders are willing to sell at the market price, according to data source Hyblock Capital. The order book depth from quote level (0%) and 1% shows a similar pattern. Order book depth represents the combined value of buy and sell orders at specific levels (1%, 2%, 5%) from the ongoing market price. It shows the market's ability to absorb large orders at stable prices. ""At the quote level, there was an upward trend, which has now shifted to a downward trend, indicating a selling pressure, which is generally where market makers (MMs) operate. Between the quote level to 1%, the action is the same as the MMs,"" Hyblock Capital said in an analysis post on X. Moreover, the seller dominance near the quote level is hardly surprising, given the recent price action in BTC, which has seen the leading cryptocurrency decline from over $102,000 to $94,000 in days, mainly due to renewed U.S. inflation concerns. On Thursday, at one point, prices slipped as low as $92,500. But the real story is the continued uptrend in market depth from 2% to 5%., which points to more bids relative to asks at price levels away from the going market rate. In other words, buyers are waiting to enter the market at those levels. ""Between 1% - 2% and 2% - 5% of the book, we see increased demand (more bids than asks over time),"" Hyblock added. Bitcoin changed hands at around $94,000 at press time, with traders awaiting Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls release to provide the next directional cue to risk assets.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-10 06:53:34

HTX will continue to drive technological innovation and industry development, striving to build a more inclusive, equitable, and open blockchain world and turning the decentralization dream into reality. In turn, it enables global users to enjoy freedom and opportunity within this new economic system. I. 2024 Global Web3 Blockchain Ecosystem Review The crypto market in 2024 kicked off with the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January. From a macroeconomic perspective, the crypto market is currently transitioning from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE), with QE expected to begin in the second quarter of 2025. Historical trends indicate that the peak of crypto bull markets rarely occurs during rate-cut cycles. Instead, it is more likely to happen at the end of rate-cut cycles, or just as a rate-hike cycle nears its end or even just begins. For example, the extreme easing policies triggered by the 2020 pandemic started a crypto bull run, which reached its peak at the end of 2021 as the Federal Reserve signaled a gradual shift toward tightening policies. Later, rate hikes officially commenced in 2022. Therefore, the market is still far from its bull market peak. On the whole, this bull market cycle may unfold in various ways. In particular, against the backdrop of Trump’s fiscal expansion policies and unprecedented crypto-friendly signals, a robust bull market is expected. Moreover, with regulatory easing and the entry of traditional financial institutions, Bitcoin will gain stronger support and gradually become a core dollar-denominated asset, aside from those tied to the dollar industry cycles (such as AI). The trend of decoupling between Bitcoin and the traditional altcoin market is expected to intensify. On the one hand, the benchmark interest rate is expected to decline to neutral levels by mid-2025. Whether there would be further rate cuts or tightening signals will depend on inflation levels at the time, as well as Trump’s ability to influence the Federal Reserve. If the Fed signals tightening measures to address inflation, the market may enter an adjustment phase that may last until May 2026, when Trump could have the chance to assert control over Fed policies. First, let’s revisit the key events in the global Web3 blockchain ecosystem in 2024. 1. Major Policy Shift The U.S. Approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs for the First TimeIn January 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) made a historic decision to approve the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETFs. This move undoubtedly represents a critical shift in U.S. regulatory agencies’ stance on virtual assets and marks a milestone for the Bitcoin market. The approved ETFs include products from 11 well-known financial institutions, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Hashdex, iShares, Valkyrie, Ark 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and Franklin. This move is of great significance because the SEC has long been cautious toward spot Bitcoin ETFs due to concerns over Bitcoin’s price volatility, risks of market manipulation, and investor protection. Since 2013, the SEC has rejected multiple proposals for spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially under the hard-line stance of former chair Jay Clayton and current chair Gary Gensler. Both had clearly opposed the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2017 and 2019, respectively, on the grounds of market instability and regulatory loopholes. However, in June 2023, BlackRock filed an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF, which broke the deadlock and quickly drew widespread attention. Later, Grayscale scored a big court win, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling that the SEC’s rejection of Grayscale’s application to convert GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF was “arbitrary and capricious”. Following this court decision, the SEC reevaluated the possibility of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which ultimately led to this approval. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs represents not only a major step forward for the U.S. market but also a bellwether for the global virtual asset market. The SEC’s decision brings Bitcoin closer to mainstream investment markets and is expected to attract more traditional financial investors. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs will significantly lower the barriers for investors to enter the Bitcoin market, especially for those from traditional finance, as they can trade Bitcoin directly through exchanges without relying on crypto exchanges or keeping Bitcoin in their own custody. More importantly, this approval could potentially have a far-reaching impact and set a precedent for regulatory agencies in other countries and regions, accelerating the compliance process for digital asset products. 2. Innovations in Asia: Hong Kong Pioneers Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs In April 2024, the Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong approved the launch of Asia’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. This decision underscores Hong Kong’s leading role in advancing the compliance of virtual assets and market innovation while further solidifying its position as a global financial center. Hong Kong’s move comes shortly after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., signaling a gradual shift of the global financial market towards greater openness and legal regulation of virtual assets. According to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), fund companies such as Bosera Funds, ChinaAMC (Hong Kong), and Harvest Global Investments have received in-principle approval from the SFC to launch spot virtual asset ETF products for Bitcoin and Ethereum. These ETFs will track the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum and will be listed on the HKEX, making it easier for ordinary investors to invest in these digital assets. Hong Kong’s launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs holds substantial significance for the Asian market. As a global financial hub, Hong Kong has been exploring effective ways to regulate and guide the development of the virtual asset market. In recent years, the city has strived to be a front-runner in regulating the crypto space and promoting compliance by actively aligning with international standards. This has offered valuable experiences and set an example for other regions. For instance, in 2022, Hong Kong pioneered virtual asset ETFs for institutional investors. This latest expansion into the retail market represents a continuation and deepening of those earlier policies. More importantly, Hong Kong’s introduction of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs provides innovative investment tools for the Asian market as well as consolidating its leading position in the global virtual asset sector. The successful rollout of these products is expected to attract more investors, making Hong Kong’s financial market increasingly diversified and internationally competitive. At the same time, it also offers valuable insights and references for other Asian regions, particularly mainland China, in introducing virtual asset products. 3. Bitcoin’s Fourth Halving: Market Expectations vs. Reality On April 20, 2024, Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving, reducing the mining reward from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins per block. This halving reignited widespread market discussions, as such events are often viewed as catalysts for Bitcoin’s price hikes. However, while the halving attracted significant attention, the market’s response was unprecedentedly complex. Historically, post-halving periods have seen substantial increases in Bitcoin’s price. The first halving occurred in 2012 when Bitcoin’s price was just $12.3, which soared to $1,217 by the end of 2013. The second halving took place in 2016, driving the price from $648 to a peak of $19,800 in 2017. The third halving in 2020 saw Bitcoin’s price surge from $8,560 to as high as $67,775. However, market sentiment was not as optimistic as before ahead of the halving in 2024. Analysts from financial institutions such as JPMorgan suggested that while the halving would draw market attention, Bitcoin’s price might drop instead due to its already high price levels and miners’ increased operational costs. They pointed out that miners potentially face exacerbated cost pressures post-halving and Bitcoin’s futures market might become another potential factor contributing to price volatility. Nonetheless, Bitcoin’s price did not decline sharply after the halving. Instead, it fluctuated briefly before quickly rebounding to around $66,000. This response indicates that Bitcoin’s long-term potential is still widely recognized. In particular, against the backdrop of growing uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment and financial markets, more investors have embraced Bitcoin as digital gold and a safe-haven asset. 4. U.S. Officially Approves Spot Ethereum ETFs On July 22, 2024, the SEC officially approved the listing and trading of spot Ethereum ETFs. This approval makes Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, the first digital asset after Bitcoin to launch a spot ETF in the U.S. market. This milestone is of great significance for the Ethereum market, as it has broadened institutional investors’ access to the Ethereum market and laid the foundation for listing compliant products of other digital assets. In fact, the SEC had given preliminary approval for spot Ethereum ETF applications from several companies on May 24, 2024, signaling Ethereum’s formal entry into mainstream financial markets. After months of review and regulatory assessment, the SEC made a final decision on July 22 to approve the listing and trading of spot Ethereum ETFs. The approval for spot ETFs of these two major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, signifies the growing maturity of crypto asset regulation in the U.S. Following the successful rollout of spot Bitcoin ETFs, U.S. regulatory agencies began loosening restrictions on other crypto assets. Meanwhile, the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs reflects a more open policy stance from the SEC toward the crypto space, laying the foundation for the future compliance of more digital assets. The introduction of spot Ethereum ETFs will make it easier for traditional financial market investors to participate in the Ethereum market. More than that, it will offer robust support for Ethereum’s liquidity and market stability. In addition, this event has undoubtedly injected fresh momentum into the global cryptocurrency market, drawing the attention of many institutional investors. It is expected to drive up Ethereum prices in the coming months and accelerate its market maturation. Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) Page on July 23 5. German Government Sells Off Bitcoin: Missing Out on $2.03 Billion in Potential Profits In July 2024, the German government announced that it had sold its entire Bitcoin holdings. This decision sparked widespread market interest and debate, as this move of the German government cost them approximately $2.03 billion in potential profits based on Bitcoin’s price at the time. In fact, the Bitcoin seized by the German government in 2014 was recovered from illegal activities through auctions, when Bitcoin prices were way lower than today. The German government held nearly 67,000 Bitcoins at that point. However, the German Ministry of Finance decided to sell these assets due to its limited understanding of digital currencies and concerns over market volatility. While in line with regulatory frameworks and policy requirements of the time, this move seems quite conservative after subsequent surges in Bitcoin’s price. In addition, this move of the German government also triggered discussions on digital currency management and related strategies. Although Bitcoin is notoriously volatile in price, its role as a long-term store of value has been increasingly recognized by institutions and countries. In the future, whether governments should utilize digital currency more proactively for asset management and appreciation remains a question worthy of serious consideration. 6. Bitcoin Conference 2024 and Trump’s Stance on Crypto On July 28, 2024, during the Bitcoin Conference 2024, former U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to designate Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the U.S. if re-elected. This statement immediately ignited widespread attention and debate. In particular, against the backdrop of an increasingly complex global economic landscape, Bitcoin’s potential as “digital gold” again becomes the center of attention. In his speech at the conference, Trump noted that the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other crypto assets would make them a new form of global reserve asset. He argued that as the U.S. dollar faces growing challenges to its dominance in international trade and its status as a reserve currency, Bitcoin could help the U.S. government mitigate risks of future financial crises and currency devaluation as a digital asset. Therefore, should he return to the White House, Trump pledged to integrate Bitcoin into the U.S.’s strategic reserve framework so as to further enhance the competitiveness of both the dollar and cryptocurrencies. This statement not only marks Trump’s public endorsement of crypto assets but also reflects changes in the global financial landscape. In a complex and ever-changing global economy, more and more politicians are beginning to acknowledge Bitcoin’s potential as a non-inflationary asset, with its role as a safe-haven asset increasingly recognized. Trump’s speech has undoubtedly broadened the horizon for Bitcoin’s future development and could foster greater collaboration and exchanges among governments worldwide on crypto asset management and policy formulation. 7. August Sees Circuit Breakers in Japanese and South Korean Stock Markets and a Plunge in Bitcoin Prices On August 5, 2024, Asian financial markets were hit by a major wave of market turbulence, triggering circuit breakers in Japanese and South Korean stock markets. Investors fled the stock markets to avoid risks. As a result, digital assets such as Bitcoin experienced dramatic price fluctuations. On that day, Bitcoin price plummeted from nearly $60,000 at dawn to $49,000. The turmoil stemmed from an unexpected monetary policy shift by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). On July 31, the BoJ raised its benchmark interest rate by 15 basis points to a range of 0.15%-0.25%, exceeding market expectations and sparking market panic. Previously, the BoJ had always adopted an ultra-loose monetary policy and maintained negative interest rates to stimulate growth. However, as pressures on Japan’s economic recovery mounted, the BoJ decided to raise interest rates. This policy shift triggered significant volatility in the yen and intensified investors’ concerns over global financial stability. At the same time, the South Korean stock market faced similar adverse effects, as investors shifted to safe-haven assets, further exacerbating the downward pressure across Asian markets. As risk assets, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are often susceptible to global market fluctuations, so their prices also dropped dramatically. It was universally believed in the market that as global economic uncertainties aggravated, investors might divert more funds from traditional financial markets to cryptocurrencies and other safe-haven assets, further driving the price volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 8. The Fed’s Rate-Cut Cycle Kicks Off in September In the early hours of September 19, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced cutting the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75%-5.00%. Since March 2022, the Fed had imposed 11 consecutive rate hikes, raising interest rates by a cumulative 525 basis points and pushing the federal funds rate to a 23-year high of 5.25%-5.5%. This decision to cut rates showed that the Fed had started adjusting monetary policy in response to changes in the economic environment after a prolonged rate-hike cycle. This rate cut drew widespread market attention, and investors anticipated further rate cuts in the months ahead to stimulate economic growth and counter potential risks of an economic slowdown. On November 8, 2024, the Fed announced another rate cut of 25 basis points, bringing the federal funds target rate down to a range of 4.5%-4.75%. The policy statement removed language indicating progress on inflation and greater confidence in achieving targets, instead emphasizing that it would pay continuous attention to dual risks posed by employment and inflation. The Fed reiterated that its primary goal was to maintain inflation at 2% and made it clear that it would not lower inflation below 2% to compensate for past overages. The October Consumer Price Index (CPI), released on November 13, showed a 0.2% month-over-month increase in the overall CPI, with the annual inflation rate rising from 2.4% to 2.6%. These figures indicated that inflationary pressures still existed and aligned with market expectations. On December 19, the Fed made its final interest rate decision of 2024, lowering the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25%-4.50%. Given that the U.S. real natural interest rate is approximately 1.4%, and short-term PCE inflation is expected to hover around 2%, the next 4 to 5 rate cuts (each by 25 basis points) will bring the rates down to about 3.5%, which is a reasonable level. CME futures data suggests that the market expects 3 more rate cuts, scheduled for December in 2024 and March, and June in 2025. The federal funds rate will reach 3.75%-4% by June 2025. This trajectory largely aligns with the Fed’s description of the neutral rate of interest. CME Futures Data 9. Trump Declares Victory in Presidential Election On November 6, 2024, initial projections by multiple media outlets, including Fox News, suggested that Republican candidate Donald Trump was on track to secure the presidency by winning more than half of the electoral votes. On the day the election results were announced, Bitcoin experienced a significant surge, rising over 8% shortly after the market opened and briefly hitting an all-time high of $75,349 per coin. Although it dipped slightly afterward, Bitcoin’s price remained above $73,000. According to Coinglass data, Ethereum rose 5.99%, Litecoin increased by 3.09%, and Dogecoin, endorsed by Elon Musk, soared by 15.33% in 24 hours. Trump has long been a supporter of cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin’s rise was interpreted as part of the “Trump trade” strategy. Trump pledged that if he returned to the White House, he would work to make the U.S. the global crypto hub, advocate for a Bitcoin reserve strategy, and appoint digital asset supporters to regulatory positions. He made it clear that he was the most pro-crypto candidate. 10. Bitcoin Price Surpasses $100,000 On December 5, Bitcoin’s price soared past $100,000, surging over 5% in a single day to reach a historic high. This milestone underscored the flourishing Bitcoin market and signaled that the cryptocurrency industry had entered a brand-new phase. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has risen nearly 140%, making it one of the most closely watched assets in global financial markets. Meanwhile, other mainstream cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin also saw gains to varying degrees, driven by Bitcoin’s rally. The overall market experienced growth across the board, investors displayed unprecedented enthusiasm, and the entire cryptocurrency market was filled with new opportunities and challenges. Bitcoin’s meteoric rise was fueled by several factors, chief among them the political impact of Donald Trump’s election victory. During his campaign, Trump had publicly vowed that, if re-elected, he would make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet” and proposed building a national Bitcoin stockpile to elevate Bitcoin’s role and influence within the global financial system. This promise attracted significant attention from cryptocurrency enthusiasts worldwide and sent a strong market signal that drove up Bitcoin’s price. In addition, the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, coupled with increased participation from institutional investors and capital inflows, further fuelled the market’s upward momentum, propelling Bitcoin’s price to new highs. This historic milestone demonstrated Bitcoin’s position as digital gold and indicated that cryptocurrencies were gradually reshaping the global financial landscape as a new asset class. With clearer policies and a maturing market, Bitcoin’s future looks increasingly promising. As more investors and institutions join this investment wave, the potential of the cryptocurrency market is being fully unlocked. II. HTX Ventures: Key Sectors for 2025 2024 has been a landmark year for the crypto industry. From the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs early on, we have witnessed a robust bull market further energized by momentum from the U.S. elections. Cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin, which benefited from the significant change in macro conditions —are reaching record-breaking valuations and are increasingly influencing the social and political landscape. It has also been a fruitful year for HTX Ventures. Benefiting from continuous innovation in the industry, this year we have supported 28 leading projects and funds that are exploring new frontiers of crypto utility. These projects span a range of sectors, including DeFi, BTCFi, ZK-rollups, modular infrastructure, Layer 1 & 2 solutions, AI, SocialFi, GameFi, and more. Looking ahead, HTX Ventures has identified five key sectors that showed encouraging progress in 2024 and will be closely monitored in 2025: the Bitcoin ecosystem, infrastructure, Meme, artificial intelligence (“AI”), and the TON ecosystem. This report provides an in-depth examination of the current landscape, challenges, and future opportunities within each sector, complemented by a macroeconomic overview and market projections. Bitcoin Ecosystem Market Dominance LTM Bitcoin dominance has increased from 45.27% to 56.81% . This implies most of the liquidity of the crypto market is currently lying mainly on the Bitcoin ecosystem and increasing. Source: CoinStats Bitcoin spot ETFs now account for 5.3% of the total Bitcoin supply, with holdings rising from 629,900 BTC at the beginning of the year to 1.24 million BTC, an increase of 613,708 BTC. This growth has elevated ETF holdings from 3.15% to 6.25% of the total Bitcoin supply in just twelve months. (Data as of 4 Dec 2024) A new market trend has emerged – with Bitcoin as the core asset, spot ETFs as liquidity channels, and U.S. listed companies represented by MicroStrategy (MSTR) as the vehicles to absorb unlimited dollar liquidity. As a result, it is increasingly essential to further develop Bitcoin’s ecosystem and enhance capital utilization efficiency, which can also boost BTC’s demand and drive up its price. Layer 2 77 BTC L2s have been launched/ fundraised over the past 3 years. Existing bitcoin L2s from the previous cycles including Lightning, Stacks and Liquid Network had experienced a significant surge in trading volume and token prices in 1H 2024 with the BTC ETF narrative. Further technical development has also been witnessed from these previous cycle L2s. Various L2 solutions on Bitcoin have emerged, including Spiderchain (Botanix), ZKRollup (Nexio and Critea), EVM compatible chains (BOB and B Squared), Sidechains (Merlin), etc. Current TVL on BTC L2 has reached US$3 billion, contributed by 19 BTC L2 projects. Assuming all Bitcoin L2s are launched in the coming years, approximated TVL on all BTC L2s could reach at least 2 to 4 times further, indicating a TVL of US$6 billion to US$12 billion. Layer 1/ Execution Layer BRC-20, Ordinals and Runes were the new major execution standards that emerged in late 2023. BTC L1s activities were on a steady increase despite an overall market downturn in Q2. However, the growth momentum was not able to keep pace in Q3 despite the resurgence of the Bitcoin markets. BTC L1s Landscape in # of Transactions, Source: Cryptokoryo_research Other Bitcoin Infrastructure Other infrastructures including interoperability solutions and security layers emerge with the rise of Bitcoin adoption. Interoperability Bridges and WBTC remain the mainstream of interoperability solutions on Bitcoin. Given that the Bitcoin network does not directly provide composability to build applications directly, people have to rely on these bridges/ WBTC to unlock DeFi yields on other blockchains. HTX Ventures remain bullish on Bitcoin interoperability solutions given the surge in institutions’ growing investment in Bitcoin as an asset class, and anticipate more solutions coming including liquidity bridges Xlink, Atomiq and Auran will launch in the coming year. Security Layers However, these interoperability solutions may pose threats on security over the underlying assets as hacking issues often happen. In light of this, security solutions with Bitcoin arise. Babylon is an example. It developed a set of security-sharing protocols for Bitcoin. This includes: (1) Bitcoin timestamp, which allows data to be recorded with a timestamp on the Bitcoin network, thereby enhancing the credibility and immutability of the data. (2) Bitcoin staking, which allows Bitcoin to provide security for other networks with financial incentives. Additionally, further usage potential with Bitcoin has been unleashed with other new technology, such as Data Availability (“DA”) layers. Nubit is a key player in Bitcoin DA. It enables scaling of Bitcoins data capacities, to empower applications, L2s and oracles, secured by Bitcoin. OP_CAT Is the Key to the 2025 Upgrade The Taproot upgrade enables the Bitcoin mainnet to issue assets. From the rise of BRC-20 inscriptions and Ordinals NFTs in 2023 to the introduction of ARC-20, SRC-20, and other asset issuance protocols, as well as the emergence of infrastructure such as Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, restaking, Liquid Staking Tokens (“LSTs”), and cross-chain bridges, the ecosystem has developed in leaps and bounds. Following the Bitcoin Conference in July 2024, the market shifted its attention to decentralized and unwrapped native BTCFi such as stablecoins. Currently, the Discreet Log Contract (“DLC”) with a cryptographic technique known as adaptor signatures can be utilized to allow Bitcoin scripts to program financial contracts dependent on external events while fully ensuring permissionless clearing for stablecoin and lending projects. Meanwhile, it facilitates permissionless multi-party transactions via Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (“PSBT”). However, this approach is dependent on game theory. In other words, it discourages projects’ malicious actions by significantly increasing their costs for such behavior rather than achieving decentralization at the smart contract level. For example, Shell Finance, a stablecoin project set to launch its mainnet, adopts this strategy. The real game-changer is OP_CAT. Once OP_CAT is enabled, developers will be able to use high-level Bitcoin native programming languages like sCrypt to develop fully decentralized, transparent smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin mainnet. sCrypt is a TypeScript framework for writing smart contracts on Bitcoin. It allows developers to write smart contracts directly in TypeScript, which is one of the most popular high-level programming languages. Bitcoin’s current Layer 2 solutions could also transition to ZK-Rollups, and BTCFi’s total market cap will be limitless. With the support of both macro markets and infrastructure support, we believe Bitcoin will experience a further surge in market demand over the coming 2 years. Infrastructure In 2024, infrastructure remains one of the most compelling sectors in the crypto industry. The synergy between capital and technology has driven the rapid development of Layer 1, Layer 2, and middleware projects, among others. Various factors have contributed to the thriving infrastructure, such as the Ethereum ecosystem’s ongoing upgrades and construction, as well as Layer 2’s improvements in costs and performance; rapid growth of high-performance Layer 1 blockchains led by Solana; the deepening of multi-chain landscape; the enhancement of network security and capital efficiency through restaking mechanisms by projects like EigenLayer; and the attempt by multiple Bitcoin Layer 2 projects to combine Bitcoin’s security with high-performance scaling solutions. Layer 1 Layer 1 projects continue to optimize consensus mechanisms and performance, thus consolidating the foundation for on-chain applications. Ethereum : introduced EIP-4844 and reduced L2 network fees. Solana and Tron: on-chain transactions have been active, attributable to the development of meme coins, infrastructure like Pump.fun and Sunpump, and similar. Aptos and Sui : GameFi and DeFi applications have spurred growth in active user numbers. Layer 2 Layer 2 remains a critical pathway for scaling, with advancements in both ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups. zkSync and StarkNet : continuous upgrades have significantly improved the user experience for ZK Rollups. Base and Arbitrum : DeFi and NFT projects are thriving on these platforms, with substantial growth in TVL. Layer 0 and Cross-Chain Middleware Layer 0 and cross-chain middleware have made breakthroughs in interoperability. LayerZero : connects over 40 chains , with a significant increase in cross-chain transaction volumes. Cosmos : the IBC upgrade has boosted cross-chain performance by 50%. Modular Public Blockchains Modular public blockchains offer exceptional performance and flexibility, thus attracting diverse applications. Celestia : by supporting multiple modular execution layers, it has established itself as a benchmark for modular public blockchains. Monad : its ultra-high TPS performance has attracted a huge number of developers and DApp deployments. BTC Layer 2 Bitcoin L2 has emerged as a new focus in the primary market in 2024. Several related projects like Babylon, Taro, BounceBit, and Corn completed their funding rounds this year, primarily introducing smart contracts and scaling to the BTC network. Taro : expanded BTC’s payment and contract capabilities via the Lightning Network. Stacks and RSK : are driving growth in Bitcoin smart contract applications. Restaking Restaking has seen speedy development and gained market attention for its ability to improve capital utilization efficiency. Projects like EigenLayer and Satori secured tens of millions of dollars in investments from leading venture capital firms this year. 2024 Key Funding Rounds in Infrastructure Project Funding Amount Lead Investors Valuation Funding Round EigenLayer US$50m Blockchain Capital, Polychain US$200m Round A LayerZero US$100m a16z, Sequoia Capital US$3bn Round B Celestia US$55m Polychain, Binance Labs – Round A Shardeum US$60m Multicoin Capital – Round A Monad US$30m Dragonfly Capital – Seed Round Fuel Labs US$40m Paradigm – Round A Lightning Labs (Taro) US$30m a16z – Round A Infrastructure is still imperative in this year’s crypto investments and funding. Layer 1 solutions, modular public blockchains, and infrastructure related to the Bitcoin ecosystem have all been favored by investors. Layer 1 now represents the most concentrated areas of technical development and exploration in the crypto space, and it is expected to remain a key sector for development resources and capital investment in the future. Meme Coins An Important Gateway for Retail Investors Under Relaxed Crypto Policies In 2024, the Meme coin sector has once again become a hotspot in the crypto market. As an ecosystem bridgehead , it has built community consensus and integrated with verticals like DeFi and GameFi to create new use cases. For example, Solana has actively championed the innovation and growth of Meme projects, successfully energizing its ecosystem. From Bome and Slerf earlier in 2024 to the emergence of pump.fi mid-year, these projects are more lottery-like due to their bonding curve pricing models and low market-cap launch strategies, thus attracting widespread attention. In addition, pump.fi is characterized by a decentralized feature that allows everyone to launch Meme coins, which fosters greater prosperity in the ecosystem. Over half of Solana’s Meme projects now originate from pump.fi, with dozens of these achieving market caps exceeding US$1bn. Public blockchains like SUI and TRON have also quickly adopted meme strategies, further invigorating their ecosystems. Characterized by their accessibility and low entry barriers, Meme projects have become a key tool for attracting new crypto users. The launch of Mootshot allows users to purchase Meme assets with fiat, while the craze of politically-themed Meme coins after the election has created a strong sense of engagement for new players. Looking forward, the potential influence brought about by the crypto policies and related governance trends under the Trump administration may spawn new hotspots related to Meme coins. For instance, if the “Department of Government Efficiency” (abbreviated asDOGE) led by Elon Musk garners attention, it could trigger another surge in Dogecoin. As the crypto market environment becomes increasingly relaxed, more retail investors are expected to enter the market, making Meme projects a key channel for capital inflows. Robinhood’s record of significant price surges following every Meme coin listing clearly highlights this trend, which is likely to drive future development in this sector. Meme Infrastructure With market participants’ growing demand for fair launches, the Meme coin fair launch sector has gained significant market attention and attracted substantial participants this year. Infrastructure projects such as Pump.fun and SunPump have emerged as top-performing cash flow generators, injecting fresh momentum into Meme coin development. Pump.fun Pump.fun is a Solana-based platform for launching Meme projects. By offering simple and intuitive creation tools, robust community support, a fair-launch allocation model, and mechanisms for automated liquidity injection into DEXs, coupled with Solana’s proven market operations, community management, and low transaction costs, Pump.fun gained market recognition upon its debut. It has successfully incubated several high-profile Meme projects. As of November 2024, over 40,000 projects have been launched on Raydium, generating cumulative revenue exceeding 1.17 million SOL, equivalent to approximately US$200m. Meanwhile, Pump.fun’s success has led to imitations by many other projects, inspiring numerous imitators across various chains, with SunPump being the most notable. Overall, this market-driven meme coin craze owes much to innovation and progress in infrastructure tools. Tools like Pump pioneered automated liquidity injection on launch platforms while pursuing fair, low-cost, and efficient launch methods. These innovations effectively lower launch costs and barriers, boost the market and community confidence, and drive increased participation. As a result, Meme projects have sustained their popularity throughout the year. Pump.fun’s success has not been perfectly replicated on other chains:the main reasons are:: ● Solana’s low transaction costs and high throughput make it one of the ideal platforms for launching meme projects. ● The Solana community has shown exceptional enthusiasm for new projects, which drives rapid growth for emerging Meme projects. ● Other ecosystems such as Ethereum struggle with high gas fees and other issues. Moreover, Meme projects on high-performance chains like BSC and Avalanche demonstrate lackluster performance because they are constrained by smaller community sizes and lower user stickiness. Launch platforms like Pump.fun and SunPump have become essential infrastructure for the development of Meme projects. Meme projects may become more diversified and practical in the future, with infrastructure potentially offering greater product functionalities, incorporating features tailored to specific use cases, such as gaming, NFTs, and social networking. As multi-chain ecosystems mature and real-world use cases expand, meme coin infrastructure will continue injecting more vitality into this sector. AI In 2024, the Crypto x AI sector has been exploring viable directions, giving rise to several segmented fields such as ZK/OPML for enabling AI on-chain, AI data crowdsourcing, decentralized computing power rental, AI data trading, AI games, and AI agents. A significant number of blockchain infrastructure and applications have expanded their focus to AI this year. Centralization of resources and ownership is one of the key challenges in scaling AI infrastructure in the long term, while traits of decentralization enabled with blockchain networks present a viable solution to solve the centralization issues with AI. One of the major examples of traditional crypto projects moving with AI include Near – it encourages AI to run on open source protocols on the chain since this year. Data Labeling/ Management Data resource constraints have been a major challenge for scaling AI development currently. The majority of useful data for AI model development is monopolized by big tech. Language and cultural coverage inefficiencies have thus become a problem due to the exclusiveness of jurisdiction coverage of these firms. Existing centralized AI data labeling firms are not able to scale the dataset in a comprehensive manner due to the poor financial incentives offered and operational jurisdiction limitation. Blockchain can be a good solution for solving these problems. Multiple projects are going to launch to improve data provenance and incentivize more efficient data labeling tasks across jurisdictions, e.g. Kiva, Sapien, Bagel, etc. Decentralized Inferencing and Machine Learning People mainly use centralized service providers like Hugging Face to run inference of open source models currently, which may pose concerns over privacy or censorship issues. Decentralized inferencing allows people to run machine learning models without relying on centralized service providers , while ensuring the trustworthiness of the model outputs. Three major verifiable inferencing verticals have emerged, with different cost and security trade-off conditions embedded: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (“ZKML”) ZKML allows inferencing of AI models with privacy provided by zk-snarks technology. Giza, Modulus Labs and EZKL were the key players in this vertical. These unlockenhanced security and accuracy over the inferencing process on open source models. However, the cost of inferencing will significantly surge due to the cost to generate ZK proof, leading to at least 100x time cost and latency compared to centralized inferencing. As such, current products still need further enhancement on ZK technology to be usable in the future. Optimistic Machine Learning (“OPML”) OPML assumes inference is accurate unless proven wrong by the challenger on the network. Network challengers act as watchers of the on-chain inferences and run on their own models to ensure output accuracy. A primary example of OPML platforms is ORA. Although the cost performance of OPML is lower than ZKML, it is still much more expensive than centralized inferencing due to the watcher cost. On-chain Decentralized Inferencing Network With a decentralized inferencing network, queries are run on-chain with a few nodes. If differences arise, the outstanding one will be slashed. This is the cheapest and fastest solution among the rest but security is not guaranteed as there are possibilities for the nodes to cheat. To ensure further security, more nodes may be considered to be deployed but this will further increase the cost. Ritual is one of the examples of running a decentralized inferencing network. Due to the weak cost efficiency compared to local inferencing, it is not a priority to decentralize AI inferencing for users at the moment. Output verification is rarely a major concern of AI developers and users under the current AI status quo. Edge computing can also be another solution for privacy and security for running AI models. As such, decentralized inferencing may face bottlenecks on growth in the long run. Decentralized GPU GPUs are in heavy demand in AI development while current GPU providers are largely monopolized by a few main players in the market, which may pose a risk of price sensitivity if any extreme market conditions occur. Old decentralized GPU protocol Render has experienced 10x growth in price since 2023. An influx of decentralized GPU networks is launching in the market this year, e.g. IO.net, Grass, Akash, etc. These networks incentivize GPU contribution with tokens, with target audiences of both consumers and smaller GPU companies. However, due to the lack of uniformity of GPU resources on these networks and the fact that most performant GPUs are not owned by the consumers, it is anticipated that centralized GPU providers will still be the mainstream of adoption by AI developers. AI Agent On Chain AI agents were put on chains to take advantage of the token mechanism to incentivise and bootstrap certain behaviors with the agents, including interacting with smart contracts, trading and querying on behalf of users. Myshell is one of the examples. In the future, AI Agents will gradually become personal butlers and assistants for users, serving them with comprehensive capabilities, such as independent asset issuance, initiation of viral marketing campaigns, formation of decentralized autonomous organizations (“DAO”), and even fund management and investment decision-making. Over time, they may develop unique cultures and religions. This deep integration of AI and encryption technology is a groundbreaking evolution unattainable within Web2 and cannot be achieved by Web3 relying solely on encryption technology. These innovations have not yet been transformed into products. Recently, in order to address AI agents’ needs for independent financial identities, specifically, the ability to autonomously control wallets, Coinbase has launched AI wallets based on its Coinbase MPC Wallet, allowing AI agents to conduct transactions with these wallets effortlessly. To make AI Wallet more accessible, Coinbase has also released a Based Agent template, which helps users deploy AI wallets with zero coding. More related products are expected to emerge in 2025. Based Agent Breakdown, Source: https://x.com/starzqeth/status/1853597036421259728 On top of that, AI agent networks have also arisen. Theoriq is a key example. It enables efficient multi-agent operation on blockchains with its community-governed AI agent marketplace. This creates an efficient distribution channel for AI agent creators and streamlined processes for AI agent users to perform multiple tasks. TON Ecosystem Attributable to Telegram’s hundreds of millions of users and robust technical support, the The Open Network (“TON”) ecosystem has gradually built a multi-layered blockchain ecosystem. In 2024, it experienced a full-scale boom in both its ecosystem and market. From DeFi and meme coins to NFTs and gaming, TON has made significant accomplishments with its massive user base in various fields, pioneering the monetization of Web2 social applications through crypto. TON data overview, Defillama, https://defillama.com/chain/TON Since traditional business models cannot bring Telegram substantial profits, TON began exploring alternatives like zero-threshold or low-spending “tap-to-earn” games, along with token airdrop incentives. This strategy has successfully drawn in a large number of Web2 users. Notcoin’s Success In May 2024, the first project Notcoin was launched. Notcoin is a social clicker game accessible via Telegram. Players engage with the Notcoin bot, invite friends, and start playing. The game mechanics are straightforward: a golden coin appears on your screen, and each tap earns you Notcoin, the game’s virtual currency. However, users’ ability to tap is limited by an energy bar that depletes with each tap but gradually refills over time. Notcoin quickly gained popularity in the market after it was released. Relying on its simple gameplay and Telegram’s vast user base, it achieved over one million monthly active users in a short time and was listed on major exchanges. Notcoin’s success marks the successful implementation of TON’s ecosystem gaming model and signifies that the gaming sector has entered a new phase of user attraction. Catizen’s Optimization Following Notcoin’s success, Catizen optimized its gameplay by introducing features such as speed boosts, encouraging users to start with small amounts, such as $0.99 or $4.99. Users can also deposit fiat via OTC channels or directly purchase crypto assets with credit cards, significantly lowering entry barriers. This zero-threshold or low-spending model has further expanded the user base. Other Business Models DOGS is one of the most popular meme projects in the TON ecosystem. Thanks to its unique community governance and ecosystem development, DOGS quickly gained a hold in the market. The project enables simple mining operations by verifying users’ Telegram accounts and adopting a referral mechanism. Upon its launch, DOGS attracted significant community attention and traffic and rapidly secured listings on multiple exchanges. Apart from gaming and social projects, DeFi also thrives in the TON ecosystem. Projects like TonStaker and Ston.fi have made strong progress. With star projects such as Notcoin, DOGS, and Catizen, TON has solidified its position in social payment and achieved breakthroughs in multiple sectors like DeFi. However, tap-to-earn games fundamentally operate on a model where Web2 users are initially attracted through token airdrop incentives and sold to exchanges afterward. After the initial hype subsides, traffic declines significantly. Currently, the TON ecosystem urgently needs to find a new business model in 2025 that can improve user retention and identify the next growth curve. It could be DeFi or meme coins but certainly not the models already implemented on Ethereum or Solana. TON’s success has also inspired other Web2 social applications. For instance, Line, targeting markets in Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, has introduced the Kaia chain, experimenting with the Mini DApp model to monetize its existing Web2 traffic. This shows that TON’s model is influencing the entire industry profoundly. Line Web3 Platform Breakdown, Source: https://govforum.kaia.io/t/gp-4-budget-request-for-kaia-wave/963 Capital Markets Attention In the capital markets, the TON ecosystem has garnered more attention from investors than other high-performance public blockchains. Multiple projects have received investments from the primary market this year. The TON ecosystem will continue advancing user experience, ecosystem diversity, and technological innovation, injecting fresh momentum into the sustained development of the crypto market. While the TON ecosystem has made substantial breakthroughs in 2024, TON must innovate its business model, increase user retention, and identify a new growth curve for the future. This is the only way for TON to maintain its leadership in fierce blockchain competition and deliver constant value to both its users and investors. III. Analysis of Future U.S. Pro-Crypto Policies In 2025, as the cryptocurrency industry develops in leaps and bounds and the global regulatory landscape continues to evolve, an increasing number of countries and regions are attaching greater importance to the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and gradually developing more favorable policy frameworks. As Trump assumes office, the U.S., as a crypto and blockchain-friendly country, is expected to continue pursuing policies aimed at driving technological innovation, ensuring market stability, improving regulatory transparency, and strengthening international competitiveness. 1. FIT21 Act The FIT21 Act divides tokens into digital assets and digital commodities, transferring the regulatory responsibilities of many blockchain projects from the SEC to the CFTC. It also introduces a safe harbor mechanism. This act is designed to set up a clear legal framework for token issuance and trading, exclude projects purely for ICO fundraising, establish market clearing mechanisms, and crack down on fraud and inferior projects. With far-reaching implications for digital asset regulation not only in the U.S. but around the globe, this act is expected to drive the industry toward standardization and healthy growth. Proposed by Republicans, the act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May with a vote of 279 to 136. Following Trump’s inauguration, it is expected to pass quickly in the Senate and be enacted into law. Key provisions are as follows: Clarification of Digital Asset Classification and Regulatory Responsibilities: Digital Commodities: Tokens where no single entity, including implicit control through alliances, holds more than 20% of the control are classified as digital commodities and are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These tokens are deemed to have practical use, such as maintaining the operation of blockchain networks (e.g., ETH or SOL could fall under this category). Digital Assets: Tokens where a single entity or alliance controls more than 20% are categorized as digital assets, essentially equivalent to security issuance, and are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These tokens are typically associated with ICOs, where holders expect investment returns but do not contribute directly to the public blockchain or product itself. Introduction of the Token Safe Harbor Act: To support projects with centralized control over tokens in their early stages, the Act introduces a “safe harbor” period (e.g., three to five years), allowing such projects to operate without fully complying with securities laws. The project team must promise to realize decentralization: reducing control to below 20%during the safe harbor period. If decentralization is achieved by the end of this period, prior violations of securities laws will be exempted; otherwise, legal consequences, such as refunds or penalties, may apply. There are no specific implementation cases as of now, such as how this would apply to meme-based projects. However, the recent listing of Pepe on Robinhood suggests that projects where the team retains a lower level of control may still qualify as decentralized. 2. Repeal of the SAB 121 Act SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin 121) is a guideline issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2022. This regulation requires banks, exchanges, and other financial institutions holding or providing custodial services for crypto assets to treat these assets as liabilities and disclose them accordingly on their balance sheets. Even if these institutions are merely holding clients’ crypto assets in custody, they must assume potential responsibilities. On the one hand, financial institutions are required to disclose detailed information regarding potential risks associated with crypto assets, including market volatility, hacking, and technical failures. On the other hand, they must account for crypto assets as liabilities rather than client assets in their custody. This may increase the total liabilities on the balance sheets of banks and financial institutions, which in turn impacts their capital adequacy ratios. This has directly hindered traditional financial institutions in the U.S., including national banks like Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, from offering crypto custody services, limiting crypto firms’ access to banking services. Trump is expected to repeal this act soon after his inauguration on January 20. Following the repeal, traditional financial institutions will be allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. Further institutionalization will provide more financing options for crypto assets and make spot cryptos more accessible through existing institutional exchanges and partnerships. At the same time, it will significantly enhance the maturity of the overall institutional crypto market. In addition, regulatory agencies’ clear stance and loose policies will enable traditional financial service companies and investors to operate on blockchain platforms for the first time, which will bring them new earnings and other strategic possibilities.

Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act Trump once proposed using BTC or “crypto checks” to repay the U.S. government’s $35 trillion national debt and avert an imminent debt crisis. On July 31, 2024, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed the BITCOIN Act of 2024 to enhance U.S. financial security and leadership by establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. The act was submitted to Congress for deliberation on August 4, 2024, and referred to the Senate Banking Committee for review. Key provisions of the act include: Bitcoin Purchase Plan: acquire up to 200,000 BTC annually for five years, ultimately capping the federal Bitcoin reserve at 1 million BTC, which is about 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Secure Storage Facilities: establish a decentralized network of secure Bitcoin storage facilities managed by the U.S. Department of Treasury for the safe storage and flexibility of Bitcoin reserves. Funding Sources: use existing Federal Reserve System and Treasury funds to purchase Bitcoin, including reassessing gold certificates held by the Federal Reserve to reflect the fair market value price of the gold, with the difference used for purchasing Bitcoin. Holding Period and Usage Rules: Bitcoin acquired by the government will be held for no less than 20 years, and no Bitcoin held may be sold, swapped, or auctioned for any purpose other than retiring outstanding Federal debt instruments during this period. If the act passes through the Senate, House of Representatives, and presidential review, it will become law, and Trump is well-positioned to push the legislation through. If enacted, this act would mark Bitcoin’s transition from a niche asset to a nationally recognized reserve asset, dramatically enhancing its legitimacy and recognition. It may also prompt other countries to adopt similar measures to further advance Bitcoin’s global recognition and application. Incorporating Bitcoin into national asset reserves provides the U.S. with a tool to counter economic uncertainty and monetary instability, thereby enhancing the country’s financial resilience. Source: BiTBO As of December 2024, BiTBO data shows that currently, the U.S. Government held about 0.9% of Bitcoin. However, similar to J.P. Morgan’s relationship with the Fed, many Bitcoin ETFs are U.S.-backed. Including their 6.2% share, along with the 4.6% passively locked away by Satoshi Nakamoto, the U.S. government could theoretically control or influence around 12% of Bitcoin’s price. 4. Relaxing SEC’s Application Criteria of the Howey Test More Spot ETFs When applying the Howey Test, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deems any asset that passes the test as a security. The assessment is primarily based on the following four criteria: An Investment of Money : investors contribute funds or other valuable assets to a project. In a Common Enterprise : the investments are pooled for a common business project, with interconnected economic interests among investors. With the Expectation of Profit : investors expect a return on their investments. To Be Derived from the Efforts of Others : profits depend primarily on the management or operations by the project’s issuer or a third party, rather than the efforts of the investors themselves. In recent years, the SEC has strictly applied the Howey Test in the digital asset space. As a result, many cryptocurrencies are classified as securities, which subjects them to stringent securities regulations, including registration, disclosure, and investor protection rules. Some industry experts and former SEC members believe that the SEC’s overly strict application of the Howey Test has stifled financial innovation and hindered blockchain technology development. They advocate for relaxing the criteria or adopting more flexible regulatory approaches for different types of crypto assets. Should the SEC ease its Howey Test criteria and allow more crypto assets to be considered non-securities or traded as “crypto asset securities” by brokers/dealers, traditional financial institutions like banks, exchanges, or brokers would be more willing to enter this sector. In addition, relaxing these criteria could pave the way for spot crypto ETFs to be listed in the U.S. Nevertheless, many projects may still need to apply for futures-based ETFs first to comply with regulatory requirements. Public Listing of Crypto Companies Depending on the SEC’s stance on the Howey Test and requirements for token disclosure, equity-like security tokens may emerge in the future. At the same time, existing tokens may also adopt more equity-like features to strengthen their value proposition so as to facilitate public listings for crypto companies with already issued tokens. Currently, bankers from leading Wall Street investment banks, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, are actively meeting with executives from the cryptocurrency industry. They hope to capture a share of the potentially lucrative initial public offerings (IPOs) by crypto companies anticipated after the U.S. presidential election, which is fueled by improvements in markets and regulatory environments. Amid market expectations of regulatory easing under a Trump victory, these bankers are highly confident in the potential IPO plans of companies like Kraken, Fireblocks, and Chainalysis. This enthusiasm stands in stark contrast to the past two years when most investment banks were reluctant to collaborate with crypto companies due to high risks. In recent years, crypto IPOs have been rare, making it challenging for crypto companies to secure mainstream institutional funding. While the massive wealth effect of Coinbase’s listing in 2021 attracted many traditional funds to establish crypto divisions, Coinbase remains the only crypto project featured on the Forbes 2024 Midas List.

Even though market analysts like Daan Crypto Trades and Wolf have made bold price predictions for them, many traders are looking elsewhere for profits. Smart money investors are rapidly becoming attracted to IntelMarkets (INTL) , a new phase nine presale star with strong ties to the AI market. Statista predicts this market could be worth $826B by 2030. Therefore, this project could capitalize on its growth potential. As it has given early buyers an 811% return, experts foresee another 1,000% surge for this altcoin in 2025. IntelMarkets (INTL) Stuns Crypto Community With an 811% Surge As Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) are showing some volatility, all eyes are on IntelMarkets (INTL) at the moment. Interest in it is sky-high as it has already surged 811% in its presale run. Not only that, IntelMarkets has raised over $6M so far and may reach $7M before this week ends. This level of interest for a project is rarely seen in the crypto market. People are excited about IntelMarkets as it will introduce the first AI-powered smart trading platform. On it, traders will experience self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time and access to autopilot Rodeum AI™ trading bots that take positions automatically. With these features, IntelMarkets could become a revolutionary force in crypto trading. The INTL native token will power this crypto exchange. Holding it is beneficial as it will give holders discounts on trading fees (up to 30%), first dibs on new IntelMarkets features, and more. Currently, INTL costs only $0.082, an 811% surge from its starting price of $0.009. However, this altcoin price will rise to $0.091 after phase ten of its presale begins. Also, traders are waiting for a Tier-1 CEX to list INTL, bringing its value to $0.11. The Ripple (XRP) Price Could See a Breakout Soon, Expert Says Ripple (XRP) is an altcoin that has faced some volatility recently. CoinMarketCap shows its value has dropped nearly 5% on the one-week chart. During that time, the price of Ripple fell from around $2.40 to close to $2.30. However, crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades remains optimistic about Ripple (XRP). According to his X post, this crypto coin sees a massive triangle/pennant. This could lead to a potential breakout for the Ripple coin soon. Although this Ripple price prediction has excited some traders, many are looking at INTL instead. The Ripple market cap is $131B, which may slow its growth. As XRP needs much new money for a price surge, INTL will not face this issue. Wolf: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) Could Reach New ATHs Ethereum (ETH) is among the best cryptos but it is showing some red price charts. On the one-month chart, its value fell from around $3,600 to below $3,300. In other words, over a 10% drop for the Ethereum coin in just a few short weeks. The crypto community is still watching Ethereum (ETH) as crypto analyst Wolf has made a bullish statement. In a recent X post, he said that this altcoin has little to no downside. As an Ethereum price prediction, he thinks it may reach a new ATH soon. But, many investors are still sidestepping ETH as it may have already experienced its highest upswings. On the YTD chart, its value has jumped over 40%. As a result, crypto coins like INTL may soar faster. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Take Off Like Ripple (XRP) & Ethereum (ETH)? Although Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ETH) could rebound soon, IntelMarkets (INTL) is starting to turn heads as more investors look for high returns. It will introduce groundbreaking technology that could bring the next gen of crypto trading, plus its smaller market cap may mean faster price growth with less money. Therefore, experts predict this altcoin could see a 1,000% spike in its value this year.

They stated that if the correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin turns negative and drops to low values, it signals high-risk areas for the market. Analysts added that this picture was formed when the BTC price rose to $ 108,000. According to analysts, altcoins have now started to follow the Bitcoin price movement again. When the BTC price falls, altcoins also fall and when it rises, they climb. According to analysts, at the current stage, BTC dominance could typically stabilize or continue its rise.

Analyst Answered - “But Pay Attention to the Date...” In addition, Alphractal analysts claimed that the Chainlink price is being tracked by crypto whales on cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Whale vs. Retail Investor Delta measures the difference between whales’ long and short positions compared to retail investors. According to analysts, this metric has been impressively consistent with LINK’s price action. However, this is not an isolated case. According to the Heatmap, whales hold more short positions than individual investors. This is because individual investors tend to “buy the dip,” while larger investors exhibit better direction and resilience. *This is not investment advice.

Pepe Rescues Trump (PEPERTRU), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPERTRU is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Rescues Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Rescues Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 07:13:43

Recently , the Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange openly extended its support to the sensational stablecoin. A recent interview conducted by a popular media house with Jack McDonald, a senior vice president of Ripple responsible for handling its stablecoin operations, reveals that the company has plans to list its stablecoin on more exchanges. Let’s have a closer look at the developments. Ripple’s RLUSD: A Quick Overview There is a reason why RLUSD has created extreme excitement in the crypto market . It is true that it is just a dollar-pegged stablecoin. But there do exist a few strong reasons that make this stablecoin stand out. Primarily, it is a stablecoin launched by Ripple, a company that has created several eye-catching headlines for its tireless battles against the US regulators. It was recently announced that the stablecoin received the final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services. Last month, after the approval, the stablecoin was launched on Ethereum and XRP Ledger. Current Status of RLUSD Exchange Listings Bitstamp is one of the first crypto exchanges to support Ripple openly. RLUSD has been listed on the exchange already, Responding positively to questions about the exchange expansion potential of RLUSD in 2025, McDonald has expressed confidence in the possibility of prominent exchanges, including coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange and binance binance - binance@miceneurol.com Centralised Exchange joining hands with the company to boost the stablecoin. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Adopts Chainlink Standard to Boost RLUSD Integration with DeFi , Next Steps for Listing RLUSD on Exchanges Even though McDonald has sounded overtly confident, he has mentioned the technical challenges of exchange listings. Primarily, he has highlighted issues related to compatibility and demand. Secondly, he has emphasised the threat of exclusive relationships, pointing out the exclusive relationships that Binance has with FDUSD and Coinbase has with USDC. Anyway, McDonald has expressed hope that major exchanges might reconsider their exclusive relationship policy in the future. In contrast, a public statement states that Coinbase has no exclusive relationship with USDC, explaining how the exchange supports various stablecoins, like PAX, GUSD, PYUSD and USDT. In conclusion, Ripple’s RLUSD is on a strategic path to expand its reach across top exchanges like Coinbase. With regulatory approval and a growing market presence, the stablecoin reflects Ripple’s vision for a stablecoin future in a competitive landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Don’t Worry, Here is One of The Top New Meme Coins for Significant Returns To The Rescue",https://thecoinrise.com/missed-out-on-the-meme-hype-dont-worry-here-is-one-of-the-top-new-meme-coins-for-significant-returns-to-the-rescue/,"If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the wild world of crypto, it’s that meme coins are more than just a joke. Over the years, these coins have gone from being laughed at to being serious wealth generators. Whether it’s Dogecoin becoming Elon Musk’s darling or Shiba Inu spawning an ecosystem, meme coins have shown they’re here to stay. Now, the meme coin revolution is heading into its next phase, and all eyes are on BTFD Coin (BTFD) to lead the charge. With its epic Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards offering a jaw-dropping 90% APY, and a referral program, BTFD isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s creating a tsunami. So if you are worried about missing Memecoin (MEME), BTFD is here to rescue you. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Meme Coin That’s Flipping the Script They say fortune favors the bold, and BTFD Coin is proving that every single day. This meme coin has set itself apart with a stellar presale performance, raising over $5.1 million and selling 63 billion coins to more than 8,000 holders. Launched at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s now in its 13th stage and priced at $0.000142. Crypto analysts are already buzzing about its future, with predictions that BTFD could hit $0.0006 once the presale ends—a massive leap. If you’re wondering just how much that could mean for your wallet, let’s break it down. Say you invest $7,500 at the current Stage 13 price of $0.000142. That would snag you around 52,816,901 BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment would balloon to $31,690 . How’s that for flipping the script? But the presale is just one piece of the pie. BTFD’s staking program offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY, rewarding long-term holders for sticking around. And then there’s the Bulls Squad community, a vibrant network of crypto enthusiasts who aren’t just investors; they’re part of a movement. Add in a referral program where you can earn while you share, and you’ve got a recipe for success. With just three stages left before the presale wraps up, the window to grab discounted coins is closing fast. Don’t be that person kicking themselves for missing out. Get in on the action now at BTFD’s Presale Page . All you’ve gotta do is connect your wallet, input the amount of $BTFD you want, and confirm the transaction. Memecoin (MEME): The Veteran Meme Coin That Keeps Innovating While BTFD is the new kid on the block, Memecoin (MEME) has been holding its ground as a solid contender in the meme coin space. Known for its innovative approach to investor protection, MEME launched its MemeSwap staking platform this year, letting users stake their holdings at variable APR rates that adjust based on demand. It’s a nifty setup, offering flexible lock times, one-click harvesting, and rewards that include MEME tokens. And with plans to add new staking pools, MEME is proving it’s not just resting on its laurels. Memecoin has also carved out a niche as the first blockchain insurance platform aimed at protecting investors from nasty rug pulls and massive devaluations. It’s like having a safety net in a market where trust can feel like a rare commodity. Crypto analysts have praised MEME’s unique value proposition, with some predicting it could double in price by the end of 2025. But the question is: will that growth outpace the explosive potential of newer players like BTFD? Unlike BTFD, MEME doesn’t come with the hype of a massive presale or the buzz of a 90% APY staking program. But it does have a loyal community and a reputation for delivering on its promises. That counts for something, no? If you’re the kind of investor who likes steady growth over flashy gains, MEME might be your jam. Still, with meme coins, it’s hard not to feel like you’re missing out when the next big thing rolls around. And right now, BTFD is that big thing. How to Join the BTFD Coin Revolution So, you’re ready to jump on the BTFD bandwagon? Here’s how to do it: Head to BTFD’s Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet—MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or whichever one you’ve got in your arsenal. Enter the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Hit “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Boom. Y ou’re in. And with over $5 million already raised and just three stages left, there’s no time to waste. Remember, this presale started at $0.000004 and has already surged to $0.000142. When it hits $0.0006 post-launch, you’ll be glad you didn’t sleep on this. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Meme Coin Renaissance Meme coins are no longer just a sideshow in the crypto carnival. They’re driving serious innovation and delivering returns that’ll make you do a double take. Whether it’s the explosive potential of BTFD Coin with its P2E game, 90% APY staking, and vibrant community, or the steady reliability of Memecoin with its innovative insurance platform, there’s no shortage of opportunities to make bank. But let’s be real. The energy, the buzz, the “I don’t wanna miss this” vibe? That’s all BTFD. With analysts predicting massive growth, a referral program that’ll have your squad saying, “GREAT!” and a presale price that’s climbing fast, now’s the time to get in. Make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity with BTFD Coin presale. Join the BTFD Presale Now and secure your slice of the meme coin pie.

Meanwhile, FXGuys ($FXG) is catching the fancy of investors seeking tokens with the potential for explosive returns in this bull run. While top altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and Render (RNDR) have shown modest growth, $FXG is the rising star with unprecedented growth potential. Experts have highlighted $FXG as the best crypto to invest in now. However, investors are asking how this emerging coin could deliver better returns over Litecoin and Render in this bull run. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Increased Miners Reserves Drive Litecoin’s Bull Run On-chain data shows that miners’ reserves for all mining pools rose above 1.5 million LTC in December 2024. This sent Litecoin’s LTC into a 2025 bull run. LTC jumped 28.95% in price from $99.65 to $128.51 in just 18 days. By the end of December, Litecoin’s LTC lost momentum and dropped 23.90% to $97.81. However, LTC surged by 15.25% to $112.73 four days into January 2025. However, despite Litecoin’s LTC movements, investors are shifting attention to $FXG. The token is hailed as the best crypto coin to buy now for its growth potential. RENDER Soars in January: Is RNDR the Best Crypto to Invest in Now? Another token with impressive price performance over the past month is RENDER. RNDR jumped 8.33% from $8.64 to $9.36 just 15 days into December. By December 31, 2024, RENDER’s RNDR had dropped 28.63% in price to reach $6.68. However, RENDER’s RNDR recovered by 23.20% to $8.23 just 4 days later to kickstart a 2025 bull run. This led many experts to predict that the price of RNDR could cross $10 in 2025. Despite the modest price growth shown by Litecoin’s LTC and RENDER’s RNDR, experts have highlighted $FXG as the best crypto coin to buy now for maximized gains in the 2025 bull run.

One such story of a crypto trader trends in the market today, as the trader lost 90% of the holdings’ worth before succeeding with the recovery. With that, the crypto investor made $2.5M within two months, bringing an optimistic experience for the rest of the community. Crypto Trader’s Bold Move Cost Him $1M Before $2.5M Profits The crypto trading industry gained its name for decentralized transactions and heavy returns, but many trades do not follow the expectation. Lookonchain highlighted an incident supporting the statement, where an enthusiastic crypto trader places trade in hopes of heavy returns. However, the trader faced a $1M loss, with the portfolio losing 90% of its value. Interestingly, the trader’s patience paid off after some time, as the crypto token’s worth grew, bringing a $2.5M profit to the investor. According to the Lookonchain X post , the crypto investor spent 5,441 SOL, equivalent to $1.15M, and bought 20.46M PIPPIN. This happened two months ago, but volatility took over, crashing the Pippin token by 90%, leaving the investors with only a $1M loss. However, as the Lookonchain regarded the trader ‘diamond hand,’ it stayed patient. To this day, the trader did not sell any crypto, and over time, the loss turned into $2.5M in profits, with the Pippin token’s recovery on the chart. This portrayed the market’s volatility, where a loss can become a profit and vice versa, depending on the situation. In two months, the aforementioned crypto trader’s $1.15M turned into $3.68M with a PIPPIN price pump. PIPPIN Price Surge 130% Amid Higher Investor Interest Pippin is an AI agent that has recently drawn attention in the crypto trading market. Although the token was launched just a few months ago and suffered losses, its demand has increased multiplefold in the last few days due to the increased hype around AI cryptos . As a result, its trading volume grew more than 150%, settling at $116,980,268 today. The PIPPIN price rose 130% to $0.21 from $0.091, gaining a market capitalization of $210,196,191. Meanwhile, this surge equipped the trader to earn $2.5M in profits; this is not a rare event. Similarly, another crypto investor made three Million in just a few hours. However, along with the profiting incidents, there are losses as well, creating the need for smart investments. What’s The Lesson Here? Pippin token’s price performance reflects the volatile nature of the crypto industry, where investor sentiments play a significant role. The token crashed right after the crypto trader’s buy, putting the trader’s portfolio at a 90% loss. However, with time and increased demand for AI-themed cryptocurrencies, PIPPIN price grew, leading to a $2.5M profit for the crypto investor. Eventually, this journey from a $1M loss to a $2.5m profit hints at how the market often fluctuates and how the right crypto trading strategies and patience could defeat the volatility.

38740474,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=378079,1736494338,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38740474.jpeg,Bitcoin (BTC) Supply Shock Unlikely in 2025: Here’s Why,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-supply-shock-unlikely-in-2025-heres-why/,"With Bitcoin’s increasing presence in traditional financial systems and speculation around a US BTC strategic reserve, some experts foresee a major supply shock during this cycle, potentially disrupting the 4-year cycle theory with extraordinary price growth. However, a new report indicates that such a supply shock is unlikely to happen in 2025. Analyzing Bitcoin Long-Term Holder (LTH) Supply While Bitcoin’s halving, rising institutional interest, and the introduction of spot BTC ETFs in the US have amplified discussions of constrained supply, detailed data suggests otherwise, according to a report by CEX.IO, shared with CryptoPotato . The combination of long-term holder (LTH) activity, ETF activity, and evolving liquidity trends indicates a strong supply ecosystem that is capable of mitigating potential shocks. Key to this assessment is the behavior of LTH supply post-halving. Historically, halving events trigger a notable transition of coins from LTH to short-term holders (STH), thereby increasing market liquidity. In 2024 alone, LTH supply dominance fell by 9%, releasing 1.58 million BTC into the market. With an average 16% decline in LTH dominance observed during previous post-halving cycles, a projected transfer of 1.4 million BTC from LTH to STH is expected in 2025. The report explained that this ensures that increased demand from institutions or governments will likely be met by substantial LTH profit-taking, tempering supply constraints. ETF Dynamics, OTC Activity, and Market Liquidity ETF activity, often cited as a potential driver of supply shocks, also appears less impactful upon closer examination. Despite US spot Bitcoin ETFs amassing over 1.13 million BTC in 2024, much of this accumulation stemmed from cash-and-carry trades rather than direct directional investments. These arbitrage strategies, which are reliant on derivatives like CME futures, balance supply and demand without directly pressuring spot markets. Additionally, ETFs currently account for less than 4% of Bitcoin’s total trading volume, which further reduces their capacity to drive a systemic supply imbalance. Market liquidity and exchange reserves also play crucial roles, as detailed by CEX.IO. While exchange-held Bitcoin reserves dropped to record lows in 2024, withdrawals largely signaled transfers to cold storage rather than liquidation, which reflected long-term confidence. Simultaneously, OTC platforms increased their holdings by over 200,000 BTC, which points to a redistribution of liquidity rather than outright depletion. This diversification, coupled with stable daily transfer volumes, indicates a balanced and active market. Finally, market depth metrics reveal improving liquidity conditions. The growing resilience is depicted by the rise in USD-denominated liquidity by 61% in 2024 despite reduced BTC-denominated depth. With larger exchanges consolidating market share and US platforms expanding dominance, the liquidity landscape appears to be well-positioned to handle increased demand in 2025. Together, these factors reinforce the conclusion that Bitcoin’s supply remains strong, making a significant supply shock unlikely in the coming year. Instead, the report states that the market is poised for measured growth within the established 4-year cycle framework.

XRP and Altcoin Market Trends Explained,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-cardanos-2025-start-a-fluke-xrp-and-altcoin-market-trends-explained/,"The post Is Cardano’s 2025 Start a Fluke? XRP and Altcoin Market Trends Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Bitcoin tends to dominate market movements , altcoins like XRP and Cardano have also shown signs of life, especially during Bitcoin’s recent upward surge. Early this year, Cardano made a notable jump, rising by 32% within the first six days. However, it then experienced a drop in line with the broader crypto market correction. Brian Q. from Santiment appeared on the Thinking Crypto podcast and opened up about the altcoin trends. Decreased Network Activity for Altcoins One concerning trend across many altcoins, including Cardano, is the drop in network activity since early December. Transaction volume has decreased, meaning less investor excitement and institutional involvement. Though this doesn’t necessarily mean the end of the bull run, it does suggest that the initial rush of enthusiasm has faded for now. Unique Coin Circulation Shows Promise Despite the drop in network activity, Cardano and some other altcoins still show healthy signs of unique coin circulation. This could mean that a large number of distinct coins are being actively moved, which is a positive signal for the market. Short-Term Bounce, Long-Term Caution In the short term, there may be a bounce if Bitcoin stabilizes, as altcoins like Cardano could see some upside. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain. Many altcoins, including Cardano and XRP, have had massive runs over the past year.

If Bitcoin doesn’t experience a significant rally to $150,000, altcoins may face some downward pressure as they cool off from their recent highs. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Which One Will Likely Make You A Millionaire In 2025?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-dogecoin-or-remittix-which-one-will-likely-make-you-a-millionaire-in-2025/,"Market dips and shakeouts, although psychologically intimidating, offer excellent opportunities to acquire cryptocurrencies at discounted prices. During these periods, well-known cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Dogecoin are holding up relatively well, alongside the lesser-known presale utility gem, Remittix. Remittix is gaining attention with its innovative solution for cross-border payments and user-friendly interface, positioning itself to disrupt a $180 trillion market. Continue reading to explore Remittix’s potential for 50-100x growth in this cycle. Dogecoin Poised To Enter The Top 5 This Cycle Despite a wider market dip, Dogecoin has remained the same this week, fueled by significant whale activity, including a massive purchase of 1.08 billion DOGE worth $413 million. This whale accumulation, combined with transfers to private wallets, has eased selling pressure for Dogecoin and is contributing to its ongoing bullish momentum. This underscores Dogecoin’s potential to reach the top 5 once again, with Dogecoin demonstrating fortitude during a tumultuous time in the market. Adding to the excitement, speculation is mounting around Elon Musk possibly integrating Dogecoin into his “X Money” payments platform. Though Dogecoin is down over 20% this month, Dogecoin is positioned to reclaim its all-time high as memes make a comeback and new money enters the market at increasing rates. Several Bullish Catalysts Bode In Cardano’s Favour Cardano is gearing up for a strong 2025, with recent whale activity driving a 15% price rally over 7 days and over $58 million in ADA purchases. If Cardano manages to break the $1 resistance zone, some bulls purport that Cardano could potentially reach as far as $7 by the end of the year, fueled by rising investor sentiment and Cardano’s rising network growth. Several other catalysts strengthen Cardano’s outlook as altcoin season looms. The incoming pro-crypto Trump administration, with Charles Hoskinson potentially advising, will add credibility to Cardano’s ecosystem. Innovations like the Chang Hard Fork and the Lace wallet enhance decentralization and accessibility, while the move toward becoming a Bitcoin Layer-2 chain is set to expand Cardano’s use cases. Based on this, Cardano could become a top 3 layer-1 in Q2-Q4 2025. Explore Remittix’s 50-100x Potential Remittix is revolutionizing global money transfers by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions. This allows users to send funds in over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Cardano, and Dogecoin, which are instantly converted into fiat currencies like USD and EUR. This seamless process eliminates delays and intermediaries, offering a faster and more reliable alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. The platform’s user-friendly design simplifies the remittance process, making it accessible even to those without technical expertise or knowledge of cryptocurrencies. This accessibility, along with its speed and cost-effectiveness, positions Remittix as the premier solution in the evolving landscape of global payments. For businesses, Remittix provides a streamlined solution for managing international payroll. Payments made to employees, freelancers, and contractors are automatically converted into fiat and deposited directly into their bank accounts, reducing costs and eliminating inefficiencies. This feature is particularly beneficial for companies operating across multiple regions, as it minimizes delays and resolves exchange rate discrepancies. Transparency and security are fundamental to Remittix’s operations. The platform has undergone rigorous audits by Solidproof and BlockSAFU, ensuring its infrastructure is secure and reliable. Additionally, its liquidity pool and team tokens are locked for three years, mitigating the risks of sudden sell-offs that often cause other low-cap cryptocurrencies to plummet overnight. Currently priced at $0.0193 during its presale phase, Remittix is emerging as a leading contender in the cross-border payments sector, attracting investors seeking a potential 50-100x return during a peak bull run.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Discover how a new presale dominates the crypto market with a 600% price surge. Meanwhile, Cardano and Solana show some price dips. Table of Contents DTX Exchange seen as a rising star amid 600% price increase Dan Gambardello: The ADA price could surge soon Solana sees a price dip, market analyst remains bullish What gives DTX Exchange an advantage over ADA and Solana? The current crypto market turmoil has been hard, even for established tokens like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). Although they are now seeing price dips, market analysts like Andrew Crypto and Dan Gambardello have made some bold price predictions for them. While these top crypto coins face resistance, another token called DTX Exchange (DTX) seems to be gaining popularity. This is because it has already given early buyers a 600% return. Since its presale is now in phase seven, this percentage will continue rising. Many experts hint it could skyrocket by another 1,000% in 2025 – making DTX one of the altcoins to watch. DTX Exchange seen as a rising star amid 600% price increase As Cardano and Solana show some red price charts, DTX Exchange is making a name for itself. This project is now seen as one of the hottest presales. Notably, DTX Exchange has raised over $11m and may reach $20m before this week ends. Also, its native token, DTX, has already soared by 600%, and more spikes are coming. People all over the globe are interested in DTX Exchange, as it could redefine online trading forever. It recently launched its hybrid trading platform, which lets traders access over 120k asset classes like FX, bonds, and crypto coins in one place at up to 1000x leverage. In other words, just a $100 investment in these assets can open up liquidity of up to $100k. Interest is high, with over 300k users onboarded so far. Even CoinMarketCap listed the DTX token, which could open the doors for millions of new eyes to be set on it. This altcoin is very beneficial for holders as it will give them governance voting rights and a percentage of the trading fee revenue generated by the DTX Exchange. It now costs just $0.14, but phase eight will bring a jump to $0.16. Plus, a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to bring its value to $0.20, potentially making DTX one of the best cryptos for fast returns.

On the one-month chart, its value fell nearly 10%, per CoinMarketCap. The Cardano price moved from $1 to around $0.90 at that time. Nevertheless, crypto analyst Dan Gambardello remains bullish for Cardano. According to his recent X post, this altcoin is seeing one of the most bullish weekly pattern setups. He remains very bullish, with a $7 price target in his long-term Cardano price prediction. Although the Cardano coin could see a price increase soon, its high market cap of $32b may hinder its growth. In other words, ADA will need a lot of new money for its price to see any noteworthy gains. Thus, many investors are turning to DTX instead. Solana sees a price dip, market analyst remains bullish Solana is another crypto coin that has experienced some turbulence. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana dropped from around $200 to nearly $190 in the past week alone, nearly a 10% dip in just a few short days. But, the crypto community is still excited about Solana thanks to some bullish statements from market analysts. For example, Andrew Crypto thinks this crypto coin could surge to $400 soon. This Solana price prediction has turned some heads. However, some experts have mentioned that DTX has some advantages over SOL. For instance, the SOL blockchain showcased 65K TPS, but the DTX VulcanX blockchain reached 100k during its testnet run. What gives DTX Exchange an advantage over ADA and Solana? Cardano and Solana remain important in the crypto market, but their recent price dips show that people should diversify their portfolios. DTX Exchange, a platform combining smart solutions, explosive growth potential, and an evident path toward market disruption, is another option available. This project is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of the online trading market, which Statista predicts could be worth $13.3b in 2026. Its smaller market cap means that DTX will need less money for its price to surge. Therefore, market analysts hint at a 1,000% price spike possibly coming in 2025 for this crypto coin.

In response to increased customer demand following the MiCA law that came into force in the European Union with the new year, Standard Chartered announced that it will offer cryptocurrency services in the EU. Accordingly, Standard Chartered said it has established a new legal entity in Luxembourg to provide cryptocurrency and digital asset custody services and has entered the EU market. Laurent Marochini, former head of innovation at French financial giant Société Générale, will serve as CEO of Standard Chartered's Luxembourg unit. Standard Chartered’s cryptocurrency offering in the EU will initially be limited to Bitcoin, but the bank’s Head of Digital Assets Waqar Chaudry said more cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) will be added by late 2025. It was also stated that Standard Chartered's cryptocurrency service in the EU will only include crypto custody, or the custody and safekeeping of digital assets on behalf of their owners. *This is not investment advice.

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is sweetening the deal for FTX victims in an effort to help them get back on their feet after the latter left hundreds of thousands of investors without billions in customer funds. New clients who select Kraken to receive their FTX payout will get trading fee credits, allowing them to buy up to $50,000 in crypto on Kraken Pro with no trading fees, the exchange said in a blog announcement on Jan. 9. On top of that, clients will receive “up to $105 in Kraken trading fee credits,” based on the amount of funds they receive, which will be added to their accounts once the FTX distribution comes through, the exchange said.

Amid these fluctuations, insights from CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain shed light on the current state of Bitcoin’s price movements and the factors influencing them. In a post titled “Bitcoin Price Correction: Short-Term Volatility Amid Long-Term Bullish Outlook,” Avocado analyzed key on-chain metrics, highlighting trends that may define Bitcoin’s immediate and future trajectory. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $690 Million As Bitcoin, Ethereum Crash On-Chain Metrics Hint At Bitcoin’s Next Move The analyst pointed out that the ongoing decline in Bitcoin’s price has been fueled by several factors, including uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate adjustments, cautious market behavior ahead of political transitions, and concerns over state-held Bitcoin sales, which historically emerge during correction periods. These elements have combined to push market sentiment toward bearish territory. However, Avocado emphasized that the short-term outlook does not necessarily overshadow Bitcoin’s long-term potential for recovery and growth. Avocado’s analysis utilized on-chain data to assess the possibility of additional price corrections. One of the primary indicators examined was the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (30-day moving average), which revealed a dominance of sell-side activity. Following Bitcoin’s price surge in March 2024 and its recent all-time high, this ratio trended downward, signaling an overheated market. This pattern historically precedes periods of price decline, indicating potential for further corrections. Another metric, the Short-Term Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which measures short-term investors’ profitability, has dropped below 1. This indicates that many short-term holders are selling at a loss, a behavior that has been observed during prior correction phases. Similarly, the Funding Rates (30-day moving average), a measure of market sentiment among leveraged traders, is trending downward. Negative funding rates often precede a bearish market shift but can also pave the way for eventual recovery once sentiment stabilizes. Avocado wrote: While this analysis focuses on short-term price movements, Bitcoin is likely to rebound in the long run and resume its upward trend after completing the correction phase. Investors should remain strategic, avoid reacting to short-term noise, and focus on the broader bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown?

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $112 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of around $4.6 billion, has lost more than 12 percent in the last four days to trade about $191 on Friday, January 10, during the mid-European session. As a result, nearly $20 million was liquidated from Solana’s leveraged market, mostly involving long traders. Additionally, Solana’s Futures Open Interest (OI) dropped around 2 percent in the last 24 hours to hover about $5.79 billion at the time of this writing. Solana Whale Panic Sells On-data analysis shows that a major Solana whale has been unstaking and depositing the coins to Binance in the recent past. In the past 24 hours, the specific Solana whale unstaked 245,921 SOLs and deposited 246,064 SOL to the Binance exchange, potentially taking profit after an impressive rally in 2024. The Solana network is heavily dominated by investors seeking to earn passively through its staking program.

Crypto’s mainstream appeal grows, but access limitations for advisors leave many clients investing outside the advisory relationship. A new survey by Bitwise Asset Management and ETF data provider VettaFi reveals that most financial advisors still face challenges in accessing crypto for their clients. Only 35% of advisors said they could buy crypto in client accounts, highlighting a major barrier to broader adoption. Advisors’ clients express interest in crypto | Source: Bitwise You might also like: Advisors ‘cautious’ with Bitcoin ETF adoption, says BlackRock exec The survey, conducted from Nov. 14 to Dec. 20, 2024, included over 400 financial advisors. It showed that while crypto allocations have doubled to 22% year-over-year, access issues still persist. Meanwhile, 71% of advisors reported that “some” or “all” of their clients are investing in crypto independently, outside the advisory relationship. Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, pointed out that advisors are “awakening to crypto’s potential like never before, and they’re allocating like never before.” “But perhaps most staggering is how much room we still have to run, with two-thirds of all financial advisors — who advise millions of Americans and manage trillions in assets — still unable to access crypto for clients.” Matt Hougan Although there are still some barriers, interest remains strong. Ninety-six percent of advisors received questions about crypto from clients in 2024, and 99% of advisors with existing crypto allocations plan to maintain or increase their exposure in 2025. The findings also showed growing optimism among advisors. Nineteen percent of those who haven’t allocated to crypto yet said they are likely to add exposure in 2025, more than double last year’s figure, the report reads.

In a new episode of the Unchained podcast, Krüger says that Bitcoin has more upside potential and is not even “remotely” close to the cycle top. According to the economist and trader, the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January of 2024 could result in the crypto king no longer following the usual four-year cycles that revolve around the halving. “I think that what happened is the introduction of the ETF and the flows which are significant, they tie together and they make the correlation between risk and Bitcoin more sustainable. So that’s why I’m not thinking about a cycle top… …at the same time market conditions for Bitcoin they are changing because the impact of the halving is lesser and we have ETFs now. So I am on the super cycle side of things.” Krüger, however, says that a supercycle doesn’t mean that “we go up only.” “It means that we have shorter [corrections]… for as long as equities do well and the economy does well, that may not be the same but they are usually the same. We have smaller drawdowns that last for shorter [periods of time].” Bitcoin is trading at $93,134 at time of writing, around 10% below the 2025 high of about $102,000.

U.K. Authorities have updated a section of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which regulates financial markets in the U.K., to clarify that crypto staking is not a “collective investment scheme.” Staking is a process where blockchain users lock up a network’s native tokens for a chance to participate in transaction validation on proof-of-stake blockchain networks like Ethereum. In return, participants earn rewards, usually in the form of additional tokens. The Treasury’s amendment clarifies that staking does not fit the definition of a collective investment scheme. A CIS involves arrangements where individuals pool their funds for shared profits or income, such as exchange-traded funds or mutual funds. These are regulated by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, requiring registration, authorization, and ongoing compliance by approved managers to ensure investor protection. You might also like: UK government to introduce legislation on stablecoins, staking: report The updated law explicitly states that ‘arrangements for qualifying crypto asset staking do not amount to a collective investment scheme,’ distinguishing staking from traditional investment models. The amendment will be effective starting Jan. 31 and applies to all four constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Commenting on the development, Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys, described it as a positive step, stating that “the way a blockchain works is not an investment scheme” but rather a form of “cybersecurity.” This clarification aligns with broader efforts by British officials to regulate crypto assets and staking services in a way that fosters innovation while reducing legal uncertainty. As previously reported by crypto.news, in November, the Treasury announced plans to introduce crypto-specific legislation, focusing on stablecoins and staking exemptions to make the U.K. more appealing to blockchain firms. In October, a proposal to categorize digital assets as personal property was presented in parliament as a response to a consultation paper published by the Law Commission, which recommended including digital assets under property law.

Lava is a novel protocol providing users with a fast and reliable experience interacting with blockchain apps. At the heart of the system is the LAVA ($LAVA) token, which routes user traffic, such as DeFi transactions and data queries, between wallets, data providers, and blockchains. LAVA holders are integral to the network, staking their tokens to direct traffic to the fastest and most reliable providers. This drives superior performance and scalability across 40+ chains, with Lava processing over 100 billion transaction requests to date , making LAVA an essential tool for maintaining a high-performing network with minimal downtime. Key integrations with Lava Network include leading dApps and enterprises such as Keplr, Paraswap, Axelar, and Hypernative, all of which depend on LAVA to keep their user traffic flowing smoothly and efficiently. Strong Fundamentals Behind $LAVA Lava’s rapid growth is backed by its robust fundamentals. Since its Mainnet pre-launch in late July 2024 , the network has secured over $3.5 million in ARR and $1m+ in onchain revenue. Its tokenomics model fosters long-term value: LAVA’s supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, with no inflationary mechanisms. All investor and team allocations are locked until 2026. LAVA’s tokenomics include a monthly burn mechanism that dynamically adjusts to attract more data providers to the network, with 1.5% of the total token supply burned so far. Lava also offers a first-of-its-kind revenue-sharing model where contributors can potentially earn rewards directly in the native tokens of supported blockchains. Over $1 million is currently being distributed in native tokens such as AXL, NEAR, and USDC, to LAVA stakers and data providers for securing and optimizing the protocol. Staking rewards can be explored at pools.lavanet.xyz, offering users a direct incentive to participate in the network’s growth. “Blockchains are digital cities with their own economies,” said Amir Aaronson, Head of the Lava Foundation. “As humans and AI agents increasingly move onchain, they need reliable roads to carry their transactions and data. $LAVA powers these roads, ensuring the free flow of digital commerce. Owning a piece of the Lava Network is like owning a share in the infrastructure that keeps these cities running.” Magma Devs, a contributor to Lava, raised $15M from prominent investors such as Hashkey, Tribe, and Jump, while Lava Foundation secured over $11M in a private token round from leading founders and community members from Cosmos, Polkadot, Filecoin, and NEAR. Lava is positioned as the protocol managing traffic from AI agents and dapps on every blockchain. For more information, users can visit lavanet.xyz . About Lava Network Lava Network enables 24/7 access to blockchain apps, with minimal downtime. Lava is a protocol which coordinates traffic from AI agents, apps and wallets on every blockchain. Lava aggregates RPC providers and directs the flow of transactions and data queries such as your wallet balance, based on the speed and reliability of the provider.

The update was accompanied by a visual representation of the transaction flows, indicating a significant move away from the asset by BlackRock. The crypto market activity tracker stated , “guys I have some bad news, BlackRock is not buying. In fact, they are selling.” BlackRock’s influence in the crypto sector grew after its launch of a Bitcoin ETF, named iShares Bitcoin Trust Bitcoin Holdings (IBIT). Analysts believe the entity is part of why BTC had a year of the books. However, following Arkham Intelligence’s insight, speculation is growing that the asset manager could be selling BTC in reaction to the coin’s recent market pullback. BlackRock Bitcoin market activity concerns community In May 2024, BlackRock reportedly moved a substantial amount of Bitcoin into cold storage, which was perceived by the market as a long-term investment strategy. The move was seen as a bullish signal, as investors rode on optimism that one of the most conservative financial institutions was betting on the longevity of Bitcoin. However, on December 26, BlackRock made headlines when it reportedly sold $188.7 million worth of Bitcoin, its largest sell-off yet. On the same day, according to multiple sources , the asset manager transferred $1.88 billion worth of BTC to Coinbase wallets. The transactions were carried out in multiple tranches, drawing attention from market watchers. At the time, it was unclear whether the firm was planning on letting go of the holdings or retain them on the exchange. One user on X commented on the potential market impact, suggesting that BlackRock’s selling could lead to a short-term bearish sentiment, although long-term investors might see this as an opportunity to buy at lower prices. Another added to the conversation by saying, “Institutions often sell when they think the market has peaked or for portfolio rebalancing, not necessarily because they’re bearish on the asset.” Meanwhile, on January 2, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded its largest single-day net outflow, with investors withdrawing $332.6 million, according to data from Farside Investors. The investment vehicle hadn’t seen a negative net investment flow for the next four days up until January 8, where outflows peaked $100 million. BTC ETF Flow chart. Source: Farside Investors. The IBIT, which holds the title of the largest Bitcoin ETF with approximately $56.2 billion in net assets, has been a dominant player in the cryptocurrency market. The ETF attracted over $37 billion in inflows, which analysts believe contributed to Bitcoin’s rally to a new all-time high of over $108,000 in December. BlackRock: Bitcoin supply can be changed In other news, BlackRock released an explainer video that questions the immutability of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap. The video, which gripped the community’s attention after being shared by MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, describes Bitcoin’s supply limit as a “hard-coded rule” designed to control supply, preserve purchasing power, and prevent the excessive issuance of currency.

The video’s implications have sparked debate over whether BlackRock’s growing influence in Bitcoin could lead to the cryptocurrency being “hijacked.” Joel Valenzuela, a sales and marketing executive for the cryptocurrency Dash, suggests that such messaging is preparing the public for a potential supply cap increase. “They’re getting everyone used to this eventuality,” Valenzuela noted. “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.” And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",Bitcoin News & Insights|BlackRock|BTC|IBIT|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-10 09:08:29
38743437,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=120267,1736500144,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bridging Traditional Finance and DeFi in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bridging-traditional-finance-and-defi-in-2025/,"The financial world keeps moving fast as TradFi and DeFi look at new ways of working together. TradFi has for a long period of time served as the backbone of global economies through offering reliable systems in banking, loans, and investment opportunities. In the meantime, DeFi is leading in new blockchain-based financial solutions, with transparency, accessibility, and efficiency. A question that appears for 2025 is whether these two systems will coexist; rather, how the collaboration between these systems can ensure a better future for finance. Understanding TradFi and DeFi TradFi refers to traditional finance , including banks, stock exchanges, and insurance. It is considered centralized, controlled, and regulated to function. Although these forms have historically offered stability and trust in financial transactions, the systems frequently have inefficiencies and are inaccessible to the most disadvantaged individuals. DeFi, on the other hand, uses blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer financial transactions devoid of middlemen. It makes use of smart contracts, which automatically carry out agreements, lowering expenses and increasing transparency. The growth of DeFi platforms has grown from simple forms to tokenized lending, decentralized exchanges, and institutional crypto investments. The gap is in the aspect of control and innovation approach employed by these systems. Understanding their strengths calls for finding out how they can complement one another. Key Trends Shaping Collaboration in 2025 Several trends are shaping the integration of TradFi and DeFi in 2025: Institutional Crypto Adoption: Large financial institutions are investigating how decentralized technology could improve operations as they venture into the blockchain finance arena. Tokenized Lending and Assets: Conventional assets, including equities, bonds, and real estate , are becoming more and more tokenized and available via DeFi systems. Regulatory Progress: To guarantee the security of decentralized finance without impeding innovation, governments and regulators are developing frameworks. Hybrid Financial Products : Products combining elements of TradFi and DeFi, such as blockchain-based savings accounts, are emerging as practical solutions. Enhanced Blockchain Interoperability : Improved connectivity between blockchains allows seamless integration of DeFi solutions into traditional systems. These trends signal a future where collaboration is not just possible but necessary to meet modern financial demands. How TradFi Benefits from DeFi TradFi institutions can gain significantly by integrating DeFi principles: Increased Efficiency : Blockchain finance reduces transaction times and operational costs by eliminating intermediaries. Transparency : DeFi’s public ledger ensures every transaction is traceable, enhancing trust among stakeholders. Expanded Reach : By using decentralized systems, banks can provide services to unbanked populations in remote regions. New Investment Opportunities : Institutional crypto investments open doors to innovative financial products with higher growth potential. For instance, a traditional bank might offer tokenized lending services, where customers use blockchain tokens as collateral for loans. This setup not only attracts crypto-savvy users but also modernizes the bank’s offerings. How DeFi Gains from TradFi DeFi, while innovative, also benefits from traditional finance partnerships: Regulatory Guidance : TradFi’s experience with regulations can help DeFi platforms operate within legal frameworks. Market Stability : TradFi institutions bring stability and liquidity to often volatile DeFi markets. Broader User Base : Collaborating with banks and financial firms can introduce more users to decentralized finance. Challenges in Bridging the Gap The collaboration between TradFi and DeFi faces challenges, including: Regulatory Uncertainty : Governments struggle to keep up with the pace of DeFi innovation, creating compliance hurdles. Security Concerns : DeFi’s reliance on smart contracts makes it vulnerable to hacks and exploits. Cultural Differences : Traditional institutions prioritize stability, while DeFi emphasizes rapid innovation. Overcoming these challenges requires dialogue between stakeholders and a willingness to adapt. A balanced approach can lead to solutions that protect users and foster innovation. Examples of Integration The integration of TradFi and DeFi is already underway in various forms: Integration Method Example Benefit Tokenized Lending Banks offering loans backed by crypto tokens Attracts tech-savvy customers Decentralized Savings Accounts Hybrid savings products combining TradFi and DeFi Higher returns with added security Blockchain-Based Payments Credit card firms using blockchain networks Faster and cheaper cross-border transactions The Future of TradFi and DeFi As we progress through 2025, the collaboration between TradFi and DeFi will likely define the financial world. The synergy of traditional institutions’ stability with decentralized finance’s innovation holds great potential. Tokenized lending, institutional crypto adoption , and hybrid financial products are just the beginning. For users, this bridge means greater financial inclusion, more accessible investments, and efficient services. It means that governments, businesses, and individuals need to evolve in order to work in a digitized economy. Bridging TradFi and DeFi isn’t about the technology; it’s about building a financial system that works for all people.",Learn|DeFi|traditional finance,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-10 09:09:04

Cardano’s ADA rebounded to $0.97, with analysts predicting future highs between $6.45 and $7. Bitcoin (BTC) fluctuated from $102K to $92K, now at $94.5K, with forecasts as high as $500K for 2025. What’s New Around Ripple? Ripple, the company behind the popular cryptocurrency XRP, continues to make huge waves in the digital asset space. Last month, it officially launched a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the American dollar, called RLUSD. The product triggered huge excitement across the community and received support from numerous leading crypto exchanges, such as Uphold, Bitso, Bullish, Moonpay, and others. As CryptoPotato reported , the latest to hop on the bandwagon was the European-based Bitstamp. The entity added RLUSD on the Ethereum network, describing it as “a robust solution designed for institutional-grade financial use cases.” The exact trading pairs available to users are RLUSD/EUR, RLUSD/USD, RLUSD/USDT, RLUSD/BTC, RLUSD/ETH, and RLUSD/XRP. Earlier this week, Ripple’s president, Monica Long, said people should expect other well-known crypto exchanges to embrace the stablecoin “imminently.” ADA Forecasts The cryptocurrency market experienced a substantial retreat in the past few days, with Cardano (ADA) among the worst-affected tokens. Its price dropped from $1.14 on January 7 to $0.88 on January 9. The sector recovered some of the losses in the last several hours and ADA pumping to its current $0.97 (per CoinGecko’s data). ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Meanwhile, numerous analysts believe the asset is poised for a real bull run in the near future . Dan Gambardello claimed that ADA has “one of the most bullish weekly pattern setups in crypto,” which represents an “inverse head and shoulders with upward sloping neckline.” He assumed that a breakout to the upside could result in a price rally to as high as $7. For their part, Altcoin Daily made bullish predictions about multiple cryptocurrencies, envisioning ADA’s price hitting $6.45 sometime in 2025. BTC’s Price Swings Similar to ADA, the primary cryptocurrency has also witnessed enhanced volatility recently. Recall that BTC surpassed $102,000 on January 7 but retraced below $92,000 two days later. The bulls managed to recover some ground, and as of this writing, the asset’s price stands at over $94,500. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the significant fluctuations, many analysts on X remain optimistic that 2025 will be a highly successful year for the cryptocurrency. One popular X user suggested that BTC could skyrocket to $210,000 before Valentine’s Day, while another envisioned a massive spike to as high as $500,000.

BREAKING: @Ripple transferred 300,000,000 #XRP worth $682,584,540 to an unknown wallet! pic.twitter.com/8rZhS6nKqv — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) January 9, 2025 What Could the Transaction Mean? The community has begun speculating about potential reasons for such a significant transaction. While large transfers of cryptocurrency often happen, Ripple’s involvement suggests the movement could be tied to corporate operations. Ripple had engaged in similar large-scale transfers as part of its business strategy, which includes supporting its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services and facilitating sales to institutional clients. Given Ripple’s history of managing XRP’s circulation through escrow releases and other means, this transaction could signify preparations for internal business operations or liquidity provisioning. Some community members have pointed to the timing of the transfer, noting the company’s past use of XRP for ODL expansion across various markets. ODL, which utilizes XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions, has seen significant adoption globally, with Ripple actively promoting its use among financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Increasing Whale Activity in the Ecosystem It is also worth noting that this transfer follows a period of heightened activity among XRP whales. December 2024 witnessed several large transfers as market participants repositioned their holdings ahead of the new year. While whale movements are typically associated with accumulation or profit-taking strategies, Ripple’s involvement differentiates this transaction, given its role in overseeing XRP’s supply and adoption. The specifics of the transaction remain unconfirmed, as Ripple has not commented on its purpose. However, large-scale movements like this often attract attention from supporters and critics of the project as they could potentially influence market dynamics. At press time, XRP has not reacted to this development. The asset is trading at $2.32, with a minor 2.3% increase over the past 24 hours. Observers continue to monitor Ripple’s wallet activities closely, especially as the company works to expand its partnerships and payment solutions. The scale and timing of this transfer may suggest strategic planning by Ripple, either for operational purposes or as part of its broader goals for XRP adoption.

In relation to defendant Ripple’s summary judgment motion, the judge agrees to seal records of confidential, sensitive, and personally identifiable information as the case now proceeds in a US appeals court. Judge Issues Order in Line With Ripple in XRP Lawsuit In the latest court filing in the XRP lawsuit, Senior District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton granted the parties’ motion to prevent public access to some confidential documents in the Ripple case. The court agreed with Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s requests, which meets the Ninth Circuit’s “compelling reasons” standard. The “compelling reasons” is a legal standard applied to decide whether the reasons for sealing documents outweigh the public’s interest in disclosure. Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghose requested sealing eight exhibits submitted in support of motion for summary judgment in the XRP lawsuit. The defendants also sought fifty-six exhibits in support of plaintiff’s opposition to defendants’ motion for summary judgment. As CoinGape reported earlier, the court ruled in favor of Ripple in the summary judgment. Source: Court Listener “The previous motions to seal filed by the parties (Dkt. 338, 340, 342, 343, 347, 349, 356, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 373, 379, 380, 381, 382, 387, and 389) are terminated as moot,” as per the court filing. Similarly, plaintiff’s requested the district court to seal portions of exhibits 29, 30, and 33 submitted in support of defendants Ripple and Brad Garlinghouse’s motion for summary judgment. As well as, exhibit 6 in support of the defendants’ motion to exclude the testimony of Steven P. Feinstein, based on the presence of confidential, sensitive, and personally identifiable information in the XRP lawsuit. The court grants the plaintiff’s motion to seal, concluding that the narrowed redactions sought by plaintiff do meet the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal’s “compelling reasons” standard. US SEC Prepares to File Principal Brief in Ripple Case Meanwhile, the XRP community awaits key U.S. SEC’s principal brief related to its appeals in SEC v. Ripple . However, lawyers such as Jeremy Hogan and ex-SEC Marc Fagel believe pro-crypto Paul Atkins under the Trump administration may decide not to pursue the appeal further. CoinGape has glanced at what could be expected from the opening brief by the U.S. SEC , as per Form C and outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s stance on crypto.

While firms like Tesla currently own Bitcoin, Sigel argues that Block’s planned and recurrent BTC accumulation distinguishes it as a pioneer in incorporating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. How Block Inc. stands out Block Inc. is a strong contender for the S&P 500 as it allocates 10% of its monthly Bitcoin gross income to BTC investments, giving Block Inc. an edge over companies like Tesla. Block is also a core participant in the Bitcoin market, holding 8,363 BTC, which equals $775 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries.Net data, the Block’s Bitcoin holdings makes it the eighth-largest corporate holder of the leading crypto. Criteria for S&P 500 inclusion Sigel went on to share insights on X regarding the criteria companies need to meet for S&P 500 inclusion. Here are the six key requirements: Market cap: Company’s capitalization should exceed $18 billion. Public float: At least 10% of shares must be publicly available. Earning: The most recent quarter’s earnings and the sum of the previous four quarters’ GAAP earnings must be positive. Liquidation: The company must display high liquidity. IPO Seasoning: The company must have been publicly traded for at least 12 months. US Domicile: The company must have its headquarters in the U.S. Block met the criteria after the first quarter of 2024. Companies that fulfill all of these standards have been listed in the index within three to 21 months, with the S&P Committee making the final decision. According to Matthew Sigel, the S&P Index Committee prioritizes sector diversification. Coinbase is another company that also meets the standards. However, it might face increased scrutiny because of its ‘pure-play crypto exposure’. In this case, Block Inc. appears to be a safer and more conventional option for inclusion. What makes S&P inclusion important? S&P 500 inclusion is among the core goals of a company that aims to become a leading player in the market. It indicates financial stability, strong market performance, and synchronization with larger economic trends. Investors benefit from increased exposure and credibility as S&P 500 index funds and ETFs purchase the company’s stock. Block’s prospective inclusion will not only improve its credibility as a financial pioneer, but it will also mark a watershed moment for Bitcoin’s entrance into mainstream financial markets. Block Inc.’s potential inclusion into the S&P 500 index comes as MicroStrategy, a software firm that has been aggressively accumulating BTC since 2022, recently made it into the Nasdaq index.

Amid this, an expert has predicted key support levels for Ripple’s native crypto, while setting a bullish long-term target of $10 for the asset. However, it’s worth noting that despite this bullish outlook, the analyst warned of a potential slip to $1.5 for the crypto before the breakout. However, here we explore some of the top reasons that could boost the crypto’s price in the coming days. Here’s Why XRP Price May Rally XRP price has been on the investors’ radar, especially with the approaching deadline for the US SEC to file its opening brief on the Ripple lawsuit. In addition, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty and CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently had dinner with Donald Trump, which has further fueled speculations. Simultaneously, the speculations over a potential XRP ETF approval have also soared among traders. For context, as Trump is about to be sworn in on January 20, optimism soared over potential pro-crypto regulatory developments in the US. Besides, the recent dinner has further sparked discussions over a favorable environment for Ripple and its native crypto in the coming days. Having said that, the market participants also expect the upcoming US SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, to drop the Ripple SEC case potentially. On the other hand, many believe a potential settlement in the XRP lawsuit is imminent under the upcoming SEC chair and after Trump’s inauguration. Despite these positive developments, the recent market volatility has fueled concerns among investors. Here we explore the key supports and potential targets for XRP, as discussed by an expert. XRP Price Risks Falling To $1.5 Before Breakout A top market expert, Ali Martinez said that XRP price is at risk of a significant downturn. If the cryptocurrency breaks out of its triangle pattern to the downside, it could lead to a sharp decline. Martinez predicts that in such a scenario, Ripple’s native crypto could plummet to as low as $1.5, citing the .618 Fibonacci level as a potential target. This would represent a substantial drop, sparking concerns among investors. However, in a separate X post, Martinez said that “XRP offers two potential entries.” This has gained notable traction from the investors, especially with his bullish long-term outlook on the coin. For context, the expert said that “the first rising trendline of the pennant is at $2.05.” In addition, he has set another key entry line at $2.50. However, the expert sets an XRP price target of $10, irrespective of the entry point or support levels of the crypto. This showcases his growing confidence towards the asset which has also bolstered market confidence. Source: Ali Martinez, X How’s Ripple’s Native Crypto Performing? XRP price was down 0.55% and exchanged hands at $2.31, while its trading volume rose 30% to $5.4 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.33 and $2.24, respectively. Besides, the crypto’s futures open interest fell 0.4% to $4.25 billion, reflecting the cautious stance of investors. However, it’s worth noting that despite XRP’s dip today, the global crypto market cap surged about 2%. Simultaneously, the recent dip also comes as Ripple Labs has recently moved 300 million XRP, worth $682 million, which has fueled speculations. However, many have deemed the recent transaction as an internal transfer of the token. Meanwhile, despite the slight dip in price recently, it appears that the crypto is poised to rally in the long run. Besides, the expert’s target of $10 for the crypto has further bolstered market sentiment.

USD0++, the staked version of the USD0 stablecoin by Usual, dropped to $0.92 — 8% below its previous redemption value — after new early exit options triggered a sell-off and disrupted its largest Curve pool. USD0++ is not a stablecoin. It is a staked version of USD0, designed to lock funds for four years while earning USUAL tokens as rewards. Previously, USD0++ could be redeemed 1:1 with USD0, but now users must choose between two exit options: a conditional exit, redeeming 1:1 but forfeiting part of accrued rewards, or an unconditional exit at a floor price starting at $0.87 and gradually increasing to $1 over four years. So @usualmoney team has been claiming for a few weeks that USD0++ was redeemable for 1:1 USD0 so everything was chill. Today, they stopped the 1:1 redeem function without any prior announcement to trap farmers and keep their TVL. USD0++ is now trading at $0.92. Please send this… pic.twitter.com/aZNArIQoy0 — CBB (@Cbb0fe) January 10, 2025 The changes have turned USD0++ into a mix of a bond and a yield farming tool. While high-risk users can stake USD0 into USD0++ to farm USUAL tokens with high yields, more conservative holders can lock funds for four years to earn a fixed 4% annual yield. You might also like: Stablecoins to move beyond trading in 2025, Dragonfly Capital exec predicts As a result, the system’s design creates trade-offs. USD0 holders sacrifice yield for stability, while USD0++ holders lock funds and hope USUAL rewards offset their lost yield, and USUAL stakers capture yields from others while betting on the token’s price appreciation. The recent updates have made USD0++ riskier and less appealing, with long lock-up periods and changing redemption rules making it less attractive than more liquid options, which led to a wave of selling as traders and yield farmers tried to exit, causing the largest Curve pool to become unbalanced and pushing the price of USD0++ below $1. As of press time, Usual Labs, the company behind the Usual protocol, made no public statements on USD0++’s price changes. In 2024, Usual Labs raised $7 million and secured a $75 million commitment in total value locked for USD0 from investors including IOSG Ventures, Kraken Ventures, GSR, Mantle, Starkware, and Flowdesk, among others.

Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Is Currently Sitting At 0.21 In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the Accumulation Trend Score has recently been looking for Bitcoin. The “Accumulation Trend Score” refers to an indicator that tells us about whether the Bitcoin investors are accumulating or not. Related Reading: Bitcoin Not Reached ‘Extreme Euphoria’ Phase Yet, Glassnode Reveals The indicator calculates its value not just by taking into account for the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors, but also by weighing the changes against the size of the holdings themselves. When the value of this metric is close to 1, it means the large entities on the network (or a large number of small addresses) are participating in net accumulation. On the other hand, it being near 0 implies the investors are in a phase of distribution (or they are simply not buying). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score over the past year: In the above graph, a dark blue/violet shade corresponds to high values of the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score, while an orange/red shade suggests values close to zero. From the chart, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score assumed a dark shade during the last couple of months of 2024, implying the whales were participating in heavy buying and helping fuel the run to the new all-time high. Towards the end of the year, accumulation from the investors started to drop and this year, the picture has completely turned upside down as the indicator has dropped to a low of 0.21. Glassnode has also shared the data for another version of the Accumulation Trend Score that breaks down the accumulation/distribution behaviors across the various BTC cohorts. As displayed in the graph, the largest investors in the sector, the “mega whales” holding more than 10,000 BTC, have interestingly been selling since September, with the distribution turning particularly heavy in the last couple of weeks. The rest of the cohorts were buying during the rally, but even they have taken to selling recently. The whales, holders who own between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, are taking part in a particularly strong amount of selling right now.

Meme coin enthusiasts are anxiously awaiting to see if this trend will continue into 2025. These tokens, often fueled by community enthusiasm and speculative hype, have generated significant returns for early investors. However, market analysts are now predicting that the peak of the meme coin frenzy may be behind us, as attention shifts toward more utility-driven projects. Among these emerging contenders, Remittix (RTX) is gaining momentum as an innovative platform focused on cross-border payments, and it seems poised for substantial growth in 2025. The question remains: Who will prevail between Shiba Inu and Pepe, and could Remittix be the next big name in decentralized finance (DeFi)? Pepe Dips 7% In First Week Of January Pepe (PEPE) saw massive gains in 2024 with a 1480% value surge as it leveraged internet culture and strong community engagement, however, Pepe’s momentum has now been slowed as 2025 begins. Pepe (PEPE) has seen a 7% dip in the first week of January and a net 32% decrease in the last 30 days. These struggles reflect Pepe’s reliance on community hype rather than concrete utility, and many Pepe (PEPE) holders are selling up as they look to diversify their portfolios. Pepe’s recent listing on major exchange BitMart will give Pepe (PEPE) some more exposure in the New Year, though this is unlikely to counteract the drop in its popularity. Shiba Inu Tries To Transition From Meme Coin To Utility Token Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been on a similar trajectory to Pepe in the last 30 days, with a 28% decrease on the whole, though it recovered almost 2% of this loss in the last week. Shiba Inu began dipping again over the past 24 hours, and some think Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) fate will be the same as Pepe’s if the meme coin trend falters. Shiba Inu (SHIB) worked hard in 2024 to avoid being seen as just another meme coin by launching ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and making several refinements to Shibarium. All these updates have led to some benefits for Shiba Inu users, such as lowering transaction costs, but they haven’t allowed Shiba Inu to create a new identity. Remittix Represents A New Era For Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX) represents the next evolution in cryptocurrency, focusing on utility-driven projects that have the potential to disrupt existing industries. The main aim of Remittix is to address inefficiencies in the $180 trillion cross-border payment sector by integrating advanced blockchain technology with traditional banking models. At the core of this platform is the thoughtfully designed $RTX token, which plays a crucial role in staking, governance, and platform rewards. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, RTX is rapidly becoming a highly sought-after asset. The platform allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and send funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. This seamless process eliminates hidden fees, provides instant transfers, and often offers rates that are more affordable than those of traditional banking methods. Moreover, businesses can take advantage of the Remittix Pay API, which enables the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments and facilitates fiat settlement. By empowering merchants to manage digital assets efficiently, Remittix is establishing a foundation for a more inclusive and versatile financial ecosystem. The ongoing Remittix (RTX) presale has already raised over $2.2 million, with the token currently priced at $0.0193. Experts predict an extraordinary 800% gain during the presale phase, with even more growth anticipated after the launch as the project gains momentum. For proactive investors, this is a unique opportunity to be part of the future of cross-border payments with Remittix.

Their love for crypto and XRP investment amid a declining Won has set citizens up for major digital asset investments. What’s more popular than crypto in South Korea? The K-pop industry. K-pop idols have taken over entertainment industries across the globe. Now, we are at an intersection of both. A K-pop entertainment CEO has been tied to a crypto scam project. On Thursday , Kang Seung-kon, Cube Entertainment’s largest shareholder, urged acquaintances and colleagues to invest in Nestree, a cryptocurrency developed by the South Korean blockchain company Nestree Media Group. The main allegation is that he deceived investors into investing in local crypto by fraudulently guaranteeing returns. 🇰🇷 Latest: K-pop's @cubeunited co-CEO Kang Seung-kon is accused of misleading investors into buying Nestree ($EGG) cryptocurrency with false return guarantees, as the token surged post-Cube's $68K investment before collapsing. #KPOP pic.twitter.com/4ApgpXqWED — CoinRank (@CoinRank_io) January 10, 2025 Additionally, in March 2022, Cube reportedly invested 100 million Korean won ($68,376) in Nestree Media Group through a capital increase. With the influence they carry, K-pop fans were quickly convinced. The fans are now on their “oppa’s” neck in requisite of their principal amount after the crypto fell. However, Kang Seung-kon has denied them saying that he did not promise anything of that sort. CEO Kang emphasized that “there was no fact that I recommended cryptocurrency investment on the condition of guaranteeing the principal.” He added, “Participation in the paid capital increase of Nestree Media Group was an investment made as part of Cube Entertainment’s expansion of its new blockchain business, and we plan to continue our business collaboration with Nestree in the future.” Normally, Korean fans are very loyal, but they can still be bullies if they are crossed. This leaves the company in danger with the authorities and with their fans. The crypto scam – Details Kang Seung-kon invested in a paid-in capital increase by Nestree Media Group in March 2022 to secure a 40% stake in the company. After the news emerged that Cube Entertainment had participated in the legacy of Nestree Media Group, the price of Nestree rocketed. We are thrilled to announce that Nestree has joined forces with @klaydice and Cube Entertainment to organize a blockchain consortium 😎 Check more details in this post 👇 https://t.co/LdEApJB1Dn — Nestree (@nestree_io) August 4, 2022 Notably, Nestree Media Group is an IT-based blockchain technology company. It operates an e-commerce ‘Nestree Mall’ using the crypto Nestree. It is also engaged in a business related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Apparently, Nestree, which was trading in the 5-won range in February 2022, surged to the 50-won range following the announcement of the legacy. The news of the collaboration with Cube Entertainment literally resulted in a price increase of over tenfold in a month. It has been alleged that CEO Kang recommended investment in Nestree to those in his vicinity. He did this during the period in which Cube Entertainment participated in the legacy of Nestree Media Group. A person who invested in the crypto said, “CEO Kang recommended investment in early 2022, stating, ‘I will guarantee the principal, so trust me and buy.'” He added, “People in the securities industry, Cube Entertainment officials, and private loan sharks believed CEO Kang’s words and rushed to invest in Nestree.” Another person believed CEO Kang’s statements and invested approximately 80 million won in Nestree. However, Nestree’s value plummeted, resulting in a loss of over 70 million won. Nestree was listed on domestic crypto exchanges Coinone and Bithumb in August 2019 and April 2020, respectively. However, its current main business, the messenger, has effectively ceased operations. The ‘Nestree Mall,’ which offers discounts based on the amount of Nestree held, has not yet closed, but all registered products are sold out or have been discontinued. Meanwhile, Nestree reached its highest point on March 28, 2022, at 59 won on the local exchange Bithumb . Subsequently, it experienced a 34% decline to 39 won within a month. According to Bithumb, the token’s price plummeted to single digits after 2022 and is presently trading at approximately 4.9 won. What is next for Cube Entertainment The South Korean government is taking no chances when it comes to guaranteeing transparency in cryptocurrency transactions. The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) is enforcing the Virtual Asset Users Protection Act. Insider trading, market price manipulation, and other unethical trading practices are among the actions that have been examined. The Korean authorities have become really good at catching scammers. Last year, they were able to track down lost cryptocurrencies that had been pointed to North Korea. Notably, according to the regulations, cryptocurrency fraudsters are subject to severe repercussions, such as the possibility of life imprisonment for operations that exceed $4 million. South Korean authorities intend to guarantee cryptocurrency exchanges’ compliance and prevent unlawful activities by adopting a zero-tolerance policy. Well, the K-pop company might be in some big trouble. This is the inevitable outcome of the trend of all these CEOs of K-pop companies desperately wanting to cosplay as their hero tech peers. However, in actuality, these allegations also elevate him to the same level as renowned figures such as the Hawk Tuah girl. Also, it was inevitable that K-pop companies would either be taken over by these individuals or be captivated by line-go-up thinking, given their current status as significant businesses. However, it is disheartening that it appears that none of them are satisfied with simply operating a music business effectively.

A coalition of investors has accused Kang of promoting Nestree, a cryptocurrency launched by South Korean blockchain firm Nestree Media Group, as a promising investment with guaranteed returns, according to a Jan. 9 report by local media outlet The Korea Economic Daily. Nestree Media Group advertised itself as a blockchain-based technology company specializing in community-focused messenger services and e-commerce platforms. Its cryptocurrency, Nestree, was listed on major South Korean exchanges, including Coinone in August 2019 and Bithumb in April 2020. Notably, the K-pop company’s CEO made these claims following reports of Cube Entertainment’s 100 million won ($68,376) investment in Nestree Media Group through a capital increase in March 2022, which triggered a tenfold surge in the cryptocurrency’s price in less than a month’s time. However, not long after Kang’s comments, the token’s value reportedly crashed from a high of 59 won to around 39 won within a month, ultimately plummeting to single digits by the end of 2022. Around this time, investors, some of whom reportedly invested as much as 80 million KRW (roughly $54,567) in the cryptocurrency, demanded their principal be returned, but Kang denied ever guaranteeing such returns. Further investors alleged that at the time, Kang suggested they could recoup their losses by investing in other cryptocurrencies he claimed to be working on listing on domestic exchanges. You might also like: Two South Koreans arrested for alleged price manipulation on Bithumb According to The Korea Economic Daily, Kang has dismissed all allegations as baseless and said he never advised anyone to invest in Nestree with a guarantee of principal protection. Regarding Cube Entertainment’s investment in the project, he said it was a move to expand the company’s blockchain portfolio and affirmed that their collaboration with Nestree Media Group would continue as planned. Kang also admitted to personally investing in Nestree but claimed he did not profit from the investment. Investors are reportedly considering legal action against Kang, who could face serious consequences if the allegations are proven true, and his actions might be deemed a form of market manipulation under South Korean law. South Korea’s crackdown on market manipulation South Korean regulators do not take allegations of market manipulation lightly, having charged several individuals in the past who were found guilty of such activities. On Jan. 3, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office’s Virtual Asset Joint Investigation Team arrested two individuals who allegedly profited from manipulating the price of the ACE cryptocurrency on Bithumb. Similar charges were b rought against an individual market maker in July, while four employees of crypto exchange Coinone were indicted in May 2023 for alleged market manipulation involving 46 coins during its listing process. In May of 2024, South Korea’s Ministry of Justice established a special task force to monitor and mitigate market manipulation and fraud in the crypto sector.

Despite the market crash and Bitcoin dropping to the $92K level, he has highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to reach unprecedented heights, possibly hitting $200,000 by year-end, as adoption accelerates. According to him, this is just a temporary phase and the market will open to new heights soon for altcoins. Top Crypto Picks of 2025 Ethereum Scaramucci reaffirmed his belief in Ethereum as a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Despite its declining popularity in recent months, he emphasized Ethereum’s unmatched network utility, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), and its widespread adoption. According to Scaramucci, Ethereum remains a long-term winner, even if short-term market cycles suggest otherwise. Solana One of Scaramucci’s top picks is Solana, which he praised for its speed, low transaction costs, and increasing adoption. He highlighted its potential to rival Ethereum in terms of scalability and application diversity. Reflecting on Solana’s journey, he shared his experience of holding through its dramatic dip to $8 in 2023, underscoring the importance of patience in crypto investing. Polkadot and Web3 Gaming Scaramucci identified Polkadot as a critical player in the evolution of Web3 gaming. He likened its potential impact to the transformation of entertainment technologies, comparing it to the leap from VHS to 4K streaming. Polkadot’s ability to enable cross-chain communication and interoperability positions it as a leader in this space. Avalanche and Algorand: Hidden Gems Avalanche and Algorand were highlighted as undervalued projects with immense potential. Scaramucci praised Avalanche for its high throughput and developer-friendly ecosystem. For Algorand, he pointed to its innovative technology and the leadership of John Wood, a former Cardano executive, as key drivers of growth. Sui and Aptos: Future Powerhouses Scaramucci also expressed confidence in Sui and Aptos, describing them as chains with long-term potential. He believes these platforms will play a significant role in the multi-chain future, complementing Bitcoin’s position as a “hard currency” in the crypto world. Investing Strategy: Patience Over Panic Scaramucci urged investors to “get off zero” by increasing their crypto allocation gradually. He recommended dollar-cost averaging into blue-chip assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. According to Scaramucci, the key to success lies in staying patient, embracing volatility, and avoiding the mistake of selling too early. His target for Solana, for instance, is $2,500, reflecting his belief in the long-term growth of the ecosystem. He believes ETH and Solana are creating ripples in the market with a constant surge they can see more adoptions especially Solana which he sees as a cheaper and much faster altcoin than ETH.

Accordingly, investors said they were more open to investing in cryptocurrencies after Trump won the US elections in November. According to the results of a survey conducted by Bitwise, the number of investors looking to invest in cryptocurrencies in the US increased after Trump's victory. Accordingly, more than half of the US-based financial advisors who participated in the Bitwise survey stated that they were more inclined to invest in cryptocurrencies after Trump won the US presidential election. According to the data, 56% of respondents said they were more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies this year following the November 5 election. It was stated that these results include Trump's pro-crypto stance and the increasing expectation that there will be more crypto-friendly regulations in the US with the Trump administration. Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, commented on the survey results: “Advisors are realizing the potential of cryptocurrencies like never before and are dedicating more resources to investing than ever before.” Additionally, 71% of advisors stated that their clients invest in cryptocurrencies independently. Bitwise analysts stated that users still have trouble accessing cryptocurrencies, according to the survey results, and said, “Access remains the biggest barrier to crypto adoption. Only 35% of advisors said they can buy cryptocurrencies from their client accounts.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Striking Results from Cryptocurrency Survey!

Pepeto , a memecoin with a compelling backstory and innovative roadmap, is positioning itself to be a standout in 2025. With a unique blend of mythology and modern blockchain technology, Pepeto’s value proposition is unmatched. Pepeto’s Godlike Beginning Pepeto’s journey began thousands of years ago during the rise of the Sumerian Civilization. This ancient civilization, known for its early advancements, is where Pepeto first discovered the documents of Power and Energy. These two principles laid the groundwork for Pepeto’s future path. The god of frogs continued his journey through time, reaching ancient China. Here, he uncovered the document representing Precision, inspired by the ancient Chinese philosophies that valued accuracy and calculated strategies. Pepeto’s next stop was ancient Egypt, a place where he found the fourth document: Efficiency. The grandeur of Egypt’s pyramids and the strategic planning behind the Nile River’s flooding left a lasting impression on the god of frogs. Efficiency became an integral part of Pepeto’s mission. In more recent times, Pepeto’s journey led him to the rise of blockchain technology. Witnessing the dawn of the crypto age, he met key figures like Satoshi Nakamoto and secured the final two documents: Technology and Optimization. These principles perfectly align with the evolving world of digital currencies. Top Cryptos to Keep an Eye on in 2025 Bitcoin trades at $93,133.38 , commanding a massive $1.85 trillion slice of the market. While it slipped 2.66% yesterday, its capped token supply and core strength suggest enduring value. Coming in second, Ethereum sits at $3,301.74 , with a $397 billion valuation and maintaining its crown in decentralized applications. The broader digital asset landscape hints at careful confidence, even as Bitcoin’s dominance dips. Meanwhile, Tether maintains steady ground at $0.999485 , serving as a trusted harbor for traders. Though market sentiment leans sunny according to the Fear and Greed gauge, investors should stay alert Staking and Rewards Pepeto’s staking mechanism stands out as one of its key attractions, offering token holders the opportunity to earn rewards through staking their assets. This approach motivates sustained involvement while ensuring ecosystem stability through long-term commitment. The project offers staking rewards of over 400% annually, and so far over 20 trillion tokens have been staked. When holders stake their tokens, they actively strengthen Pepeto’s network security, directly contributing to its development trajectory. With increasing competition in cryptocurrency markets, the staking functionality could emerge as Pepeto’s distinguishing advantage. Another aspect is Pepeto’s introduction of PepetoSwap, a specialized trading platform designed specifically for meme-based cryptocurrencies. This innovative exchange aims to address a crucial gap in the crypto ecosystem by delivering a strong, expandable, and efficient trading environment tailored for memecoin transactions.

Many cryptocurrencies are facing declining trends, losing their bullishness amid uncertainties. The Chainlink price is continuing the downtrend, with panic sentiments rising among LINK holders, but analysts continue to regard this as a buying opportunity. Let’s discuss. Should You Buy Chainlink as LINK Holders FUD Chainlink has been part of the crypto industry for 6 years, but its prime days are long due. The Chainlink token hit an ATH of $52.88 four years ago, but the same target is 61% away from the current level of $20.36, influencing the LINK holders’ sentiments. Although the altcoin presented multiple rallies in between, with the latest being in December 2024, a long recovery has been due ever since then. As a result, savvy investors are moving from this asset, creating a 3.3k deduction in crypto wallets holding LINK tokens. Such a drop is associated with the selling sentiments of the investors, which is concerning. However, santiment reports call it just the surface and present a contrary viewpoint on the situation. As per the Santiment X post , if the wallet count is rising, it describes the community’s comfortable behavior for the project. However, if the wallet content drops, this indicates some excess FUD. The price will reduce with the FUD, creating an opportunity to buy. Experienced investors also see this Chainlink news as an opportunity for long-term gains despite the Chainlink price crash. Chainlink Price Long-term Price Targets The LINK token is constantly riding the waves of new collaborations, whale buying, and increased adoption, eventually contributing to the bullish trajectory of this altcoin. Further analysis points to the price recovery, where an earlier Coingape report suggests that the LINK price could hit $30 with the Chainlink-Blackrock partnership rumors. Further analysts of Chainlink price prediction claim the altcoin will form higher peaks in the future. A LINK whale earlier booked $20M profits in similar perspectives. With increased adoption and collaborations, a long-term target of $43, $50, and even $100 is possible. This price target is backed by the famous crypto analyst WSB trader Rocko, who notes that Chinlink’s collaboration with Swift, Franklin Templeton, and others will favor the price rally while boosting LINK holders’ sentiments. Bottom Line Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, have witnessed increased wallet count, LINK holders are backing down with the Chainlink price crash on the weekly chart. Although the Chainlink news seems concerning to investors and indicates increased selling pressure, the santiment post maintains positivity, claiming this is the buying opportunity. Additionally, the bullish projection is still high in terms of the long-term outlook, especially with Bitcoin price recovery with global M2 money supply expansion. Due to increased adoption, analysts see the LINK price rising to $43, $50, and $100 in the long term.

Crypto experts like Anthony Scaramucci are keeping a close eye on this, as Trump could introduce his first executive order soon, possibly including Bitcoin reserves alongside pro-crypto policies. However, Bitcoin is currently facing a rough patch, trading around $92K after dipping below $100K, partly due to skepticism about Trump’s crypto promises and a hawkish FOMC meeting. When Will The Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Get Passed? Trump’s plan for Bitcoin reserves suggests that the U.S. government could hold significant amounts of Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. This could have a huge impact on the market, potentially stabilizing Bitcoin’s price by creating a government-backed reserve. However, Trump’s idea also comes with risks, particularly around the idea of government control over a decentralized currency like Bitcoin. Anthony Scaramucci’s Take Anthony Scaramucci has weighed in on the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. He sees it as a potential game-changer, but not without its complications. Scaramucci believes that having a Bitcoin reserve could be beneficial for the U.S. in terms of economic strategy and security, especially as the world shifts towards digital currencies. However, he also points out that the concept of a government holding Bitcoin might undermine the core principles of decentralization that make Bitcoin appealing in the first place. In Scaramucci’s view, the U.S. could use Bitcoin as part of a broader strategy to hedge against inflation and boost its financial system. But, he warns, this move needs careful planning to avoid over-centralizing control and potentially stifling innovation within the crypto space. Bitcoin is Here to Stay Trump’s idea of a Bitcoin reserve is gaining attention, but Scaramucci is advising caution. While Bitcoin’s price has been fluctuating, Scaramucci remains optimistic about its future. He likens Bitcoin’s current phase to the early days of the internet, suggesting that as adoption grows and technology advances, Bitcoin could see exponential growth. He even predicts Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, though there may be some drops along the way. Scaramucci also criticized those who dismiss Bitcoin without understanding its technology, arguing that it’s still in its early stages, with only 5-6% market penetration. On the legislative front, he anticipates major developments under a pro-crypto administration. He envisions a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve being introduced within Trump’s first 100 days, which could provide a strong signal of support for Bitcoin and reassure investors. Additionally, Scaramucci is hopeful about bipartisan efforts to create clear crypto regulations, which could make the market safer and more predictable for investors, while discouraging bad actors.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 09:50:20

In addition, a massive 141,000 ETH options will also expire today. 19000 BTC Options Expiry Amid Bitcoin Price Drop A total of 19,000 Bitcoin options expired this week with a notional value of $1.81 billion. The BTC options expiry has a put-call ratio of 0.65, a maximum pain point of $97,000, hinting that the bullish bias continues despite the price decline, per the data from Deribit exchange . Source: Deribit The expiration occurred against the backdrop of a sharp pullback in the broader market, driven by weakness in U.S. equities and unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin price briefly dipped below $91,000, marking its lowest level in nearly a month. This decline comes along with a sharp surge in short-term implied volatility (IV) for BTC options, thereby hinting at market panic and uncertainty. The crypto market is bracing for some macro headwinds such as Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data on Friday, US CPI data release on Jan 15, and the FOMC meeting later this month. Some Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin price recovery along with a surge in the global M2 money supply. Bitcoin Short-Term Prediction After BTC Options Expiry Along with BTC options data, Bitcoin short-term indicators flash concerns showing weakness for the world’s largest crypto asset class. A key metric, Hot Capital—representing capital revived over the past seven days—has plummeted 66.7%, dropping from its December 12 peak of $96.2 billion to $32.0 billion. Source: Glassnode Similarly, the 30-day average of Bitcoin exchange volume has now dropped to the 365-day average showing a sharp drop in capital flows since the all-time high of $108K in December. The 7-day moving average of the mean funding rate, along with rates from the top three perpetual markets, remains below the neutral threshold of 0.01%. This reflects a persistent lack of demand from aggressive buyers, even after the brief rally to $102,000. As of press time, BTC price is trading 1.28% up at $94,517 levels with a market cap of $1.87 trillion. Source: Glassnode 141,000 ETH Options Expiring Today A total of 141,000 Ethereum (ETH) options expired today, carrying a notional value of $460 million. The contracts closed with a Put/Call ratio of 0.48, signaling a bullish skew in market sentiment. The Max Pain point for the expiration was recorded at $3,450, highlighting a key price level for traders and market makers. Source: Deribit Along with Bitcoin, the Ethereum price faced strong selling pressure and is trying to establish support at $3,300. According to the recent analysis from Glassnode, Ethereum (ETH) futures open interest (OI) is following a pattern similar to Bitcoin (BTC). The mid-term trendline for ETH futures OI peaked in mid-December before experiencing a decline. However, the short-term trendline has since rebounded, indicating that traders are reopening positions after an initial reduction. Additionally, the Ethereum whale buying can provide further support to the upside. US Nonfarm Payrolls Data Release Today On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will publish the much-awaited US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data for December 2024. This jobs report will be critical in deciding the next direction of US Dollar giving some insights into future rate cuts by the Fed. Economists predict the December Nonfarm Payrolls report to reveal an addition of 160,000 jobs to the U.S. economy. Furthermore, the unemployment rate is likely to stay at 4.2%. Amid stick inflation, the Fed has already hinted that they would move slowly with interest rate cuts this year. While reviewing the December employment situation, analysts at TD Securities said: “We expect payroll growth to cool down closer to trend in December following the October-November gyrations that were triggered by one-off shocks. The UE rate likely stabilized at 4.2% despite our expectation for a meaningful rebound in the household survey’s employment series. Separately, we look for wage growth to mean-revert to 0.1% m/m following a string of hot monthly prints”. Also, the dollar index (DXY) remained above the 109 level while US 10-year Treasury yields hovered around 4.7%, reflecting the Federal Reserve’s hawkish shift.

Depressing, isn’t it? What if what you have lost is as valuable as $750 million? Highly disturbing, isn’t it? Then, it is the right word to define the current feeling of James Howells, who has lost a legal battle to recover a hard drive holding nearly 8,000 BTC, worth approximately $750 million. Reports indicate that he is not ready to completely give up his hope to recover his lost fortune. Howells’ Lost Bitcoin Fortune It was in 2013 that the incident, which led to this legal battle, occurred. That day, Howells’ then-partner was carrying out a routine office cleanup, when she stumbled upon an old hard drive. Without giving it a second thought, she threw the hard drive into a waste bin. She was clearly unaware of the intensity of the damage that simple act could create in the life of her then-partner. It would have become an easily repairable damage if the clutter discarded from the office of Howells that day had not been taken to a landfill controlled by the Newport City Council. Council’s Refusal to Howells’ Plea Citing Environmental Concerns When Howells, who was well aware of the severity of his loss, approached the council, requesting permission to access the landfill to recover his lost hard drive, he was welcomed by a leadership, which valued its commitment to protecting the environment more than its responsibility to help him recover his lost fortune. Importantly, the council’s stance on environmental protection was so strong that it even denied Howells’ offer to donate a share of the recovered Bitcoin. It was in this state that the battle between Howells and the Newport City Council reached the corridors of the judicial system. The Court’s Ruling on Howells’ Case The court accepted the claims made by the council regarding its ownership of the landfill and its environmental permit, casting a thick shadow over Howell’s dream of winning the support of the court to recover his fortune. The legal battle has come to an end lately, when Judge Keyser KC has dismissed his petition, citing that it has no realistic prospect of success at trial. Tokenising the Lost Bitcoin of Howells Howells have acknowledged the court’s decision. However, reports indicate that he is not ready to completely give up his hope of recovering his fortune. His innovative counter-strategy, which he projects as his last resort to recover his lost fortune, is to create a new cryptocurrency tied to the lost Bitcoin’s value. In conclusion, James Howells’ journey from Bitcoin mining to legal battles highlights the challenges of lost digital assets. His tokenisation plan could pioneer a new way to recover value, marking a unique turn in this ongoing saga.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 09:58:50

DOGE Price Could Soar If This Happens,https://coingape.com/markets/will-elon-musk-back-dogecoin-again-doge-price-could-soar-if-this-happens/,"Dogecoin price stabilized around $0.33 on Friday, halting a market downturn that saw a 15% decline over four days. Currently, the market struggles to rally. A resurgence in support from Elon Musk for DOGE could be imminent under certain conditions. Elon Musk Ready to Back Dogecoin price Again? What Needs to Happen In 2021, Elon Musk declared his willingness to fully back Dogecoin’s price contingent on major stakeholders scaling down their investments to combat the disproportionate concentration of wealth. The call for action aimed to foster a more equitable distribution of Dogecoin among its holders. Despite the initial buzz around Musk’s statement, recent trends show that wealth concentration is still a significant issue within the Dogecoin community. If major Dogecoin holders sell most of their coins, it will get my full support. Too much concentration is the only real issue imo. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 14, 2021 The Gini, a statistical measure of distribution used to gauge inequality, has continued to climb, indicating that wealth among Dogecoin holders is increasingly concentrated. In Dec 2021, the coefficient was recorded at 0.987 and has since edged closer to a perfect inequality score of 1, sitting at 0.995 in recent assessments. This rise suggests that despite broader market dynamics, the wealth disparity among Dogecoin investors is intensifying. Santiment Analysis of Dogecoin wallets reveals varying trading behaviors, particularly among those holding between 1k and 1m coins. Notably, accounts with tens of millions of DOGE have consistently bought more during market dips and sold during highs. This strategy underscores a persistent accumulation trend among the largest holders, challenging the decentralized Dogecoin aims to promote. Source- Santiment Will Dogecoin Price Revist ATH? In November, the meme coin experienced a notable surge, primarily driven by Elon Musk’s enhanced influence and direct involvement in the D.O.G.E. initiative. His engagement has sparked renewed optimism about Dogecoin overcoming key resistance levels. At the time of writing, the DOGE price hovered at $0.33604, marking a slight 0.9% increase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 46, indicates that Dogecoin is neither overbought nor oversold, presenting a neutral market sentiment. As the Dogecoin price prediction approaches the $0.35 mark, traders might look for signs of sustained momentum. If it breaches this level, a test of higher resistance near the $0.50 range could be imminent. If bulls mount more pressure, the DOGE price could revisit the ATH seen in the 2021 bull run, which could surge by more than 54%. Conversely, a drop below current support levels might see it retreat to lower thresholds around $0.28. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView In conclusion, Dogecoin’s stabilization and the prospect of Elon Musk’s support hinge on reduced concentration among major holders. If this shift occurs, DOGE might once again capture market enthusiasm and revisit its peak prices. The post Will Elon Musk Back Dogecoin Again?

Of those advisors who had not yet allocated crypto for clients, 19% were ‘probably’ or ‘maybe’ likely to seek more crypto exposure in 2025, more than double the 8% recorded in 2023. Almost 96% of the advisors also said they had answered crypto-related questions from their clients within the past 12 months. The latest Bitwise/VettaFi survey report confirmed that the Expense Ratio ranked highest at 58% among the most important features advisors consider when choosing Bitcoin ETF investments. The brand of the issuer (46%) and the issuer’s support (43%) proved more important than AUM (28%). Access to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, however, emerged as a challenge as only 36% of the advisors were able to purchase crypto in client accounts. The sentiment associated with challenges in ETF access was supported by 71% of the advisors who said ‘some’ or ‘all’ of their clients were making ‘side crypto investments’. Bitwise survey confirms 2024 was a turning point for crypto The findings are in. We surveyed 430 financial advisors across the nation to gauge their views on crypto. Here's what they had to say ⬇️ (Spoiler: They’re more bullish than ever) — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 9, 2025 Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO, said this year’s Bitwise/VettaFi survey would convert all who doubted that 2024 was crucial for crypto’s growth. He added that advisors were awakening to crypto’s potential and allocating ‘like never before’. Interestingly, nearly two-thirds of these advisors, who advised millions of Americans and managed trillions in assets, were still unable to purchase crypto for their clients. 2025 is probably the year that this will change as the ‘mainstream era of crypto’ continues to evolve rapidly, said Hougan. The 2024 survey, which ran from November 14th to December 20th, provided several key findings after interviews with over 400 respondents (financial advisors). Crypto emerged as a key factor in the 2024 U.S. elections, and allocations doubled year over year to a new high. Client interest also grew stronger than ever, and nearly all of the advisors with allocations were inclined to keep or add to the investments. More than double the advisors surveyed in 2023 were more likely to make an initial allocation for clients. Advisors prioritized expertise when choosing Bitcoin ETFs for their client’s investments, suggesting the importance advisors placed on industry-specific ‘subject matter expertise’. “Based on the latest data, the future is very bright as advisors and investors gain more access and education about the potential benefits (of crypto investments).” ~ Todd Rosenbluth, head of research for TMX VettaFi Advisors demonstrated their regulatory concerns, as 55% of them said clearer regulations would make them more comfortable investing in crypto in the future. Better education (42%), more real-world use cases (34%), better custodial solutions (33%), and less volatility (33%) also emerged as top factors most likely to ease the advisors’ concerns regarding crypto investments. ETF access remains a major barrier to crypto investments As per the Bitwise report, access to ETFs was a key barrier to crypto adoption in 2024. Despite the introduction of BTC and ETH ETFs last year, slightly over a third of advisors reported success in allocating to crypto in client accounts. Many clients tended to make their own crypto investments on the side, outside the advisory relationship. However, the ‘held-away’ assets represented a significant business opportunity for advisors who sought to help their clients integrate crypto into a wider ‘wealth plan’. When asked what crypto exposure they were most interested in allocating to in 2025, the advisors said crypto equity ETFs (22%) were their favorites. A diversified crypto index fund (19%) was the next most preferred exposure. However, half of the advisors (~50%) believed regulatory uncertainty was the top obstacle to crypto’s future investments. While still significant, regulatory uncertainty had notably dropped compared to previous surveys, which ranged between 60% and 65%. Volatility also emerged as a major concern, with 43% of the advisors flagging it as a huge barrier to entry. The percentage had dropped from 60% in 2022 and 53% in 2021 but remained the same as in 2023. Volatility’s persistence as a barrier was reflected in the advisors’ responses, although the bull market that started in 2023 had eased some of the advisors’ concerns.

On the regulatory front, Summer Mersinger, a crypto-friendly candidate, is poised to succeed Rostin Behnam as CFTC chair. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is adopting a more neutral policy stance due to economic uncertainties, which could impact BTC's price. There is also speculation around potential pardons by outgoing President Joe Biden for controversial crypto figures like Sam Bankman-Fried and Ross Ulbricht. New Crypto Subcommittee On Its Way The US Senate Banking Committee is reportedly preparing to establish its first-ever crypto subcommittee . This initiative aligns with the broader Republican agenda under President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to be inaugurated on Jan. 20. These developments also come at a time when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may also see a shift in leadership where a pro-crypto commissioner could replace the outgoing chair. According to reports from FOX Business and Punchbowl News, Senator Tim Scott, the new chair of the Senate Banking Committee, prioritized the creation of the crypto subcommittee. This move mirrors the model that was established by the House Financial Services Committee, which launched a similar subcommittee in 2023. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a longtime cryptocurrency advocate, has been proposed to chair the subcommittee, with a vote on her approval expected soon. If confirmed, Lummis will spearhead efforts to align the Senate’s approach to digital assets with President-elect Trump’s vision of turning the United States into a global leader in cryptocurrency. The subcommittee’s composition is likely to include Senators Bernie Moreno, Dave McCormick, Thom Tillis, and Bill Hagerty, who are all strong supporters of digital assets, according to the Stand With Crypto lobby group. However, any Democratic participation in the subcommittee is still uncertain as Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of cryptocurrency, holds a senior position on the Senate Banking Committee. This development also follows the House’s passage of the FIT21 bill in 2024. One of the main goals of the bill is to grant greater regulatory authority to the CFTC. The bill is a product of the House Financial Services crypto subcommittee, and is now awaiting Senate action. Summer Mersinger On the regulatory front, CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger emerged as a leading candidate to succeed Rostin Behnam as chair of the agency. Mersinger is a former Senate staffer with 12 years of experience, and has been favored over ex-CFTC commissioner and a16z policy head Brian Quintenz. Mersinger is also known for her crypto-supportive stance, and is not comfortable with the CFTC’s reliance on enforcement cases to set policy. For now, the new Congress seems poised to make major progress on cryptocurrency legislation and regulation. Fed Officials Lean Toward Neutral Stance Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials are signaling a shift toward a more neutral policy stance as they await clarity on economic policies under President-elect Donald Trump. On Jan. 9, Fed Governor Michelle W. Bowman stated that the Federal Reserve is approaching a neutral position after a year of strong economic performance and persistent inflation above its 2% target. Kansas City Federal Reserve President Jeff Schmid stated that the economy currently requires neither restrictive nor supportive measures, and suggested that a neutral policy stance is appropriate. Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker pointed out some of the uncertainty surrounding economic conditions and called for a temporary pause in policy adjustments to assess ongoing developments. Bowman warned that aggressive rate reductions could stoke demand and reignite inflationary pressures. Market analysts mostly anticipated this more cautious approach, with a 95.2% probability that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting on Jan. 29. However, Ryan Lee , chief analyst at Bitget Research, pointed to strong US economic data as a factor behind Bitcoin’s dip to $92,500 on Jan. 8. He attributed the market correction to signals of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve’s December decision to cut interest rates by 0.25% was the final step in what Bowman described as a policy recalibration phase. This followed earlier cuts of 0.50% in September and 0.25% in November. While the crypto market anticipated the December adjustment, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s indication that only two more rate cuts are expected in 2025 raised concerns among investors. Additionally, the committee’s decision to revise its 2025 inflation outlook from 2.1% to 2.5% also increased uncertainty. Speculation Grows Over Biden Pardons for Crypto Figures With only a few days remaining in his term, US President Joe Biden still has the power to issue pardons and commute federal sentences. This caused speculation about whether he might extend clemency to controversial figures in the cryptocurrency space, like former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. According to the crypto betting platform Polymarket, the odds of Biden pardoning Bankman-Fried stand at 4%, while Ulbricht’s chances are pegged at 2%. More than $5 million in bets were placed on Bankman-Fried and $1.2 million on Ulbricht. Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market platform that allows users to trade on the outcomes of real-world events, including politics, finance, sports, and global affairs. The platform is powered by blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and reliability in its operations. Users buy and sell shares in potential outcomes, with prices reflecting the collective probabilities of events occurring. In this case, traders think SBF has a 4% chance of being pardoned by Biden. Overall, Polymarket combines market-driven forecasting with crowd-sourced insights, which creates a very dynamic ecosystem for predictive analytics. By leveraging the wisdom of the crowd, it provides a very unique way to speculate on global developments like politics. Odds of Biden pardons (Source: Polymarket ) Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted on seven felony counts for his role in fraud at FTX. He filed an appeal but is still a very controversial figure across political lines. Meanwhile, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015 for operating the darknet marketplace Silk Road. He gained a lot of support in the cryptocurrency community advocating for his release. Biden already commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic and controversially pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, on felony firearm charges. However, he has not shared any formal plans to pardon or commute the sentences of Bankman-Fried or Ulbricht before leaving office on Jan. 20. President-elect Donald Trump made commuting Ulbricht’s sentence a campaign promise to the crypto community, but has not yet acted on the matter just yet. While Trump’s first term included high-profile pardons, including one for National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden , there is no public indication that he intends to pardon Bankman-Fried.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-10 10:12:00

The company aims to convert 90% of its funds to BTC. Lately, more and more companies around the world have chosen Bitcoin as the prime asset in the corporate treasury. Table of Contents Genius Group Bitcoin reserve Corporate Bitcoin reserves as the new trend Genius Group Bitcoin reserve While many countries are working on strategic Bitcoin reserve proposals, private and public companies purchase bitcoins to create their corporate treasuries. Over one million bitcoins are held in corporate treasuries of private and public companies. Genius Group Limited is a Singapore-based AI-powered education and acceleration company boasting over 5.4 million students around the world. One of the rare characteristics of this company is its Bitcoin-first approach, suggesting that most of the company’s funds (90%) must be held in BTC. On Dec. 30, 2024, Genius Group announced it acquired $10 million worth of Bitcoin. Thus, the company raised its Bitcoin holdings by 50%. The total amount of cryptocurrency acquired by Genius Group reached 319.4 BTC.

The Bitcoin-first strategy was announced on November 12, 2024. The Q4 2024 Bitcoin yield is estimated at 1,649%. According to Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton, the company will explore various options to maximize shareholder value. Genius Group switched to a Bitcoin Treasury Key Performance Indicator as the company management believes that the Bitcoin Standard will be beneficial both for the company and its shareholders. The Bitcoin Treasury KPI indicates if the company’s market cap is above or below the value of its Bitcoin reserves. The Genius Group provided crypto.news a commentary in which they explained the company’s dedication to Bitcoin: “We believe a new type of future-focused, AI-driven, blockchain-based public listed companies can bridge the divide for investors between the current, centralized and regulated world of NYSE, NASDAQ and other stock markets with the future promise of decentralized, exponential economies. Genius Group’s unique position of already educating for the future gives us an opportunity to bring a layer of added value through education, where we prepare the next generation for a world in which how they earn and learn are dramatically different. The Genius management team believes that with the rise of AGI and the ongoing need for sound money, that Bitcoin was a clear choice for a treasury asset to preserve and grow long-term shareholder value. Being a Singapore-incorporated company, with 0% capital gains tax, gives us an additional advantage in our Bitcoin-first strategy.” Addressing the question of how does Genius Group time the market to acquire Bitcoin, the company responded: “As fundamental believers in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, we don’t try to time the market, but rather buy and hold with the intention of never selling.” Corporate Bitcoin reserves as the new trend Acquisition of hundreds of bitcoins attracted much attention to Genius Group Ltd., although the company is far from being a pioneering company to do so. As the crypto market started to grow in November 2024 and the pro-crypto narratives intensified in all kinds of media, many public and private companies began to switch to Bitcoin Standard. They create corporate Bitcoin reserves and start to estimate its value in bitcoins on par with more traditional assets like the American dollar. One of the latest examples is the Thumzup media. Reportedly , it strives to hold 90% of its liquid assets in Bitcoin and spent $1 million on bitcoins on January 9, 2025. As of Jan. 6, 2024, Coingecko names 32 public companies holding bitcoins. Bitcoin Treasuries tool provides over 70 public companies that hold bitcoins. Tesla was among the first companies whose decision to set a Bitcoin reserve sparked the market, boosting the BTC price in 2021. Since then, other companies have become more prominent in making headlines associated with huge Bitcoin acquisitions. MicroStrategy is without doubt the top company associated with consistent growth of corporate BTC holdings and sheer amounts of purchased bitcoins. At nearly 450,000 BTC, it holds over 2.1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Marathon Digital Holdings occupies the second position with over 26k BTC. Other leaders include Galaxy Digital Holdings, Tesla Inc., Riot Platforms Inc., and many others. According to Bitcoin Treasuries , over 20 public companies hold over 1,000 BTC each. The same source indicates eight private companies with 1,000+ Bitcoin units in corporate treasuries. The leading company is Block.one with 164k BTC. Tether Holdings Limited follows with 83k BTC. The trend is only visible because it contrasts with the mainstream corporate approach to cryptocurrencies–most companies still prefer to stay away from Bitcoin or approach it with caution. For instance, Microsoft shareholders were deciding whether the company should add Bitcoin to its balance sheets. The majority of shareholders voted against the proposal. The reason for the decline of the Bitcoin proposal was that the company is already doing pretty well and investing in a volatile asset, although a lucrative one, may only make the investment potential of Microsoft less predictable for shareholders. Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy referred to Microsoft’s refusal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet as “destruction of capital.” MICHAEL SAYLOR: 💻 Microsoft's #Bitcoin decision cost them $1 TRILLION. The biggest miss in tech history? 🤯 pic.twitter.com/5zMCTlB08I — Swan (@Swan) December 29, 2024 There are many ways to explain why companies may need these bitcoins. First off, Bitcoin reserves serve as a hedge against inflation. If BlackRock advises allocating up to 2% of funds in Bitcoin, why not follow this advice? In terms of publicity, Bitcoin reserves can amplify the company’s progressive image and attract more attention in the crypto community. Finally, in the bull market, acquiring BTC may be seen as an effort to quickly boost the company’s budget without having to produce, promote, or improve anything. However, feasibility of investing much of the company’s assets in Bitcoin can be questioned as some experts warn about soon market trend reversal.

The app quietly appeared on Apple’s App Store on Thursday, offering users a new way to access Grok without needing to go through X, Elon’s social media platform. It’s free for now, labeled as a beta product, and currently only available to users in the United States. Until now, Grok was tied to X, where it launched last month for free. Premium subscribers on the platform enjoyed higher usage limits, but this new app is Elon’s move to break Grok away from X’s ecosystem. The App Store description invites users to “get access to xAI’s latest model, Grok 2, for free.” That’s it—no subscriptions, no paid tiers. Elon’s Grok promises something different: less political correctness and direct access to real-time information via X. That’s Elon’s answer to what he’s called “woke” AI models from competitors. Elon’s rocky relationship with OpenAI Elon’s journey to xAI wasn’t smooth. Back in 2015, Elon co-founded OpenAI as a nonprofit to create AI “for the benefit of humanity.” But things went south. Internal disagreements over funding, control, and structure pushed Elon to resign in 2018. That didn’t mean he stopped paying attention. Elon wasn’t happy with OpenAI’s decision to move to a capped-profit model in 2019. He criticized the move, calling it a betrayal of the company’s original mission. In emails from 2015, Elon told OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that nonprofits with paid executives might have “misaligned incentives.” His solution? A traditional corporation with a parallel nonprofit. In texts with OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, Elon suggested the nonprofit model made sense initially but wasn’t sustainable long-term. By 2017, Elon had proposed turning OpenAI into a for-profit entity. Those plans fell apart, with disagreements over who would control the company and who would be CEO. Elon walked away, but not quietly. By 2023, Elon was openly criticizing OpenAI, claiming it had strayed too far from its original goals. Enter xAI. xAI’s rise and Grok’s evolution Elon officially launched xAI in July 2023, to directly rival OpenAI and other tech heavyweights like Google and Meta. He wasted no time. Within four months, xAI launched Grok, its first chatbot. Updates have been coming ever since, with Grok 2 now powering the app. xAI is reportedly raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, partly to secure 100,000 Nvidia chips for AI development. Those chips aren’t cheap, but they’re essential for the kind of large-scale AI research Elon envisions. Late last year, the company launched a paid tool for developers, offering discounts to early adopters. Elon’s strategy also includes a massive data center in Memphis, Tennessee. It’s all part of his plan to turn xAI into a major player in a market that analysts predict could hit $1 trillion in annual revenue within the next decade. Grok’s competition and legal drama The generative AI space is crowded, with players like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all vying for dominance. OpenAI’s ChatGPT remains the biggest name, thanks to its viral success after launching in late 2022. OpenAI’s valuation now stands at a staggering $157 billion, with Microsoft investing billions. When Elon sued OpenAI, he alleged breaches of contract and fiduciary duty, claiming OpenAI had strayed from its mission of developing AI “for the benefit of humanity.” The legal battle escalated in November when his attorneys filed for a preliminary injunction to block OpenAI’s conversion into a fully for-profit corporation. They argued that OpenAI had used confidential information obtained through Microsoft board interlocks. OpenAI fired back, accusing Elon of hypocrisy. Grok’s standalone app is Elon’s latest play in a high-stakes game. By offering the app for free, Elon is likely hoping to attract a large user base quickly. The beta label suggests more updates are coming, but for now, Grok’s main selling points are its lack of political correctness and its integration with real-time data from X.

At this point, PeckShield said that cryptocurrency attacks increased by 15% in 2024, with Ethereum in particular continuing to be the biggest target of hackers. Blockchain security firm PeckShield stated in a post on its X account that more than $3 billion was lost due to crypto-related attacks and scams in 2024. This figure corresponds to a 15% increase compared to 2023. He also stated that there was a 30% increase in hacking attacks compared to the previous year, with more than 300 attacks taking place. Stating that DeFi platforms are the primary targets of hackers, PeckShield stated that weak security practices are fundamental security vulnerabilities. PeckShield added that Ethereum (ETH) was the most attacked in the hacking incidents, with ETH accounting for 34.8% of the incidents and 47.3% of the total losses. “Crypto hacking incidents exceeded 300 incidents in 2024, with losses exceeding $2.15 billion.

Remittance is the backbone of the Philippine economy. The stablecoin launch, scheduled to take place between May and July, is expected to simplify the cross-border payment framework. How will this influence the lives of Overseas Filipino Workers? Let’s dive deep! What Makes PHPX Revolutionary for Overseas Filipinos? As per a World Bank report , OFWs send nearly $40 billion a year to their home country. It makes up a major portion of the Philippine’s economy. However, if a Filipino expatriate wants to make a direct payment in his home country while staying abroad (for example, if he wants to pay the tuition fees of his child in real time), the options are not only limited but also highly expensive. Once the PHPX stablecoin is launched, an expatriate can make direct payments to his home country for essentials in real time from any country, even from the United States. Key Players Driving the PHPX Initiative The ambitious concept of PHPX has been materialised with the support of several prominent Philippines banks including UnionBank, Rizal Commercial Banking, Cantilan Bank, and the Rural Bank of Guinobatan. Reports reveal that the stablecoin will be governed jointly by the banks which support the project. How PHPX Ensures Seamless Cross-Border Transactions? As per reports, PHPX will operate on the highly secure and permissioned network of Hedera. This ensures compliance with the Basel Committee’s low-risk crypto-asset requirements. A multicurrency stablecoin exchange will enable swaps between PHPX and other currencies like USD, SGD and JPY, supported by liquidity providers, reports say. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : UK Treasury Excludes Crypto Staking is Not a Collective Investment Scheme , Broader Financial Inclusion in the Philippines Beyond Remittances Improving the foreign remittance environment in the Philippines is not the sole target of PHPX. It has plans to expand beyond the scope of remittance. Reports suggest that the stablecoin may expand into domestic retail and point-of-sale transactions. This implies that those behind the stablecoin are keen to make financial services accessible, affordable and efficient for Filipinos both locally and abroad. In conclusion, PHPX stablecoin is more than just a digital currency – it is a tool of empowerment for overseas Filipinos. By enabling real-time payments and fostering financial inclusion, PHPX has the potential to transform the way Filipinos manage and access their money across borders. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 11:44:00

AscendEX , a prominent platform in the digital asset space, announced this exciting development via a tweet to its 256K followers. This marks a significant milestone for the Nollars Network layer-2 blockchain & ecosystem. It establishes a foothold in the bustling world of public crypto exchanges. This announcement comes just before the conclusion of the presale on Nollars.com, which is set to wrap up in May, hinting that additional exchange listings may be on the horizon. Google data reports AscendEX boasts a robust user base of over 1 million customers, creating a solid foundation for potential trading activity surrounding the NOLA token. What is the Nollars Network project? The Nollars Network isn’t just a token; it aims to create a comprehensive crypto ecosystem encompassing the development of its IES layer-2 blockchain and a related dAPP called Noladex. The latter will function as a decentralized crypto exchange and the Layer-2 will accelerate transactions of various digital currencies. This integration of services may enhance the utility and value of the NOLA token within the wider crypto landscape. With the confirmation of its initial exchange listing and subsequent assignment to a liquidity pool, this news positions $NOLA as a promising and secure investment choice for potential buyers. Recent trends in the presale indicate a robust interest from the crypto community, with an impressive average of over 6,000 tokens being sold daily, as evidenced by analyses of ICO transactions. Additionally, the project has attracted the attention of significant investors, with two notable crypto whales purchasing substantial stakes, the latest of whom joined in during the first week of 2025. Positive Outlook on the Tokenomics Should the audience of AscendEX engage heavily with the NOLA token, it could ignite a surge in buying pressure, potentially driving the price upward. With a total token supply capped at 15,000,000 NOLA tokens, and 8 million of those being allocated for the active presale, early investors have already acquired 70,000 tokens. The project provides transparent information regarding its token management for public consumption on the official website, Nollars.com . The total supply of tokens is outlined clearly, offering crucial details on how they will be allocated for stakeholders: Total Token Supply: 15,000,000 8,000,000 (53%)** allocated for presale 4,000,000** designated for NollarsDAO 1,560,000** reserved for centralized exchange (CEX) listings 1,440,000** set aside for other purposes The Nollars Network has established a capped total supply of 15,000,000 tokens, suggesting that the development team anticipates a limited demand for its layer-2 ecosystem initially and associated exchange platform. This intentional limitation on token availability helps stabilize price and presents a unique opportunity for potential investors, as even modest buying activity could lead to substantial price increases over time. Additionally, notable increases in the token’s value often create significant interest and excitement in the cryptocurrency market, drawing attention from both experienced investors and newcomers. Currently, investors have the opportunity to purchase the NOLA token at an introductory price of $0.50 during the first round of the presale. However, this price is set to escalate once 400,000 tokens are sold, marking the completion of this initial fundraising effort aimed at advancing the layer-2 blockchain and broader project objectives. Forecasts from artificial intelligence tools have been notably optimistic for the Nollars Network since its inception. Analytical tools like ChatGPT predict that if the token successfully lists on four different crypto exchanges, its value could potentially multiply over 16 times, reaching a remarkable $8.14. NollarsDAO The Nollars Network ecosystem is designed to function as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which means it will be governed and controlled collectively by its community members. This structure empowers users to have a direct say in the decision-making processes, promoting transparency and collaboration among participants. In this model, akin to established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), the original founder will voluntarily relinquish ownership and control over the network. This shift in governance allows the cryptocurrency to evolve and thrive based on the collective input and engagement of its user community. By decentralizing authority, the Nollars Network seeks to harness the ingenuity, creativity, and strength of the crypto community, ultimately cultivating a robust ecosystem that prioritizes the needs and interests of its users. The announcement from AscendEX signaling the listing of the Nollars Network (NOLA) token underscores the project’s advancing trajectory in the competitive cryptocurrency landscape, with expectations of further exchange listings to follow.",Information|Exchange News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 11:44:33

This strategic reinvestment has sparked curiosity and excitement among investors, potentially causing interest in another cryptocurrency to watch: iDEGEN , a community-driven AI token that’s rapidly gaining traction. Trader leverages the SWARMS success story SWARMS has been on a spectacular rise since its launch towards the end of 2024. Despite experiencing a scare pullback after its first listing on Binance, the coin has rebounded, gaining 26% over the past 24 hours according to CoinGecko . Despite its recent pullback, the coin has gained 2,223% since its launch. This massive price surge has attracted quite a number of investors including whales who believe the coin could be on the verge of an even greater rally. One of the whales first purchased 6.18 million tokens at an average price of $0.13 and later sold these tokens at $0.38 each, banking a profit of over $1.5 million. On January 9, the same whale decided to buy another 8 million SWARMS tokens at $0.35 each, representing a total investment of $2.8 million.

The trader’s actions illustrate a pattern of capitalizing on market movements, a skill that many in the crypto space aspire to master. However, this also underscores the speculative nature of cryptocurrency investments, where high rewards come with high risks, especially in a market known for its volatility. iDEGEN could be the next coin for investors to reap big While SWARMS continues to be a focal point for traders, another cryptocurrency, iDEGEN, is emerging as a potential next big thing. iDEGEN stands out not just as another token but as an AI-powered project where the community shapes its very essence. Born on November 26th with its token presale, iDEGEN has already raised over $16 million, selling more than 1.315 billion tokens. iDEGEN’s presale utilizes an innovative dynamic auction system, where the price adjusts every five minutes based on buying activity. This system has created a buzz, with the price potentially increasing or decreasing by 5% depending on the number of purchases made. Besides the innovative presale pricing model, the other unique selling point of iDEGEN is its AI, which learns from every tweet it’s mentioned in, evolving without human interference. This AI, described as a “sentient, degenerate memelord,” is entirely molded by the community’s input, leading to unpredictable and exciting developments. The excitement around iDEGEN stems from its novelty and the sense of ownership it instills in its supporters. They’re not just investing in a token; they’re actively participating in raising an AI that could redefine crypto memes, market predictions, or even venture into uncharted territories. As iDEGEN prepares for its official listing on major exchanges on January 1st, 2025, at a price 10% higher than the final auction price, the community’s anticipation is palpable. It could be the next coin for investors looking to make huge profits like the ones made by the SWARMS whale.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin’s push toward $150,000 sparks a bullish crypto market, with Solana and Lightchain AI poised for explosive growth. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s $150,000 target and its impact on the crypto market Solana positioned for exponential growth Lightchain AI: Rising star in a bullish market As Bitcoin (BTC) eyes the ambitious milestone of $150,000, the broader cryptocurrency market is poised for a transformative bull run. Historically, Bitcoin’s rallies have propelled other cryptocurrencies to new heights, and analysts predict that Solana (SOL) and Lightchain AI are set to benefit significantly. With Lightchain AI’s presale raising over $8.5 million and its token priced at $0.004875, it’s gaining traction as a promising player in this bullish scenario. Bitcoin’s $150,000 target and its impact on the crypto market Bitcoin has been a key part of the crypto market, with its price changes affecting almost every other digital coin. The expected climb to $150,000 is pushed by reasons like more big businesses using it, a small supply, and people accepting it more as a shield against rising prices. This big step is thought to add cash into the market, causing fresh excitement in altcoins. In the past, Bitcoin’s rises have come with a jump in altcoin prices, as buyers look for fast-growth chances beyond B͏TC. Experts think that this time will be no other, with Solana and Lightchain AI standing out as two of most hopeful winners. Solana positioned for exponential growth Solana’s reputation as a high-performance blockchain makes it a top contender for capitalizing on Bitcoin’s bull run. Known for its fast transaction speeds and low fees, Solana has become a hub for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi projects. Its ecosystem continues to expand, attracting developers and enterprises alike. If Bitcoin reaches $150,000, analysts predict that Solana could see its price soar to new highs, potentially surpassing $600. This growth would be fueled by increased adoption, partnerships, and the overall expansion of its ecosystem. With its strong fundamentals and innovative approach, Solana remains a favorite among investors looking for high-growth assets. Lightchain AI: Rising star in a bullish market While Solana builds on its established foundation, Lightchain AI is emerging as a new contender poised to capture market attention. With its focus on addressing blockchain inefficiencies and fostering innovation, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to thrive during a market-wide bull run. Lightchain AI’s roadmap includes plans to establish a developer-friendly ecosystem, providing resources and incentives to foster decentralized application creation. Additionally, the project emphasizes transparency and collaboration, making it an attractive option for developers and enterprises alike. Analysts suggest that Lightchain AI’s price could climb significantly, potentially reaching the $1-$3 range, offering substantial returns for early investors.

38745145,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=640949,1736509823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38745145.jpeg,TSMC breaks record with December revenue backed by relentless AI demand,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tsmc-december-revenue-relentless-ai-demand/,"TSMC is making headlines again with its AI exploits. The world’s largest chipmaker raked in 868.5 billion New Taiwan dollars ($26.3 billion) in revenue for December 2024. That’s a 38.8% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Even more impressive was that it blew past analysts’ expectations of 850.1 billion New Taiwan dollars. The annual numbers make for hotter headlines. TSMC hit 2.9 trillion New Taiwan dollars in revenue for 2024. That’s the highest annual revenue the company has ever reported since it went public back in 1994. If anyone thought AI demand was just hype, TSMC proved otherwise. With customers like Nvidia and Apple, this is a carefully engineered domination of the semiconductor market. AI chips driving TSMC’s rise AI-focused chips, especially Nvidia’s GPUs, are in high demand. TSMC is the company behind those chips, producing the most advanced semiconductors on the planet. They’re reportedly built to power AI workloads, from massive data centers to cutting-edge consumer tech. TSMC’s chips are at the center of it all, making them indispensable for companies diving headfirst into AI innovation. Even its smartphone semiconductor market, while not as flashy as AI, continues to improve, adding a steady revenue stream for TSMC. And investors are noticing. Shares of TSMC listed in Taiwan have shot up 88% over the last 12 months. Microsoft , meanwhile, is dropping $80 billion on new data centers by June 2025. Why? To handle AI workloads, plain and simple. Foxconn , another Taiwanese giant, reported its highest-ever Q4 revenue, fueled by AI server demand. The global AI market is exploding By the end of 2024, the AI market was worth $184 billion, a massive jump from $135.9 billion in 2023. That’s nearly $50 billion in growth in just one year. And it’s not stopping there. With an annual growth rate of 36.6%, the market is set to hit $826 billion by 2030. AI startups grabbed 31% of global venture capital funding in Q3 2024. Everyone wants a piece of this pie, and it’s not hard to see why. The potential is huge. Generative AI is another hotspot. More than half of companies—51%, to be exact—are using it for things like content creation and customer service. By 2032, the generative AI market is expected to hit $1.3 trillion. The impact on jobs is just as important though. AI is projected to create 133 million new jobs globally by 2030. While some industries worry about automation replacing workers, the numbers tell us AI is more about transformation than elimination. Governments are also watching closely, with AI projected to add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. That’s a 26% boost to GDP. Companies are responding by pouring up to 20% of their tech budgets into AI initiatives. Nearly 58% of firms plan to increase their AI spending in 2025. But it’s not all smooth. Data management is a massive headache for companies adopting AI. Regulations on data storage, especially in places like the EU and the US, complicate how businesses collect and store information. Then there’s the trust issue. Gen Zs, in particular, have concerns about privacy, biases in AI algorithms, and the security risks that come with adopting these technologies. Businesses are trying to address these fears, but it’s an uphill battle.

A long-awaited ‘Uptober’ failed to materialize — only for Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections to ignite a full-on bull run in November. On November 4, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was changing hands at approximately $68,800 — after the rally, it reached a new all-time high (ATH) price of $108,135. Altcoins followed suit — with many well-established coins and tokens seeing stellar returns. However, in mid-December, BTC hit a roadblock. Prices fell to as low as $92,000, a crucial support level, and have since struggled to decidedly break past $100,000 again. At press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $94,970. Many theorized that the first Bitcoin correction would lead to altcoin season — a period where smaller cryptocurrencies outperform the leading digital asset. BTC price 1-month chart. Source: Finbold It turns out that this sluggishness isn’t relegated solely to BTC — altcoins have also seen a decrease in bullish momentum. Some of this can be attributed to plain old profit-taking — however, the Federal Reserve’s (FED) decision to have fewer rate cuts in 2025 is also a factor, as it hampered the risk/reward profile of speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies. The slump has already lasted longer than most have expected — and while more pessimistic commentators are already calling the altcoin bull run over, one noted analyst has shared a much more optimistic sentiment. Michaël van de Poppe points to macro factors in bullish altcoin thesis In stark contrast with the prevailing sentiment of bearishness, Michaël van de Poppe, a renowned cryptocurrency researcher, outlined a much more bullish case for the currently anemic altcoin market in a January 9 post on social media platform X . The #Altcoin bull market is over! That's the current thesis on the markets. Let me tell you, it's not. This correction is the shake-out before it begins. There's so much on the horizon that will reward you if you're holding those altcoins. The party is about to get… pic.twitter.com/pJIGLY7th4 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 9, 2025 At present, a strong dollar, FUD surrounding Tether ( USDT ), and high bond yields are hampering bullish momentum. While he did admit that the present state of affairs has been an ‘awful ride’ and noted that his own returns have also suffered, van de Poppe pointed out that altcoins are trading at a cycle low in comparison to Bitcoin, and highlighted several macroeconomic catalysts that could renew bullish sentiment. In particular, the analyst put a spotlight on inflation, GDP growth, and labor markets — per van de Poppe, underperformance or weakness in any of these categories could lead to quantitative easing (QE), increased liquidity, and ultimately a much more favorable environment for speculative assets. Lastly, although the President-elect’s promises don’t always come to fruition, the analyst is confident that Trump’s intent to lower interest rates (although the President cannot do so directly), will bear fruit — in yet another move that would benefit risk assets such as altcoins.

Some more crypto ETFs that may see the light in 2025 are XRP ETF and Solana ETF, considering a lot of applications have been filed by issuers in November last year. That said a new wave of ETFs is now expected to emerge as Donald Trump prepares himself for the upcoming Presidential inauguration. Next Wave for US Crypto ETFs According to a Reuters report , as many as 16 applications have been filed by issuers like VaEck, Canary Capital, and 21Shares. They are trying to get approval for exchange-traded products that would track crypto indices or tokens like XRP and SOL. This next wave of US Crypto ETFs, which is also likely to include Litecoin ETF and HBAR ETF, stems from two core factors. These are the nomination of Paul Atkins as a successor to Gary Gensler for the SEC Chair and lighter regulations. Gary Gensler has always been seen as an anti-crypto figure who was ‘forced’ to approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January last year. Lighter regulations are based on Donald Trump’s commitment to draft crypto-friendly regulations and frameworks that would support the cryptocurrency as well as the technology sphere. SOL And XRP Price Anticipation of the next wave of crypto ETFs in the US has had a mixed impact on SOL and Ripple’s XRP. SOL prices today are $191.04, which is up by 0.88% in the last 24 hours. There is also a notable surge in market cap despite a dip in the 24-hours trade volume which is down by 5.29%. Sentiments for SOL are bearish with Open Interest down by 2.15%. Price movement for XRP is more or less the same. XRP price today is $2.32 which is up by 0.76% in the last 24 hours. The market cap has gained 0.80% with a slip of 31.08% in 24-hours trading volume. Sentiments for XRP are neutral amid the anticipation for the next wave of US Crypto ETFs with Open Interest slightly up by 0.39%. Flows for Current Crypto ETFs Amid the anticipation of XRP, Litecoin, HBAR, and SOL ETF, Spot Bitcoin ETF and Spot Ether ETFs recorded heavy outflows on January 08, 2025. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an outward movement of $568.8 million with Fidelity’s FBTC leading the chart. It saw an outflow of $258.7 million followed by Ark’s ARKB which recorded an outflow of $148.3 million. Interstingly, Fidelty’s FETH led outflows for Spot Ether ETFs as well, recording an outward movement of $147.7 million. Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH followed with an outflow of $8.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively.

It’s about the power of networks, the emergence of trust in trustless systems, and the endless dance between innovation and speculation. Meme coins, in particular, represent a unique chapter in this story. They are the product of virality and cultural momentum, where humor meets finance, and where markets are shaped as much by memes as by mathematics. This week, these three meme coins are worth your attention: Doge Uprising ($DUP) , FLOKI, and BONK. Each offers a fascinating case study of how communities and narratives drive the crypto economy. Doge Uprising: The Rebellion Has Begun Doge Uprising is attempting to reimagine the path of meme coins. At its core is a story: a dystopian future, ruled by technological autocrats, where Doge Mechas rise as symbols of resistance. This narrative is designed to engage and immerse its community, and by all accounts, it is working. But $DUP’s appeal doesn’t stop at storytelling. The project includes the release of anime-style NFTs. These NFTs form a crucial part of the Doge Uprising ecosystem, offering access, rewards, and a sense of belonging for anyone lucky enough to own one. Add to this a staking feature offering 50% APY, and you have a token designed for long-term engagement, not fleeting hype. The presale, which launched earlier this week, gives investors an early entry point into a project that combines creativity with scalability. If early projections are accurate, this early low-price point won’t last long. FLOKI: Valhalla Awaits FLOKI uses Viking-themed branding to maintain its strong and loyal community. Inspired by Elon Musk’s pet Shiba Inu named Floki, this token capitalized on meme culture while developing a utility-driven ecosystem that includes FlokiFi and Valhalla, its Metaverse initiative. FLOKI’s real strength lies in its community-first approach. From grassroots marketing to partnerships with global brands, the project has consistently found ways to keep its audience engaged and its token relevant. While it lacks the narrative flair of Doge Uprising, FLOKI’s focus on building tangible use cases has made it 7th largest project in the meme coin world. BONK: Solana’s First Meme Star BONK burst onto the scene as Solana’s first major meme coin in early 2023, capturing the attention of a blockchain known more for speed and scalability than for canine cryptos. Its launch was a deliberate response to the dog-themed meme coin trend, and its trajectory has been nothing short of fascinating. Although BONK’s initial hype has cooled, its integration into the Solana ecosystem gives it staying power. With transaction fees so low they’re nearly invisible, BONK has become a popular choice for those exploring meme coins on Solana. Its recent performance shows resilience, and its 47% drop from its ATH could be spun as a buy signal for those who believe in its potential to get back to its peak. Why You Should Buy These Meme Coins As meme coins continue to evolve with the market’s sensibilities, they offer a window into the dynamics of culture and capital. FLOKI and BONK have proven the staying power of strong communities and accessible ecosystems. Doge Uprising, with its multifaceted approach, represents the next step in the evolution of meme coins, a project that’s not only ready to capture attention but also to sustain it. For those watching the market this week, Doge Uprising’s presale offers an unmissable chance to get in early. If you’re seeking the next big thing in meme coins, this may just be your moment to join the uprising.

Late Wednesday, prices tested the long-standing support zone of $90K-$93K, which has successfully halted downward movements at least six times since the second half of November. This latest bounce will be tested by Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which is anticipated to show an addition of 164,000 jobs in December, following November's gain of 227,000, per FXStreet. The unemployment rate is expected to match November's pace of 4.2%, while average hourly earnings are projected to cool slightly to 0.3% month-on-month, down from 0.4%. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could add to the existing hawkish Fed fears, further increasing inflation-adjusted bond yields. These yields have been rising due to inflation worries, complicating matters for risk assets. The inflation scare and rates volatility likely catalyzed BTC's rapid descent from $102K to $93K in the past four days. To illustrate just how bearish sentiment was early today, the funding rate in perpetual markets turned negative , representing a dominance of shorts, that too at a time when BTC is just 15% away from its record high. The prevalence of the Fed-led pessimism means any sign of weakness in the payrolls figure will likely trigger sharp market reactions, reviving the case for Fed rate cuts and shifting sentiment markedly in favor of risk assets. If the data misses estimates by a wide margin, BTC could easily make another attempt at $100K, provided the U.S. government, which holds approximately $18.50 billion worth of BTC, refrains from flooding the market with offers to sell.

Gary Gensler’s resignation in 10 days can serve as a catalyst. Analyst explains why $2.50 is important. XRP has been holding its ground despite the recent crypto market chaos. Unlike other tokens facing sharp declines, XRP has shown surprising resilience, staying steady just below $2.50. XRP’s resilience remained strong, making it a standout in the sea of market turbulence. While other cryptocurrencies are seeing big drops, XRP has been moving sideways, with a slight upward trend from its dip under $1.99. Analysts believe staying above the $1.98 mark can set up XRP for a bigger rally in the near future. SEC Leadership Shakeup Fuels XRP Optimism The biggest news for XRP holders came when SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation, effective January 20, 2025 – the same day Donald Trump is set to be inaugurated. In just a few hours after the announcement in November, XRP surged by a massive 26%, reaching $1.43 – its highest price since the 2021 crypto bull run.

In the song, 'Razzlekhan vs. The United States,"" Morgan's outlandish and proactively clad musical persona gyrates and scowls into the camera. Despite the legalese of the song's name, its lyrics don't make an overt attack on the investigation and court proceedings that landed her a federal sentence of 18 months in prison. ""This ain't no free country; it running on money; capitalists chummy; old white men hella grumpy,"" raps Morgan, bound in red ropes. The aggressive image strikes a sharp contrast with the conservatively dressed defendant that wept in a Washington courtroom as she apologized for her role in concealing and cashing out parts of the stolen fortune of almost 120,000 bitcoin. Her husband, Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein, was sentenced to five years for orchestrating the hack and theft. And the couple's crypto crimes are the subject of a recent Netflix documentary , ""Biggest Heist Ever."" Morgan's Razzlekhan performances are meant as a tongue-in-cheek commentary, she contends, and in the latest ""misfits anthem"" released on Friday, ""the lines of sex appeal and cringe memes are blurred."" ""It symbolizes many of my thoughts and actual experiences throughout our federal case,"" she said in a statement about the work. ""Many creatives and misfits have told me that Razzlekhan content has been really inspiring to them, and it makes them feel less alone."" The federal judge who sentenced her , despite her request to be let off with the days she'd already served behind bars, said she wouldn't have to report to prison before the end of January. Her computer use will also be restricted and monitored. Read More: Bitfinex Hack Launderer Heather 'Razzlekhan' Morgan Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison Morgan lamented in court that her reputation had been ""utterly and completely"" destroyed because of the public's fixation on her rapper character as a side show of the high-profile criminal case. She told the judge at her sentencing hearing that she'd be haunted ""for the rest of my life"" but what she'd done to aid the theft of what would now be worth $11 billion. Hours later, she posted a Razzlekhan video celebrating the end of her silence. In this latest appearance less than two months later, Razzlekhan appeals not to a crypto executive, but to somebody with close ties to the digital assets world: the CEO of Tesla and social-media site X who is now a political ally of President-elect Donald Trump.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum tried to move above $3,600 this week but was quickly stopped by sellers who came in force to push the asset back to the key support at $3,200. If buyers continue to show weakness, then ETH could fall under $3,000. The price also closes the week with a 4% loss. The bullish momentum was cut short, and it remains uncertain if buyers will be able to take control of the price action in the days to come. The support appears fragile, and sellers may still be encouraged to press forward. Looking ahead, ETH may end up in a longer correction after failing to sustain its price above $4,000. If so, it is unlikely that this cryptocurrency will revisit $4,000 this month. However, a sustained recovery could come in February once this correction ends. Chart by TradingView Ripple ( XRP ) Ripple also closed the week in red with a 4% loss. While this is in line with the overall market, XRP does show more resilience by moving inside a consolidation channel between $1.6 and $3. As long as the price stays in this range, there is a good chance of a continuation higher later. Buyers also showed eagerness and came in quickly as soon as the price fell under $2. This allowed XRP to move to $2.4 this week quickly. At the time of this post, the ассет is found to be around $2.3, which is a respectable level considering the latest higher high was at $2.9. Looking ahead, XRP has a good chance to continue its bullish rally this year and challenge the all-time high at $3.3 from January 2018. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) The price action by ADA is similar to XRP and appears stuck in a range between $0.9 and $1.3. However, compared to XRP and ETH, Cardano fell by 9% this week, which shows that sellers were more aggressive and buyers were quite shy about re-entering. On a macro level, ADA reached a higher high in December 2024. This could mean that later in 2025, the asset might still have a chance to move higher since the overall trend is bullish despite the current pullback. Looking ahead, Cardano will have to break its key resistance at $1.3 and turn that level into support before it can hope to make new highs later in the year. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin shows a lot of resilience by holding steady above the key support at $690. As long as buyers manage to defend this level, the overall bias remains bullish, with the expectation of new peaks later on. The price is also at a similar level to last week. While the current all-time high is at $794, the asset will have to break above $750 before it can hope to make a new record. This appears unlikely in the days to come as the overall market is still deciding where to go next. Looking ahead, Binance Coin is one of the strongest altcoins in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization since it managed to make an all-time high in this cycle. Few altcoins have achieved that, and some, like ETH, are still due to do so. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana did not have an easy week after the price tested the $206 level as a resistance. Since then, SOL fell lower and closed the week with a 9% loss, which puts it in the same category as Cardano. It is a bit surprising to see Solana show so much weakness when other altcoins like BNB are doing much better despite the market turbulence. If buyers fail to show up, then the next key support level will be found at $164. Should the overall market stay bearish in the near term, then SOL is likely to revisit that level. Looking ahead, Solana had a difficult time in January after it failed to sustain a price above $200. If this level is not reclaimed soon, then optimism around this cryptocurrency could suffer and see it trend lower until the key support is hit.

Among the frontrunners so far are Sui (SUI), Render (RENDER), and Fantom (FTM). $SUI ticks all the boxes Source: TradingView There aren’t many major cryptocurrencies with a chart as good as for $SUI. The $SUI price just keeps going up. In the bearish phases it falls less, and in the bullish phases it outperforms the field. In the latest dip, the price came down to the 0.618 Fibonacci, and also respected the ascending trendline. $SUI parabolic uptrend Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $SUI shows the parabolic uptrend in all its glory. The potential hold above the 2.618 has to be seen in conjunction with the current fantastic-looking weekly candle. A very long wick down to the ascending trendline bears testament to the huge buying interest in this top layer 1 coin. Further targets are in the chart. $RENDER holds market structure - bullish Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $RENDER is looking good. The recent hold above the major $6.68 horizontal support was extremely important. This is the bottom that is being built on very strong market structure below. If this were to fail, a return to $4.44 could have been on the cards. As it is, an ascending trendline has also held, and the price has the chance to go higher now. Targets as per the Fibonacci levels are in the chart. $FTM bulls still have a lot to do Source: TradingView $FTM has experienced the biggest gains on Friday so far, up more than 12% on the day. That said, unlike the previous two cryptocurrencies mentioned, the bulls have a huge amount to do. If it continues, the recent bounce can set a higher low, and it would then remain for the bulls to break the descending trendline and put in a local high in order to break the downtrend. Of course, in the latter stages of a bull market, this is entirely possible. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is looking helpful, given that the indicator lines are bottoming.

Among the frontrunners so far are Sui (SUI), Render (RENDER), and Fantom (FTM). $SUI ticks all the boxes Source: TradingView There aren’t many major cryptocurrencies with a chart as good as for $SUI. The $SUI price just keeps going up. In the bearish phases it falls less, and in the bullish phases it outperforms the field. In the latest dip, the price came down to the 0.618 Fibonacci, and also respected the ascending trendline. $SUI parabolic uptrend Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $SUI shows the parabolic uptrend in all its glory. The potential hold above the 2.618 has to be seen in conjunction with the current fantastic-looking weekly candle. A very long wick down to the ascending trendline bears testament to the huge buying interest in this top layer 1 coin. Further targets are in the chart. $RENDER holds market structure - bullish Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $RENDER is looking good. The recent hold above the major $6.68 horizontal support was extremely important. This is the bottom that is being built on very strong market structure below. If this were to fail, a return to $4.44 could have been on the cards. As it is, an ascending trendline has also held, and the price has the chance to go higher now. Targets as per the Fibonacci levels are in the chart. $FTM bulls still have a lot to do Source: TradingView $FTM has experienced the biggest gains on Friday so far, up more than 12% on the day. That said, unlike the previous two cryptocurrencies mentioned, the bulls have a huge amount to do. If it continues, the recent bounce can set a higher low, and it would then remain for the bulls to break the descending trendline and put in a local high in order to break the downtrend. Of course, in the latter stages of a bull market, this is entirely possible. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is looking helpful, given that the indicator lines are bottoming. Once a bottom is achieved, and the blue line crosses back over the red, and both lines get above the 20.00 level, the resulting price momentum could help push $FTM to that important local higher high.

Market indicators, including funding rates and open interest, suggest sustained bearish pressure as traders brace for potential further losses. Per TradingView data, over the past week, XRP has seen a price decrease of 4.89%, with its monthly performance reflecting a 3.75% loss. Recent analysis also showcases concerns for the market, as CoinGlass updates reveal that XRP’s funding rate flipped negative in the past 24 hours, reaching -0.03%. Funding rates typically represent periodic payments between futures traders to keep derivative contract prices aligned with the spot market. Negative funding rates indicate rising bearish sentiment, where short traders “pay a fee” to long traders. XRP open interest and whale activity signal bearish momentum XRP’s open interest has remained elevated since a spike earlier in the week, further highlighting traders’ cautious approach. The combination of declining funding rates and high open interest suggests that bearish momentum continues to dominate despite occasional rebounds during bullish market conditions. Significant whale activity between January 7 and 8 saw approximately 60 million XRP, valued at $139 million, offloaded. This large-scale sell-off contributed to XRP’s dip from $2.4 to $2.2, adding further downward pressure. Ripple saw a significant surge in value of over 200% following the election victory of Donald Trump as US President in November. The cryptocurrency received an additional boost with the confirmation of Gary Gensler’s resignation as the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP’s price peaked in mid-December, reaching over $2.50 per token, up from $0.54 just two months earlier, marking a 363% increase. Despite this impressive rise, the token’s value remains well below its all-time high of January 2018. Since its rejection at the $3 resistance level, XRP has traded within a wedge pattern, confined to a $2-$3 price range. This limited volatility reflects a state of market equilibrium, where neither buyers nor sellers have gained a decisive advantage. A breakout from this wedge is seen as critical for XRP to establish a clear directional trend. Analysts have identified key levels influencing XRP’s price movements. Resistance levels are set at $2.29, $2.33, and $2.36, while support levels are noted at $2.22, $2.20, and $2.16. Currently, XRP is trading below the middle Bollinger Band, an indicator synonymous with negative sentiments. Analyst recommends investors to ‘wait and see’ Market analysts have issued a “Sell” recommendation for XRP with a 70% confidence level, advising traders to proceed cautiously. Per a crypto analyst on X, investors should consider a stop-loss at 2-3% above the entry price and a take-profit range of 5-7% below the entry price. 🔍 #XRP Market Analysis 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: SELL | CONFIDENCE: 70%. Explanation below 👇 📊 1. The current market condition for XRP shows a price of $2.25, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of around 32, which indicates that XRP is currently oversold. However, the overall… — Cryptotradesignals.io (@cryptosignalsio) January 9, 2025 Traders are monitoring support levels for potential rebounds, and bulls are taking up defensive formations at the $2 threshold. A breach below this support could lead to further declines, possibly testing the 100-day moving average. Conversely, a push above the $3 resistance could ignite a rally toward higher levels. That said, the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently surpassed a descending resistance trend line and moved above the 50 mark, a level that could lead to a potential breakout. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish cross, signaling a strong possibility of further upward movement. If the coin’s price can sustain this momentum, it could have a good chance of reaching the $3 mark before the end of this month.

However, popular analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that the bull market is very much intact and the current phase is just the final shakeout before a mega rally ahead. Altcoins Market Rally to Continue Per Historical Trends Calling it a temporary shakeout in the altcoins market, popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe draws comparisons with the historical patterns from the past bull runs in 2017 and 2021 and the overall outperformance in that bullish cycle. Similarly, while Bitcoin has dominated market trends in 2023 and 2024, with a meteoric rise from $17,000 in late 2022 to $93,000 today, altcoins are poised for a resurgence. Michael van de Poppe explained that recent setbacks, including fears surrounding USDT Tether, rising yields, and a strong U.S. dollar, have dampened market sentiment. However, political and economic developments, such as President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to lower interest rates, signal a potential shift. Trump’s policies aim to address high debt payments and a strong dollar, mirroring his approach in 2016, which subsequently boosted markets following a massive expansion of global M2 money supply . Key Factors to Watch Ahead In his message on the X platform, Michael van de Poppe shares some of the key macro indicators and other factors to watch ahead for big opportunities in the altcoins market. Below are the three key factors to watch for: Macroeconomic Shifts: Inflation, slowing GDP, and weakening labor markets are signs of economic softness. If these trends result in lower yields and quantitative easing (QE), cryptocurrencies stand to benefit. Political Influence: Trump’s potential economic policies, including reduced interest rates and a weaker dollar, could catalyze a bullish crypto cycle. Altcoin Valuations: Many altcoins are at cycle lows against Bitcoin, historically a signal for future market rallies. Altseason Index Drops Under Crucial Support Following the recent crypto market correction , the altseason indicator has dropped under crucial support levels indicating that the market is not in an altseason. However, with the indicator dropping below the 50 mark, it presents a promising opportunity for investors to accumulate altcoins, noted Michael van de Poppe, citing Blockchain Center data . Source: Blockchain Center He predicts that crypto will thrive under a crypto-friendly Trump administration, particularly as QE policies gain traction. As meetings between Trump and crypto leaders make headlines, investors are urged to remain patient. Current market conditions, while challenging, are not indicative of a bear market. With altcoins at low valuations and Bitcoin yet to enter a euphoria phase, the crypto market is poised at the cusp of a potentially massive 4-year cycle. Also, the announcement of a US Bitcoin reserve in Q1 could be a game-changer for the overall crypto space.

38745579,https://finbold.com/?p=227513,1736511323,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Donald Trump now holds over $11 million in crypto,https://finbold.com/donald-trump-now-holds-over-11-million-in-crypto/,"Despite once denouncing digital assets, the former and future president Donald Trump is becoming increasingly associated with cryptocurrencies . Part of the reason for this perceived connection stems from the Republican President-Elect’s substantial crypto portfolio , whose value, at press time on January 10, stands at $11.42 million. The holdings themselves are interesting as there is but a handful of well-known coins and tokens among their numbers. For example, despite the bullish rhetoric about Bitcoin ( BTC ), Trump doesn’t hold any BTC. Donald Trump’s crypto portfolio revealed Instead of the widely recognizable digital assets, the incoming President holds Ethereum (ETH), wrapped Ethereum (WETH), and his very own MAGA ( TRUMP ). What is perhaps the strangest fact of the portfolio is that a cryptocurrency called Trog (TROG) – Trump frog – accounts for a whopping 46.5% of the total value of the holdings. The quaintness of the setup is exacerbated by the fact that TROG – which represents $5.31 million of the $11.42 million portfolio – is, at press time, changing hands at $0.0000261 and has a total market capitalization of $10.9 million. The four digital assets together account for about $10.1 million of the portfolio, with the remaining dozens of coins and tokens barely crossing over $1 million in value, per the data retrieved on January 10 from Arkham. Donald Trump’s top crypto holdings on January 10. Source: Arkham Why Donald Trump owns half of all TROG Examining the changes Trump’s cryptocurrency holdings experienced over time, however, provides some insights into how the overall strangeness came about. In fact, the President-Elect appears as avid a crypto market participant as Joe Rogan , who, as Finbold reported on January 9, hardly touched his five Bitcoins in about a decade. Similarly, Trump appears to have done little trading with his digital assets with the last major change to his, for example, Ethereum balance happening in late 2023. This, however, does not mean that the value of the holdings remained level. Indeed, together with the rest of the cryptocurrency market, Trump’s portfolio has been waxing and waning from about $5 million after the election to highs near $16 million in mid-December. It also does not mean there have been no changes to the coin and token balances themselves, though these are most likely digital assets sent to the President-Elect’s wallet by third parties. In crypto, anyone can send tokens to any known wallet, whether invited or not, and small teams sending their cryptocurrency to prominent individuals to boost visibility is something of a classic stunt. Cryptocurrency traders enthusiastic about President Trump Finally, though Donald Trump appears relatively disinterested in engaging with the market, cryptocurrency investors have enthusiastically greeted his election victory. The total digital assets market capitalization skyrocketed after November 6 from relatively stable levels near $2.2 trillion to December highs near $3.7 trillion. Even once the latest volatility is factored in, the total cryptocurrency market cap is about $1 trillion above where it stood ahead of election day.

Speaking to the Altcoin Daily YouTube channel recently, Scaramucci listed seven altcoins that stand out and could be preferred for 2025. Stating that Bitcoin could possibly reach new heights by reaching $ 200,000, Scaramucci stated that the recent declines were only a temporary phase and that altcoins would soon rally and reach new heights. 1.Ethereum (ETH): Stating that Ethereum is the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, Scaramucci said, “Although ETH's popularity has declined in recent months, Ethereum's unique network utility, role in decentralized finance (DeFi), and widespread adoption make ETH stand out.” According to the famous CEO, even if Ethereum moves against the market cycle and looks weak in the short term, it will experience a big rise in the long term and continue to be a winner. 2. Left: Stating that Solana is the best choice among altcoins after Ethereum, Scaramucci said that SOL stands out among altcoins due to its speed, low transaction costs and increasing adoption. Drawing attention to Solana's potential to rival Ethereum, Scaramucci recalled Solana's dramatic drop to $8 in 2023 and said, “Even during that drop, I held Solana and then there was a big rally. This shows investors the importance of patience in crypto investment.” The famous CEO added that his long-term target for Solana is $2,500. 3.Avalanche (AVAX) and Algorand (ALGO): Stating that AVAX and ALGO are a hidden treasure among altcoins, Scaramucci said that these two altcoins have tremendous potential and are far below their value. 4.Sui (SUI) and Aptos (APT): Scaramucci also stated that he trusts Sui and Aptos, saying that SUI and APT are among the altcoins with long-term potential. 5.Polkadot (DOT): Finally, Scaramucci highlighted the potential of Polkadot, stating that it is an important altcoin in the Web3 space. The famous CEO finally said that the key to success in cryptocurrency investment is to be patient and avoid the mistake of selling too early by accepting volatility. *This is not investment advice.

While BNB has also dropped, its performance has been less severe than SOL and other top altcoins. So, will SOL bounce back and overtake BNB again to reclaim the 5th spot in terms of market cap? Solana Price Is At Risk Of A Deeper Dive Technicals suggest that the SOL price is at a significant risk of a deeper dive in the coming days. It has just dropped below the trendline that connects the lowest swings since December 20. The coin has also moved below $193.65, the highest level on July 29, and the 50-day moving average at $204.60. Moving below these crucial support levels is a sign that the coin is not finding enough buyers just yet. Solana price now must remain above the support at $175.8, its lowest level on December 20. Indeed, in a recent note, Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst on X, warned that a drop below $180 will raise the possibility of it falling to $150 and then $130, a 30% crash. Therefore, SOL price may be at a significant risk of more downside as the trend of lower highs and higher lows continue. Also, from a macro level, it faces the risk of a meme coin bubble burst as those in its ecosystem have shed billions of value in the past few days. On the positive side, a Solana price drop to $175 may be a bullish thing as it will be a sign that it has formed a double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $223. A double-bottom usually leads to a strong bullish breakout. Solana Price Chart BNB Price Cup And Handle Points To A Rebound On the positive side for BNB, the weekly chart shows that it has been forming a cup and handle pattern . The upper side of this pattern is at $695, where it is trading presently. It has already completed forming the cup section and is now in the handle part. Therefore, as this Binance coin price forecast showed, there is a likelihood that the BNB price will stage a strong rally and move to $1,180. This price target is achieved by first measuring the depth of the cup, which stands at 70%. We then measured the same distance from the upper side of the cup. BNB Price Chart Will SOL Overtake BNB Again? BNB Flipped Solana Recently Technically speaking, SOL price needs to remain above the crucial support at $175 to increase the possibility of overtaking BNB again. As things stand, the two have formed two uniquely different chart patterns, reducing the possibility that SOL will flip BNB soon. Fundamentally, however, Solana’s ecosystem is thriving, with the amount of stablecoins, DEX volume, and DeFi TVL being in a strong uptrend. Also, the possibility that the SEC will approve a SOL ETF will be a catalyst.

Rollblock is set to transform the $500b GambleFi industry with blockchain transparency, outpacing Shiba Inu, Solana, and Ripple in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock stamping out bet fixing with blockchain security Shiba Inu token burn rate keeps on rising Solana preparing for Firedancer revolution Ripple ETF could be coming in Q1 Rollblock tokens selling fast as momentum grows by the day Rollblock (RBLK) has emerged as a leading light in the ever-growing GambleFi sector, poised to shake up this $500 billion space with blockchain-backed transparency. Experts are predicting astonishing gains this year that will eclipse the returns made by Shiba Inu, Solana, and Ripple in 2025. Here’s why. Rollblock stamping out bet fixing with blockchain security Rollblock uses the power of blockchain to secure all its transactions on-chain, completely eliminating the ever-present risk of shady underhand dealings that have plagued the $500 billion gambling industry for so long. The platform features over 7,000 classic games, all powered by the latest AI technology and featuring exciting live dealer and sports betting modes. Rollblock recently posted incredibly bullish statistics for the month of December, highlighting a 600% surge in new registrations and more than $1.75 million of wagered bets in one month alone. It is likely that these numbers will double in January. Rollblock is rightfully proud of its recent license granted by the authorities at Gaming Anjouan, which further reflects Rollblock’s commitment to trust and transparency. All winnings are paid out using the native RBLK token, which is deflationary in nature thanks to a profit-sharing feature that burns 60% of purchases to reduce the supply, and allocates the remaining tokens to stakers who can earn up to 30% in passive income. As the RBLK supply craters on exchanges, the price will have no choice but to explode upwards as Rollblock continues its rapid rise. You might also like: Cryptos to buy in 2025: Ethereum, XRP, Rollblock, Solana, Pepe, and Shiba Inu Shiba Inu token burn rate keeps on rising Shiba Inu has fallen by 22% this month, leading the token price to its current level of $0.000021. This remains one of the more deflationary meme tokens in the space, and recently the burn rate increased by a whopping 4,100% as more than 21.7 million Shiba Inu tokens were destroyed in just 24 hours. Despite this bullish reduction in overhanging supply, SHIB has been struggling recently as any short-term rallies have been met with significant selling pressure. Shiba Inu recently launched the TREAT reward token, which gives users an incentive to engage in DeFi activity on the Shiba Inu chain. Solana preparing for Firedancer revolution Solana also faced a severe sell-off this month, falling by 11.9% to $190. Solana has been ramping up its on-chain testing of the anticipated Firedancer upgrade that promises to increase Solana’s transaction speed to a potential 1 million TPS. This Solana upgrade has been promised since 2022 and is likely to improve Solana’s reliability and decentralization. A successful launch could propel the price of Solana beyond $300 during Q1 of 2025. Ripple ETF could be coming in Q1 Ripple has fared much better this month and remained one of the strongest tokens in crypto. Ripple is actually up by 4% in the last 30 days as its token price has reached $2.30. This has secured Ripple a place in the fourth position in the crypto top 10 with a market cap of $132 billion. Many analysts predict that Ripple will soon see approval for its spot ETF as a change in the SEC is likely to look much more favorably on Ripple Labs and their ongoing lawsuit. Ripple has gained more than 350% since November 7th and looks to continue its bullish momentum into January. Rollblock tokens selling fast as momentum grows by the day Shiba Inu, Solana, and Ripple will all likely outperform the wider market in 2025. However, very few projects have the number of bullish catalysts on the horizon as Rollblock. With stage 9 tokens already 61% sold out at the bargain price of $0.045, time is short to secure a bag at these levels. Experts predict that a coming supply squeeze will send the RBLK price flying in the coming months as the market prices in its disruptive potential.

However, recent developments have revealed that its dominance appears to be waning due to competitors like Solana, Polkadot, and Avalanche stepping up. Conversely, however, Cardano and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) have gained traction offering a compelling alternative for investors and market participants. Ethereum's Market Dominance Under Scrutiny Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is facing increased scrutiny. While it remains a dominant force in the Dapp sector, competitors are strongly gaining ground. Rising transaction fees and network congestion on Ethereum have driven users towards alternative blockchains. Notably, users have opted for more reliable and faster projects such as Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. It is worth mentioning that Ethereum's continued success hinges on its ability to address scalability challenges, improve user experience, and maintain its position as the preferred platform for developers. Ethereum price is currently at $3,304 . Cardano’s Potential Breakout Since the onset of 2025, Cardano has been showing signs of renewed strength, setting the stage for a potential price breakout. At the time of writing, Cardano price is swapping hands with $0.9167 after a 4.04% decline. Additionally, the digital asset has recorded a drop of 4.05% and 1.95% in the past week and month respectively. Recent price action and key technical indicators suggest a bullish trend with potential for further upside. A breakout above a critical resistance level could trigger a rally, potentially propelling ADA price toward new highs. This bullish sentiment is further supported by ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem, including advancements in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract capabilities. 10X Potential: Is Yeti Ouro The Next Big Meme Coin? While Cardano presents a compelling alternative for developers and enterprises, the rise of innovative projects like YETIO is shaking up the cryptocurrency landscape in unexpected ways. Yeti Ouro, an innovative ecosystem built on the Ethereum blockchain, combines the playful spirit of meme culture with real-world utility through its integration with the upcoming Yeti Go, a thrilling Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. YETIO works best as part of the Yeti Go system. Notably, YETIO has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens which creates scarcity which would potentially drive towards significant price appreciation. Yeti Ouro's presale has been met with significant demand, surpassing $1.579 million in funding and selling over 22 million tokens in its second stage. With a token price of $0.017 and a 10% early investor bonus, the presale has attracted both crypto whales and retail investors. On the other hand, Yeti Go, an Unreal Engine-powered P2E racing game, offers a high-octane, competitive experience where players can earn real rewards, including YETIO tokens, by showcasing their skills and dominating the track. It is worth mentioning that Yeti Ouro enables token holders to earn passive income through staking, fostering long-term investment in the platform. Additionally, YETIO token’s serve as the essence of the Yeti Go ecosystem, powering in-game purchases race entry, and rewards. Players can use YETIO to acquire unique skins, and powerful in-game items, and customize their racing experience. Furthermore, YETIO boasts great tokenomics. Notably, YETIO has set aside 5% for burning further nurturing the possibility of reducing the circulating supply further increasing the possibility of a price increase.

Expectations are mixed, with investors anxiously eyeing the data to gauge the Federal Reserve’s next moves. As revealed by The Kobeissi Letter, prediction markets estimate 183,000 jobs were added to the US economy in December, with a 40% chance that the figure surpasses 200,000.

Fed policy and Treasury yields on market watch The Federal Reserve’s interest rate strategy remains a focal point as Treasury yields climbed ahead of the jobs data release. The 10-year yield rose to 4.72% this week, driven by concerns over sticky inflation. A stronger-than-expected jobs number could further pressure equities, with analysts predicting the S&P 500 could drop by up to 1% if payrolls exceed 200,000. Wall Street analysts note that higher unemployment could intensify pressure on the Federal Reserve amid resurging inflation fears. November saw 227,000 jobs added , significantly higher than October’s upwardly revised 36,000, reportedly impacted by Hurricane Milton and a Boeing strike. Despite these fluctuations, the average monthly job additions through November were approximately 180,000—slower than pandemic-era highs but aligned with pre-2020 trends. Peter Cecchini, director of research at Axonic Capital, commented on the sensitivity of markets to economic data, saying, “ Equities are pricing in near perfection, but inflation has been far stickier than the Fed admits. ” A JPMorgan Chase trading desk note, cited by Bloomberg, also signaled potential market declines of 0.5% to 1% if job growth surpasses the pre-January 10 predictions. Stock and bond markets react to data shifts Stock and bond markets experienced volatility earlier this week following the release of the JOLTS job openings survey, which indicated a stabilization in the labor market. The S&P 500 has rallied in recent months, but rising yields are adding to equity market pressures. ING analysts suggested a weaker-than-expected jobs report, below 150,000 new jobs, might halt the upward trajectory of Treasury yields. “ Payrolls are always a pivotal report, but we need to deviate materially from consensus to have an effect this time around, ” said ING’s Padhraic Garvey. Reuters reported that Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.9%, contributing to a weekly loss of 1.6%, while the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index outside Japan dropped 1.2%. Rising US bond yields and dollar strength weighed heavily on international markets. The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against major currencies, is poised for its sixth consecutive weekly gain, marking the longest winning streak since 2023. During Asian trading hours, the dollar strengthened against the yen and the British pound, with the latter hitting a 14-month low amid economic uncertainty in the UK. Cryptocurrency market pressure heats up The cryptocurrency market also felt the heat ahead of the jobs report. Bitcoin dropped below the $95,000 mark during early Friday trading, pressured by rising bond yields and expectations of strong US employment data. Major altcoins also saw declines, with Ethereum falling 5%, XRP down 4%, and Solana slipping over 10% in the last week. The global crypto market cap also settled at $3.3 trillion, witnessing little to no gain in the last two days, per Coingecko data . “ Bitcoin remains range-bound as investors remain cautious. Bulls must step in to see price action ,” noted Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex. Meanwhile, Avinash Shekhar, CEO of Pi42, characterized Bitcoin’s drop to $92,000 as “short-term noise” unlikely to affect the coin’s long-term momentum in the coming months.

These new coins (running on their own native blockchain) are called altcoins or alternative coins. One popular altcoin is Dogecoin. It can be bought, sold and traded, just like Bitcoin. It can also be mined! This article will explore how to cloud mine Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies cloud mining What is Dogecoin cloud mining? Dogecoin cloud mining is the process by which cloud mining service providers are rewarded with new Dogecoins by checking transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. It seems simple, but it is not that easy! Cloud mining service providers process the same block of transactions through many computers at the same time, but only one computer can win the reward of new coins. The one that earns new coins is when a node adds a new block of transactions to an old block. This is done using a complex mathematical equation. The node that solves the math problem first wins! It can then append the newly confirmed block of transactions to the rest of the blockchain. This is how most cryptocurrency mining happens. However, Dogecoin mining differs from other coins in a few important areas. These areas are: Algorithms: Each cryptocurrency has a set of rules for mining new coins. These rules are called mining or hashing algorithms. Block time: This is the average length of time it takes to check a new block of transactions and add it to the blockchain. Difficulty: This is a number that represents how difficult it is to mine each new block of currency. Mining difficulty can go up or down, depending on how many miners there are. The coin's protocol also adjusts the difficulty to ensure that block time remains constant. Reward: This is the amount of new currency awarded to the miner for each new block. How to do Dogecoin cloud mining Choose a cryptokeying cloud mining service provider. In rare cases, our professional team of analysts and IT teams will analyze the hash rate generated by the operation of the mining machine and replace the latest mining machine.

Many expected these products to open the floodgates for institutional capital and catapult Bitcoin prices to new heights. But now, a year later, have Bitcoin ETFs delivered on their promise? For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Have Bitcoin ETFs Lived Up to Expectations? A Strong Start Since their launch, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over 1 million BTC , equivalent to approximately $40 billion in assets under management. Even when accounting for outflows from competing products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which saw withdrawals of over 400,000 BTC, the net inflows remain significant at about 540,000 BTC. Figure 1: ETFs have accumulated over 1 million BTC. View Live Chart 🔍 To put this into perspective, the scale of inflows far exceeds what we witnessed during the launch of the first gold ETFs in 2004. Gold ETFs garnered $3.45 billion in their first year, a fraction of Bitcoin ETFs’ $37.5 billion in inflows over the same period. This highlights the intense institutional interest in Bitcoin as a financial asset. Figure 2: The first Gold ETF accrued less than 1/10th the value of the BTC ETFs in its first year. Bitcoin’s Year of Growth Following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs, initial price movements were underwhelming, with Bitcoin briefly declining by nearly 20% in a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" scenario. However, this bearish trend quickly reversed. Over the past year, Bitcoin prices have risen by approximately 120%, reaching new heights. For comparison, the first year following the launch of gold ETFs saw a modest 9% price increase for gold. Figure 3: Over 100% returns in the year following approval. Following the Gold Fractal When accounting for Bitcoin's 24/7 trading schedule, which results in roughly 5.3 times more yearly trading hours than gold, a striking similarity emerges. By overlaying Bitcoin’s first year of ETF price action with gold’s historical data (adjusted for trading hours), we can see almost the same % returns. If Bitcoin continues to follow gold’s pattern, we could see an additional 83% price increase by mid-2025, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price to around $188,000. Figure 4: BTC time-adjusted returns to GLD are incredibly similar since ETF approval. Institutional Strategy One intriguing insight from Bitcoin ETFs has been the relationship between fund inflows and price movements . A simple strategy of buying Bitcoin on days with positive ETF inflows and selling on days with outflows has consistently outperformed a traditional buy-and-hold approach. From January 2024 to today, this strategy has returned 130%, compared to ~100% for a buy-and-hold investor, an outperformance of nearly 10%. Figure 5: Following institutional inflows has outperformed buy & hold BTC. View Live Chart 🔍 For more information on this institutional inflow strategy, watch the following video: Using ETF Data to Outperform Bitcoin [Must Watch] Supply and Demand Dynamics While Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over 1 million BTC, this represents only a small fraction of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply of 19.8 million BTC. Corporations like MicroStrategy have also contributed to institutional adoption, collectively holding hundreds of thousands of BTC. Yet, the majority of Bitcoin remains in the hands of individual investors, ensuring that market dynamics are still driven by decentralized supply and demand. Figure 6: Corporations have also accumulated hundreds of thousands of BTC but are still minority holders. View Live Chart 🔍 Conclusion One year in, Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded expectations. With billions in inflows, a significant impact on price appreciation, and increasing institutional adoption, they have solidified their role as a key driver of Bitcoin’s market narrative. While some early skeptics were disappointed by the lack of immediate explosive price action, the long-term outlook remains highly bullish. The comparisons to gold ETFs provide a compelling roadmap for Bitcoin’s future. If the gold fractal holds true, we could be on the cusp of another major rally. Coupled with favorable macroeconomic conditions and growing institutional interest, Bitcoin’s future looks brighter than ever.

However, one of the officers leading the inquiry, Major Marat Tambiev, is alleged to have met a lawyer representing several members of the Infraud organization and demanded half of the BTC in exchange for not confiscating the other half and sparing the criminals from penal detention in favor of house arrest. According to reports, Tambiev received 1,032 BTC on April 7, 2022, but was subsequently arrested along with his assistant, Kristina Lyakhovenko. He was charged with accepting a bribe and sentenced to 16 years in a maximum security prison and a fine of over $5 million. For her part, Lyakhovenko was jailed for nine years after being found guilty of falsifying evidence. In 2023, police found the private keys to the disgraced officer’s Bitcoin holdings in a folder labeled “Pension” on his work computer. These funds are being transferred by the Russian Treasury, with efforts to liquidate the entire stash apparently being complicated by legal hurdles. It is alleged that Tambiev split his illicit windfall into smaller amounts and kept them in separate wallets, meaning prosecutors will have to file several requests to the court to access them all. Further, the ex-investigator is said to have passed off some of the coins to family members, with the office of the Prosecutor-General filing a case against him and one of his uncles. The initial sale resulted from the court granting the prosecutors leave to dispose of the first batch. Additionally, authorities are looking to sell other properties belonging to Tambiev, including real estate and motor vehicles. Silk Road BTC Could Hit the Market Recently, news emerged that the U.S. Justice Department had received clearance to liquidate up to 69,000 coins worth around $6.5 billion, much of which came from the defunct Silk Road online marketplace. This is despite incoming President Donald Trump urging the current administration not to sell any cryptocurrency in its holding as he and his allies look to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve . Russian lawmakers have also made a similar proposal for a national BTC stockpile, encouraged by President Vladimir Putin’s public support for the asset while at an investment forum in Moscow.

Tether is the world's largest stablecoin, with a value that is 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. The Coinbase premium for the three tokens surged in early December as BTC's move to lifetime highs above $108,000 spurred risk-taking.

With that, the company sends a strong message to the market regarding what could be its dumping strategy for 2025. On January 9, at 8:16 p.m. UTC, Ripple sent 300 million XRP from the ‘ Ripple (1) ’ account to the ‘ rP4X2h(…) ’ address. This is a selling pattern that repeats every month, as Finbold reported throughout 2024, used to Ripple’s monthly XRP dumps.

Miners now retain around 1.9M BTC, not counting expanded treasuries, with sales occurring more sparingly. Miners are no longer selling their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings at usual rates, retaining between 1.8 and 1.9M coins across the board. Outflows to exchanges are at the lowest levels since April, shifting the balance of new supply to mining companies. The shift was noticed at the end of 2024. Miner flows to exchanges have been a long-term indicator of market sentiment. Miners sold some of their reserves during the 2024 rally, but have become more intentional about retaining BTC for the long term. | Source: BGeometrics Mining firms holding on for favorable conditions Some of the BTC block producers can still sell their coins on OTC markets. Most, however, are hoping for higher market prices while retaining the coins produced at a lower cost basis. Miners can also plan their activity to avoid panic-selling or capitulation. Additionally, some large-scale corporate mining firms receive payments from third parties and do not always depend on selling their BTC for electricity or equipment. As a result, miners’ realized price when selling is above $47,000 per BTC, compared to $41,000 for all other sellers. At that price, most mining operators realize profits of over 100%, especially if they sell coins mined during previous halving periods. Average BTC mining costs are recalculated at over $89,000, rising along with the market. However, miners retain coins that have been mined at costs as low as $23,000 or even lower for older companies. Miners may also be a source of coin availability, especially in the case of diminished exchange reserves. Miners have also survived a larger number of cycles and have learned not to capitulate or sell their coins too fast. Previously, some of the funds were selling regularly to cover costs, but the past year shifted sentiment, turning miners into partial long-term whales. Over the past two years, mining firms have continued to expand their hashrate, while their reserves reached a temporary top at 2.02M coins. Since then, some of the companies have been taking profits, mostly to finance new investments. The miner reserves are lower than the reported 2.95M BTC in corporate treasuries, though some of those coins may overlap as belonging to long-term miners. Of those reserves, the top US-based mining firms hold over 73,000 BTC. As activity shifted to powerful US-based farms, up to 40% of newly mined BTC may be held in the wallets of those top mining companies. Those new BTC may be even more valuable for OTC purchases and long-term holding, as they have not been linked to illegal activities. Despite previous fears, miners are showing no signs of capitulation, instead focusing on retaining access to electricity and expanding their new mining facilities. Bitcoin hashrate remains near its historical peak, with short-term fluctuations as some of the pools come offline during less favorable mining conditions. Miners may offset selling from other investors Miners holding on to their coins could also potentially offset the selling from ETFs and other professional whales. BlackRock recently broke its holding streak, even though it still holds 557.39K BTC. The ETF issuer sold 1,320 BTC , which may still be easily absorbed by the market. However, they are sending a signal of shifting sentiments. ETFs as a whole hold 1.1M BTC, which may be sold more rapidly and without a plan. Miners, on the other hand, mostly sell based on predictable electricity costs or long-term investment plans. BlackRock’s sales happened on a day that BTC continued to feel price pressure, settling under $94,000. Soon after absorbing some selling, BTC recovered to $95,073.80, showing its ability to bounce with short-term volatility. Smaller drawdowns are no longer causing the same panic, even for newer buyers who acquired BTC at a lower cost basis. Even short-term buyers show strong support above prices of $87,000. For BTC, spot selling may not be the biggest threat, compared to the derivative market. In the short term, attacks against leveraged positions may sway the price. Options expiry periods also cause short-term volatility.

The economy added 256,000 jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday, topping forecasts for 160,000 and up from 212,000 in November (revised from an originally reported 227,000). The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December versus an expected 4.2% and November's 4.2%. Attempting to rally from sizable declines earlier this week, bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 2% in the immediate aftermath of the report to $92,800. Today's job market readings came after a number of recent economic reports triggered a broad-market pullback across asset classes as investors quickly scaled back the idea of a continued series of Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. Previously high-flying crypto markets bore the brunt of the selloff, with bitcoin tumbling from nearly $103,000 on Monday to below $92,000 at one point on Thursday. Major altcoins suffered even larger declines on a percentage basis. A check of traditional markets finds U.S. stock index futures down roughly 1% following the jobs print. The strongest reaction is in the bond market, with the 10-year Treasury yield popping nine basis points higher to 4.78%. The dollar index is also surging, up 0.6%. Gold has moved modestly lower to just below $2,700 per ounce. Traders are quickly scaling back bets on further Fed rate cuts in 2025, with the odds of a March move falling to 28% from 41% just ahead of the report, according to CME FedWatch . The odds of a May rate cut have declined to 34% from 44% prior. In other closely watched report details, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in December compared with forecasts for 0.3% and November's 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, average hourly earnings were higher by 3.9% versus expectations for 4% and November's 4% reading.",Markets|Markets|Jobs report|unemployment rate|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-10 13:39:06

Conducted between November 14 and December 20, the survey gathered insights from 430 financial advisers, with 56% expressing a stronger inclination to invest in crypto in 2025 due to the election results. The crypto industry is optimistic about Trump’s potential to establish a more favorable regulatory environment for digital assets. Strike CEO Jack Mallers speculated that Trump might even issue an executive order to designate Bitcoin as a U.S. reserve asset upon taking office. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer, Matt Hougan, noted the transformative shift among advisers, stating, “Advisers are awakening to crypto’s potential like never before and allocating like never before.” Notably, 99% of advisers already invested in crypto plan to maintain or increase their exposure this year. Market Shifts and U.S. Bitcoin Dominance Despite rising interest, the broader crypto market has experienced notable volatility . Bitcoin, for instance, dipped to $92,500 on January 8, just a day after briefly crossing the critical $100,000 threshold for the first time since mid-December. Meanwhile, U.S.-based entities are consolidating their position as dominant holders of Bitcoin reserves. Data from CryptoQuant revealed that as of January 9, U.S. entities’ Bitcoin reserves are 65% higher than those held by non-U.S. entities, reflecting growing domestic confidence in the asset. Client Demand Fuels Adviser Interest The survey also highlighted a growing trend among clients, with 71% of advisers reporting that their clients are independently investing in cryptocurrencies. Bitwise pointed out that these independently held assets present a significant opportunity for advisers to integrate crypto into broader financial plans. However, access remains a stumbling block for many. Only 35% of advisers reported being able to purchase crypto directly within client accounts, underscoring the need for improved access to crypto investment vehicles in traditional financial platforms.

Meanwhile, Agora completed its first OTC transaction with AUSD, which was a huge step into the institutional market. Ethena's USDe, which is now ranked as the third-largest stablecoin, recently gained a lot of traction in DeFi with its attractive yields and integrations into platforms like Compound Finance. The stablecoin market is currently valued at close to $203 billion, and projections suggest it could realistically reach $300 billion in 2025. Philippine Banks to Launch PHPX Stablecoin Several banks in the Philippines are collaborating to create PHPX , a peso-backed stablecoin with the goal of improving cross-border payments and financial inclusion. The PHPX stablecoin is scheduled for launch between May and July, and is being developed by Singapore-based startup Just Finance. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like a fiat currency such as the peso, or other assets like gold. This stability makes stablecoins ideal for use in everyday transactions and cross-border payments. PHPX will operate on the Hedera decentralized ledger technology (DLT) network. Some of the key participants in the project include UnionBank of the Philippines, Rizal Commercial Banking, Cantilan Bank, and Rural Bank of Guinobatan. All will play a role in the token's governance. PHPX is designed to transform cross-border remittances , which is an essential economic component in the Philippines as $40 billion was sent by overseas workers in 2024 alone. UnionBank’s fintech arm, UBX, previously operated PHX, a quasi-stablecoin for closed-loop payments. UBX CEO John Januszczak believes it is important to create a publicly exchangeable token to support broader use cases beyond just domestic transactions. The PHPX stablecoin will hopefully streamline cross-border transfers by enabling real-time payments and offering solutions like paying tuition fees directly from abroad. (Source: World Bank ) The initiative also includes plans for a multicurrency stablecoin exchange that will facilitate swaps between PHPX and stablecoins in US dollars, Singapore dollars, and Japanese yen. Liquidity providers and other qualified investors may be incorporated to meet market demand, potentially expanding PHPX’s use to domestic retail and point-of-sale transactions. Hedera’s permissioned network ensures that the stablecoin is compliant with Basel Committee crypto-asset requirements, while interactions will align with EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation standards or similar frameworks. Agora’s AUSD Completes First OTC Trade Stablecoin developments are also happening in other parts of the world. Asset manager Galaxy and stablecoin issuer Agora recently announced the completion of the first over-the-counter transaction involving AUSD , Agora’s stablecoin, which was its first transition from a proof-of-concept to real-world application. Agora’s CEO, Nick van Eck, believes this milestone is a step toward establishing AUSD in the competitive stablecoin market, which is currently dominated by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) and Tether’s USDT. Other newer entrants like Ethena’s USDe have also turned some heads recently. The stablecoin market experienced a lot of growth, especially after President-elect Donald Trump openly committed to making the United States a global leader in crypto. The market caps of the top three stablecoins —USDT, USDC, and Dai—grew by more than $25 billion in 2024, driven by increased demand during the fourth quarter. Stablecoins play a pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi) by serving as critical on-ramps to the ecosystem. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin gained traction in the DeFi space after reaching a market cap of $6 billion in December, which allowed it to surpass Dai. Analysts attribute its success to attractive staking yields, which averaged 17.5% annually in 2024, and its integration into DeFi protocols. AUSD features (Source: Agora ) Agora positions AUSD as a builder-focused stablecoin that is aimed at traders and developers, leveraging gas-optimized smart contracts and offering full collateral backing. With reserves held by a leading asset manager and regular audits, Agora is targeting the institutional stablecoin market. Overall, Agora plans to establish AUSD as a cornerstone in the industry. Compound Adds USDe and mETH to Lending Platform Compound Finance recently integrated Ethena’s USDe and Mantle’s liquid staking token (LST) mETH as lending collateral on its decentralized lending and borrowing platform. The decision was finalized through a token holder vote on Jan. 8, and certainly proves the growing adoption of yield-bearing stablecoins and Ethereum-based LSTs in DeFi. With $2.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), Compound is one of the Ethereum network’s leading DeFi protocols. Compound TVL (SourceL DeFiLlama ) The integration also reflects broader trends in DeFi, where TVL surged to over $118 billion as of Jan. 10. This is a 150+% year-to-date increase. The growth is fueled in part by the popularity of LSTs and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) like Mantle’s mETH and cmETH. Restaking involves leveraging already-staked tokens to secure additional protocols, and has enhanced yield opportunities. Mantle’s mETH currently generates an annual yield of about 2.86%, while its cmETH token amplifies returns with restaking rewards. The adoption of Ethena’s USDe stablecoin reinforced DeFi’s expansion. Since its February 2024 launch, USDe has become the third-largest stablecoin by market cap. It has also attracted a lot of interest from users seeking double-digit yields, with its staked version, sUSDe, currently yielding 11.25% annual returns. Circle Donates 1 Million USDC to Trump Inauguration Circle, the issuer of USDC, donated 1 million USDC to President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration Committee. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described the acceptance of the donation as a reflection of the asset class's growing maturity. USDC holds a market cap of close to $45 billion, and is part of a broader stablecoin market that is worth almost $203 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz . Trump’s inauguration is slated for Jan. 20, and it caused a lot of optimism in the crypto industry due to expectations for pro-crypto legislation and regulatory reform under his administration. Stablecoin stats (Source: RWA.xyz ) In recent years, stablecoins attracted the attention of US lawmakers for their potential to support the economy. In April of 2024, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis introduced the Lummis-Gillibrand Payment Stablecoin Act , which places a lot of emphasis on the need for a regulatory framework to preserve the US dollar’s global dominance. Former House Speaker Paul Ryan also advocated for stablecoins in a June op-ed, and he specifically mentioned their ability to address the national debt crisis by driving demand for US government debt through overcollateralized issuers holding $120 billion in short-term securities. Later in October, Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act , which proposed state-level regulation for issuers with less than $10 billion in market cap. Looking ahead, industry leaders and venture capitalists see great growth potential in the stablecoin market. Guy Young , the founder of Ethena, predicts the sector will reach a $300 billion market capitalization by 2025. This growth will likely be driven by established players like Tether and Circle. Deng Chao, CEO of HashKey Capital, believes stablecoins are a primary focus for venture capital in emerging markets because of their proven utility in providing financial services to unbanked populations globally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-10 13:43:58

Expectations,https://coingape.com/dogecoin-whales-dump-219m-coins-as-elon-musk-backtracks-from-doge-expectations/,"The Dogecoin whales have made headlines with a massive selloff recently, which has sparked market concerns. Notably, two whales have collectively sold over 219 million DOGE to a leading crypto exchange, with experts keeping close track of the development’s impact on price. Besides, the dump also comes a day after Elon Musk backtracked from his expectations of cutting US Federal spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Dogecoin Whales Dump 219 million DOGE The recent dump by the Dogecoin whales has caught the eyes of investors, with many speculating the move to significantly impact the DOGE price ahead. According to Whale Alert data, the large investors have dumped 219 million DOGE, worth around $74 million. This has fueled discussions in the broader meme coin community. Detailed Look Into The Whales Move According to Whale Alert, an investor, identified by the wallet address “D7fXy…4QLW3” has moved 106.43 million DOGE, valued at around $35.88 million, to the Coinbase exchange. Following that, another trader conducted a similar move. In a separate transaction, the whale with wallet address “D8hi4..RsF1j” moved 112.62 million coins, worth around $37.99 million to the same leading crypto exchange . Notably, these selloffs came as the Dogecoin price recorded a slight recovery today after volatile trading this week. Notably, most of the top meme coins, alongside other assets, have recorded massive volatility this week. However, these recent dump indicates a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors towards these assets. Simultaneously, it also comes as Elon Musk has lowered his expectations with the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Elon Musk Lowers D.O.G.E. Expectations Elon Musk has downgraded his initial estimate of cutting $2 trillion from the federal budget as co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In a recent interview with Mark Penn , Musk stated that the $2 trillion figure was a “best-case outcome” and that he now thinks cutting half that amount is a more realistic goal. In other words, Musk’s revised estimate is a significant departure from his earlier claim of slashing “at least $2 trillion” in government spending during a Trump rally in October. This reversal has sparked concerns in the crypto community, particularly among Dogecoin investors, given Musk’s previous support for the meme coin. Besides, the department’s acronym also resembles the Dogecoin ticker, which has further added to the discussions recently. So, it appears that these statements of Musk could have impacted the market sentiment and acted as a catalyst for the recent dump. However, there are several other factors that may have caused the recent Dogecoin whale dumps. How’s Dogecoin Price Performing? DOGE price today surged over 2% and exchanged hands at $0.334, while its trading volume fell 11% to $3.46 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $0.3385 and $0.3151, respectively. However, despite the surge, CoinGlass data showed that the top dog-themed meme coin’s Futures Open Interest fell 1.5%, reflecting a bearish sentiment in the market. Meanwhile, a recent DOGE price analysis indicates that the crypto could soon target the $0.35 mark. Besides, the leading crypto asset management firm, Grayscale has recently considered DOGE, HBAR, and others, as the crypto assets under consideration for future investment products. This has further bolstered market sentiment, offsetting the recent Dogecoin whale dump concerns. The post Dogecoin Whales Dump 219M Coins As Elon Musk Backtracks From D.O.G.E.

Ai16z price rose to $1.6830, up 32% from its lowest level this week, bringing its market cap to over $1.84 billion. The token, the third-biggest Solana ( SOL ) meme coin, rose as on-chain data showed that some whales bought the recent dip. Nansen data indicates that one whale purchased tokens worth over $1.58 million on Friday, anticipating a bounce back. That trader now holds ai16z tokens valued at over $2.8 million. Two other whales bought tokens worth over $1 million, while ten more acquired coins valued at over $500,000 during the same period. This activity suggests that these traders expect the meme coin to recover once the current selling phase ends.

The second and third most profitable traders have sold nearly all of their tokens, realizing $39 million and $20 million in profits, respectively.

Solana meme coin ai16z profit leaders | Source: Nansen Is the ai16z price rebound a dead cat bounce? Ai16z chart | source: crypto.news The ongoing ai16z price rebound could be a dead cat bounce — a situation where an asset in a downtrend briefly recovers before resuming its decline. The token has retested the critical level at $1.7177 on the four-hour chart. This is an important point, as it was the neckline of the double-top pattern at $2.35. A double-top pattern is a well-known bearish indicator, while a break-and-retest formation often signals a continuation of the trend. Additionally, the ai16z price has fallen below the 50-period moving average. Therefore, unless the token breaks above the 50-period moving average at $1.7490, there is a risk of a continued downtrend. If this rebound proves to be a dead cat bounce, the next level to watch will be this week’s low of $1.2663.

Terra Luna Classic ( LUNC ) dropped to the key support level of $0.00010, its lowest point since Dec. 20 last year. It has slipped by 42% from its December high. One potential catalyst for the LUNC price is the ongoing token burns, which have accelerated over the past few months. Data from LUNC Metrics shows that the network has burned over 397 billion tokens since May 2022. In the past seven days alone, 341 million tokens have been burned, with the number continuing to grow. On January 10, the daily burn jumped to over 686 million. Binance remains the largest LUNC burner, having incinerated almost 70 billion tokens. Meanwhile, DFLUNC Protocol and LunaticsToken have burned over 2 billion and 1.9 billion LUNC, respectively. You might also like: SAFE rallies 20% on Bithumb listing These token burns have helped reduce LUNC’s circulating supply over the past two years to 6.50 trillion. In theory, token burns boost a cryptocurrency’s price by reducing supply and increasing the value of the remaining tokens. Meanwhile, more data shows that investors have increased their staked tokens over the past few days. The staking ratio has risen to 15%, or 981 billion LUNC tokens, up from last week’s low of 14.8%. A higher staking ratio is a positive sign for a cryptocurrency, as it reduces the number of tokens available for sale on the market, thereby easing selling pressure. These positive metrics may help support a recovery in LUNC’s price once the ongoing sell-off ends. LUNC price analysis LUNC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that LUNC price peaked at $0.0001790 in December before erasing some of those gains to reach the current $0.00010 level. This retreat has occurred amid ongoing weakness in the broader crypto market. Most recently, the token broke below the key support at $0.0001054, which was the neckline of a small double-top chart pattern. Additionally, LUNC has moved below both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. On a positive note, the coin has formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation indicator. The ongoing pullback is likely part of the handle formation. Therefore, it’s possible that Terra Luna Classic’s price will rebound as long as it holds above the key support level at $0.00009060. If this recovery materializes, the initial target to watch will be the double-top level at $0.000122, followed by the upper side of the cup at $0.0001310 and last December’s high of $0.000179. A return to last month’s high would represent a 73% jump from the current price.

New Crypto Players Could Spark a Wild Ride,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/eth-to-the-moon-in-2025-new-crypto-players-could-spark-a-wild-ride/,"The post ETH to the Moon in 2025? New Crypto Players Could Spark a Wild Ride appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After its impressive bull run last year, analysts are anticipating that ETH will continue to dominate the crypto space in 2025. Meanwhile, their attention is also turning to new crypto players like Lunex Network, which is shaking up the DeFi industry. Lunex Network is not only driving technological advancements but also creating incredibly lucrative opportunities for investors. With its exciting features and a highly successful presale, Lunex Network could take investors to new profit dimensions in 2025. Why Lunex Network May Just Be Your Ticket To A World Of Financial Freedom Profit-seeking investors know that the real winners in the crypto space aren’t the projects that have already peaked, like ETH, but the ones brimming with untapped potential. This is why new ICO-providing projects like Lunex Network have become hot topics due to the unlimited profit potential they offer. Since its debut in the DeFi space, Lunex Network has positioned itself as a must-have new crypto in any well-rounded portfolio. Lunex Network’s value proposition is clear : a platform designed to streamline cross-chain interactions and make transactions seamless. But Lunex Network isn’t just about speculative gains. It offers practical benefits, such as an 18% APY staking reward for holders of its native token LNEX. These holders also get to enjoy the benefits associated with Lunex Network’s special revenue-sharing model, which ensures that they’re rewarded while driving long-term value for LNEX. As a Web3 multi-chain bridge network, Lunex Network operates on a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that facilitates instant and cost-effective cross-chain transactions. It taps into deep liquidity to provide an alternative to traditional centralized exchanges. This makes it a go-to solution for DeFi traders and liquidity providers alike. Are There Green Charts In Ethereum’s Future? Ethereum (ETH) was remarkable in 2024, with a 45.54% growth between January and December. This surge was largely supported by the approval and expansion of its spot ETFs. In the same year, ETH’s transition to a proof-of-stake consensus bumped energy efficiency and reinforced ETH’s position as the leading option for smart contracts and dApps. With this system still in place, market experts are beginning to release their ETH price predictions, anticipating further growth. For instance, Coinmarketcap analysts expect ETH’s value to rise by a staggering 400% by 2025. Although ETH has been trading around the $3,400 mark for the past week, these analysts believe that it is facing strong resistance at $3,990, a level where many investors may sell. Breaking above this point could push the price to $4,090, which is another key resistance zone. According to the ETH price prediction charts, support levels to keep an eye on include $3,250 and $2,950, which are aligned with the 200-day moving average, and $2,720, where buyers are likely to step in. With these conditions, ETH’s growth trend is clearly bullish and might remain that way till the end of Q1 2025. Conclusion While ETH is projected to reach new heights in 2025, Lunex Network is firmly establishing its presence in the DeFi market with its live presale. Through the presale, interested investors can get LNEX tokens at a discounted $0.0054 each. Buy LNEX today!

In Thailand, officials seized nearly 1,000 Bitcoin mining devices allegedly involved in a multi-million dollar electricity theft. Meanwhile, blockchain security firms such as PeckShield and CertiK have revealed that over $3 billion was lost to crypto-related hacks and scams in 2024, reflecting the persistent vulnerabilities in the fast-evolving digital asset space. Over $3 Billion Stolen in Hacks and Scams, Reports Show Blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that more than $3 billion was stolen in crypto-related activities throughout 2024. This alarming figure marks a significant increase of approximately $400 million compared to 2023, highlighting the persistent threats faced by investors and institutions in the space. In a social media post on Jan. 9, PeckShield revealed detailed data from its 2024 security analysis, showing that cryptocurrency hackers and scammers collectively stole $3 billion in digital assets. This figure represents a 15% increase from the previous year, reflecting a surge in the monetary value of stolen crypto despite a noticeable decline in the overall number of incidents. “This [2024] total includes $2.15 billion stolen from crypto hacks and $834.5 million stolen from scams,” PeckShieldAlert stated. However, there was a silver lining: approximately $488.5 million worth of stolen assets were successfully recovered, thanks to coordinated efforts by security firms and law enforcement agencies. PeckShield's findings also pointed to a tapering off in the number of hacks and scams toward the end of 2024, continuing a downward trend that started in 2022. This decrease in frequency, however, did little to assuage concerns, given the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and the larger sums involved in each incident. According to another security report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, hackers targeted decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for the majority of their illicit gains in 2024. DeFi platforms, known for their transparency and accessibility, have also proven to be lucrative targets for attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts and decentralized protocols. Chainalysis estimated that $2.2 billion of the stolen funds came from such platforms, particularly during the first quarter of the year. CertiK , another leading blockchain security firm, highlighted the growing prevalence of phishing scams in 2024. These scams were identified as the ”most costly attack vector” during the year, with cybercriminals stealing over $1 billion across 296 reported phishing incidents. Phishing attacks typically involve malicious actors impersonating legitimate platforms or individuals to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, such as private keys or wallet credentials. In one notable incident, hackers breached the Virtuals Protocol Discord server and posted fake Google links, tricking unsuspecting users into compromising their wallets. As the crypto industry matures, experts warn that 2025 could see an evolution in the tactics employed by hackers and scammers. A CertiK spokesperson expressed concerns about the potential use of artificial intelligence ( AI ) in enhancing phishing techniques. AI could enable more convincing impersonation of trusted entities, making it even harder for users to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent interactions. The broader adoption of cryptocurrency by institutions and increasing regulatory clarity in key markets may also attract more sophisticated cybercriminals seeking to exploit the influx of new investors. Contextualizing the Surge in Crypto Crime While the monetary value of stolen crypto surged in 2024, the number of incidents and the total amount of assets stolen remained lower than the peaks observed in 2022. This trend aligns with a period of heightened regulatory scrutiny and market downturns, which may have discouraged opportunistic attacks but did not eliminate the threats posed by organized cybercriminal networks. Reports from Chainalysis, PeckShield, and CertiK all point to the need for stronger security measures, greater awareness among crypto users, and continued innovation in blockchain security technology. The findings from these reports have spurred calls for improved security measures across the crypto industry. Experts suggest that users should adopt robust security practices, including the use of hardware wallets, multi-signature authentication, and vigilance against phishing attempts. Platforms and developers, on the other hand, are being urged to conduct thorough audits of smart contracts and implement advanced threat detection systems. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain traction in mainstream finance, the stakes are higher than ever for ensuring the safety of digital assets. While the challenges ahead are significant, collaborative efforts between blockchain security firms, regulators, and industry participants could pave the way for a safer crypto ecosystem. Thai Authorities Seize 996 Bitcoin Mining Devices in Multi-Million Dollar Electricity Theft Case In related news, Thai authorities have seized 996 Bitcoin mining machines from a company accused of illegally siphoning off electricity to power the rigs. The operation, conducted by the Crime Suppression Division (CSD) and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), targeted JIT Co., a firm based in Phanat Nikhom, Chon Buri. The Bangkok Post and Nation Thailand reported on Jan. 9 that the alleged theft could amount to hundreds of millions of Thai Baht, translating to at least $2.88 million at current rates. Pol Maj Gen Montree Theskhan, commander of the CSD, confirmed the seizure of the mining machines during a raid on Jan. 8. The company allegedly modified electricity meters to operate mining rigs at night while using legitimate power during the day to avoid detection. Solar panels were also installed on-site but were reportedly not connected to the mining operations. The scale of the electricity theft was staggering. JIT Co.’s energy consumption to mine Bitcoin far exceeded normal household usage. For context, the Bangkok Post noted that an efficient Bitcoin mining setup costs around 620,000 Thai Baht ($17,930) to mine a single Bitcoin—825 times the average monthly power bill in Thailand. While JIT Co. was registered for digital asset trading, it is now accused of running a clandestine mining operation. Nation Thailand reported that the CSD has yet to identify the individuals or company fully responsible for the theft. Arrest warrants are expected to be issued as investigations progress. Crypto Mining in Southeast Asia: A Regional Perspective Thailand’s action against JIT Co. is the latest in a series of crackdowns on illegal cryptocurrency mining across Southeast Asia. Neighboring Malaysia, for example, reported that approximately $723 million worth of electricity was used for illegal crypto mining between 2018 and 2023. Malaysian authorities have been seizing mining equipment since 2019, with some cases leading to public destruction of confiscated machines. The surge in illegal crypto mining in the region is fueled by the rising value of Bitcoin and the potential profits from mining operations. However, the high energy demands of mining rigs and the associated costs often lead operators to resort to electricity theft to sustain their operations. The crackdown comes at a time when Thailand is seeking to position itself as a hub for digital innovation. The country recently announced plans to trial cryptocurrency payments in Phuket, a popular tourist destination, as part of a pilot program aimed at offering foreign visitors alternative payment options. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has urged the government to explore the potential of cryptocurrency further to stay competitive on the global stage. However, incidents like the JIT Co. case demonstrate the challenges Thailand faces in balancing innovation with regulation and security. The JIT Co. incident highlights the need for stricter regulatory oversight and robust enforcement mechanisms in the cryptocurrency sector. As Thailand embraces digital assets, the government must address gaps in its regulatory framework to prevent similar cases of electricity theft and ensure fair practices in the industry. Authorities are expected to tighten monitoring of energy consumption and increase cooperation with electricity providers to identify anomalies. The development of clearer guidelines for crypto mining operations, including mandatory registration and compliance audits, could help mitigate risks associated with illicit activities.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-10 14:00:00

According to recent market data, Dogecoin’s large transaction volume has skyrocketed by over 41%, while daily active addresses have increased by more than 35%. These developments, which indicate a surge in interest among large-scale token holders, could act as a catalyst to push the Dogecoin price towards the coveted $1 mark. Increase In Dogecoin Transaction Volume And Daily Addresses In the crypto market, large-scale transactions involving significant amounts of a specific cryptocurrency are often associated with entities known as ‘whales,’ who execute strategic moves that have the potential to influence market trends. Recently, IntoTheBlock revealed that Dogecoin has recorded a massive increase in its large transaction volume, skyrocketing by an impressive 41.12% to reach $23.35 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum Gets Massive $12,000 Price Tag From Research Lead Ahead Of Major Upgrade This significant increase in Dogecoin’s large transaction volume suggests heightened engagement and activity among deep-pocketed players. Moreover, the sharp surge could indicate growing interest from institutional investors or whales who see potential in the meme coin’s future trajectory. According to ITB’s data, there has also been a notable spike in Dogecoin’s daily active addresses, recording a 34.91% increase that points to broader adoption and an increase in the meme coin’s network activity. As a blockchain metric, daily active addresses measure the number of unique wallet addresses involved in transactions of a particular cryptocurrency within 24 hours. A surge in the daily active address of a cryptocurrency like Dogecoin often suggests that more users engage with the network, whether for investing, trading, or transactions. Despite this strong metric activity, Dogecoin’s price has fallen by more than 2.2% in the past 24 hours, dropping to $0.33. Nevertheless, ITB reports that Dogecoin remains “mostly bullish,” a sentiment that contrasts with ongoing market volatility and price fluctuations. Interestingly, this bullish optimism could signal that the surge in Dogecoin’s on-chain metrics, both large transaction volume and daily active addresses, could be a potential catalyst for a price rebound. Can This Propel DOGE To $1? Although Dogecoin has faced regular backlash over its speculative nature, its ability to maintain relevance and growth in the crypto market cannot be overlooked. The increase in Dogecoin’s large transaction volume and daily active addresses could be an early indicator of a broader trend shift, potentially signaling the meme coin’s next upward rally.

For Instance, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has predicted that Dogecoin could rise to the $1 benchmark very soon. However, the meme coin’s recent pullback could act as a bullish springboard, as the analyst has stated that a retracement often precedes a massive price rally.

Chen, based in Kaohsiung, had been using Facebook groups to solicit cryptocurrency trades and arrange in-person transactions where he exchanged Tether ( USDT ) for cash. Despite the new law, Chen reportedly completed hundreds of transactions in less than a month, selling 400,000 USDT and profiting NT$800,000. Police arrested him on December 24 and seized computers, mobile phones, cash counters, and safes as evidence. This marks the first case of its kind since the Virtual Asset Service Provider registration system became effective on November 30, 2024, according to local media outlet The Liberty Times.

Seja você fã de futebol, tênis, corridas de cavalos ou Fórmula 1, o universo das apostas online oferece possibilidades quase infinitas – e entre essas opções, o basquete está conquistando um lugar especial no coração dos apostadores. Com partidas eletrizantes e finais imprevisíveis, o basquete não só encanta pelas jogadas nas quadras, mas também se destaca como uma das modalidades mais emocionantes e promissoras no mercado de apostas esportivas. E não é para menos! A influência global de ligas renomadas, como a NBA, transformou o basquete em uma das opções mais procuradas para quem deseja unir emoção e estratégia nas apostas. Neste artigo, reunimos tudo o que você precisa saber sobre as apostas de basquete . Se você quer dominar as melhores práticas, entender os tipos de apostas mais populares ou explorar como aproveitar ao máximo as oportunidades desse mercado em ascensão, continue lendo. Aqui, você encontrará todas as informações necessárias para se tornar um especialista em apostas de basquete! O tamanho do mercado online de apostas basquete O mercado de apostas esportivas é um dos setores que mais crescem no entretenimento global, movimentando bilhões de dólares anualmente. Dentro desse cenário, o basquete ocupa uma posição de destaque, rivalizando com outros gigantes como o futebol e o tênis. Segundo dados do Eurohoops, as apostas em basquete têm atraído um público significativo devido à dinâmica rápida dos jogos e às possibilidades variadas de apostas, como totais de pontos, resultados de quartos e performances individuais. A NBA é, sem dúvida, a principal razão para o tamanho desse mercado. Com transmissões globais, grandes estrelas e jogos repletos de ação, a liga americana lidera o volume de apostas. Em 2023, as apostas online nos Estados Unidos atingiram US$ 80 bilhões. Desse valor, mais da metade é proveniente das apostas em jogos da NBA. No entanto, ligas europeias e torneios internacionais também têm sua parcela de contribuição. Bob Voulgaris é um exemplo de sucesso nas apostas esportivas, especialmente no basquete. Utilizando análises estatísticas avançadas, ele desenvolveu modelos que lhe permitiram identificar padrões e tendências nas partidas da NBA, proporcionando-lhe uma vantagem significativa sobre as casas de apostas. Seu método foi tão eficaz que, em determinado momento, as casas de apostas ajustaram suas odds para minimizar as perdas causadas por suas apostas bem-sucedidas. O sucesso de Voulgaris nas apostas levou-o a ser contratado pelo Dallas Mavericks, uma equipe da NBA, para aplicar seu conhecimento estatístico na análise de desempenho dos jogadores e estratégias de jogo. Apostas basquete – O que são odds? Odds (ou “cotas” em português) são as probabilidades que as casas de apostas oferecem para um evento específico ocorrer. Elas representam tanto a probabilidade de um resultado quanto o retorno financeiro que você pode receber caso sua aposta seja bem-sucedida. Existem três formatos principais de odds: Odds decimais : Exemplo: 2.50 Neste formato, as odds indicam o quanto você ganhará em cada unidade apostada. No caso de odds de 2.50, para cada R$ 1 apostado, você receberia R$ 2,50 no total (incluindo o valor da aposta inicial). Cálculo : 1 x 2.50 = R$ 2,50 (R$ 1 de lucro + R$ 1 da aposta). Odds fracionárias : Exemplo: 5/1 (lê-se “cinco para um”). Este formato indica quanto você ganhará em relação à sua aposta. Se as odds são 5/1, para cada R$ 1 apostado, você receberia R$ 5 de lucro, além de receber de volta o valor da aposta inicial. Cálculo : (5 x 1) = R$ 5 (lucro) + R$ 1 (aposta inicial) = R$ 6 no total. Odds americanas (Moneyline): Exemplo: +200 (para apostas em underdog) ou -150 (para apostas em favorito). As odds positivas (+200) indicam quanto você pode ganhar com uma aposta de R$ 100. Já as odds negativas (-150) indicam quanto você precisa apostar para ganhar R$ 100. Cálculo com odds positivas : Uma aposta de R$ 100 em +200 pagaria R$ 200 de lucro. Cálculo com odds negativas : Uma aposta de R$ 150 em -150 pagaria R$ 100 de lucro. Esses formatos são usados para calcular os ganhos potenciais das apostas, ajudando você a decidir em qual aposta vale a pena investir. Quanto menores as odds (ou seja, mais negativas), maior a probabilidade de o evento ocorrer, e vice-versa. Como funcionam as apostas basquete Apostar em basquete pode ser tão simples ou tão elaborado quanto o apostador desejar. Aqui estão alguns dos principais tipos de apostas que você pode encontrar: Moneyline : Aposte no time vencedor. Spread : Aposta baseada em um handicap atribuído pelos sites. Totais (Over/Under) : Preveja se o total de pontos será maior ou menor que um valor definido. Props : Apostas específicas, como o desempenho de um jogador. Live Betting : Aposte em tempo real durante os jogos. Dicas para começar a apostar em Basquete Aqui estão mais algumas dicas para começar a apostar em basquete: Entenda os tipos de apostas : Antes de começar, familiarize-se com os diferentes tipos de apostas em basquete, como apostas em pontos, handicap, totais (over/under) e apostas em vencedores. Isso ajudará você a escolher as melhores opções para sua estratégia. Aposte em jogos com os quais você está familiarizado : Focar nas ligas e equipes que você conhece bem pode aumentar suas chances de sucesso. Isso permitirá que você entenda melhor os padrões de jogo e as forças e fraquezas dos times. Atenção aos lesões e suspensões : Lesões podem afetar drasticamente o desempenho de um time ou jogador. Fique atento às notícias e atualizações sobre a saúde dos jogadores antes de fazer suas apostas. Acompanhe as odds : As odds podem mudar rapidamente à medida que novas informações surgem, como lesões ou mudanças nas condições de jogo. Acompanhe as odds e faça apostas quando elas oferecerem o melhor valor possível. Não siga a “multidão” : Evite apostar apenas porque todo mundo está fazendo isso. É importante tomar decisões informadas baseadas em dados e análises, e não em tendências de apostas populares. Aposte de forma disciplinada : Mantenha a calma, mesmo quando enfrentar perdas. Apostas consistentes e disciplinadas tendem a ser mais lucrativas no longo prazo.

Bitcoin struggles to maintain momentum, trading below $100,000. Market uncertainty looms as regulatory shifts are anticipated following Gensler’s departure. Investors are advised to reconsider positions in volatile assets. Below are five crypto to sell that might warrant caution before this transition. Crypto to Sell Now: Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), a major meme-based cryptocurrency, has experienced a significant price decline over the past 30 days. The downturn aligns with broader bearish trends in the crypto market. At the time of writing, the DOGE price is trading at $0.3353. Investors are advised to reassess their holdings ahead of potential market shifts. Dogecoin appears to be forming a selling climax bottom, signaling potential recovery. It continues to hold above a critical support trendline. This secondary test reinforces the structure’s stability, with a possible sign of strength expected soon. Source- X THORChain (RUNE) THORChain (RUNE), a decentralized liquidity protocol, facilitates secure cross-network cryptocurrency trades, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, without requiring users to relinquish control of their assets. Currently, the RUNE price is at $3.49, reflecting a daily decline of 7.07%. This downturn mirrors broader market trends. If the downward pressure continues, RUNE could potentially drop to $3.00 in the short term. This positions RUNE as a significant underperformer in today’s market, marking it as one of the crypto to sell now to sidestep losses before Gary Gensler’s departure. Source: TradingView Bittensor (TAO) Bittensor, an open-source blockchain protocol for decentralized machine learning, has experienced a recent price dip.

Experts highlight potential risks, listing Bittensor among five crypto to sell now to avoid losses before Gary Gensler’s departure impacts the regulatory landscape. Helium (HNT) Helium (HNT), a decentralized blockchain network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, was launched in July 2019. Its mainnet enables low-powered wireless devices to communicate and share data across a distributed network of nodes. Over the past week, HNT’s price dropped by 10%, reflecting the ongoing bearish trend in the crypto market. In the last 24 hours, the price declined further to $5.63, ranking it among the top losers in today’s market. Helium is now considered a crypto to sell before Gary Gensler’s farewell to mitigate potential losses. SPX6900 SPX6900, an innovative blockchain cryptography token, offers limitless potential for scientific applications. Currently priced at $1.19, it reflects a 2.71% daily decline.

The PBOC mentioned that the purchases would resume after properly monitoring the government bonds market supply and demand. The central bank’s decision led to the rise in Chinese bond yields significantly. The move also led to rumours that the central bank’s decision aimed to prevent the yuan from losing more ground. The Chinese government kicked off the bond purchases in September to help the yuan gain more ground and ease the country’s monetary policies. A CNBC report revealed one of the reasons behind the yuan depreciation experienced in the past year, citing the growing gap between China’s and U.S. bond yields. The report mentioned that the Chinese bond yields have dropped by about 100 basis points over the past year, dropping below 1.6%. Compared to U.S. bond yields, which have been at approximately 4.7%, the gap has steadily increased. PBOC Halts Bond Buying to Defend Yuan as Economic Gloom Worsens The People’s Bank of China will halt purchases of sovereign debt this month as the supply of the bonds has fallen short of demand, it said in a statement on Friday. The move reflects “the authorities’ discomfort… pic.twitter.com/1eUkoFnyTY — Tracy Shuchart (𝒞𝒽𝒾 ) (@chigrl) January 10, 2025 A recent TradingView report further highlighted that the yuan had hit a 16-month low at the beginning of the week, trading below 7.3 CNY per dollar. The report further cited a growing worry among investors despite the central bank’s efforts to stabilize the currency. The 16-month low was 5% lower than the yuan’s peak in September. Since the temporary pause in buying bonds, the 10-year and 30-year bond yields have increased by about 4 and 8 basis points, respectively. The CNY rose by about 0.1% before dropping to 7.3469 CNY per dollar. Analyst expects more downtrends in bond yields The Shanghai Anfang Private Fund Co. research director Huang Xuefeng speculated that the bond yields would continue on a downward trend despite the central bank’s efforts. Xuafeng explained that investors were looking for better investment options, which the country lacked. Goldman Sachs China chief economist Hui Shan shared the same sentiment, explaining that investors were more pessimistic about long-term bond growth and inflation. Shan suggested the negative sentiment could lead to further plunges in government bond yields. Pinpoint Asset Management chief economist Zhiwei Zhang also mentioned that the PBOC’s recent move to stop bond purchases indicated the government’s increased worry about bond yields falling further. Zhang speculated that the move was the PBOC’s effort to prevent bond yields from further affecting the declining yuan. The PBOC announced plans to enact ‘moderately loose’ fiscal policy changes to fuel China’s economic growth, as well as to stabilize the yuan. The mention of the ‘moderately loose’ policy change came into consideration by the PBOC for the first time in 14 years. The country has been experiencing low domestic consumption, housing crises, and lower exports. China gets ready for Trump’s inauguration A Reuters report confirmed that China’s central bank’s decisions are efforts to stabilize the economy before President Donald Trump’s re-entry into office on January 20. China is one of the countries that will be on the harsh end of Trump’s proposed tariffs. President Trump promised to increase a 10% tariff for goods from China on top of any additional tariffs in place. The U.S. president mentioned on Truth Social that the tariff increase would prevent Fentanyl imports from China into the U.S. Trump had promised during his campaign that he would hike tariffs for China’s imports to 60% or higher. The Chinese government is taking more steps in preparation for Trump’s inauguration, including more gold purchases. China accumulated over 330,000 gold troy ounces in December, with more purchases expected before January 20. The PBOC also plans to introduce more RMB bills into the Hong Kong market on January 15. A tender letter from the Hong Kong government revealed that China would release RMB60 million of 6-month bills into the market. The PBOC will settle the tender on January 17.

Table of Contents RCO Finance: A beacon of hope while Dogecoin struggles The Dogecoin price plunges as investors take profits RCOF soars in presale with 43,000% growth expected As the crypto market evolves, a stark contrast emerges between the fortunes of Dogecoin and RCO Finance . While Dogecoin’s price struggles to gain traction, RCO Finance is experiencing significant momentum in its ongoing presale. With a staggering projected rally of 43,000%, RCO Finance offers a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking substantial returns. But what are the factors contributing to this bullish momentum? Find the details below!

The Dogecoin price plunges as investors take profits The Dogecoin price has experienced a surprising decline, impacting its market position. As of January 8, Dogecoin was trading at $0.347, down 10.1% over the past 24 hours. Over the past month, its price has also dropped by more than 24%, making it a less attractive investment option. A likely reason for the sudden decrease is that investors are taking profits after the Dogecoin price rose to $0.40. Despite the decline in the Dogecoin price and overall market value, trading volume increased by 43.69%, reaching $3.81 billion. This suggests many investors are actively trading, either buying at lower prices or cashing out profits before further declines. Some experts, like KrissPax via a post on X, have noticed a pattern in the Dogecoin price movement that usually indicates it could keep going down. If this pattern breaks downward, it might lead to a bigger drop in price. RCOF soars in presale with 43,000% growth expected With the Dogecoin price momentum slowing down, all eyes are now on RCOF and its buzzing presale. The ongoing presale has already raked in an impressive $10.1 million in revenue, signaling a sharp uptick in interest. At just $0.0777 per token, RCOF tokens are currently available with an attractive 25% discount using the code ‘RCOF25’. Anticipation is building as forecasts indicate that the token price could skyrocket to $0.60 at launch, marking a phenomenal increase of over 500%. The excitement surrounding RCOF’s presale is palpable, with experts likening it to the early exchange listings of Dogecoin. Some speculate that RCOF could mirror the spectacular Dogecoin price rally in 2021, offering early investors potential gains exceeding 43,000%.

Though rare in cryptocurrency, these explosive increases point to this market's fantastic possibilities. Suppose you're looking for the next big thing. In that case, we have found seven altcoins with excellent development potential, including Rexas Finance (RXS), which has already earned outstanding profits in its ongoing presale. A few weeks after its presale went live in early September 2024, Rexas Finance increased 485%, soaring from $0.030 to $0.175 ATH. Let's explore several fascinating initiatives and why they might be the next SOL, especially Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance (RXS): A Real-World Asset Revolution In the crypto scene, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a paradigm-changer. Rexas Finance closes the gap between conventional sectors and blockchain technology by allowing the tokenization of actual assets such as real estate, commodities, and artwork. Anyone can tokenize assets and generate money using its easy-to-use Rexas Token Builder and Launchpad, which generate applicable use for blockchain technologies. From its original price of $0.030 in stage 1, RXS has risen 485%. As of writing, it is currently priced at $0.175 in presale stage 11. Having raised more than $36,623,625 so far, Rexas Finance has attracted the interest of investors looking for fast-growing prospects. Experts estimate a shocking 12,101% increase for RXS, possibly reaching $21.17—a path reminiscent of SOL's enormous 2021 expansion to $263 ATH. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have listed Rexas Finance, increasing the token’s profile. The project's Certik assessment emphasizes its dedication to dependability and security. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens and an ongoing $1 million giveaway, RXS is positioned to draw a devoted community. Presale attendees have already experienced up to six times the return on investment, and there is still an excellent chance for more. Rexas Finance (RXS) has attracted many top investors in ETH and SOL. In the last 60 days, RXS has outperformed both, rising 485% and becoming the most-performed token in Q4 2024. These top investors believe RXS will outperform most crypto giants in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) is experiencing increasing bullish momentum as it attracts top cryptocurrency investors. Market experts have revealed that RXS could rise 12,100% to reach a $21.17 price level in 2025, making it a token to buy if you like what Solana did in 2021. Sui (SUI): The Liquidity Enhancer Sui's creative cross-chain USDC transfer systems have enhanced liquidity and stablecoin usability, pushing its 2024 performance. As of writing, SUI is priced at $5.36, and SUI peaked annually and increased by 159.56% over the preceding ninety days. Technical indicators show ongoing rising momentum; analysts estimate SUI might reach $9.63 by early 2025, an 86% rise from present levels. Sui is a top choice for investors wishing to duplicate SOL's success. Like SOL in 2021, Sui benefits from a rising user base and innovative technologies. Polygon (POL): The Scalability Powerhouse Ethereum's scalability is led by Polygon's zkEVM approach. Expanding its ecosystem through partnerships with big corporations like Nike and Starbucks has produced a 57.14% price rise to $0.5145 over the previous 60 days. POL's carbon-neutral initiatives also attract developers and businesses with environmental consciousness, enhancing its appeal. Considering its strong ecosystem and helpful use, Polygon will make much money. Investors driven by SOL's ascent in 2021 must have POL; analysts see a possible 10x rally in 2025. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum’s Layer-2 Star Arbitrum's roll-up technology maintains Ethereum's security and lowers transaction costs and congestion. Over the past sixty days, this creative method has pushed the price up 67.95% to $0.8917 at the time of writing. ARB's relevance will only rise as Ethereum's ecosystem continues to expand. Analysts projected that ARB might be worth $5, a substantial increase for investors. Arbitrum is a good alternative if you like projects with solid technical bases. ARB is another altcoin to buy now if you like what Solana did in 2021. Stellar (XLM): The Financial Inclusion Pioneer Stellar's recent 382.18% price increase to $0.4451, as of this writing, has been driven by its aim to transform worldwide financial institutions through low-cost transactions. With a market value of over $13 billion, XLM is becoming increasingly popular among financial institutions as a workable substitute for conventional systems. Stellar's road map indicates ongoing expansion, so it's another cryptocurrency worth considering if you're looking for initiatives with transforming power, as SOL did in 2021. Aptos (APT): The Web3 Developer’s Choice Aptos is a strong candidate in the blockchain market. It is designed for scalability and developer-friendly tools. Over the past 60 days, its price has increased 5.66% to $9.84 at the time of writing; analysts project APT reaching $15 before the end of the second quarter of 2025. With its emphasis on Web3 apps and a strong ecosystem, Aptos presents a convincing investment opportunity for those seeking to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation. If you like what SOL did in 2021, APT is another altcoin to buy. Tron (TRX): The dApp Powerhouse Tron's high-performance blockchain design facilitates an active distributed app ecosystem (dApps). TRX is gathering speed with a current price of $0.2632 at the time of writing and a 60.57% rise over the past 60 days as it gains bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market. Tron is a fantastic contender for investors looking for altcoins with actual value and growth potential because of its scalability and almost negligible transaction costs. As SOL's ecology grows, analysts think TRX might follow. Why Rexas Finance Could Be the Next SOL Although the seven altcoins on our list show great promise, Rexas Finance (RXS) distinguishes itself with its special attention to actual asset tokenization. By bridging the gap between conventional sectors and blockchain, RXS presents a use case that is generally relevant and practical in implementation. With a 6x ROI thus far, its presale performance shows great investor confidence, and given the expected 12,100% gain, it qualifies as a unique investment opportunity. Furthermore, Rexas Finance's community-centric approach—avoiding venture capital in favor of individual investors—fits the dispersed attitude of blockchain. Its CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings, Certik audit, and ongoing $1 million giveaway further boost its legitimacy and appeal. RXS shows the potential to rise 12,100% to reach $21.17 in 2025, repeating what SOL did in 2021. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a strong candidate if you want the next altcoin to match SOL's 2021 success. Join the RXS presale and set yourself up for potentially life-changing results. Final Thoughts Though the cryptocurrency market offers prospects soon, making the correct project calls requires thought. Every altcoin on this list—from Sui and Polygon's transforming technologies to Arbitrum's scaling solutions to Stellar's initiatives toward financial inclusion—has excellent return potential, especially Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is a visionary project with a well-defined road map, practical application, and fantastic development capacity. Its presale presents a unique access point for investors looking for a significant return. Before the next major event starts, don't hesitate to investigate these prospects and decide on your course of action.

Experts estimate a shocking 12,101% increase for RXS, possibly reaching $21.17—a path reminiscent of SOL's enormous 2021 expansion to $263 ATH. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have listed Rexas Finance, increasing the token’s profile. The project's Certik assessment emphasizes its dedication to dependability and security. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens and an ongoing $1 million giveaway, RXS is positioned to draw a devoted community. Presale attendees have already experienced up to six times the return on investment, and there is still an excellent chance for more. Rexas Finance (RXS) has attracted many top investors in ETH and SOL. In the last 60 days, RXS has outperformed both, rising 485% and becoming the most-performed token in Q4 2024. These top investors believe RXS will outperform most crypto giants in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) is experiencing increasing bullish momentum as it attracts top cryptocurrency investors. Market experts have revealed that RXS could rise 12,100% to reach a $21.17 price level in 2025, making it a token to buy if you like what Solana did in 2021. Sui (SUI): The Liquidity Enhancer Sui's creative cross-chain USDC transfer systems have enhanced liquidity and stablecoin usability, pushing its 2024 performance. As of writing, SUI is priced at $5.36, and SUI peaked annually and increased by 159.56% over the preceding ninety days. Technical indicators show ongoing rising momentum; analysts estimate SUI might reach $9.63 by early 2025, an 86% rise from present levels. Sui is a top choice for investors wishing to duplicate SOL's success. Like SOL in 2021, Sui benefits from a rising user base and innovative technologies. Polygon (POL): The Scalability Powerhouse Ethereum's scalability is led by Polygon's zkEVM approach. Expanding its ecosystem through partnerships with big corporations like Nike and Starbucks has produced a 57.14% price rise to $0.5145 over the previous 60 days. POL's carbon-neutral initiatives also attract developers and businesses with environmental consciousness, enhancing its appeal. Considering its strong ecosystem and helpful use, Polygon will make much money. Investors driven by SOL's ascent in 2021 must have POL; analysts see a possible 10x rally in 2025. Arbitrum (ARB): Ethereum’s Layer-2 Star Arbitrum's roll-up technology maintains Ethereum's security and lowers transaction costs and congestion. Over the past sixty days, this creative method has pushed the price up 67.95% to $0.8917 at the time of writing. ARB's relevance will only rise as Ethereum's ecosystem continues to expand. Analysts projected that ARB might be worth $5, a substantial increase for investors. Arbitrum is a good alternative if you like projects with solid technical bases. ARB is another altcoin to buy now if you like what Solana did in 2021. Stellar (XLM): The Financial Inclusion Pioneer Stellar's recent 382.18% price increase to $0.4451, as of this writing, has been driven by its aim to transform worldwide financial institutions through low-cost transactions. With a market value of over $13 billion, XLM is becoming increasingly popular among financial institutions as a workable substitute for conventional systems. Stellar's road map indicates ongoing expansion, so it's another cryptocurrency worth considering if you're looking for initiatives with transforming power, as SOL did in 2021. Aptos (APT): The Web3 Developer’s Choice Aptos is a strong candidate in the blockchain market. It is designed for scalability and developer-friendly tools. Over the past 60 days, its price has increased 5.66% to $9.84 at the time of writing; analysts project APT reaching $15 before the end of the second quarter of 2025. With its emphasis on Web3 apps and a strong ecosystem, Aptos presents a convincing investment opportunity for those seeking to capitalize on the next wave of blockchain innovation. If you like what SOL did in 2021, APT is another altcoin to buy. Tron (TRX): The dApp Powerhouse Tron's high-performance blockchain design facilitates an active distributed app ecosystem (dApps). TRX is gathering speed with a current price of $0.2632 at the time of writing and a 60.57% rise over the past 60 days as it gains bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market. Tron is a fantastic contender for investors looking for altcoins with actual value and growth potential because of its scalability and almost negligible transaction costs. As SOL's ecology grows, analysts think TRX might follow. Why Rexas Finance Could Be the Next SOL Although the seven altcoins on our list show great promise, Rexas Finance (RXS) distinguishes itself with its special attention to actual asset tokenization. By bridging the gap between conventional sectors and blockchain, RXS presents a use case that is generally relevant and practical in implementation. With a 6x ROI thus far, its presale performance shows great investor confidence, and given the expected 12,100% gain, it qualifies as a unique investment opportunity. Furthermore, Rexas Finance's community-centric approach—avoiding venture capital in favor of individual investors—fits the dispersed attitude of blockchain. Its CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings, Certik audit, and ongoing $1 million giveaway further boost its legitimacy and appeal. RXS shows the potential to rise 12,100% to reach $21.17 in 2025, repeating what SOL did in 2021. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a strong candidate if you want the next altcoin to match SOL's 2021 success. Join the RXS presale and set yourself up for potentially life-changing results. Final Thoughts Though the cryptocurrency market offers prospects soon, making the correct project calls requires thought. Every altcoin on this list—from Sui and Polygon's transforming technologies to Arbitrum's scaling solutions to Stellar's initiatives toward financial inclusion—has excellent return potential, especially Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is a visionary project with a well-defined road map, practical application, and fantastic development capacity. Its presale presents a unique access point for investors looking for a significant return.

Although the altcoin crashed due to Bitcoin’s collapse, it AIXBT price triggered a 55% recovery rally. One of the key reasons for this is the CES 2025 event. In addition to this, NVIDIA CEO’s mention of AI agents and how they could reshape many industries caused this trend to ignite. Moreover, technicals also suggest AIXBT price has a long way to go despite the 55% rally witnessed on Friday. NVIDIA CEO Restart AI Agent Hype During CES 2025 During the recent Consumer Electronic Show (CES) 2025, many Artificial Intelligence-based developments were showcased, sparking interest in AI agents. These agents are powered by AI and machine learning and are expected to accrue value that could surpass billions of US dollars. The technology also has the capacity to massively impact various sectors, including healthcare and finance. One of the main reasons that fueled this hype was Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote on the AI agent topic during a CES 2025 keynote. His comments Google Trend search reveals that AI agent topic’s popularity or searches eclipse that of meme coins. This shows that the trend is pivoting toward these agents. Google Trends As CES 2025 concludes, AI Agents have become a topic of interest. AIXBT, a popular crypto AI agent, shot up 55% in under 13% hours after Bitcoin’s crash to $91K. With more investors taking notice, the AI agent sector is likely to explode. AIXBT Price Analysis Hints AI Token is Primed For Extended Recovery Rally As seen in the one-hour chart, AIXBT’s price shot up 55% from the bottom of January 9 and set up a local top of around $0.598. This massive uptrend, coupled with volatility related to Nonfarm Payrolls, triggered a short-term 20% correction, leaving aixbt, a Solana-based token , to trade around $0.530. It has produced four lower highs since December 31, indicating that despite this recent uptick, bears or profit-taking still dominate. However, with Bitcoin (BTC) showing signs of forming a potential bottom, top altcoins, including AIXBT price, could be setting the stage for an even bigger rally. Strategic Support & Target Levels Investors need to observe potential reverals around the $0.471 and $0.510 support levels. A bounce here could lead to a revisit of the December 31 highs of $0.670. Crypto traders can expect a breakout from here, leading to a new all-time high potentially around $1 before January 2025 ends. AIXBT/USDT 1-hour chart The surge in AIXBT’s price is a testament to the growing interest in AI agents. With NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s endorsement and the CES 2025 event sparking excitement, the AI agent sector is poised for massive growth. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes, AIXBT’s potential for an extended recovery rally also surges.

A meme coin’s market hype, including what the most popular crypto influencers are saying, can have a massive impact on its presale numbers and, ultimately, on its performance once it’s listed. The meme coin market is thriving, with a 3.52% increase in total market cap in the last 24 hours, with fantastic gains for coins like PIPPIN (+201%), RAPTOR (+396%), and SPORE (+138%). With a potential bull run coming, your best bet is to position yourself behind projects that aren’t only fundamentally strong but also have the vote of confidence from influencers and retail traders alike. Here are 4 of the best meme coins that meet that criteria. 1. Wall Steet Pepe ($WEPE) $WEPE has quickly become a highly sought-after meme coin in the crypto community, with several influencers on platforms like YouTube and X championing its mission to empower small-scale investors. Drawing inspiration from the iconic Pepe meme, this coin blends innovation with humor, delivering real value to its holders. It’s currently in presale, where it has already raised over $45M . Such remarkable success speaks for $WEPE’s growing popularity among both retail investors and crypto influencers. The commitment of $WEPE in the crypto market sets it apart. Unlike traditional crypto ecosystems dominated by whales, $WEPE equips its community members with unique training insights and alpha trading calls. Typically, these resources are reserved for institutional players. However, $WEPE has a vision to level the playing field. The “WEPE Army,” or the “Frog Army,” based on the $WEPE community, is another factor contributing to the success of the coin. Influencers have already spread the message of collaboration and empowerment, which is fueling its viral growth. With strong support from the community and innovative features, $WEPE is well-positioned as a potential 100x meme coin in 2025. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) Solaxy ($SOLX) is the meme coin revolutionizing DeFi. It has rapidly emerged as a favorite among crypto enthusiasts and influencers, thanks to its unique combination of meme culture and practical utility. $SOLX has been built as a Layer-2 solution on the Solana network and addresses persistent challenges like spam transactions and scalability. It also simplifies issues like network congestion, which makes it an outstanding choice in the meme coin ecosystem. The Solaxy presale was launched in December 2024 . Since then, it has raised an impressive $9.5M, which showcases the strong confidence among investors. The current price of $0.001596 is an attractive entry point for early investors, considering that prices are expected to increase within the next 24 hours. The innovative tokenomics of $SOLX allocates 25% of its supply to rewards, 30% to development, and 10% to liquidity pools. $SOLX is also gaining traction for its seamless integration with DeFi platforms. This meme coin makes transactions faster and more effective, providing a user-friendly solution for the expanding DeFi market. Currently, 2.8B $SOLX tokens are locked in staking rewards. This demonstrates the strong trust in its community and active participation. Influencers are excited about the robust ecosystem of $SOLX and its practical applications. This defines its potential for exponential growth in 2025, making it one of the best crypto presales to join in 2025. 3. Flockerz ($FLOCK) $FLOCK is another meme coin gaining a lot of traction among influencers due to its unique vote-to-earn mechanism. All token holders, irrespective of the size of their holdings, can vote on important decisions to decide the future of the project. The more you participate, the more $FLOCK tokens you earn. Simply put, it’s the token holders who get to decide the future of the project in a purely democratic way. Moreover, the platform has also been audited by Coinsult and SolidProof , ensuring that $FLOCK is 100% legit and safe. The project has already raised more than $9M in presales, with one $FLOCK currently priced at $0.006616. However, note that this price may increase as the presale is expected to end around 23 January. The token already has a strong following on X , with close to 30K followers, indicating both influencers’ and investors’ interest in the project. 4. SPX6900 ($SPX) SPX6900 ($SPX) is out of its presale stage and is currently trading live. It had a good bull run up until December, after which it went into consolidation. However, the year ended on a positive note for the token as it breached the $1 mark. The first week of January 2025 was particularly excellent, as it soared more than 80% in a single week and hit an all-time high with a $1.44B market cap. Currently, the coin is trading at around $1.25-$1.35, with a total market cap of $1.18B. Analysts believe it’s still early days for the coin, and it has a lot of potential in the next few months, with the price expected to cross the $2 mark. If you’re a long-term investor and can hold the coin for 3-5 years, you can expect the price to reach somewhere between $6-$10. It’s no wonder SPX6900 has become a rage among influencers and crypto enthusiasts. It has around 70K followers on X and over 16K subscribers on its Telegram . Conclusion With all the chatter around meme coins and their potential for massive returns, it’s important to stick to the basics of investing, which is to do your own research and put your money into projects that offer distinct advantages over the others in their segment. We also recommend not getting overwhelmed by a particular coin’s market hype or taking a crypto influencer’s word for it. Additionally, none of the above is financial advice, and you must always do your due diligence.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-10 15:44:12

With its presale raising an impressive $9.7 million at a token price of $0.004875, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as the token to watch this cycle, offering extraordinary growth potential. Lightchain AI Game-Changer in the Making Unlike established giants like Solana or Ripple, Lightchain AI is an emerging player with a distinct value proposition. Focused on addressing inefficiencies in blockchain technology, it offers a versatile platform designed to adapt across multiple industries. By combining blockchain with cutting-edge AI, Lightchain AI tackles challenges such as scalability and privacy, positioning itself to lead the shift toward decentralized intelligence and real-world applications. The robust tokenomics of Lightchain AI (LCAI) ensures sustainability, with its 10 billion token supply distributed strategically - 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. This thoughtful allocation provides a strong foundation for growth and innovation. Lightchain AI’s success during its presale highlights its credibility, attracting early investors eager for high-growth opportunities. With its ability to innovate and solve practical challenges, Lightchain AI is a project to watch, offering a chance to get in on the ground floor of a token set for substantial impact. Why Solana and Ripple Investors Are Taking Note Solana and Ripple has shown their strength and use in the block chain area, each making a special spot. Solana has got fame for its great speed of deals and low prices, making it a favorite for builders of apps that are not run by one person. Ripple, in the other hand, has made its place in changing payments between countries, giving quicker and cheaper options for banks around world. But, Lightchain AI offers something completely fresh. With its focus on making blockchain solutions that can grow and change, it is a special project made to matc͏h the changing needs of firms and workers. By putting new ideas and change first, Lightchain AI can meet some of the big problems in the field, from dealing with bigger deal counts to fitting different needs. How $450 Can Turn Into $45K With Lightchain AI What if a small $450 investment could turn into a life-changing $45K—or even more? Lightchain AI is paving the way for exponential growth, and the potential is astounding. Here’s the math - at $0.004875 per token, a $450 investment secures you about 92,307 LCAI tokens. If the token price climbs to $0.50, your $450 grows to $46,154. And if it hits $1? That same investment skyrockets to $92,307! But it’s not just about numbers— Lightchain AI’s unique value proposition and scalability make it a standout player in the booming AI and blockchain space.

Per the analysts, the level of transparency in bitcoin’s hashrate distribution we’re seeing today is “unprecedented.” Just three years ago, in January 2022, only 16.7% of the total hashrate (a measure of bitcoin mining compute power) could be attributed to known entities, per TheMinerMag’s archive data. “This figure has doubled in just three years, showcasing the growing share of bitcoin mining owned by publicly traded companies and the increased transparency,” the report stated. Source: Miner Weekly Meanwhile, going back to 2020, the analysts noted that the largest known pools accounted for over 90% of global bitcoin production. Yet, there was a significant lack of clarity when it came to the entities controlling the hashrate, besides a few smaller-scale companies in North America. At the time, the majority of hashrate was owned by large, “often opaque operations” situated in China. The country has imposed a ban on crypto mining, forcing the miners to move their operations overseas. The scene has changed dramatically in the past four years. According to December 2024 data from TheMinerMag, some 31.6% of global bitcoin production can now be directly attributed to 19 publicly traded mining companies that disclose their proprietary mining performance monthly. These are Argo Blockchain , Bitfarms , Bit Digital , Bitdeer Technologies , BitFuFu , Cango Inc. , Cipher Mining , CleanSpark , Core Scientific , Digihost Technology , DMG Blockchain , HIVE Digital , Hut 8 Mining , Iris Energy , MARA Holdings , Mawson Infrastructure Group , Riot Platforms , Soluna Holdings , and Terawulf . However, it is important to note that this list excludes companies that report only quarterly, not monthly. These include companies such as Greenidge Generation , Canaan , Galaxy Digital , Northern Data , Phoenix Technology , Cormint Data Systems , and Stronghold Digital Mining . “When including these quarterly results, the total hashrate attributable to the 27 aforementioned companies mined over 34% of global bitcoin production in December, representing more than one-third of the bitcoin network’s total hashrate,” the report concluded.

The CFPB’s rule seeks to expand the scope of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to cover digital assets such as stablecoins — crypto tokens designed to maintain a stable value — and other fungible tokens used for payments. If adopted, the expansion would redefine “funds” to include assets that act as money or are used to pay for goods and services. Cryptocurrency accounts, often referred to as wallets, allow users to store digital currencies and make transactions. Unlike traditional bank accounts, however, these wallets are not universally protected against losses resulting from hacking or fraud. The CFPB’s proposal would change that, requiring service providers to compensate customers for stolen funds.

Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reported 303 crypto hacks in 2024, resulting in $2.2 billion in stolen funds. North Korean groups were responsible for over $1.6 billion of these losses, doubling their theft from the previous year. The CFPB’s proposal marks one of the final crypto-related initiatives from the Biden administration. However, its future remains uncertain as the incoming Trump administration, which has shown strong support for the crypto industry, prepares to take office. Several Trump advisers, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, have publicly criticized the CFPB, calling for its reduction or elimination. Public comments on the CFPB proposal are open until March 31, after which the bureau will decide whether to issue a final rule.

38750638,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/how-does-bitcoin-work,1736524376,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/38750638.jpeg,How Does Bitcoin Work?,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/how-does-bitcoin-work,"Bitcoin (BTC) is a revolutionary digital currency that functions independently from banks or centralized entities. It was created by the pseudo-anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto as a decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems, enabling transactions directly between users. This brief guide will explain how Bitcoin works and the underlying technology powering it. Looking Under The Hood Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system and currency operating without a financial system or the involvement of financial institutions. At the center of Bitcoin’s success is its protocol that ensures secure, transparent, and trustless transactions. The Bitcoin Blockchain The Bitcoin blockchain is a publicly available, distributed ledger containing a record of every Bitcoin transaction. When a transaction is initiated, it is signed with a secure digital signature and broadcast to the Bitcoin network. Anyone can download a copy of the blockchain and trace previous transactions between users. While anyone can view the transactions, once transactions are added to the Bitcoin blockchain, they become immutable. This means they cannot be altered in any shape, way, or form. Another thing to remember is that while the blockchain maintains a record of every Bitcoin transaction, these transactions may or may not be linked to real-life identities. This is why Bitcoin is considered pseudo-anonymous. Some features of the Bitcoin blockchain are: Transparency: The Bitcoin blockchain allows anyone to view the history of all Bitcoin transactions. Transparency ensures trust and security. Decentralization: The Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by a single entity. Instead, it is maintained by its network of nodes that verify transactions and secure the blockchain. Blocks A block is a set of Bitcoin transactions from a specific time period. Blocks on the blockchain are “stacked” so that each block is dependent on the previous one, creating a chain of blocks, hence the term “blockchain.” Blocks are created by Bitcoin miners in return for BTC . Whenever a miner solves a block, they earn a predetermined quantity of BTC . Bitcoin miners play a crucial role in securing the network, and the BTC acts as a reward for their efforts. This system ensures all transactions are valid and protects the network from fraud. A block contains the following information. Current software version: The current Bitcoin client version Previous block hash: The hash of the block before the current block Block height number: How numerically far the block is from the first block Merkelroot: A 256-bit number that stores information about the transactions within the block Timestamp: The date and time the block was opened Target in bits: The network target Nonce: A 32-bit number added to the block hash Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin mining is the process through which the Bitcoin network releases new BTC into circulation. But how does it work? Bitcoin mining is carried out by a very specific type of user. These users, called miners, use specialized hardware to solve cryptographically difficult puzzles using real-world computational resources. When a miner solves the puzzle, they get to add a block containing pending transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. This process is also called Proof-of-Work. In return for adding the block to the blockchain, the miner wins a “block reward.” The first Bitcoin block had a block reward of 50 BTC . Since then, Bitcoin has gone through several “halving” events. These halving events occur every four years, or 210,000 blocks, and slash the block reward by half, ensuring BTC’s limited supply does not run out and creating a supply crunch. The most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in April 2024 and slashed the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC . The next halving will take place in 2028. Bitcoin Transactions You don’t need to go through a financial intermediary to complete a Bitcoin transaction. All you need is a Bitcoin wallet. Bitcoin wallets contain your public and private keys. The public key acts as your bank account and helps store your BTC . On the other hand, your private key acts like an ATM pin, allowing you to access your BTC . You can share your public address with anyone. However, your private key must be kept secure at all times. Below, we will oversimplify the transaction process. If you want your friend to give you BTC , send them your public address. If you wish to send your friend your BTC , use your private key. In Closing This guide has explained the workings of Bitcoin in a very brief and simplified manner. It has also explained how the process of mining works. In the next part, we will look at some of the hard and soft forks of Bitcoin. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

You would think this will be embraced at first glance. But No. The MiCA regulations have caused the crypto industry sleepless nights. However, they have their benefits. According to JPMorgan (JPM), the EU’s MiCA regulations, which were implemented on Dec. 30, 2024, are expected to increase the demand for euro-denominated stablecoins. Presently, euro-pegged stablecoins account for only 0.12% of the stablecoin market share. However, MiCA has the potential to grow this figure by promoting European banks and financial institutions’ adoption of euro stablecoins for customer requirements and blockchain-based financial settlements. JPM analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote, “Under MiCA, only compliant stablecoins can be used as trading pairs in regulated markets, prompting EU exchanges to adjust their offerings.” Source: J.P. Morgan The analysts cited Societe Generale’s EURCV stablecoin and BBVA’s forthcoming stablecoin launch in partnership with Visa as notable examples. MiCA’s impact on global stablecoins The report noted that stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, are required to secure trading licenses within the EU and maintain substantial reserves in European institutions under the new regulations. This has led to the strengthening of compliant stablecoins, such as Circle’s EURC. Non-compliant stablecoins, such as Tether’s EURT, have encountered difficulties. Already, Coinbase delisted Tether’s USDt, citing concerns about compliance with the EU’s MiCA regulations. However, the bank stated that Tether continues to be a “dominant force” in the global stablecoin market despite the challenges it faces. It is also noted that tether is extensively used in Asian markets, where there are fewer restrictions. The report further stated that Tether’s investment in stablecoin issuers that are MiCA-compliant, such as Quantoz Payments, demonstrates its dedication to sustaining a presence in the EU. Platforms like Binance and Crypto.com chose to hold off on any action until the situation became clearer. Notably, in December, the organization disclosed that it had also made an investment in StablR, a European stablecoin issuer. Generally, the analysts stated that MiCA’s long-term impact on the crypto market could be positive. This is because it could attract institutional investors and promote the adoption of euro-pegged stablecoins. Still, although it introduces higher compliance costs, the U.S. is likely to adopt its own crypto legislation under the incoming Donald Trump administration as the EU takes this regulatory leap. MiCA regulations and their demand on the crypto industry The first thing MICA regulations did was to kick out algorithmic stablecoins. Apparently, MiCA does not regard algorithmic stablecoins as asset-referenced tokens. This is because they lack explicit reserves that are associated with any conventional asset. This essentially implies that algorithmic stablecoins are prohibited under MiCA. The new regulations will necessitate that stablecoins are recognized by MiCA and be supported by a liquid reserve with a 1:1 ratio. MiCA has stated that its explicit objective is to safeguard the financial stability and monetary sovereignty of the European market. As a result, the regulations regarding stablecoins, particularly those that pertain to variant issuers, are quite stringent. Therefore, before listing or publicly offering their assets in the EU, individuals who intend to issue EMTs and ARTs must obtain authorization. The issuer must provide this authorization unless they expressly grant written consent to another party to do so. Notably, MiCA does not employ the term “stablecoin;” both ARTs and EMTs are regarded as stablecoins. After publishing a whitepaper and notifying their supervisory authority, authorized credit institutions may offer or list EMTs. EU-based ART issuers are subject to additional requirements, including the approval of their whitepaper before publication. More importantly, the European Banking Authority may classify them as “significant” based on specific criteria, which would subject them to more stringent regulatory policy and supervision. This is where the EU-based stablecoins will benefit.

Despite this, BTC has held on to key support at around $92,000, but a break below this level could pave the way for a deeper pullback.” The 24-hour liquidation in the crypto market crossed $329 million on Friday. Of this, Bitcoin accounts for over $88 million in liquidations as the largest cryptocurrency consolidates. Traders should watch the liquidations closely next week to identify whether the market improves and makes room for higher demand in crypto. Reason for optimism as US regulatory outlook improves David Carlisle of Elliptic explores crypto policy and regulation in his recent research at Elliptic. Carlisle notes that 2024 has been a year of important developments that will have an impact on the crypto space for years to come. Carlisle believes that in 2025 crypto policy and regulation could make strides. In the US, banking regulators could lower barriers to engagement with crypto for financial institutions and President-elect Donald Trump’s presidency could promote a pro-crypto sentiment. Key appointments like SEC Chair, AI & Crypto Czar, and the CFTC Chair by the incoming President could influence the regulatory and policy approaches to crypto in the US. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently revealed that 75% of the company’s open roles are now based in the U.S. and stated that the “Trump effect” is the driver for the firm’s decision. Growing optimism among crypto firms, and a conducive regulatory environment could support demand for crypto among U.S.-based traders. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Among the contenders, Lightchain AI is emerging as a strong candidate, leveraging creativity and market momentum to capture investor attention.

Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin has evolved into a significant digital currency, boasting a market capitalization that exceeded $85 billion at its peak. Its vibrant community has utilized the coin for various charitable endeavors and crowdfunding projects, highlighting its practical applications beyond mere internet humor. The cryptocurrency has also garnered attention from high-profile figures, notably Elon Musk, whose endorsements have influenced its value and popularity.

Banana Zone was a term used by Raoul Pal to describe a period of significant price increases, and the famous name stated that the market was still in an upward cycle and divided the banana zone phase into three. Stating that the first phase of the Banana Zone period occurred in November last year, Pal said that we are currently in a consolidation phase similar to the 2016/2017 cycle and that the consolidation will not last too long. Stating that the second phase of the Banana zone period will come very soon, Pal stated that there will be an altcoin season in which everything will rise. Finally, Pal stated that after this phase where everything is on the rise, the third phase will come and there will be a greater consolidation here. “Yes, we are still in Banana Country… Banana Zone phase 1 was the breakout in November last year, now we are in the consolidation phase (like the consolidation in 2016/2017). This consolidation will not last long.. Next is Banana Zone phase 2: This will be the altcoin season where everything goes up.

Data from Dune showed that the total market cap of liquid staking tokens on Solana ( SOL ) spiked above $7.5 billion on Jan. 10. This growth came as leading LSTs — including Jito staked SOL, Binance staked SOL, and Marinade staked SOL — saw notable increases over the past week. Among these, jitoSOL continues to lead with a 37.6% market share, bringing its total market cap to over $2.8 billion at the time of writing. The bnSOL and mSOL liquid staking tokens account for 20.2% and 14.1% of Solana’s LST market share, with market values of $1.5 billion and $1.05 billion, respectively. Other Solana LSTs with significant market caps include Jupiter’s jupSOL, Solayer’s sSOL, Bybit’s bbSOL, and Laine’s laineSOL. Read more: Solana’s Liquid staking ecosystem flourishes amidst increased adoption Dune data also shows that the total market cap of staked SOL currently stands at $82.66 billion, which means the $7.5 billion value for liquid staking tokens gives an LST ratio of 9.07%. However, despite the overall growth in market cap, the total value locked (TVL) in Jito and Marinade has declined by 19% and 15%, respectively, over the past month. In contrast, DeFiLlama data showed total value locked in Binance staked SOL has jumped more than 29% in the same period. Binance announced the launch of bnSOL in August 2024. In the decentralized finance market, liquid staking protocols and their associated tokens are playing an increasingly important role. These protocols provide users with access to staking services, while LSTs offer tokenized representations of staked assets — in this case, Solana’s native token, SOL. For example, users can stake SOL to receive an LST such as jitoSOL or bnSOL. These tokens can then be traded or utilized on other DeFi platforms, allowing holders to earn additional rewards while their underlying assets remain staked.

Back on November 3, 2020, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) confiscated 69,370 BTC from dark web marketplace Silk Road. At the time, a single Bitcoin was worth roughly $14,000. That same hoard is now worth roughly $6.4 billion in total. The seized assets have been kept in storage by the Treasury Department since then — and although Battle Born Investments appealed the government’s decision to sell the stash, the appeal was lost on October 7 , 2024 — clearing the way for a major sale. Although not conclusively confirmed, on January 10, several online commentators noted that the address in question made its first outgoing transaction. What can firmly be stated is that this was no sale — as the transaction was worth only $0.51, if legitimate, it’s most likely a precautionary test run of sorts. Will the Silk Road Bitcoin be liquidated? One of the first reports regarding the transaction came from a January 10 post made on social media platform X by user CryptosRus. The post contained a screenshot of the Silk Road wallet’s page from blockchain.com — at the time of publication, the page still indicated that $0.51 was sent from the wallet.

Bitcoin’s price tumbled toward $93,000, liquidating hundreds of millions in over-leveraged positions in the process, as the majority of altcoins are also in the red. Bitcoin’s price trades at a 4.5% decline compared to seven days ago and it’s currently around $93,000. This comes after a week of choppy action, where the primary cryptocurrency attempted to climb toward its peak but was stopped abruptly at around $102,000. As soon as the new week began and the expected economic details started coming in, the market plunged, alongside broader stock markets. On Tuesday, US jobs data came in hotter than expected, making many investors fear that the ongoing rate cuts from the Federal Reserve won’t last long as inflation has been on the rise. Recall that the chairman of the institution – Jerome Powell – hinted at this as well earlier, saying that 2025 will likely see far less rate cuts. That said, not all of it is doom and gloom. Although the majority of large-cap cryptocurrencies are in the red, AI agents continue to be the talk of the town. Most of their prices are also down on a seven-days basis but they are pumping at the slightest sign of a recovery, hinting that interest in them is still strong. Binance even listed a few of them today, highlighting the attention this particular narrative is receiving. That said, Bitcoin’s dominance has exploded by 2% in the past seven days, emphasizing its strength relative to that of the rest of the market. It’s interesting to see how the rest of the month will shape up, especially given that Trump’s inauguration is set for January 20th – a date watched closely by the entire industry.

Unlike the previous MicroStrategy purchases announced throughout November and December, the one from this week actually sparked an immediate price surge for BTC, which went to a multi-week peak of $102,000. Interestingly, it was one of the most modest MicroStrategy acquisitions in recent history, as the firm spent ‘only’ $101 million to buy 1,070 BTC. Arthur Hayes Expects the Crypto Market to Peak in March: Here’s Why . The former BitMEX CEO believes the entire crypto market will go through a real-life rollercoaster once January 20 (inauguration day) approaches. Aside from those expected short-term fluctuations, he predicted that the current bull cycle still has some legs but will likely finish by March this year. US Govt Cleared to Liquidate $6.5B in BTC from Silk Road, But Don’t Panic . Perhaps the biggest FUD this week came from a few reports claiming that the US had been clear to sell off $6.5 billion seized from Silk Road. Looking at the fine print, though, shows that the authorities might have already disposed of the assets, so no FUD is necessary. US Entities’ Bitcoin Holdings Reach Massive Record: Details . On a more positive note coming from the world’s largest economy, locally based entities, such as ETFs, exchanges, MicroStrategy, miners, and others, have grown their overall BTC share – a figure that is 65% higher now than non-US-based counterparts. Ripple Executives Meet Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago Event . With Trump set to assume office in ten days and his multiple positive promises for the crypto industry, reports are coming left and right about crypto execs meeting with the President-elect and his team. The latest to do so were two of Ripple’s chief executive – CEO Brad Garlinghouse and CLO Stuart Alderoty. Ethereum Outpaces Bitcoin as Long-Term Holders Soar to 74.7% . Long-term holders (LTHs) seem more inclined to hold ETH for a longer period than BTC. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 74.7% of Ethereum addresses belong to such investors, while the number for BTC’s LTH ratio is at just over 60%. However, this is expected to change if ETH’s price nears its 2021 all-time high of almost $5,000.

Amid this market uncertainty, data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reveals that $35.96 million worth of XRP is at risk of liquidation due to the current market sentiment. XRP’s Major Liquidation Levels According to the XRP exchange liquidation map, the major liquidation areas are near $2.231 on the lower side and $2.36 on the upper side at press time. At these levels, traders are over-leveraged. Source: Coinglass If the market sentiment remains unchanged and the price reaches the $2.231 mark, nearly $35.97 million worth of long positions could be liquidated. Conversely, if the sentiment shifts and the price rises to the $2.36 level, approximately $67.63 million worth of XRP could face liquidation. This data shows that traders betting on short positions significantly outnumber those betting on long positions, indicating a bearish sign for XRP holders. XRP Current Price Momentum Currently, XRP is trading near $2.28 and has experienced a price decline of over 1.35% in the past 24 hours. However, considering the market sentiment, traders and investors appear hesitant to build new positions, leading to a 31% drop in trading volume during the same period. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level The continuous price fluctuations in XRP have formed a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily time frame, indicating a potential breakdown. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if XRP fails to hold the neckline of this bearish pattern and closes an hourly candle below the $2.24 level, there is a strong possibility that the price could drop by 5% to reach the $2.12 level. This scenario could also trigger the liquidation of millions of dollars worth of long positions. On the other hand, if this does not happen, we may see an upside rally and a price rebound in the future.",News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 16:56:09

The multinational bank’s initial crypto services in the region will focus exclusively on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with plans to expand to additional assets later in 2025. Luxembourg Launch According to the official press release , the Luxembourg entity leverages the country’s balanced regulatory and financial environment to meet growing client demand in the EU. Meanwhile, Laurent Marochini has been appointed CEO of the new entity. Interestingly, Marochini was the former Head of Innovation at Société Générale. Commenting on the new entity, Margaret Harwood-Jones, Global Head of Financing & Securities Services, at Standard Chartered, said, “We are really excited to be able to offer our digital asset custody services to the EU region, enabling us to support our clients with a product that is changing the landscape of traditional finance, whilst also providing the level of security that comes with being an appropriately regulated entity. We are incredibly proud to be paving the way for our institutional clients to access the digital asset ecosystem.” The Luxembourg expansion comes on the heels of Standard Chartered’s decision to launch crypto custody services in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank revealed that its digital asset custody offerings would initially focus on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), in collaboration with Brevan Howard Digital, the crypto arm of hedge fund Brevan Howard. The latest development follows the implementation of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation and is part of the banking giant’s global strategy to expand its digital asset offerings. MiCA’s Rules For Exchanges Under the MiCA regulation , crypto exchanges classified as Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) must adhere to a strict framework to operate within the EU. These requirements include obtaining authorization from national regulatory authorities, meeting financial stability benchmarks, as well as ensuring operational transparency. Exchanges must also implement strong consumer protection measures, such as clear terms of service, fee disclosures, and robust security systems to safeguard user funds and data. Additionally, they are required to maintain transparency by reporting trading volumes, disclosing conflicts of interest, and keeping detailed transaction records. Additionally, MiCA’s anti-money laundering (AML) provisions require exchanges to enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, monitor transactions for suspicious activity, and retain data to support investigations. Meeting these standards often requires advanced compliance technologies and significant resource investments. Smaller exchanges, in particular, face challenges in meeting financial stability requirements and implementing sophisticated compliance infrastructure.

The VFX SwitchBlade also supports a ‘first-mover’ fully decentralized and self custodial Bitcoin Tokenization (Verified Bitcoin) with on-chain native features, enabling real day-to-day utility, while solving current frictions for all Bitcoiners globally today. Verified Bitcoin (vBTC) enables anyone the ability to save, spend, withdraw, borrow, lend, mint & transfer media / documents, and vault actual Bitcoin with on-chain recovery features eliminating the need for third-parties or hardware wallets, through a feature rich simple text smart contract. This incredibly unique Bitcoin token provides for enhanced privacy with near-instant transaction finality, all with near-zero fees. Verified Bitcoin tokens are transferable in any denomination completely peer-to-peer, so long as they have a native Bitcoin balance and always maintain a fully decentralized and non-custodial evergreen 1:1 peg. This means that 1 vBTC will always equal 1 BTC and token owners may withdraw their underlying Bitcoin anytime with a ‘one-click’ multisig action or off-ramp the token itself, in whole or in part, at any participatory liquidity provider. This empowering development will inevitably help provide congestion relief for the Bitcoin network, dramatically reduce Bitcoin holders cost of ownership and transfers, enable media embedding, and increase self-custodial security exponentially, adding immediate utility to holders of the largest digital asset class. It is anticipated that Verified Bitcoin may also help facilitate additional native scarcity with Total Value Vaulted (TVV) over time on VerifiedX Vaults. VerifiedX – VFX (VerifiedX.IO) is the first open-source decentralized network that is both a universal layer 1 and a Bitcoin specific sidechain for the purpose of tokenized self-custody, on-chain storage, and peer-to-peer commerce of both digital & physical assets.

33767162,[object Object],1736528427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Experiences Sharp Capital Outflows – Here Are Next Key Levels To Watch,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-experiences-sharp-capital-outflows/,"Bitcoin , the largest digital asset, has faced significant volatility in the last few days, dropping close to the $91,500 price level. Following its recent notable decline in price, bullish sentiment seems to be fading among investors and traders as the flagship asset faces significant capital outflows. Aftermath of Huge Capital Outflows In Bitcoin As Bitcoin’s price continues to struggle, reports from advanced investment and on-chain data platform Alphractal show that the asset has witnessed a huge wave of capital outflow. A rise in capital outflows indicates a shift in investors’ confidence in BTC’s prospects. This trend comes in light of investors and traders reassessing their positions following BTC’s latest price movements toward a downside trajectory. Also, BTC’s decline in price has sparked concerns about its capacity to maintain its present levels as the platform points to crucial support areas ahead. As highlighted by the platform, the withdrawal of capital from Bitcoin raises the possibility that market makers are looking for fresh price points at which to reenter the market. Thus Alphractal has underscored potential scenarios and price points that may develop in the upcoming days. With substantial capital flowing out of BTC, Alphractal noted that the Short-Term Holder Realized price is currently situated at the $86,200 level. During bull markets, this region frequently serves as support and is the initial target if Bitcoin continues to drop. Bullish momentum usually persists when BTC recovers from this point. Alphractal also mentioned another price level of $80,700, representing an area of hope/denial band. The STH & LTH Sentiment Price Band indicator identifies this range, which has historically maintained bullish trends and reflects the sentiment thermometer of both short and long-term investors . However, should the market experience another collapse akin to the one that occurred in May 2021, Bitcoin might fall to lower support levels between $66,000 and $60,000. These zones correspond to metrics like the Active Realized Price and True Market Mean Price, which determine the ideal average price of the blockchain while omitting newly mined coins . Since BTC is consolidating near key support levels, the downtrend may be halted once substantial capital begins to enter the market. In the meantime, market participants continue to observe the situation for signs of a possible rebound or an extended downward pressure. Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis At Critical Level Bitcoin’s latest price movement has put the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at a critical level. Data from leading on-chain and financial platform Glassnode reveals that the short-term holder cost basis is currently positioned at the $88,000 mark for assessing the momentum of BTC’s price . Using the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric, Glassnode finds that there is insufficient volume below the STH cost basis . According to the platform, a decisive loss of this level could trigger an extension of the downswing.",Bitcoin News|Active Realized Price|Alphractal|bitcoin|blockchain|btc|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Glassnode|Short-Term Holder Cost Basis|Short-Term Holder Realized Price|The STH & LTH Sentiment Price Band Indicator|True Market Mean Price|URPD|UTXO Realized Price Distribution,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-10 17:00:27

SUI’s recent resurgence has sparked optimism about the potential for new highs, with the break above $4.9 fueling increased market interest. Traders are now closely watching if the token can sustain its momentum and overcome upcoming resistance levels. With technical indicators supporting the rally, the next few trading sessions will be pivotal in determining whether SUI can capitalize on its current momentum or face challenges at higher levels. Bullish Momentum Returns: A Closer Look At SUI’s Rebound After failing to break below the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA), SUI has made an impressive bullish recovery, breaking through the significant $4.9 resistance level. This surge signals a shift in market sentiment as the bulls regain control and push the price closer to its previous high of $5.3. Related Reading: SUI Breakout Alert: Strong Momentum Puts $4.98 Key Level In Focus Its price action highlights a strong rebound, demonstrating the underlying strength and potential for continued upward movement. The 4-hour SMA, which initially acted as a support level now serves as a key reference point for future price action. If the momentum holds and buying pressure remains robust, SUI could not only test its previous high at $5.3 but possibly surpass it, marking new milestones in its bullish trajectory. With the current strength, it is important to keep a close watch on SUI’s next steps to see whether the rally can extend further, leading to even higher price levels. Additionally, SUI’s RSI is signaling continued bullish momentum, suggesting the possibility of more price increases. As SUI climbs above $4.9, the RSI maintains its upward trajectory well away from overbought levels, which indicates that the asset has room for additional gains. This positive RSI trend strengthens the outlook for prolonged upside movement, with the potential to revisit previous highs as long as the indicator continues to show strength and no signs of a reversal arise. Will SUI Achieve Its Next Big Breakthrough? SUI’s price continues to climb, signaling the capability for new highs if the momentum is maintained. With further gains possible, the next target might be a test of the $5.3 peak. As long as SUI stays above $4.9, the bullish outlook remains intact and a breakout looks promising. Related Reading: SUI Skyrockets: Bullish Momentum Drives Push Toward $6 However, a failure to hold above $4.9 may weaken the bullish trend, leading to a shift in sentiment and a decline to $3.9. A breach of this support could dampen the uptrend and introduce downside risks, keeping the market cautious.

Sui Hits Record Highs, Sei Stays Strong — Yet Web3Bay Could Be 2025’s Underrated Crypto Star!",https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-bulls-rejoice-sui-hits-record-highs-sei-stays-strong-yet-web3bay-could-be-2025s-underrated-crypto-star/,"With Sui reaching its all-time high of $5.36 and the Sei price holding steady, crypto enthusiasts are keeping a close watch. But beyond these developments, Web3Bay is emerging as a potential leader in decentralized commerce. Dubbed as the “Amazon of Web3,” Web3Bay blends blockchain’s transparency with marketplace convenience. Unlike traditional platforms, it removes middlemen, reducing fees and offering direct rewards to users. Buyers and sellers both benefit from enhanced margins and fairer transactions. Web3Bay’s ongoing presale gives early participants the chance to lock in their stake at a low entry point. For those exploring practical crypto applications, Web3Bay could reshape the future of online commerce. Web3Bay: The Amazon of Web3 Explained Web3Bay: A Peer-to-Peer Marketplace with Blockchain Benefits Web3Bay is gaining recognition as a decentralized marketplace that prioritizes user benefits, earning the nickname “Amazon of Web3.” By combining blockchain’s transparency with the ease of a marketplace, it addresses key user needs like lower fees, better transparency, and direct buyer-seller rewards. Unlike Amazon, Web3Bay removes middlemen, offering a peer-to-peer system that ensures users benefit more directly. This distinct approach places it among the top underrated cryptos to keep an eye on today. The ongoing presale is gaining traction, allowing early supporters to purchase 3BAY tokens at $0.0039675 during stage three. With more than $580,000 raised so far, interest in the presale continues to rise. The tiered model pushes token prices up by 15% with each stage, offering early participants a projected ROI of over 6,430%. This growth pattern mirrors Amazon’s early phase, where initial supporters reaped massive rewards. Web3Bay stands out for its user-centric model. It enhances seller margins, rewards buyers, and uses blockchain to ensure transparency. Future updates like staking and cross-chain compatibility aim to strengthen the platform’s longevity. For those interested in cryptos with real-world use cases, Web3Bay could be one of the most promising opportunities heading into 2025. Sui All-Time High: What’s Driving Its Record Price? Sui’s price recently hit an all-time high of $5.36, marking a significant milestone for this Layer 1 blockchain. Designed for high scalability and fast transactions, Sui has gained popularity among developers and users in decentralized finance (DeFi). The project’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has now surpassed $1.85 billion, showing strong user confidence. Strategic partnerships, like its collaboration with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, and plans to integrate AI for security improvements have driven this growth. Despite setbacks like the November 2024 network outage, Sui’s ability to bounce back highlights its potential. As more dApps join the Sui ecosystem, its all-time high reinforces the blockchain’s status as a key player in the crypto market. Sei Price Updates: Why Sei’s Resilience Stands Out Sei continues to attract attention with its stable price, currently trading at $0.38874. This Layer 1 blockchain focuses on supporting decentralized exchanges (DEXs), with a transaction finality time of just 380 milliseconds. Its speed and efficiency set Sei apart from other blockchains. Recent announcements about Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility through the upcoming v2 upgrade have further boosted interest. Once launched, this upgrade will make smart contract deployment easier and attract Ethereum developers to the Sei platform. Combined with a growing ecosystem that includes projects like DragonSwap and Pallet Exchange, Sei remains a strong choice in the DeFi space. Top Underrated Cryptos to Watch Now Sui’s all-time high of $5.36 and Sei’s steady performance at $0.38874 highlight their growth in the crypto sector. Sui’s focus on scalable DeFi solutions and Sei’s efficiency improvements through EVM compatibility make them both noteworthy. However, Web3Bay’s rise as a decentralized marketplace offers something different. Dubbed the “Amazon of Web3,” it focuses on real-world use cases in e-commerce. With its 3BAY presale gaining momentum and over $580,000 already raised, early backers have a chance to benefit from its future success.

According to DefiLlama, the figures recorded at the end of December reveal a potential initial trend in the metrics rise in 2025. The monthly crypto funding has begun to rise after nearly two years of consolidation. Data from DeFiLlama, a decentralized finance data aggregating website, shows that the monthly crypto funding recorded in December has broken through a two-year consolidation. The sudden increase in crypto funding towards the end of 2024 could potentially mark the beginning of a successive trend moving into 2025. Monthly crypto funding from private investors begins to rise Monthly crypto funding is finally going up! It’s still far below 2021 levels, but the recent increase shows private investors are putting more money into the market again. pic.twitter.com/VVBlZqVeVh — Satoshi Club (@esatoshiclub) January 10, 2025 The levels recorded in December are close to $2 billion, the highest since the end of 2022. The monthly crypto funding peaked towards the end of 2021 at just above $7 billion after a successively increasing trend that began at the end of 2020. The current figures are still far below 2021’s peak figures. However, the trend shows private investors are actively investing in the market once again. Last year, a report compiled by law firm Barnes & Thornburg revealed that 59% of U.S. private investors are more likely to explore investment opportunities in crypto funds from 2024 to 2025. The survey also revealed that 84% of participants were convinced that private investment in the digital asset arena would rise in the next twelve months until August 2025. The survey interviewed 138 limited partners, general partners, and service providers in various institutions across different industries. A separate survey conducted by Bank of America at the beginning of 2024 in partnership with research firm Escalent unveiled new findings about private investments in the crypto sector. The survey revealed that younger wealthy generations are increasingly looking beyond the traditional stock and bond markets to build their wealth. Investors are driving demand for investment vehicles such as digital assets and gold. The report highlighted that those between the ages of 21 and 43 had the majority of their wealth in real estate and digital assets, accounting for 31% and 28%, respectively. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. These investment vehicles have paved the way for fresh capital from private investment. According to U.S. spot ETF tracker Sosovalue, American-approved spot Bitcoin ETFs managed $106.82 billion at the time of this publication. The ETFs gained massive popularity after pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump emerged victorious in the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, bringing a wave of optimism to the sector. Bitcoin emerges as a strategic reserve asset for institutions and governments Bitcoin, an asset that was closely associated with criminal activities during its early stages of development, is now bearing a hallmark of institutional and potentially government acceptance. Institutional investors, including private equity firms, family offices, hedge funds, traditional money managers, and publicly traded companies, have begun to divert their surplus cash to Bitcoin in a bid to diversify their portfolios and maximize their returns. So far, several publicly traded companies have joined the bandwagon by directing part of their surplus cash in Bitcoin and Bitcoin investment funds in a bid to increase shareholders’ value and overcome inflation. At the time of this publication, data from Bitcoin treasuries shows that Microstrategy is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world, with 447,470 Bitcoin worth $42.56 billion at Bitcoin’s current price of $95,112. In November last year, advanced battery materials provider Solidion Technology announced it had adopted Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and would allocate a significant portion of its excess cash reserves to purchase the asset. The company stated in a press release that it would commit 60% of excess cash from operations to purchasing Bitcoin. The company also announced that it will convert interest earnings in cash held in money market accounts to Bitcoin. Solidion pledged to undertake future capital raises and use the funds to increase its Bitcoin holdings, a playbook mimicking Michael Saylor’s strategy. Governments are also exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset after President-elect Donald Trump promised to adopt it for the U.S. Treasury.

De prijs staat nu op $0,9352 en nadert kritieke support. Handelaren maken zich zorgen over de toenemende verkoopdruk en mogelijke verdere dalingen. In dit artikel gaan we dieper in op de impact van deze whale-sell-off en de koersverwachting van Cardano . Whale verkoopt 70 miljoen ADA Donderdag, 9 januari 2024, heeft een prominente crypto-expert op X (voorheen Twitter) gepost dat crypto whales maar liefst 70 miljoen ADA-tokens hebben gedumpt. De post op X vermeldde ook dat deze enorme dump zich de afgelopen 48 uur heeft voltrokken, wat erop wijst dat de markt crash is begonnen. De impact van deze grote dump is echter al zichtbaar in de ADA-prijs, die sinds het begin van de verkoop met meer dan 20% is gedaald. Op het moment van schrijven werd ADA verhandeld op $0,9352, een daling van 14% in de afgelopen week. Met toenemende onzekerheid onder handelaren rijst de vraag of Cardano het tij kan keren of dat verdere verliezen onvermijdelijk zijn. Impact van de sell-off op Cardano De whale-activiteit heeft geleid tot een scherpe daling van de ADA-prijs, die nu kritieke support nadert. De sterke verkoopdruk heeft de marktkapitalisatie van ADA teruggebracht tot $32,87 miljard, een daling van 6,08%, wat de omvang van de marktreactie weerspiegelt. Daarnaast is de Stock-to-Flow-ratio gedaald van 291,37 naar 288,50, wat wijst op afnemend vertrouwen van investeerders, terwijl schaarste- en vraagstatistieken lager uitvallen. ADA Stock-to-Flow Ratio Bron: Santiment Ook de derivatenmarkt toont significante bearish signalen. Op Binance daalde de Funding Rate van 0,01% naar 0,0055%, wat wijst op een afname van bullish sentiment onder traders met hefboomposities. Op de DYDX-exchange daalden de Funding Rates eveneens, van 0,000334 naar 0,000057, wat de afname in markt optimisme verder benadrukt. Deze ontwikkelingen suggereren dat handelaren hun posities aanpassen aan de verhoogde volatiliteit en neerwaartse risico’s. De MVRV ratio, een maatstaf voor winstgevendheid onder houders, is gedaald van 0,92 naar 0,769. Dit geeft aan dat ADA-houders grotere verliezen ervaren naarmate de prijs blijft dalen. MVRV ratio. Bron: Santiment Deze gecombineerde metrics tonen de impact van de whale-sell-off, die handelaren en investeerders met weinig vertrouwen in ADA’s prestaties op korte termijn heeft achtergelaten. Kan Cardano herstellen? Ondanks het bearish vooruitzicht zou ADA steun kunnen vinden bij de kritieke support van $0,8335, wat een technische rebound kan triggeren. Hiervoor moeten bulls echter de verkoopdruk opvangen en vertrouwen herstellen. Als deze support niet standhoudt, loopt ADA het risico verder te dalen, wat de verliezen voor investeerders zou kunnen verergeren. Cardano koers. Bron: TradingView In conclusie hangt het herstel van Cardano sterk af van het stoppen van de verkoopactiviteit door whales en de terugkeer van kopers naar de markt. Als ADA de kritieke support vasthoudt, is een rebound mogelijk. Gezien de huidige metrics die wijzen op bearish momentum, lijkt een snel herstel op korte termijn echter uitdagend. Veelbelovende crypto’s die Cardano kunnen overtreffen Gezien het bearish vooruitzicht voor Cardano is het verstandig om alternatieve crypto te ontdekken die er beter bij liggen.

BTC, which rose above $100,000 a few days ago but could not hold on there, started to decline again and dropped to $91,000 levels. Bitcoin, which experienced a historic moment after this decline, has burned green candles 14 times in a row on an hourly basis since 2017. These hourly candles appeared as the BTC price rose from $91,771 to $95,283. Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, explained the last time this happened in a post on his X account. Lunde said that Bitcoin burned the most candles on an hourly basis today since January 1, 2017. Lunde said that although Bitcoin has been creating an hourly green candle series since January 2027, this series has had a maximum of 11 green candles. At this point, although Bitcoin has burned more than 10 green candles on an hourly basis many times in a row in the past years, the number of candles has never reached 14. Although it is stated that these green candles in Bitcoin show that buyers are more dominant than sellers, the green candles on the Bitcoin chart were replaced by red candles with the US labor market data announced a few hours ago. Bitcoin continues to trade at $93,770 at the time of writing. https://twitter.com/VetleLunde/status/1877660468552098147 *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Surprising Move from Bitcoin!

Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik had been arrested last month, and they face money laundering charges. A third person tied to the services' operations, Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, is at-large, the DOJ said. Authorities from multiple jurisdictions had already seized and dismantled the computer equipment behind the services. Blender.io had previously been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for aiding in the concealment of the crypto proceeds of cyber thefts conducted by North Korean hackers. That move marked the Treasury's first sanctions against a crypto mixer , which is a service that aims to anonymize transactions and erase the public trail of digital assets. ""According to the indictment, the defendants operated cryptocurrency ‘mixers’ that served as safe havens for laundering criminally derived funds, including the proceeds of ransomware and wire fraud,"" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent S. Wible, the DOJ's criminal division chief, in a statement. ""By allegedly operating these mixers, the defendants made it easier for state-sponsored hacking groups and other cybercriminals to profit from offenses that jeopardized both public safety and national security."" Read More: Crypto Mixer Sanctioned by U.S. Treasury for North Korea Allegations, as FBI, Dutch and Finnish Police Seize Website The prosecution of crypto mixing services – the controversial businesses that represent both the sector's vulnerability to criminal use and its championing of financial privacy – has been a point of contention for U.S. policymakers and members of Congress. In the most famous case, the pursuit of Tornado Cash, the Treasury's sanctions were overturned in November by a federal appeals court, ruling that the technology underpinning such services can't be targeted this way. However, the government is still pursuing criminal prosecutions of Tornado Cash's founders. Blender.io operated from 2018 to 2022 before it was taken down by authorities, to be quickly replaced by Sinbad.io , which drew similar sanctions from the Treasury Department.",Policy|mixing services|blender.io|Tornado Cash|Department of Justice|Criminal Activities,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-10 17:25:47

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 17:27:00

With projects constantly evolving and new innovations reshaping the landscape, knowing which coins to keep an eye on can be a game-changer. This weekend, three names stand out: Qubetics ($TICS), Gala, and Injective. Each of these projects is making waves in its own way, but Qubetics is leading the charge with what’s being hailed as the best crypto presale of 2025. Let’s dive into why these three are the ones to watch. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain with Real-World Applications Latest Developments: The Best Crypto Presale 2025 Qubetics is shaking up the crypto world, and its presale is nothing short of phenomenal.

At just $0.0455 per token, the presale offers a rare opportunity for early adopters to get in before the price soars. Analysts are predicting significant returns for $TICS holders. At the presale’s end, the token is expected to reach $0.25, delivering a whopping 448% ROI. But that’s just the beginning. Post-presale, projections suggest $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. The potential for up to 32,816% ROI is turning heads and making Qubetics a standout in the best crypto presale 2025. Real-World Asset Tokenization: The Game Changer One of Qubetics ’ flagship features is its focus on real-world asset tokenization . Imagine owning a fraction of a luxury condo in Miami or investing in a fleet of commercial trucks without the hassle of traditional ownership. With Qubetics, assets like real estate, vehicles, and even art can be tokenized and traded on the blockchain. This opens up investment opportunities to a broader audience, breaking down barriers that have traditionally kept wealth generation out of reach for many. For instance, a small business owner in Chicago might use Qubetics to tokenize their equipment, securing capital without taking on debt. Meanwhile, a family in New York could invest in tokenized real estate, earning passive income without the headache of property management. The possibilities are endless, and Qubetics is making them a reality. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Qubetics isn’t just another presale; it’s a revolution.

The United States Oval Office rolled out a package of measures aimed squarely at crippling Russia’s ability to fund its war in Ukraine. Treasury officials labeled these actions the “most aggressive” since the start of the invasion, with over 180 tankers blacklisted, along with Russian oil giants Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. For years, President Biden has avoided a full-on assault on Russia’s energy exports, fearing global oil prices would skyrocket and leave Americans footing an even higher gas bill. But with inflation cooling off and global oil supplies looking healthier, the administration decided to hit Putin where it hurts most: his oil profits. The crackdown on Russia’s shadow fleet If there’s one thing Putin’s Russia knows how to do, it’s evade sanctions. Enter the shadow fleet—a murky network of aging oil tankers, often flagged in obscure countries, designed to smuggle Russian crude around the world while thumbing its nose at Western sanctions. For the Kremlin, this clandestine fleet has been a lifeline, hauling oil to markets like China and India despite global restrictions. Now, America’s Treasury Department has made it clear this party is over. To make life even harder for Putin, the sanctions also hit liquefied natural gas projects and key players in the Russian energy ecosystem, from engineers to financiers. Oil prices, global markets, and the next administration’s headache The effect of Biden’s sanctions was felt almost immediately. Oil prices spiked on Friday as markets braced for potential supply disruptions. Combine that with extreme weather in the U.S. and ongoing wildfires in California, and it’s easy to see why traders were sweating bullets. Yet Biden’s team insists that the global oil market is stable enough to weather the storm. The timing of these sanctions is amusing for another reason though. See, these guys are about to hand the baton to the Trump administration, and they know that this would likely strain his and Putin’s relationship some more and make it hard for them to get along as they want. When the war started in February 2022, economists predicted a total collapse of the Russian economy. That didn’t happen. High oil prices and crafty trade deals with countries like India and China have kept Russia’s coffers filled, at least for now. But Biden’s new sanctions go deeper than previous attempts. For Putin, this is literally billions in lost revenue every single month. Russia’s economic reality Russia’s economy has taken a beating since the war began. Back in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted an 8.5% drop in Russia’s GDP. But by the end of the year, the actual decline was a modest 2.1%. Why? Because sky-high energy prices cushioned the blow. Fast-forward to 2023, and Russia even managed to post a 2.2% growth rate. Sounds impressive until you dig deeper. That growth came from selling oil and gas at discounts to non-Western markets like China and India. Meanwhile, sectors like technology and defense were in shambles, and long-term investments dried up faster than a puddle in the Sahara. By 2024, cracks in the foundation were impossible to ignore. Inflation soared to 15%, and the ruble nosedived against major currencies. Businesses were struggling, with over 200 shopping centers on the brink of bankruptcy. Freight haulers, who move goods across what’s the largest country on earth, warned of insolvency. The U.S. Treasury estimated that sanctions had shaved 5% off Russia’s potential GDP growth. For ordinary Russians, the pain is real. Consumer prices are through the roof, wages are stagnant, and job prospects are grim. Over a million people—many of them young professionals—have fled the country since the war began. Business elites are fed up with policies that prioritize military spending over profitability. Kremlin insiders are reportedly grumbling about the unsustainable costs of the war. Even loyalists are beginning to question Putin’s long-term strategy. Meanwhile, the population is growing restless. Years of economic stagnation, coupled with rising prices, have taken their toll. Public discontent is bubbling under the surface, and it’s only a matter of time before it boils over.

The decision, communicated via an official announcement, highlights concerns over SOLVE’s business practices, including deficiencies in its distribution plan, changes in business strategy, and overall operational transparency. SOLVE is designated as a “cautionary item” for a two-week review period. Upbit will evaluate whether to extend the designation, lift it, or terminate trading support during that time. 솔브케어(SOLVE) 거래 유의 종목 지정 안내 솔브케어(SOLVE)가 거래 유의 종목으로 지정되었으며, 이에 따라 입금 서비스가 일시 중단됩니다.

Discover more: https://t.co/0HnqXY1arg — Upbit Korea (@Official_Upbit) January 10, 2025 Upbit Suspends SOLVE: What’s Happening? Upbit’s announcement detailed several factors that led to SOLVE’s designation as a cautionary item. According to the exchange, a comprehensive review revealed significant deficiencies in several key areas. Upbit expressed concerns over inconsistencies and a lack of transparency in the token’s issuance and distribution strategy, which could mislead investors about its true supply dynamics. The exchange also flagged changes in SOLVE’s business direction, questioning the extent and procedural transparency of these modifications. Additionally, SOLVE’s lack of clarity and rationality in its operational procedures raised alarms about the token’s sustainability and potential risks to investors. The announcement emphasized that these issues could harm users, prompting Upbit to suspend deposits and issue an investment warning. The designation period runs from January 10 to January 24, 2025. During this time, the exchange will decide on the token’s future trading support based on its “Digital Asset Trading Support Termination Policy.” Implications for South Korean Investors Amid Growing Intrest In Crypto The suspension has significant implications for both SOLVE investors and the broader cryptocurrency market in South Korea. Investors holding SOLVE face uncertainty as they await Upbit’s final decision. Deposits for the token have been blocked, and any transactions attempted during the suspension period will be returned or subject to delays. Upbit has warned users against depositing SOLVE to avoid irreversible losses. Upbit’s actions align with the country’s evolving regulatory landscape, particularly the Virtual Asset User Protection Act, which aims to ensure transparency and mitigate risks in the crypto space. This new development comes as South Korea prepares to redraw the regulations for the crypto market. For instance, a report on Jan 9 shows that South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is exploring a gradual approach to allowing corporations to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin . While no legal barriers currently prevent such actions, banks have been directed to reject corporate crypto account requests. The FSC plans to work with the Virtual Asset Committee to establish listing and delisting standards for altcoins, introduce regulations for stablecoins, and improve self-regulation. However, critics argue for more streamlined policies addressing unresolved issues like crypto taxation and approving Bitcoin spot ETFs. The FSC has also acknowledged the need for enhanced investigative tools and forensic protocols to tackle unfair practices and monitor the market properly. This is particularly important now as South Korea’s cryptocurrency investors recently surpassed 15 million in November 2024 . According to official data from the Bank of Korea, over 30% of South Korea’s population now uses cryptocurrency. Total market valuation doubled from 58 trillion won in October 2024 to 102.6 trillion won in November, and average individual holdings rose from 3.87 million won to 6.58 million won. The increased activity is also reflected in the soaring daily trading volume, which reached $10.2 billion in November, surpassing the combined activity of the KOSPI and KOSDAQ stock markets. Deposits in crypto exchanges doubled to 8.8 trillion won during the same period.

Keith Ammon could allow New Hampshire’s treasury to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The Republican Representative Keith Ammon proposed legislation that would establish a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve for the state, enabling the state’s treasury to custody BTC alongside traditional assets like gold, silver, and platinum. Rep. Ammon’s bill includes “secure custody solutions” to safeguard New Hampshire’s potential BTC stash. Even states now need a crypto wallet as adoption skyrockets. If passed, New Hampshire could become a leader in the push for state-controlled Bitcoin reserves. However, it faces stiff competition from other states considering similar measures.

What are these bills? As previously reported, Texas, Ohio, and some 10 other U.S. states considered BTC treasury legislation. Lawmakers like Cynthia Lummis also advocated for a BTC reserve at the federal level. The idea of a U.S.-based Bitcoin reserve gained momentum last year, driven in part by former President Donald Trump’s campaign to appeal to the crypto voting bloc. Trump pledged to make the U.S. a global leader in cryptocurrency and proposed building a Bitcoin stockpile from the government’s existing 207,000 BTC holdings. Now, less than two weeks into 2025, predictions that more jurisdictions would move to adopt Bitcoin reserves are starting to materialize. In addition to U.S. states, countries like Brazil and Poland have also begun exploring the concept of holding Bitcoin in their national treasuries.

Image source: TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00001681, beginning a bearish trend to $0.0000143. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2024 could potentially propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price has been declining for over the last few hours as it gained intense selling pressure. The price is aiming for a hold below the $0.00002 mark. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Is Pepe a good long-term investment? If Pepe price continues to attract investor interest and lead the meme coin market in the future, we might see a strong long-term future for Pepe coin. Recent news Tech billionaire Elon Musk stirred online buzz by renaming his X (formerly Twitter) profile to ‘Kekius Maximus’ and changing his profile picture to the ‘Pepe the Frog’ meme. PEPE Price Prediction January 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000015 and $0.000028, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000017. January Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) January 2025 0.000015 0.000017 0.000028 Pepe price prediction 2025 The roadmap for Pepe is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. This lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential, despite its robust community. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000024. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses. According to predictions and technical analysis, Pepe could achieve a minimum price of $0.0048 in 2026. The price may rise to a maximum of $0.0058, with an average expected trading price of $0.0050.

Pepe price prediction 2030 Drawing from deep technical analysis of past PEPE data, the price in 2030 is projected to have a minimum value of $0.0204.

Another prominent event in 2024 could similarly propel Pepe to unprecedented levels. Cryptopolitan predicts that Pepe’s lowest price in 2025 will be $0.000024.

Pepe historic price sentiment Initial Market Entry and Early Fluctuations: PEPE was introduced to the open market in May 2023, starting at $0.000001514. It experienced a peak at $0.000008117 in July 2023, followed by a dip to $0.0000006105 shortly after. End of 2023 and Trends in 2024: By the close of 2023, the price of PEPE stabilized at $0.000001335. However, 2024 began with a downward trend, with the price dropping to $0.00001237 by mid-February. Record High in March 2024: Amidst a surge in the memecoin sector, PEPE reached a new all-time high of $0.00001074 on March 14, 2024, but slightly decreased to $0.0000083 by March 21, 2024. In May, the price of Pepe surged exponentially, and a new ATH was formed each week. On 27 May, Pepe price reached a new ATH at $0.00001718. However, the price heavily declined in June as it broke below the crucial level of $0.00001. In July, though the Pepe price touched $0.000012, it failed to maintain its momentum and dropped toward $0.0000093. In August, Pepe’s price dropped toward the $0.0000058 level. However, it is now recovering slightly. In September, the price of Pepe witnessed extreme fluctuation; however, it ended the month on a bullish note as it hit $0.000012. Pepe price experienced an Uptober rally later as it surged toward the high of $0.000012 in October. However, the price is now declining below support channels. In November, the price of Pepe skyrocketed above $0.000026. In December, Pepe consolidated below $0.00002.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-10 17:48:10

Grayscale’s low-cost ETF, BTC, launched in August 2024, temporarily reduced GBTC’s AUM by transferring 10% of its assets. AUM are now back to where they were in January 2024. IBIT remains my top choice for Bitcoin exposure due to its low fees, strong liquidity, and growing AUM driven by BlackRock’s marketing efforts. I recommend to HOLD GBTC only for short-term plans. Long-term investors should choose IBIT for better performance and lower costs. It’s been almost a full year since the Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) was converted to an exchange-traded fund. In this article, I will evaluate GBTC to determine whether it is an efficient vehicle for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure in their portfolios. Along with examining the ETF's technical details, I will analyze its Assets Under Management ((AUM)) trends over the past year and cover this ETFs’s unique history. This article is part of my “Bitcoin ETFs Showdown” series, where I analyze several Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETFs and compare them to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). This series does not have the objective to discuss whether entering a trade in Bitcoin is a good idea at current prices. Rather, it focuses on analyzing Bitcoin ETFs for investors who are interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Investors who are not familiar with Bitcoin should first do their own research and understand whether investing in this cryptocurrency is for them. Readers can find my thoughts about Bitcoin as an asset class on my profile . GBTC: ETF profile and AUM evolution The GBTC ETF has the following key metrics at the time of writing: Yearly Expense Ratio of 1.50% Assets Under Management of $ 19.2 Billion - making it the third largest Bitcoin ETFs at the time of writing, behind IBIT and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) Average Bid/Ask Spread of 0.02% Average Daily Volume of $ 210 Million The fund uses Coinbase as a custodian for its Bitcoin, exactly like IBIT and other major Bitcoin ETFs (with the notable exception of FBTC ) GBTC’s biggest issue in my opinion is its uncompetitive expense ratio, which is a legacy from before its conversion to an ETF in January 2024 — a topic I’ll explore further later in this article. In my view, this high expense ratio has been the primary driver of outflows the fund experienced in its first few months as an ETF, as investors gained access to more efficient, low-cost Bitcoin ETF alternatives. GBTC, IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs - Key Metrics (Author's work based on Seeking Alpha data) The table above compares GBTC with other major Bitcoin ETFs I covered in this “Bitcoin ETFs Showdown” series. While GBTC experienced significant outflows in its early months, its AUM has actually grown over the past four months, increasing by approximately 33%. As a result, GBTC’s current AUM is nearly identical to its level at the time of its ETF conversion in January 2024 . I find this dynamic interesting, as this is the first time I have noticed GBTC AUM growing since I started covering this ETF in May 2024. I attribute this growth over the past four months to two factors. First, Grayscale's launch of the low-cost Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ) in August, which was funded by transferring 10% of GBTC’s assets. This transfer temporarily “suppressed” GBTC’s AUM figures in August. Second, retail investor euphoria fueled by Bitcoin's bullish rally from early November through late 2024 contributed significantly to the recovery in AUM. I will continue monitoring GBTC’s AUM trends in the coming months, as I see them as a key indicator of retail investors’ interest in Bitcoin as an asset class. The recent Bitcoin bull run was enough to reverse GBTC’s AUM decline, despite its uncompetitive expense ratio. It will be interesting to see if a potential Bitcoin bear market triggers disproportionately higher outflows from GBTC compared to other Bitcoin funds. Another metric that I believe is worth calling out from the above table is the Average Daily Volume. This has been dropping consistently in the past 3 months, with GBTC registering a decrease of almost -80% in volumes. While volumes remain sizable in absolute terms, at above $ 200 Million, they are now significantly less than the almost $ 1 Billion this ETF was registering in August 2024. In my view, this trend suggests that active traders are shifting from GBTC to BlackRock’s IBIT ETF for Bitcoin trading . Notably, IBIT is the only Bitcoin ETF to report an increase in Average Daily Volume, rising nearly 30% between August and December 2024. Overall, despite AUM growth over the past four months, GBTC has fallen from the largest Bitcoin ETF by AUM in January 2024 to third place as of now. Additionally, the sharp decline in its average daily volume could eventually impact its liquidity, particularly in terms of the bid/ask spread. GBTC: A brief history of Bitcoin’s first fund and what’s next Launched in 2013, GBTC was one of the first global investment funds dedicated to Bitcoin. As such, it served as one of the the primary ways for investors to access Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts for years. GBTC has historically almost always traded at a discount against its Bitcoin holdings, given regulatory uncertainty about Bitcoin that made it uncertain whether investors would be able to eventually cash in the Bitcoin held by the fund. Only in January 2024, more than 10 years after its launch, the GBTC fund was converted into an ETF and its discount against Bitcoin holdings went to zero. Charging a 1.50% annual fee made sense, in my opinion, before Bitcoin ETFs existed. At the time, investors had few alternatives beyond cryptocurrency exchanges, and GBTC was a truly unique product. However, after Bitcoin ETFs were approved in early 2024, this expense ratio became very uncompetitive, as it is more than five times higher than what direct competitors charge and even exceeds the fees of most leveraged Bitcoin funds. Grayscale chose not to change their expense ratio to match that of other Bitcoin ETFs, even after seeing significant outflows from GBTC. So far, the strategy appears to have worked for Grayscale: GBTC generated approximately $285 million in fees during its first year as an ETF (1.50% of $19 billion). Had the fund reduced its annual expense ratio from 1.50% to 0.25% (matching that of IBIT), its AUM would have needed to grow to $114 billion to match this revenue. With the combined AUM of the top three Bitcoin ETFs currently around $90 billion, it seems highly unlikely that Grayscale would have benefited from such a move. From the perspective of investors, though, things are different. I see virtually no reason to choose GBTC to get exposure to Bitcoin - something I will cover later in the article. BTC: Grayscale’s low cost Bitcoin ETF Grayscale recently launched the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF, a low-cost Bitcoin ETF that began trading in August 2024. The Mini Trust was funded by transferring 10% of GBTC’s assets , resulting in a distribution of Mini Trust shares to existing GBTC shareholders. This fund has a 0.15% expense ratio, making it the least expensive Bitcoin ETF available today in the market in terms of fees. However, given its limited size, BTC has a spread of 0.05% at the time of writing - which is more than double that of GBTC or IBIT. In my view, Grayscale’s decision to launch the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF ( BTC ) reflects a clear strategy: acknowledging GBTC's uncompetitive expense ratio while avoiding a reduction in the lucrative fees it generates. Instead, Grayscale has opted to introduce a lower-cost alternative. Considering the recent launch of BTC and the significant inflows GBTC experienced during the last Bitcoin bull run despite its high fees, it seems highly unlikely that Grayscale will lower GBTC’s expense ratio. For now, maintaining this revenue stream appears sustainable and strategically sensible for Grayscale. Why IBIT remains my preferred choice over GBTC (and BTC) IBIT vs. GBTC, past 1 year performance (Seeking Alpha) In my first article about GBTC, I highlighted how its uncompetitive expense ratio would likely hinder its long-term performance in favor of competitors like BlackRock’s IBIT. This prediction has played out, with IBIT now the largest Bitcoin ETF and more than twice the AUM of GBTC. More importantly from the perspective of investors, GBTC has lagged behind IBIT in terms of performance for the last year, as shown by the above chart. IBIT vs. GBTC, qualitative assessment (Author's work) The table above provides a qualitative summary of IBIT and GBTC as Bitcoin ETFs. My top choice for Bitcoin exposure today remains the IBIT ETF. It offers a competitive expense ratio and strong liquidity. Most importantly, IBIT has benefited from a virtuous cycle in the past few months: as one of the most liquid Bitcoin ETFs, backed by BlackRock’s robust marketing efforts, it continues to attract more investors. This inflow drives AUM growth and further enhances its liquidity metrics. I see the gap between IBIT and other ETFs, including GBTC, only widening in time. For investors currently holding GBTC, it may make sense to stick with this fund if they have a short- or medium-term exit strategy for their Bitcoin position. As a result, I maintain a HOLD rating for GBTC. For long-term Bitcoin holders, however, I recommend buying IBIT or switching to IBIT if they already hold GBTC as I do not see likely that Grayscale will ever reduce the fund’s expense ratio. I do not recommend switching to BTC either, despite its competitive expense ratio, as its bid/ask spread is more than double that of IBIT. Should the situation change - for instance, if Grayscale allocates more of GBTC’s assets to BTC - I would reconsider BTC as a more viable option. Conclusion The GBTC ETF has proven very lucrative for its issuer, generating more than $ 250 Million in fees for Grayscale during its first year existing as an ETF. However, due to its uncompetitive expense ratio - at 1.50% - I still cannot recommend this fund as an efficient way to get exposed to Bitcoin. Grayscale's launch of the low-cost ETF ""BTC"" suggests, in my view, that a reduction in GBTC's expense ratio is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Therefore, I recommend that investors looking for long-term Bitcoin exposure avoid GBTC. My HOLD rating applies only to investors already holding GBTC who intend to take profits in the short or medium term. Risks of investing in Bitcoin and GBTC Investing in Bitcoin remains a speculative bet on its potential to evolve into a global reserve asset. While I find this opportunity compelling, it represents the primary risk for investors considering GBTC or any Bitcoin ETF and requires careful consideration. Another key risk for Bitcoin ETFs is their reliance on custodians. Funds like GBTC entrust custodians such as Coinbase to safeguard their Bitcoin holdings. Any fraudulent activity or security breach by the custodian could result in substantial losses for investors. GBTC's dependence on a single custodian further amplifies this risk. For GBTC as a Bitcoin ETF, an additional risk lies in its high expense ratio, which will inevitably lead to underperformance compared to lower-cost Bitcoin ETFs. Furthermore, if GBTC experiences further outflows, its bid/ask spread could widen, potentially causing losses for investors looking to exit their positions in the future.",IBIT|FBTC|BTC|GBTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-10 17:48:27

""The emergence and growth of Virtual Assets (VAs) and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) have given rise to innovations in the local and international financial system with dynamic opportunities and challenges,"" Mbadi said according to local news outlet The Standard . Mbadi stressed a need for a regulatory framework to both capitalize on the potential benefits of the industry while mitigating the risks posed by money laundering, terrorism financing and fraud. “The Government of Kenya is committed to creating the necessary legal and regulatory framework in order to leverage opportunities presented by VAs and VASPs while managing the reluctant risks,” Mbadi said. Kenya launched a draft policy on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers in December. The draft policy aims to establish a “fair, competitive and stable market” for cryptocurrency industry players and foster innovation and financial literacy, Mbadi said. Kenya has historically kept a cautious stance toward the cryptocurrency industry. In December 2015 the country’s central bank issued a public notice warning against cryptocurrency use, stating that these assets weren’t legal tender in the country and no entity was licensed to offer money remittance services using crypto in Kenya. Fast forward to 2022 and lawmakers in the country started weighing on whether to move ahead with a law to tax crypto as the industry kept on growing in the country.

Hayes' prediction is based on a shift toward aggressive monetary policies and a broader wave of global money printing under the expected presidency of Donald Trump. Speaking as chief investment officer of the Maelstrom Fund, Hayes outlined a scenario in which nationalist economic policies lead governments around the world to prioritize the economic stability of their citizens. “Every country will put its citizens first and print money to smooth out the volatility,” Hayes said. According to Hayes, this increase in money supply will trigger a chain reaction of devaluation, prompting investors to seek alternatives such as gold and cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of the year,” he predicted. Hayes is among a growing number of analysts who predict that Donald Trump’s return to the presidency could create a crypto-friendly environment. Trump has signaled plans to implement policies favorable to digital assets that many believe could significantly boost the industry. Related News: How Many Interest Rate Cuts Will the Fed Make This Year? Analyst Answered - “But Pay Attention to the Date...” According to Hayes, Trump will adopt a more aggressive monetary policy than other world leaders, including deliberately devaluing the US dollar against gold. “Trump will massively devalue the dollar against gold,” Hayes said. That forecast contrasts with the dollar’s current strength, which rose to a two-year high after Trump’s election, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish move to keep interest rates higher to curb inflation. Bitcoin traditionally thrives in environments where the dollar is weaker as investors look for alternative stores of value, but Hayes noted an unusual dynamic where both assets are surging at the same time. Hayes also shared his 2025 Bitcoin trading roadmap. In his latest blog post, he told investors to sell Bitcoin in the final stages of the first quarter and wait for “favorable fiat liquidity conditions” to return in the third quarter. He expects these conditions to occur as the U.S. Treasury borrows more capital to fund government operations, a scenario that typically aligns with rising Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices. *This is not investment advice.

The popular commentator suggested that BTC has yet to reach its full potential and that more price rallies lie ahead for the the flagship crypto. Specifically, Peterson says the Bitcoin is headed to seven figures within the next decade. BTC To Hit $1.5 Million By 2035 In a Jan. 8 post on X (aka Twitter), Timothy Peterson, the famous author of the paper “Metcalfe’s Law as a Model for Bitcoin’s Value, predicted that Bitcoin would hit an eye-popping $1.5 million within 10 years. To arrive at $1.5m, Peterson cites his own model, which puts network growth at the center of BTC’s future value proposition. “The year is 2035. Bitcoin is at — and you can hold me to this — $1.5 million,” Peterson posited. “And somewhere someone is asking ‘Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin?’” Peterson is a prominent Bitcoin uberbull, indicating in his 2018 paper on Metcalfe’s Law that widespread global Bitcoin propagation was just a matter of time. “Traditional currency models fail with bitcoin, but various mathematical laws which explain network connectivity offer compelling explanation of its value,” the paper explained. In 2020, Peterson’s Lowest Price Forward (LPF) metric accurately forecasted that BTC would never cost less than $10,000 again. Last year, the pundit timed the local BTC price bottom to just over a week when it hit in September. Meanwhile, Peterson shared his expectations for future BTC price action in another X post on Jan. 2 saying, “nothing special.” “In fact, it was the second-worst ‘Up’ quarter out of the past 10,” Peterson observed . Huge Bitcoin Bounce Imminent? Peterson’s $1.5 million Bitcoin prediction comes following a historic Q4 2024 rally spurred by Donald Trump’s November election victory and the hope of a much more favorable regulatory landscape for crypto out of Washington D.C. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin is currently languishing below the symbolic $100,000 threshold following a macro-spurred market rout. However, we could potentially see a change in market fortunes by the end of this month after the swearing-in of pro-crypto President Trump on Jan. 20. The largest crypto slipped to a session low of $91,250 on Thursday, losing about 9% in two days from its Jan. 7 peak above $102,200. BTC has recouped some of its losses and recently traded at $94,390, still down 2.2% over the past seven days. That being said, the coming weeks could be key in determining whether Bitcoin continues its steady climb as Trump’s inauguration fuels optimism.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-10 17:58:32

While SHIB has made significant strides as a meme coin, its price potential is inherently limited. In contrast, Lightchain AI , an emerging blockchain project, offers a unique opportunity for investors to secure exponentially larger returns. Priced at $0.00525 in its presale and having raised over $10 million, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of those seeking high-growth alternatives. Why $1 Is Unrealistic for Shiba Inu Getting to a $1 cost for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is not likel͏y because of its huge amount of around 589 trillion tokens. To hit $1 would need a market worth of $589 trillion, which is way more than the whole world’s wealth, that was about $454 trillion at one point in 2024. Even with the token burn plans that try to cut down supply, the current burn pace is not enough to make a real change on price. At this speed; it would need more than 20,000 years to burn enough tokens for a $1 worth. So, even if SHIB might have price changes, the chance of it getting to $1 is very unlikely at this time. Lightchain AI Robust Alternative for Greater Returns Unlike Shiba Inu, Lightchain AI is not limited by an inflated token supply or speculative branding. The project is built with a capped total supply of 10 billion tokens, ensuring scarcity and driving demand as adoption increases. Lightchain AI integrates blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to deliver innovative solutions for real-world challenges, including data processing, AI computations, and decentralized applications. It incorporates off-chain systems such as IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave to securely store datasets and AI models, while the blockchain is utilized to manage metadata, cryptographic proofs, and access controls, ensuring traceability and data integrity. Projected Returns Shiba Inu vs. Lightchain AI While Shiba Inu may still deliver returns in the next bull run, its potential is limited compared to projects like Lightchain AI . Analysts predict that SHIB could see gains of 2x–5x in ideal market conditions. Lightchain AI, however, is poised for significantly larger growth due to its presale success, innovative technology, and scalable architecture. Early projections suggest Lightchain AI could achieve returns of 100x–400x as it gains adoption post-launch. Lightchain AI’s ability to address inefficiencies in traditional blockchain networks while catering to high-demand industries makes it a high-potential investment.

Projected Returns Shiba Inu vs. Lightchain AI While Shiba Inu may still deliver returns in the next bull run, its potential is limited compared to projects like Lightchain AI . Analysts predict that SHIB could see gains of 2x–5x in ideal market conditions. Lightchain AI, however, is poised for significantly larger growth due to its presale success, innovative technology, and scalable architecture. Early projections suggest Lightchain AI could achieve returns of 100x–400x as it gains adoption post-launch. Lightchain AI’s ability to address inefficiencies in traditional blockchain networks while catering to high-demand industries makes it a high-potential investment. Unlike SHIB, which relies heavily on market sentiment, Lightchain AI offers tangible utility, making it a standout choice for long-term investors. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While this decline has negatively impacted its short-term price, investors remain optimistic that Dogecoin will reach the anticipated $1 mark by summer once the market starts to recover. Here’s an analysis of how experts expect it to perform before the end of Q2. Dogecoin Slips: Is There More Downside In-Store? Meme coins are notoriously susceptible to volatility spikes, and even at $50+ billion in market cap, Dogecoin (DOGE) is no different. After a memorable triple-digit run in late 2024, Dogecoin rose from $0.10 to a local peak of $0.47 in a few weeks. After a rejection, Dogecoin entered a cool-off phase. However, the $0.30 mark always proved to be a rock-solid support level. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was selling for $0.34, following a 10% intraday decrease, for a cumulative monthly loss of 21%. As bulls and bears are battling in the order books, Dogecoin’s volume has jumped by 87%, with over $5.8 billion worth of DOGE traded across platforms in the last 24 hours. Analyst Trader Tardigrade has drawn a parallel between Dogecoin’s performance during previous cycles and its current chart formation. He points out that Dogecoin’s current action is reminiscent of its 2017 accumulation phase, which was followed by an explosive rally that saw the DOGE price conquer new heights. If history repeats itself, a Dogecoin breakout could soon take place and propel DOGE toward the $1 target in the upcoming months. How Remittix Could Revolutionize A $150 Trillion Market In 2017, global payments were estimated at around $150 trillion, with established entities like MoneyGram, Western Union, and Stripe dominating the market. However, none of these companies currently offer a comprehensive crypto-to-fiat payment solution.

In a statement released on January 8, the failed crypto firm clarified that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court has not approved the sale of FTX EU to Backpack, nor has it been authorized to manage fund distributions to creditors. Misleading Statement On January 7, global crypto-trading platform Backpack announced through social media that it had acquired FTX EU and would handle creditor repayments for European customers as part of a court-approved bankruptcy process. Further, founder Armani Ferrante emphasized that the firm was committed to working with all relevant parties to prioritize the return of customer funds in the bloc. With a presence in over 150 countries, the exchange also claimed that the acquisition had received approval from the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) with plans to expand through crypto derivative services such as spot, margin, and futures trading across the EU. However, FTX denied these claims, stating that Backpack’s press release and related website contained multiple potentially misleading information. It clarified that its subsidiary, FTX Europe AG, still holds 100% of the share capital of FTX EU. The company also said that although a prior agreement was made under court supervision to transfer FTX EU shares to former insiders of FTX Europe, this transfer has not yet occurred. It claimed that the indirect transfer of the former to Backpack, arranged by these insiders, was done without its knowledge or the court’s approval. Backpack Has No Role in Fund Redistribution Further, the statement stressed that Backpack has no authorization to make distributions to any creditors or customers, including former European clients. The defunct exchange reiterated that FTX EU itself remains solely responsible for returning funds to its customers. “FTX will not be responsible for the repayment of any funds owed by FTX EU to its former customers and expressly disclaims any responsibility for such repayment by FTX EU,” read the disclosure. It also explained that the amounts owed by its subsidiary to its customers have also not been determined by the relevant entities. In a related update, the outfit confirmed the effectiveness of its Chapter 11 plan of reorganization on January 3, 2025, with an initial distribution record date set for the same day. Pending regulatory compliance, distributions to convenience class claimants are expected within 60 days. Elsewhere, on January 2, another troubled crypto firm, Celsius, filed an appeal challenging a previous ruling that had dismissed its $444 million claim against FTX. The defunct crypto lender had claimed that FTX officials had undermined its reputation, making “unsubstantiated and disparaging statements” that contributed to its downfall in 2022, asking for up to $2 billion in damages.

According to newly disclosed court papers, a group of authors is alleging that the social media giant knew they were using pirated work to train their AI systems. Internal documents from Meta “reveal” the claims In their court filing, the authors said internal documents that were produced by Meta during the discovery process showed that the social network firm knew about the pirated books. According to The Guardian , its CEO Zuckerberg backed the use of the LibGen dataset, a huge online archive of books. This was despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it is a dataset “we know to be pirated.” US author Ta-Nehisi Coates, comedian Sarah Silverman, and other writers suing the company for copyright infringement made the accusations in filings that were made public on Wednesday in a California federal court. The authors took Meta to court in 2023 on allegations that the social media company was misusing their books to train AI models, specifically Llama, its large language model that powers its chatbots. Originating in Russia, the Library Genesis or LibGen dataset is a “shadow library” which claims to contain millions of novels, notification books as well as science magazine articles. In 2024, a New York federal court asked LibGen’s anonymous operators to pay a group of publishers $30 million in damages for copyright infringement This is one of the many others that allege that copyrighted work by authors, artists, and others was used to train generative AI tools like ChatGPT chatbot without consent from owners. Creative professionals have warned that using their work without their consent is endangering their business models. According to Reuters , defendants have, however, argued that they made fair use of copyrighted material. The judge allowed the authors to file an amended complaint In the Meta case, the authors reportedly asked the court on Wednesday for permission to file an updated complaint. In their arguments, they indicated that new evidence showed that social network firms used the AI training dataset LibGen, which includes millions of pirated works, and distributed it through peer-to-peer torrents. According to them, Zuckerberg “approved Meta’s use of the LibGen dataset notwithstanding concerns within Meta’s AI executive team (and others at Meta) that LibGen is ‘a dataset we know to be pirated.'” The filing also cites a memo that referred to Zuckerberg’s initials, noting that “after escalation to MZ” Meta’s AI team “has been approved to use LibGen.” Last year, a US district judge, Vince Chhabria, dismissed claims that text generated by Meta’s AI models infringed the authors’ copyrights and that Meta unlawfully stripped books’ copyright management information. This refers to information about the work including the title, name of author, and copyright owner. The plaintiffs were, however, permitted to amend their claims. In their arguments this week, the authors said the evidence bolstered their infringement claims and justified reviving their copyright management information case adding a new computer fraud allegation. During a Thursday hearing, the judge said he would allow the authors to file an amended complaint although he was skeptical about the merits of the fraud claims.

The correlation between price fluctuations and social volume highlights the significant influence of public sentiment on XRP’s market performance. Source-Santiment Ripple Price Analysis The Ripple price is currently at $2.31, showing a modest increase of 2%. Ripple has established a resistance level near the $2.60 mark. The price has struggled to break this threshold over the past few days, indicating a strong resistance area. Conversely, a support level has formed around the $2.20 mark, providing a baseline below which the price has not fallen. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key technical indicator, sits at 52.24, suggesting a neutral market sentiment.

This helps Ripple integrate RLUSD with Chainlink Price Feeds on Ethereum. This collaboration is another major milestone for the newly launched stablecoin. It also aims to enhance RLUSD’s utility and accessibility within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Chainlink’s Price Feeds provide secure and reliable pricing data on the Ethereum network, enabling developers to integrate RLUSD into their DeFi applications seamlessly. This move aligns with Ripple’s commitment to advancing the adoption of stablecoin-based payments and expanding RLUSD’s reach across on-chain markets. According to Ripple’s official blog post , Jack McDonald, Senior Vice President of Stablecoin at Ripple, highlighted the importance of this integration, stating, “As RLUSD scales across DeFi ecosystems, reliable and transparent pricing is essential to maintaining stability and building trust in its utility within decentralized markets.” RLUSD and the Growing Stablecoin Market Stablecoins, with their ability to facilitate instant, low-cost transactions, are transforming the financial landscape. RLUSD backed 1:1 with the US dollar with NYDFS approval , is Ripple’s answer to the increasing demand for secure, compliant digital payment solutions. RLUSD was issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum blockchain and is designed for seamless compatibility with smart contract applications in DeFi. However, the growth of RLUSD in DeFi depends on access to high-quality pricing data. DeFi applications cannot effectively manage risks or create reliable financial products without accurate and real-time asset prices. By integrating Chainlink Price Feeds, Ripple addresses this need, positioning RLUSD for broader adoption within the DeFi space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Chainlink’s Role in RLUSD’s Expansion Chainlink’s infrastructure offers several features that make it an ideal partner for Ripple’s goals. Its decentralized oracle network delivers tamper-proof, volume-weighted pricing data from a wide range of premium aggregators. This ensures RLUSD pricing remains accurate and resilient against market manipulation. Moreover, Chainlink’s secure node operators and decentralized architecture provide robust protections against downtime and tampering. Johann Eid, Chief Business Officer at Chainlink Labs, emphasized, “The adoption of tokenized assets such as stablecoins will continue to accelerate in the coming years, and having access to critical on-chain data will accelerate the process.” The integration also benefits from Chainlink’s reputation framework, which enables real-time monitoring of the Oracle network. RLUSD is already in the top ten most used stablecoins , and this transparency further solidifies trust in the stablecoin and the broader ecosystem. By leveraging Chainlink’s battle-tested infrastructure, Ripple is set to accelerate RLUSD’s adoption and reinforce its role as a leader in the digital asset space.

These investors, known to back game-changing breakthroughs, are locking in OFT's future. With over $1.11 million raised so far, 1Fuel is fast gaining popularity within the cryptosphere. Its stable fundamentals and practical applications make it a tempting proposition, and it is not surprising that Ethereum fans are jumping aboard early. Ethereum: Will February Fuel 2025's Best Altcoin? February, a historically strong month for Ethereum, is just around the corner. Looking back, ETH saw impressive gains in the past Februaries, like the 173% surge in 2016. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, these trends hint at how investors might feel about the market this time. On Monday, Ethereum briefly climbed above $3,700 as investor accumulation increased over the previous week. However, by Tuesday, it dropped 7%, erasing the gains of the last five days due to a broader crypto market decline. Currently, Ethereum trades at $3,400, but its trading volume has jumped by 20%, giving investors some optimism. Still, Ethereum faces a crucial moment. If it can’t hold the lower boundary support of its symmetrical triangle pattern, it could dip to the $3,000 mark—a key psychological level. With February potentially seeing more market activity, Ethereum keeps attracting attention. Given its historic resilience and current market activity, several analysts think it might become 2025's best altcoin. Ethereum remains one of the leading contenders for investors searching for crypto deals. Watch this altcoin closely in the coming weeks, as Ethereum's February performance might signal its future direction. 1Fuel: The Top Crypto Investment Revolutionizing DeFi 1Fuel is a DeFi token currently in Presale but has attracted investor interest for its practical uses and novel features. 1Fuel is a top crypto investment, as analysts consider it a game changer in decentralized finance. The 1Fuel project targets the security, efficiency, data protection and user-friendliness of the DeFi experience. It aims to simplify complex processes, make DeFi more accessible and let users unleash its full potential. Typical issues like security risks and storage limitations mean 1Fuel can become the go-to platform for decentralized finance fans. 1Fuel's ecosystem includes a crypto card for daily use and a privacy mixer for anonymous transfers. It also offers security tools like cold storage and disposable wallets alongside standard solutions like Ledger and Core Wallet. AI-driven tools enhance the user experience, automating tasks and guiding better financial choices. In 2025, 1Fuel might be a DeFi contender with its utility. With a powerful utility token, 1Fuel aims to deal with the issues of current DeFi participants. Analysts project massive growth already, and $0FT tokens sell for 0.012. Even better, experts anticipate a 1,000% jump before the presale conclusion and a 4,000% boost once it hits centralized and decentralized markets. These impressive projections and its focus on user-friendliness and innovation make 1Fuel a top crypto investment for Ethereum investors. This project is potentially good for investors searching for new opportunities before its price rockets.

These investors, known to back game-changing breakthroughs, are locking in OFT's future. With over $1.11 million raised so far, 1Fuel is fast gaining popularity within the cryptosphere. Its stable fundamentals and practical applications make it a tempting proposition, and it is not surprising that Ethereum fans are jumping aboard early. Ethereum: Will February Fuel 2025's Best Altcoin? February, a historically strong month for Ethereum, is just around the corner. Looking back, ETH saw impressive gains in the past Februaries, like the 173% surge in 2016. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, these trends hint at how investors might feel about the market this time. On Monday, Ethereum briefly climbed above $3,700 as investor accumulation increased over the previous week. However, by Tuesday, it dropped 7%, erasing the gains of the last five days due to a broader crypto market decline. Currently, Ethereum trades at $3,400, but its trading volume has jumped by 20%, giving investors some optimism. Still, Ethereum faces a crucial moment. If it can’t hold the lower boundary support of its symmetrical triangle pattern, it could dip to the $3,000 mark—a key psychological level. With February potentially seeing more market activity, Ethereum keeps attracting attention. Given its historic resilience and current market activity, several analysts think it might become 2025's best altcoin. Ethereum remains one of the leading contenders for investors searching for crypto deals. Watch this altcoin closely in the coming weeks, as Ethereum's February performance might signal its future direction. 1Fuel: The Top Crypto Investment Revolutionizing DeFi 1Fuel is a DeFi token currently in Presale but has attracted investor interest for its practical uses and novel features. 1Fuel is a top crypto investment, as analysts consider it a game changer in decentralized finance. The 1Fuel project targets the security, efficiency, data protection and user-friendliness of the DeFi experience. It aims to simplify complex processes, make DeFi more accessible and let users unleash its full potential. Typical issues like security risks and storage limitations mean 1Fuel can become the go-to platform for decentralized finance fans. 1Fuel's ecosystem includes a crypto card for daily use and a privacy mixer for anonymous transfers. It also offers security tools like cold storage and disposable wallets alongside standard solutions like Ledger and Core Wallet. AI-driven tools enhance the user experience, automating tasks and guiding better financial choices. In 2025, 1Fuel might be a DeFi contender with its utility. With a powerful utility token, 1Fuel aims to deal with the issues of current DeFi participants. Analysts project massive growth already, and $0FT tokens sell for 0.012. Even better, experts anticipate a 1,000% jump before the presale conclusion and a 4,000% boost once it hits centralized and decentralized markets. These impressive projections and its focus on user-friendliness and innovation make 1Fuel a top crypto investment for Ethereum investors. This project is potentially good for investors searching for new opportunities before its price rockets.

The SEC’s approval on Jan. 10, 2024, paved the way for 11 spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs to go live on U.S. exchanges. The launch coincided with Bitcoin’s rally to a new all-time high in March 2024, crossing the $100,000 mark before undergoing a correction. While the market has seen tremendous growth since these ETFs began trading, it’s the records they have broken that stand out a year later. Read more: Bitcoin ETFs record nearly $1b inflows as BTC rallies past $102k On Jan. 10, 2025, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart shared a summary of spot BTC ETFs one year down the line. According to Seyffart, one of the most surprising milestones is the inclusion of four spot Bitcoin ETFs in the list of the top 20 ETF launches of all time. The ETFs in question are BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Ark/21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), and Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT surpassed $50 billion in assets under management in less than a year. In comparison, the asset manager’s gold ETF took nearly 20 years to cross $30 billion in AUM. “Just how big was the first year for Bitcoin ETFs? Massive,” Seyffart noted. “Even if you inflation adjust the assets, 4 of the Bitcoin ETFs are in the top 20 US ETF launches of all time. $IBIT, $FBTC, $ARKB, and $BITB.” IBIT tops the list of best ETF launches in history, while FBTC, ARKB, and BITB rank fourth, 16th, and 18th, respectively. “A key takeaway of mine here is that even the two ETFs from comparatively small issuers ARK/21 Shares and Bitwise which “only” have ~$4 billion each are still in the top 20 launches of all time. That’s crazy,” the analyst added. VanEck’s HODL ranks 99, CoinShares Valkyrie’s BRRR 162, Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO 196, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC 199 and WisdomTree’s BTCW at position 384. According to data from SoSoValue , the total net assets in U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at over $106 billion as of Jan. 9, 2025, accounting for approximately 5.74% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization.

The cryptocurrency reclaimed its $100K mark on Monday, as it rode the wave of a broad upswing across risk assets. However, BTC could not sustain the climb, and fell away from the threshold. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell below the $100K threshold on Tuesday after stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data led investors to further scale back their expectations for interest-rate reductions by the Federal Reserve. On Thursday, the selloff became stronger and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) along with other high-profile crypto assets slumped such as DOGE and SHIBA INU, as macro jitters mounted and the surge in global bond yields reflecting concerns about upside risks to inflation. ""Market volatility is expected to stay low until NFP on Friday, which should officially kick-start the new trading year with decision makers fully back at work. The highest volatility event for the month is priced to be FOMC at the end of the month as the economic stats are priced to show 'soft landing' signs in the near future,"" said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA. The demand for Bitcoin is manifesting itself, said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, adding, ""Now that traders have wrapped up their vacations and are back to work, they've resumed purchases of Bitcoin, crypto, and stocks in a bullish trend as we approach Donald Trump's inauguration. However, there might be more silver lining, as Bernstein predicted in a recent note that the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is set for another triple-digit surge this year, dubbing 2025 the ""Infinity Age"" of the cryptocurrency space. ""Bitcoin's price is projected to range between $70,000 and $150,000 in 2025, with extreme volatility expected due to market dynamics and geopolitical shifts,"" SA contributor Florian Grummes said. Any turmoil in the stock markets will put Bitcoin prices at very high risk as Bitcoin is more closely correlated with US stock markets than ever before, Grummes added.

Analysts report that the Dogecoin price is experiencing a decline due to bearish pressure, and investors may not see any real gains this season. On the other hand, a new AI altcoin currently priced at $0.0420 is receiving huge investments from large organizations as it forges towards a whopping 65,000% rally. This AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , has been tagged “the most promising token” in crypto this season. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Rises Upwards As The Dogecoin Price Heads Downwards In 2024, the Dogecoin price rallied significantly, appreciating by around 380%. Various predictions sprung up, with some predicting that the Dogecoin price could reach $1 this season. These predictions were partly based on the Dogecoin price history, which shows that the price usually surges at the end of every price cycle. However, the end of the current cycle has begun, and rather than seeing a surge, the Dogecoin price has fallen by approximately 13% over the past month. Just today, the Dogecoin price fell by about 2%. Expert analysts explain that this bearish pressure could affect the Dogecoin price, and its actual performance may be quite the opposite of popular predictions of an incoming surge. On the flip side, an AI altcoin named WallitIQ (WLTQ) is projecting towards a jaw-breaking 65,000% surge. Experts say they have too many solid reasons to believe in WallitIQ's (WLTQ) ability to bring huge wealth to investors this season. One is this AI altcoin platform’s incredible ability to trade over 1,500 cryptocurrencies directly. This, combined with a wisely designed tokenomics of 1 billion tokens only, is inevitably encouraging rapid adoption.

In the last presale stages, WallitIQ (WLTQ) generated a whopping $6 million as large investors bought more than 350 million tokens. A new presale stage has just begun, yet WallitIQ (WLTQ) has raised close to $200,000 with approximately 5 million tokens sold. This AI altcoin is projected to generate over $2 million in monthly revenue, eventually dominating the $700 billion crypto wallet and AI market.

In the past three days, XLM has experienced a price decline of over 18% and has also broken through its crucial support level of $0.403. XLM Bulls Back However, with today’s upside momentum, XLM has returned to the support level and is poised for further gains. The potential reason for this price recovery across the crypto market, including XLM, is the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, scheduled for January 20, 2025. With this potential price recovery, the XLM daily chart has formed an ideal setup for traders looking to go long, with a perfect risk-to-reward ratio. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to XLM’s daily chart, traders can see an attractive 1:5.6 risk-to-reward ratio, with a stop loss at $0.38 and a target at the $0.60 mark. Source: Trading View If we delve deeper into the analysis, expert technical analysis suggests that XLM is forming a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders price action pattern on the daily time frame. Based on the recent price action, if XLM closes its daily candle above the $0.415 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar significantly and complete the speculated price action pattern. Traders Over-Leveraged Positions Looking at this bullish outlook, traders seem to be building long positions, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass According to the data, the major liquidation level on the lower side is $0.388, where traders have held significant long positions worth $7.47 million. However, $0.422 is another major liquidation area where short sellers have built over $2.09 million worth of short positions. These levels are areas where traders are over-leveraged and have the potential to be liquidated if the price shifts to either level. Current Price Momentum Currently, XLM is trading near $0.418 and has witnessed a price surge of over 4.5% in upside momentum. However, during the same period, its trading volume has also increased, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-10 19:21:05

The BTC price has been on a downtrend for a while now, dropping to as low as $92,000 at the moment, and is trading at $93,475 at the time of writing. Speaking about the drop, the analyst claimed that this entire pullback wave looks like a “bear trap” and is intended to shake off most people before a strong bull run for altcoins ensues. The analyst added that he remains patient. Related News: CFTC Sends Subpoena to Cryptocurrency Exchange Coinbase - Here's Why On the other hand, during the decline yesterday, il Capo said that he added more ENA and ZEUS altcoins to his portfolio from the current levels. The analyst added that the ENA price is in a demand/support area similar to BTC and stated that he believes it will bounce.

With the altcoin season fast approaching, many crypto investors have become motivated to find their 'how to become a crypto millionaire' token. Here comes Remittix , the presale token several investors have started investing in as their PEPE: their pathway to being a crypto millionaire. Let's explore the facts of the Remittixpresale to learn why experts believe it could better PEPE's price gain and create the next crypto millionaire. Remittix (RTX): PayFi token with fast-paced growth in presale With Remittix, you can instantly convert over 100 cryptocurrencies into fiat money and send it to any bank account worldwide. There are no foreign exchange fees, keeping things simple. The recipient gets the payment in their preferred fiat currency without knowing it came from cryptocurrency. Remittix stands out from competitors like Wise, Stripe, and Coinbase. Unlike them, it supports direct crypto-to-fiat transactions, giving it a clear edge. Businesses can use the Remittix Pay API to accept cryptocurrency payments and settle fiat transactions directly into bank accounts. Merchants can also open accounts with Remittix, giving them control over how they withdraw cryptocurrency. The platform supports over 50 cryptocurrency pairs and 30 fiat currencies. The Pay API works anywhere with internet access, regardless of location. Remittix offers other features, including automated smart contracts that distribute funds based on compliance and other conditions. It also integrates with dApps and payment systems. The platform cuts out middlemen in currency conversion, saving users money on exchange rates. Its use of stablecoins reduces volatility and simplifies cash withdrawals. Security is a top priority for Remittix. The platform uses advanced security measures and undergoes regular audits. Experts from BlockSAFU have verified the smart contracts.

Buterin wrote on the future direction artificial intelligence is taking. In a series of posts, the Ethereum co-founder made it clear that AI should empower humanity – not disempower it. AI should help humans, not take over He warned that “poorly designed AI systems might produce something that’s more or less a non-controllable, self-replicating entity.” AI done wrong is making new forms of independent self-replicating intelligent life, Buterin wrote. “AI done right is mecha suits for the human mind. If we do the former without the latter, we risk permanent human disempowerment. If we do the latter, flourishing superintelligent human civilization.” He believes AI should augment human thinking, creativity, and so on, kind of like a “mecha suit” which enhances the user’s strength. This is contrasted by the dangers of autonomous AI systems without human oversight, according to him, which may eventually lead to a loss of control over the technology we create. Buterin further suggests that there should be the use of “distilled human judgment” as a collective means of improvement in decision-making. He further described this as creating systems that could imitate high-quality human decision-making processes but perform more efficiently than humans. Thus, humans could maintain control with the benefits reaped from the capabilities of AI. The latter can be done at the collective level through distilled human judgment, he explained; the collective human intelligence can provide guidance to help AI amplify, rather than substitute for, human abilities. The risks of uncontrolled AI systems Buterin goes on to clarify that the emerging AI tools – such as this real-time video generation software – have an example AI system that indeed empowers, while the “way of ‘passive system’ like, for example, the text-to image model, of which user influences are very minimum.” Prompt and wait doesn’t work that way, aim and adjust to a constant real-time base,” he puts in, suggesting a more intimate and empowering dynamic between humans and AI. He then talked about AI agents: the programs that will do tasks without human input. He explained two types: one that does long-term, complex planning, and the other simpler AI tool like a chatbot, replacing GUIs. The latter, he said, “Chatbot replaces GUIs as the interface to everything. The latter is great!” Ultimately, Buterin advocates for responsible AI development to empower humanity. He is not in favor of an uncontrolled, unbridled drive towards autonomous systems and instead sees tools that serve to enhance human abilities. “If done right,” he thinks, “AI can lead to a flourishing superintelligent civilization.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",AI|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-10 19:30:31

Ripple has been on a tear, gaining 324.7% in the past year. This impressive performance has left XRP holders joining PropiChain's (PCHAIN) presale to maximize gains in 2025. PropiChain is an AI altcoin set to transform the real estate industry with tokenization and fractional ownership. The project has raised over $1 million in its token presale, indicating investors' confidence. This investor confidence is seen in the broader market, with the XRP price to resume its uptrend soon. Ripple and PCHAIN are gaining traction, with the latter set for explosive gains. XRP Price Set to Rise in 2025 Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared that the ""Trump bull market is real"" and noted that the firm signed more deals in six weeks than in the last six months. This is expected to augur well for the XRP price. The XRP price rose 19.6% in the past week to trade at $2.42. Galringhouse noted that the new administration is jumpstarting innovation. This is a key development as many investors feel that the XRP price was held back by its legal battle against the SEC. Analysts are bullish on Ripple and predict that the XRP price will print a new high. They are targeting $9, marking a 272% increase. The XRP price surged 324.7% in the past year. PropiChain: AI Altcoin Set for Explosive Rally PropiChain is on track to soar from $0.01 to $1, offering early investors potential gains of up to 10,000%. Its unique combination of AI and real estate tokenization is attracting both smart money and retail investors. PCHAIN is already up 200% during the presale alone. This is only the beginning and the AI altcoin is tipped to outshine the XRP price momentum in 2025. Its appeal lies in AI-driven features that will transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. PropiChain's tokenization and fractional ownership democratize real estate investments. It allows the platform's users to own portions of properties with minimal capital. This creates new avenues of wealth for retail traders. Moreover, it helps PCHAIN's users to diversify their investments. The platform's AI features are central to its appeal. The platform uses AI for predictive market analysis , property filtering, and search. PropiChain's users have access to AI-powered market analysis, helping them make smarter, data-driven decisions. This gives the platform's users an edge over their peers. Property filtering is key in helping users narrow down their property searches based on preferences such as budget, finance options, and location. Additionally, PropiChain uses automated valuation models to offer accurate and fair property appraisals. PCHAIN uses smart contracts to automate real estate transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals. This improves efficiency and reduces manual work for landlords and tenants. The platform's smart contracts have been vigorously audited by BlockAudit. The audit ensures transparency, security, and reliability. Furthermore, PropiChain introduced remote property viewing using the metaverse . This feature enhances the property-buying experience. Ripple Rival Set to Outshine XRP The XRP price has seen impressive gains over the past year. Analysts believe it still has fuel in the tank and will grind slowly to $9 in the best-case scenario. However, they feel that Ripple is fast approaching its limit and may stumble below $9. In contrast, PCHAIN is priced at only $0.01. This presents a prime opportunity for the AI altcoin to rise exponentially in 2025. Investors in PCHAIN for 10,000% Gains in 2025 Savvy traders are investing early in PCHAIN to secure 10,000% gains in H1 2025. The AI altcoin has already risen 200% during the presale, with major gains expected after its public launch. PropiChain is set to outpace the XRP price momentum and skyrocket from $0.01 to $1 in the blink of an eye. Analysts are calling PCHAIN the best altcoin to invest in right now. Apart from its AI-driven features, PCHAIN has secured a CoinMarketCap listing . This has added several layers of credibility and transparency. The project has more milestones in the pipeline.

According to a new report from the BBC, James Howells lost the device containing 8,000 Bitcoin during a 2013 house cleanup in Newport, Wales, when he mistakenly threw away the wrong hard drive. The BTC on the hard drive, which Howells mined in 2009 during cryptocurrency’s early days, has skyrocketed in value since then. Despite offering to share the recovered funds with the local community and presenting detailed environmental safety plans, Howells failed to convince Newport City Council to permit a search of the landfill where the hard drive is believed to be buried. The council maintained that excavating the site would pose significant environmental hazards, including the potential release of harmful materials. Officials also questioned the likelihood of finding an intact hard drive after years of exposure to the elements. According to the report, the court’s dismissal cited a lack of reasonable grounds for success in Howells’ case. The ruling marks the end of his efforts to recover what would be one of the largest lost cryptocurrency fortunes in history.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 19:43:00

The firm says the total value loss in the crypto sector last year exceeded $3.01 billion, a 15% increase from the 2023 total. That number includes $2.15 billion stolen in hacks and $834.5 million purloined via scams. PeckShield also notes that $488.5 million worth of looted crypto was recovered. Source: PeckShield/X Despite the surge in crypto losses last year, 2024 still wasn’t as prolific as 2022, which clocked $3.6 billion worth of value loss. Last year’s largest heist happened in May when North Korean hackers stole more than $300 million worth of Bitcoin ( BTC ) from the Japanese crypto exchange DMM. American and Japanese government investigators say the breach began in March when a hacker posed as a recruiter and sent a malicious GitHub link to an employee of Ginco, a DMM partner company. After the employee copied the link to their personal account, a North Korean group known as “TraderTraitor” gained system access and later impersonated the worker to infiltrate DMM’s communications. The hackers then intercepted and modified a legitimate transaction request from DMM, authorities said. In December, the blockchain security firm Chainalysis noted that North Korean hackers stole more crypto in 2024 than any prior year, looting $1.34 billion worth of digital assets across 47 incidents.

Meanwhile, momentum is building elsewhere with PropiChain, a revolutionary blockchain-based real estate platform projected for an unparalleled 25,000x growth in 2025 from round two of the PCHAIN presale . Will the XRP Price Regain its Momentum Amid Market Uncertainty? The XRP price continues to be a focal point in the crypto market, with investors discussing its recent resurgence to $2.40 today . Over the past week, XRP price has seen a noteworthy 15.03% increase, indicating renewed investor optimism in the altcoin. However, XRP remains down for the month by 2.11% while experiencing a marginal daily decline of 1.26%, suggesting a slowdown in momentum as it faces lingering market pressures. Much of XRP's stagnation is attributed to a wait-and-see approach from investors as they monitor potential regulatory developments. The recent appointment of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, to lead the SEC has fueled speculation about a favorable regulatory climate for Ripple (and even PropiChain ). While this change could contribute to bullish sentiments, the market remains cautious as any real impact on XRP price may take months to materialize, given how the altcoin failed to capitalize on Ripple's stablecoin launch. PropiChain Real Estate Revolution Fuels 25,000x Profit Potential Imagine a world where the persistent challenges of the real estate industry – property fraud, class exclusivity, limited market access, and ridiculous inefficiency – are not just mitigated but eliminated. This is the bold vision driving PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a platform built on the revolutionary power of blockchain, RWA tokenization, metaverse, smart contracts, and AI technologies to completely transform the way real estate is bought, sold, and managed. Across the globe, blockchain is already making waves in addressing real estate issues. In India, for example, it’s being used to eliminate property fraud. But PropiChain isn’t stopping there; it’s setting its sights on a comprehensive overhaul of the industry on a global scale. PropiChain is positioned as the first full-service real estate innovation, offering a single platform for tokenizing, discovering, acquiring, managing, and investing in assets with unprecedented efficiency and transparency. Blockchain not only safeguards assets and transaction data on an impenetrable vault but also decentralizes access to property data, thereby dismantling the dominance of data monopolies. In addition, this digitization will bring liquidity to a historically rigid market by allowing instant property transactions instead of taking weeks. Yet, the real game-changer lies in PropiChain’s ability to tokenize real estate to enable fractional ownership . No longer will real estate be an exclusive investment ground for the wealthy. Now, investors with modest budgets can own tiny fractions of premium real estate properties and trade them freely without border restrictions. Accessibility to the market will skyrocket as a result, but PropiChain is taking it to a whole new level through the integration of the metaverse that creates virtual spaces where asset owners can meet, explore properties and trade, all without leaving their homes. Real estate business efficiency is also another area taken care of with PropiChain's smart contracts and artificial intelligence, with automated property leasing, rent collection, renewals, asset valuations, asset trading, and much more. PropiChain Overtakes With 25,000x Projections as XRP Price Rally Slows While the XRP price has regained its $2.40 level after nearly falling below the $2 mark this past week, the story has remained largely the same over the past three months, with altcoin failing to cross its resistance levels. With the XRP price stagnating and with few options regarding the best cryptos to buy now , investors are looking deeper into undervalued gems, with PropiChain being the standout AI altcoin with its astonishing 25,000x growth potential. Round Two PCHAIN Presale Investors Await 25,000x Gains in 2025 Analysts believe a bullish storm is upon us with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming the $100,000 mark just two weeks away from Trump's inauguration as president. For investors, finding the best cryptos to buy before prices skyrocket is of utmost importance. So it's no surprise that savvy investors – from Wall Street traders to Web3 degens – are rushing the PropiChain presale , already splashing $2.1 million in record time to acquire PCHAIN at $0.011 in round two, the lowest it'll ever be again. With an outstanding 25,000x breakout potential in Q1, PropiChain presale investors are poised to make millions of dollars from modest investments. For example, a $950 round-two investment can balloon to over $300,000 by March, even if PCHAIN meets only a fraction of its growth potential. However, it's not all good news as PropiChain's transformative potential and early presale success, along with news of its successful BlockAudit security review and PCHAIN CoinMarketCap listing , have all spotlighted the project. The result was an insane increase in traffic in round two, meaning the window to make the maximum gains with PropiChain (PCHAIN) is closing fast. Analysts say a stellar PCHAIN rally is upon us, which will far outperform the historic XRP price boom, and investors are showing a serious unwillingness to miss out.

Speaking on Friday, Mbadi said the proposed framework seeks to leverage the opportunities presented by cryptocurrencies while addressing associated risks, including money laundering, terrorism financing, and fraud, according to The Standard. Mbadi said the Kenyan Government is committed to creating a legal and regulatory framework that will enable VAs and VASPs to reap the benefits.

According to Mbadi, the policy aims to foster a fair, competitive, and stable market for industry participants while promoting innovation and financial literacy. Mbadi also pointed to the global trend toward regulating cryptocurrencies, citing examples from Morocco, the United States, and Russia.

Now, this same trader has set sights on a new project with a staggering 22,000% growth potential - Lightchain AI . Currently in its presale stage, Lightchain AI has already raised over $9.7 million at a price of $0.004875, drawing significant attention as the next big opportunity in the crypto market. Dogecoin’s Meteoric Rise Lesson in Timing Dogecoin (DOGE), first made as a fun thing in 2013, has seen big price changes due to many reasons. In November 2024, after Donald Trump got elected again and he picked Elon Musk to run the Department of Government Efficiency DOGE Dogecoin's worth jumped from less than $0.16 to almost $0.38 in just one week.

A key factor driving its growth is its well-defined roadmap, which includes the testnet launch in January 2025 and the mainnet activation in March 2025. This clear strategy highlights its focus on innovation and scalability. Another standout feature is its use of homomorphic encryption, allowing computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information. This ensures data remains secure and confidential at all times. These unique features set Lightchain AI apart from competitors like Dogecoin, offering a strong foundation for sustainable growth and positioning it as a promising player in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

However, the celebration was short-lived as BTC failed to hold this critical level, dropping as low as $92,500 in less than three days. This sharp downturn has reignited concerns about the market’s stability and Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its upward momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Downswing To $2,900 Could Be A ‘Buy-The-Dip Opportunity’ – Analyst Expects Bullish Surge Axel Adler, a prominent CryptoQuant analyst, shared valuable insights into the recent market activity. He revealed that the largest deleveraging in the past week took place between January 6 and 7, when Bitcoin’s price fell from $102K to $100K due to liquidations. This wave of forced selling pushed prices lower, allowing bears to regain control and drive Bitcoin’s price down further to $92,500. The current market conditions have left investors questioning Bitcoin’s next move. Will it stabilize and find support to mount another rally, or will the bearish momentum lead to a deeper correction? With the market sentiment teetering between fear and cautious optimism, all eyes remain on Bitcoin as it navigates this critical phase. Bitcoin Regains Ground After Aggressive Sell-Off Despite experiencing an aggressive drop that saw Bitcoin plummet to $92K, the cryptocurrency has managed to find key support at this critical level. In the past few hours, BTC has pushed above this threshold, climbing to $95K, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish investors. The ability to hold and rebound from this support level suggests potential resilience, but uncertainties remain. Prominent CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared insightful data on X about the recent market dynamics. He noted that the largest deleveraging in the last week occurred between January 6 and 7, when Bitcoin’s price dropped from $102K to $100K due to a wave of liquidations. This liquidation event wiped out overleveraged positions and set the stage for bearish activity. Capitalizing on the chaos, bears opened shorts, further driving the price down to $92K. Despite the recent recovery, Adler warns that the current 9K BTC reduction in open interest (OI) doesn’t provide a definitive signal of pressure easing in the market. This leaves Bitcoin’s next move uncertain, with investors closely watching how the price action unfolds in the coming days. Related Reading: Expert Sets $1 Target For Dogecoin Once It Breaks A Multi-Year Trend – Details The recovery to $95K is a positive sign, but BTC must reclaim higher levels to confirm bullish momentum and stabilize the market. Until then, traders remain cautious as the potential for further volatility looms. BTC Holds Key Level: Bulls Eye Higher Ground Bitcoin is trading at $95,000, holding above a critical support level and sitting just 2% below its 4-hour 200 EMA at $96,200. The 200 MA, another significant indicator, lies 3% away, adding further importance to Bitcoin’s current position. These technical levels are pivotal for assessing short-term market momentum and potential bullish recovery. For bulls to reclaim the uptrend, the $95K level must hold as a foundation for further upward movement. A decisive push to reclaim the $98K and $100K levels is crucial. These price points serve as key resistance levels that, once surpassed, could set the stage for a robust leg up, paving the way for Bitcoin to revisit its all-time highs. Failing to hold above $95K could open the door to increased bearish pressure, potentially sending BTC into a deeper consolidation or even testing lower demand zones. However, holding the line at current levels and building momentum could restore investor confidence and create the conditions needed for a sustained rally.

Institutional whales are quietly accumulating the $0.0420 altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , for a potential 60,000% return. This massive profit dwarfs even the most bullish Dogecoin (DOGE) predictions. As such, savvy investors are looking beyond established meme coins to this explosive opportunity the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale offers. As Dogecoin Whales continue to acquire the meme coin, experts say WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a better shot for investors who wish to transform their portfolios this Q1. Here’s why. Dogecoin Whales Accumulate, However, Pundits Say $7 By Q2 Is A Myth Dogecoin (DOGE) had a positive end in 2024. The altcoin traded around $0.10 in October and $0.45 by December. This data implies that Dogecoin (DOGE) gained about 165% to 200% between October and December 2024. This pump caused the Dogecoin whales to increase their holdings and capitalize on the uptrend.

But the proposal is expected to face significant opposition and be dropped when Donald Trump takes office later this month. The CFPB announced Friday that it has proposed an interpretive rule that aims to regulate digital asset wallets as financial institutions under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. If enacted, the rule would give the agency the authority to hold wallet providers liable for unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. “When people pay for family expenses using new forms of digital payments, they must be confident that their transactions are not tainted by harmful oversight or errors,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. The bureau, which was originally established to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis, opened the rule to two months of public comment, but many believe the proposal is unlikely to gain traction under the incoming administration. “This is like holding a hammer manufacturer (who in many cases give away hammers for free) liable for misuse of a hammer,” said Joey Krug, a partner at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, likening the move to holding a hammer manufacturer liable for misuse. Related News: What to Expect in Bitcoin Price After Strong Employment Data from the US? Will Interest Rate Cuts Be Postponed? Many in the crypto space see the move as part of a broader agenda tied to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a staunch critic of digital assets. Warren, who first proposed the creation of the CFPB in 2007, is considered one of the crypto industry’s staunchest opponents. Chopra, a longtime Warren ally, was nominated as CFPB director by President Biden in 2020. Her proposal to rein in crypto wallet providers is seen by some as emblematic of Warren’s influence over the agency. Despite the uproar, industry leaders remain skeptical of the rule’s longevity. A 2020 Supreme Court decision allows the president to fire the director of the CFPB without cause, and the incoming Trump administration is expected to take a pro-crypto stance. Chopra and his proposed rule are likely to be short-lived, as Republicans have historically criticized the CFPB’s existence. The Trump administration has already signaled its intention to support digital assets, a stark contrast to the Biden administration’s more cautious approach to the sector. *This is not investment advice.

The SHIB community is warned that scammers target victims with fake offers involving the upcoming meme coin. The First to Add TREAT The Shiba Inu-related meme coin TREAT will go live on January 14 . It is designed to be the reward token within the ecosystem and provide liquidity for the upcoming SHI stablecoin. TREAT’s launch sparked huge enthusiasm across the SHIB community. One person who commented on the effort was Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama: “Our capstone and key to full and perpetual decentralization. Stay tuned for this epic launch, and remember to listen to my podcast to fully understand why TREAT is vital to our success .” Not long ago, Kusama revealed their intentions to launch a podcast in 2025. It will consist of 44 episodes and focus on various aspects of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem each day of the week. According to their announcement, Tuesdays will be dedicated to TREAT. Currently, traders can find the meme coin on certain decentralized exchanges. KuCoin, for its part, became the first centralized platform to announce support for the coin. The company will list the trading pair TREAT/USDT on January 14 . The Seychelles-based KuCoin is among the top 10 biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. It will be interesting to see whether other leading companies, including Binance and Coinbase, will follow suit soon. Be Careful With TREAT The excitement surrounding the pending development, combined with Shiba Inu’s vast community base, could explain why scammers have used the meme coin as bait to con unsuspecting victims. Not long ago, Shibarium Trustwatch (an X account that aims to provide security) warned people to stay away from dubious individuals who offer TREAT services. “They are now using SHIB socials linked to their FAKE TREAT. Please don’t be misled by these predatory scammers. They can be called vultures, circling and looking for their next feed. We ask with heaven on our side, please do not fall for these scams. Be clear: the TREAT launch is scheduled for the 14th of January 2025, not before. If you are unsure about anything at any time , check with us first. Stay safe, SHIBARMY,” the alert reads. It is important to note that fraudsters might continue to target the community even after the meme coin goes live. This means that users should always stay vigilant, trust only information from official channels, and not engage with dubious individuals who offer attractive opportunities involving TREAT or any other tokens part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 529,900 followers on the social media platform X that based on historical precedence, the crypto king should mount a recovery. “Bitcoin started its current -15% pullback in week seven of price discovery. The timing of this retrace is in line with historical tendencies. It is the first price discovery correction of this cycle. As a result, it has a high probability of reversal.” Price discovery is the process by which buyers and sellers determine the fair market value of an asset based on supply and demand, liquidity, and other factors. Rekt Capital goes on to note that this type of pattern is a regular part of the top crypto asset by market cap’s historical cycle. “In the 2013 cycle, it took six weeks of upside into Price Discovery before BTC experienced its first major correction in week seven. In the 2017 cycle, it took seven weeks of upside into price discovery before a first major retrace of -34%. In week eight In the 2020/2021 cycle, BTC rallied six weeks into Price Discovery before BTC’s first meaningful pullback of -16%. And in this cycle, Bitcoin enjoyed upside until week seven before retracing -15%. Out of the ordinary? History says no.” The trader then says BTC has rebounded nicely from its low support range and will occupy the $91,000 to $101,000 price range “until further notice.” BTC is $93,803 at time of writing, a 1% decrease during the last 24 hours.

The protocol retains some of the legacy DAI supply, which is also actively used in decentralized trades and lending. The stablecoin of Sky protocol, USDS, reached a new supply peak above 1.8B, after accelerated swaps from DAI. Both the new and the legacy stablecoin have a total supply of over 5.8B and are used in active and passive DeFi activities. USDS is still in the process of minting, as the swap mechanism from DAI is still open. The chief driver of the growing supply of USDS is the 12.5% annualized yield for the token. A total of 2.1M USDS and DAI have been locked for staking in exchange for the yield. The new supply milestone arrived after USDS surpassed 1.5B tokens as of January 3. The token expanded in the first days of the new year, reaching peak supply with rapid growth on Ethereum and smaller additions on Solana. USDS total supply surpasses 1.8 billion and reaches a new all-time high. https://t.co/JW2MR3JzbG pic.twitter.com/GpWaUNIsvo — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) January 10, 2025 The asset is in its initial stages of spreading to other networks. So far, around 1.53B of the tokens are on Ethereum. The Solana version, with over 102K tokens, is a test for the later stage of fully launching Sky Protocol. The chief goal is to offer the same DeFi services and yield but on Solana’s much more scalable network. USDS also prepared for its expansion on Base, by offering outsized yield for the first liquidity providers on Aerodrome. In the coming weeks, USDS will continue its inflows into Base, which already holds more than $3.5B in other stablecoins. Sky Protocol and the legacy vaults of Maker are still some of the top DeFi apps for passive income. Some of the partnerships are achieved through the biggest subDAO, Spark Protocol, which has launched its own set of Aave vaults. Over time, Sky Protocol will aim to regain the former position of Maker as one of the top stablecoin issuers and providers of passive income. USDS changes trading profile with representation on Solana The growth of USDS also comes with increased activity and turnover on Solana. The shift came in November, as Sky strategically made its move to the new chain, displacing the volumes on Ethereum. The highly active USDS on Solana points to a trend of adopting some of the legacy protocols on Ethereum. The last few months saw Solana activity rise, with potential demand for passive yield to lock in gains. The supply of USDS expanded again in early 2025, preparing for a bigger influence on Solana and Base. | Source: Dune Analytics The total value locked on Solana increased to $8.54B , expanding more rapidly in the last three months. The TVL increased not only due to the higher nominal price of SOL but with token and stablecoin inflows. The stablecoins on Solana have already reached $5.79B, with a predominance of USDC usage. The USDS market share has climbed to around 1% of the entire supply, still getting ahead of other niche stablecoins. In this early stage, USDS usage on Solana is more limited. On Ethereum, USDS transactions reach over $30,000, while the Solana version carries on average transactions of around $3,000 as the asset is still building up its adoption. The USDS on Solana is still spread among a handful of whale wallets. One of the leading addresses holds 1.5M USDS and is one of the biggest yield recipients. The top 4 addresses on Solana hold more than 50% of the supply of USDS, as retail wallets are still catching up with whales. The expansion of USDS started from November 19 onward, with a rapid spike in activity. USDS is also trading on Raydium and Aerodrome, though with a warning for being a mintable and freezable asset. This means some of the holders may have to consider the possibility of locked tokens if they fail to fulfill the terms and conditions of Sky Protocol. The Raydium USDS/USDC pair has over $69M in liquidity, while Aerodrome carries $1.2M . The token is mostly meant for staking and passive yield and is not a part of the meme token ecosystem.

Table of Contents Trump’s influence on the crypto space Crypto market responds to bullish news Pepeto: A rising contender in the upcoming bull market About PEPETO The much-anticipated inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th is drawing global attention, with crypto enthusiasts eager to understand the potential implications for the digital asset market. Known for his pro-business approach, Trump’s presidency could signal a new era for blockchain and crypto adoption. Trump’s influence on the crypto space In his previous term, Trump demonstrated a mixed stance on cryptocurrencies but prioritized economic policies that spurred market growth. Analysts predict that his return to office could foster a more favorable environment for crypto innovation, particularly with the expected replacement of key regulatory officials. This shift may provide the crypto space with reduced restrictions and a boost for blockchain projects. Crypto market responds to bullish news Bitcoin’s price is nearing $100,000 as enthusiasm around Trump’s inauguration builds, reflecting optimism among investors. Historically, Trump’s economic strategies have been associated with increased liquidity and market growth, trends that are now extending to the crypto sector. The potential for pro-crypto regulatory changes under the new administration is creating excitement, particularly for tokens and projects poised to capitalize on a friendlier legislative landscape.

Pepeto’s price outlook Since its presale launch in November 2024, Pepeto has drawn considerable attention from both short-term traders and long-term investors, raising over $3.5 million so far. Priced at $0.000000103 per token, with 30% of its total supply allocated for the presale, Pepeto offers an appealing entry point for those looking to get involved early. Post-launch success for PEPETO will depend on key developments, including anticipated listings on major exchanges and the rollout of its PepetoSwap platform and cross-chain bridge. These advancements are expected to drive significant adoption, with some analysts forecasting potential token value increases of up to 1,000x. The project’s unique blend of narrative, community-driven growth, and utility positions it as a top contender for the next bull run. While Pepeto sets itself apart in the memecoin market, it remains a speculative asset, subject to the inherent volatility of the crypto space. Investors should approach with caution, balancing the potential for impressive returns against the risks typically associated with emerging cryptocurrency projects. Notably, the project has already been audited by SolidProof and Coinsult, both of which are reputed entities within the crypto space. With meme coins becoming a topic of attention as the bull run progresses, Pepeto could see a rise in demand, making it a promising option.

To read full editions, subscribe . Investors learned one year ago today that US spot bitcoin ETFs finally had the go-ahead to launch , with those products hitting the market the following day. We now have 12 months of data to look back on. It was fun reading my piece published the morning of Jan. 10, 2024, which recapped what led to that milestone. The Winklevoss twins filing for a bitcoin ETF in 2013; BTC futures funds hitting the US market in 2021; the SEC blocking Grayscale’s GBTC conversion the following year — and the firm then suing the regulator ; BlackRock’s head-turning proposal in mid-2023; and, finally, Grayscale’s legal win . Predictions seeking to quantify the demand for these then proliferated, with many expecting the bitcoin ETFs to shatter records . Spoiler: They did. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart reflected on his $15 billion year-one net inflow expectation from a year ago. These were higher expectations than most in the TradFi research world, he told me. Yet lower than some projections from those in the crypto space. “Still, even issuers who expected these to be blockbuster hits did not expect them to do this well,” Seyffart told me. “They now hold over 1.13 million bitcoin and have $100 billion in assets after taking in almost $38 billion of net inflows in their first year — more than double what we thought would have been a very successful launch.” Just how big was the first year for Bitcoin ETFs? MASSIVE Here's a list of the largest ETFs 1 year after they launched. Even if you inflation adjust the assets, 4 of the Bitcoin ETFs are in the top 20 US ETF launches of all time. $IBIT , $FBTC , $ARKB , and $BITB pic.twitter.com/MQuf6wp9Fe — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 10, 2025 In its 2025 outlook report , Bitwise argued that bitcoin ETFs will attract more flows in 2025 than they did in 2024. Others have a bit more of a nuanced perspective. Seyffart noted that after the products welcomed roughly $16 billion in assets during Q4 alone, another $15 billion inflow year (matching his initial year-one prediction) seems like “a foregone conclusion assuming the economy avoids a recession.” Though he didn’t share a precise 2025 inflow projection, Seyffart believes bitcoin ETFs will grow to triple the size of gold ETFs within the next three to five years. The biggest bitcoin ETF — BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) — has well surpassed its iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in AUM — ~$52 billion to ~$33 billion. IBIT is still chasing the category-leading SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which manages roughly $74 billion. Seyffart highlighted bitcoin’s various use cases: a hedge against currency debasement, as well as a form of “hot sauce and satellite positions” in a portfolio given the asset’s volatility. He and Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research, also pointed out more wirehouses greenlighting bitcoin ETFs in 2025 as a potential catalyst. Remember Morgan Stanley’s move in August? Meanwhile, BlackRock and Fidelity — as powerhouses in the asset management industry — are set to continue “legitimizing” bitcoin , which cannot be overlooked, Mishra added. “However, much will depend on bitcoin’s performance, as ETF flows tend to follow performance trends,” she said. Alongside macro factors, set to be a major factor on BTC price in 2025 is whether (and how quickly) the promise of crypto regulatory progress is fulfilled.

The best blockchain innovations are reshaping industries by addressing the daily challenges people are facing. Traders looking to stay ahead must identify projects that combine profitability with transformative potential. This list highlights the four best blockchain innovations of 2025. Whether it’s enhancing data security, enabling cross-chain communication, or prioritizing sustainability, these projects are paving the way for real-world adoption. By aligning with these advancements, traders can position themselves for both impactful and profitable investments. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY): Redefining Secure Online Marketplaces Web3Bay (3BAY) is leading the charge in decentralized e-commerce by addressing critical issues of security and privacy. Online shopping has become the standard in today’s day and age, but concerns about data breaches and fraud are rising. Web3Bay tackles these challenges by creating a secure, transparent marketplace powered by Layer-1 blockchain technology. Currently priced at $0.0039675 in stage 3, Web3Bay has raised over $546,000, selling 148 million tokens since its presale began. Web3Bay’s Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance model empowers users to influence platform development, creating a community-driven ecosystem. Beyond e-commerce, Web3Bay integrates NFT and DeFi capabilities, expanding its utility for traders and businesses. As one of the best blockchain innovations in the market today, Web3Bay is setting new standards in real-world applications. For traders seeking a project with clear features and transformative potential, Web3Bay offers an unparalleled opportunity to invest in and profit from the future of e-commerce. 2. Filecoin (FIL): The Decentralized Storage Powerhouse Filecoin (FIL) has become the leading decentralized storage solution, providing a secure and efficient alternative to traditional services like AWS and Google Drive. Its blockchain-based network distributes data securely while offering cost efficiency and privacy. Recent integrations with NFT platforms, gaming, and AI applications have boosted its utility, making Filecoin a key player in data-heavy industries. However, its reliance on consistent network activity can lead to higher costs during peak demand. As one of the best blockchain innovations out there, Filecoin’s growing ecosystem and strong use case make it an essential project for traders seeking real-world utility and scalability. Its ability to meet the increasing demand for decentralized storage sets it apart in 2025. 3. Cosmos (ATOM): Bridging Blockchain Networks Cosmos (ATOM) addresses one of blockchain’s biggest challenges—interoperability. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol enables seamless sharing of data and assets across different blockchains, making it an essential tool for developers creating cross-chain applications. The protocol has spurred adoption, with dApps and enterprises relying on Cosmos to build interconnected ecosystems. Its dependence on multiple network participants can sometimes delay transaction processing. Despite this drawback, Cosmos remains one of the best blockchain innovations for its ability to connect isolated blockchain networks. Cosmos offers traders an opportunity to support a project solving real-world problems. Its role in enhancing scalability and blockchain communication ensures its continued relevance in the blockchain universe. 4. Algorand (ALGO): Sustainability Meets Speed Algorand (ALGO) combines speed, scalability, and sustainability, giving it a spot among the best blockchain innovations. Its pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism enables fast and secure transactions while minimizing energy consumption, appealing to eco-conscious investors. Recent use cases include central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and tokenized real estate, demonstrating Algorand’s versatility. However, its development structure has drawn criticism from some decentralization advocates, as it leans more centralized compared to other blockchains. Nevertheless, Algorand appeals to investors seeking projects that combine practicality and sustainability. Its focus on reducing environmental impact while maintaining efficiency makes it a key player in blockchain adoption for 2025. Innovation Meets Opportunity in 2025 Each project on this list exemplifies blockchain innovation. Filecoin enhances decentralized storage, Cosmos enables seamless blockchain communication, and Algorand delivers eco-friendly, scalable solutions. All improving the day-to-day activity of traders and real-world users. However, Web3Bay stands out for its focus on secure e-commerce and user empowerment, offering unmatched versatility. By addressing real-world challenges like data protection and privacy, Web3Bay redefines what a blockchain marketplace can achieve. Traders seeking impactful and practical investments will find Web3Bay a compelling choice among the best blockchain innovations in 2025.

Glassnode says on the social media platform X that BTC’s short-term demand momentum has dwindled. “One key indicator: Hot Capital (capital revived over the last 7 days) has plunged 66.7% from its December 12th peak of $96.2 billion to $32.0 billion.” Source: Glassnode/X The firm notes that BTC’s diminishing exchange volume momentum and low funding rates also hint at reduced demand. “The 30-day average of exchange volume is nearing the 365-day average, reflecting reduced capital flows since the December market top. The seven-day moving average of the mean funding rate, as well as the funding rates from the top three perpetual markets, remains below the neutral value of 0.01%. This indicates a continued absence of demand from aggressive buyers, despite the short rally toward $102,000. Without a new catalyst, the waning short-term demand suggests either a sideways consolidation period or a heightened likelihood of further correction.” Source: Glassnode/X Bitcoin is trading at $92,579 at time of writing. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 3% in the past 24 hours and more than 4% in the past seven days. BTC also remains more than 14% down from its all-time high of $ 108,135, which it set in December.

Two days ago, the atebites X account pointed out that THORChain’s lending service currently has nowhere near enough bitcoin to repay its creditors. As of the time of the post, the total amount of bitcoin to be repaid to depositors was 1,604, while the lending pool only had 592 bitcoin in it. We need to be raising awareness on just how bad of a shape Thorchain lending is right now, posing a potential risk to the protocol itself. As it stands, at current mark to market rates for RUNE, complete loan closure will mint 24 million RUNE. 1,604 in BTC collateral, 18,258… pic.twitter.com/OykZbMQCdx — atebites (@ate_bites) January 8, 2025 As Lava founder Shehzan Maredia explained in a post on X, when you borrow on THORChain, they sell the bitcoin you put up as collateral for their own token, RUNE. When you repay your loan, they sell the RUNE for bitcoin to give you back your collateral. I predicted the Thorchain collapse in 2023 when they launched their ""lending"" feature, and it's happening now. The lesson people never seem to learn: any system in crypto that can fail will fail. When you borrowed on Thorchain, they would sell your BTC collateral for their… — Shehzan (@MarediaShehzan) January 10, 2025 The actual mechanics of how this works are a bit more complex and are detailed on THORChain’s website. See screenshots from the website below: The primary issue in this scenario is that half of the value borrowed in U.S. dollar denominations was borrowed when bitcoin traded at significantly lower prices than that at which bitcoin trades today, according to atebites. This means that for THORChain to meet its current demands, it will need to mint upwards of 24 million RUNE (as of January 8). While this would only be about 8% of the circulating supply of RUNE , it would lead to a reduction in the price of the asset, which would give THORChain even less purchasing power as they try to buy bitcoin back on behalf of their creditors. If traders were to start shorting RUNE on top of this, THORChain’s ability to purchase the required amount of bitcoin to redeem its creditors would diminish even further. This could lead to something akin to the Terra/Luna death spiral we saw in 2022. With that said, prominent supporter of the project Erik Voorhees shared that THORChain's lending service is operating as it was intended to and that there is no foreseeable danger. Thorchain continues working as designed. Yes, loan redemptions cause downward pressure on RUNE price, but scale is not dangerous. If you're worried, just go pay off your loan. — Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) January 10, 2025 A core developer for THORChain that goes by the name Nine Realms on X also made the case that THORChain is resilient: 1/ Addressing Community Concerns There's been a lot of discussion recently about the state of the network and the outstanding lending protocol liability. Let’s dive into the facts to shed light on what’s really happening and why we remain confident in THORChain's resilience. — Nine Realms (@ninerealms_cap) January 10, 2025 While it surely isn’t a given that this situation will end in disaster, you may want to redeem the bitcoin you’ve put up as collateral via THORChain’s lending service just in case.

The proposed legislation would permit the state to store Bitcoin alongside traditional assets such as gold, silver, and platinum, making New Hampshire one of the first U.S. states to formally consider such a move. Hampshire Bill Proposes Investment in BTC and Gold The bill presented by Republican lawmaker Keith Ammon explains the plans to build a “strategic reserve” for the state with both physical and digital currencies. The bill aims at making it possible for New Hampshire’s treasury to invest in Bitcoin and precious metals for its reserves. Consequently, this represents a paradigm shift in the manner that states handle their financial assets as cryptocurrencies continue to gain acceptance. The bill also provides for how the digital assets will be secured as seen in the “secure custody solutions”. This would mean that the state would have to work with so called “qualified custodians” in order to avoid possible risks connected with storage of digital assets. The legislation seeks to address security and legal issues that are important especially given that more states are turning to cryptocurrencies like El Salvador BTC buying strategy. Rising Interest in Bitcoin Reserves Across States New Hampshire’s proposal follows similar steps taken by other states, such as Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The idea toward using Bitcoin as a reserve has become more popular in the last one year as more people are embracing cryptocurrencies and the use of decentralized finance. Incoming US president Donald Trump has also contributed to the discussion recently during his campaign where he pledged that United States would become the leader of cryptocurrency. The Trump administration had previously stated that the federal government owns 207,000 Bitcoin and this gave steam to other state-level initiatives like the one in New Hampshire. Dennis Porter, CEO of the Satoshi Action Fund, confirmed the bill’s introduction in a statement posted on the X . According to Porter, the bill seeks to position New Hampshire as a forward-thinking state by embracing digital assets and ensuring their safe storage. Global Interest in BTC as a Reserve Asset The idea of using Bitcoin as part of government reserves is not limited to the United States. Countries such as Brazil and Poland have also begun exploring this concept, with some nations taking steps to include cryptocurrencies in their national treasuries. Notably, Bhutan recently announced its plans to expand crypto adoption in its Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC) initiative. Bhutan’s decision to hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin in its reserves highlights the growing global acceptance of digital assets. Binance Co-Founder Changpeng Zhao remarked that this approach reflects a willingness to diversify reserves beyond Bitcoin alone. Should the bill be approved, New Hampshire may become a pioneer in the implementation of the cryptocurrency into the public sector financial systems. However, the bill could be opposed by politicians who remain skeptical of the digital assets’ price fluctuations and the safety of storage solutions.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Meme Index set to become the next crypto presale gem after raising $2 million in 2 weeks. Table of Contents Why a meme coin index could help manage volatility MEMEX gives access to meme coin indexes How to join the MEMEX presale The crypto market had a difficult final stretch in 2024, which has extended into this year. Despite this, Meme Index (MEMEX), a new coin, is reaching impressive milestones. In just two weeks, the MEMEX presale has raised nearly $2.1 million, attracting huge investor interest. Meme coins have continued to shine in 2025. Early signs still point toward bullish market tendencies across the wider crypto markets, as over 14% of all Bitcoin is currently being stored in long-term holdings like ETFs, company and country treasuries, and DeFi platforms. Meme Index is benefiting from long-term crypto strategies, as it’s the world’s first-ever meme coin index platform, designed to simplify meme coin investing. Through the Meme Index platform, MEMEX token holders will be able to diversify and control their investments by staking their MEMEX across various meme coin indexes (also known as baskets). These indexes will represent the price action of different collections of meme coins, specially curated to match the needs of all kinds of investors, from conservative players to degens. This arrangement saves market participants from being overwhelmed by the number of meme coins on the market, benefiting from the price performance of an expertly chosen selection of tokens instead of building their portfolios from scratch. Early buyers can buy MEMEX tokens for $0.015043. However, there’s a limited window to buy the token at this price before the presale moves on to its next stage and the price increases.

In this year’s first week, the meme coin market’s value rose to over $116 billion. However, it has again declined to around $110 billion at the time of writing. One new meme coin, SPX6900, broke into the billion-dollar market cap club after rising 57% in just a week. Moreover, Kekius Maximus surged over 4,000% after an Elon Musk reference sparked instant hype on social media. These examples demonstrate the chaotic and exciting nature of meme coins but also show the value of an index-based approach to investing. MEMEX gives access to meme coin indexes Holding MEMEX will allow investors to stake tokens in their choice of indexes through the Meme Index platform, enabling them to benefit from the price movements of a range of meme coins at once. Here’s a quick look at Meme Index’s offerings: Meme Titan Index: This is the “blue chip” index, containing established coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. While these tokens may not produce the exponential gains of ultra-small-cap coins, they remain solid picks for those looking for a bit more stability. Moonshot Index: This index targets tokens with under $1 billion market cap. It aims for a relatively higher growth potential, but carries a higher degree of risk than the Meme Titan Index. Midcap Index: This index focuses on tokens with market caps between $50 million and $250 million. If they break the $1 billion mark, these tokens could be valued at 4x to 20x. Meme Frenzy Index: This one lists ultra-volatile and lesser-known tokens that could easily explode (or drop) in a very short amount of time. Even a single success could hugely boost this index’s performance. It’s worth noting that MEMEX holders will also be able to vote through the Meme Index governance system, deciding which tokens will be included in (or removed from) the various indexes. This transformative concept has caught the attention of crypto influencer ClayBro, who recently shared a positive review of Meme Index with his 134,000 YouTube subscribers. With mainstream influencers highlighting Meme Index’s creations, the buzz surrounding MEMEX could continue to grow. To provide peace of mind for security-conscious investors, top security firms like Coinsult and SolidProof have successfully audited the platform’s smart contract. How to join the MEMEX presale Early investors have under a day left to buy MEMEX tokens at $0.015043. To get involved, visit the Meme Index official presale page to connect a crypto wallet (including Best Wallet , Wallet Connect, Metamask, and Coinbase Wallet). MEMEX can be bought using USDT, ETH, BNB, or even a standard bank card. After buying, MEMEX tokens can also be staked for a high APY of 1,098% per annum.

This is the longest green candle period since the start of the year 2017 signifying renewed interest in the digital asset. Source :X Blockstream CEO Adam Back suggested that such an unusual trading pattern may signal time-weighted average price (TWAP) buying. He noted that a large institutional investor or a major market maker may be accumulating bitcoin at the current price. Back also noted that short-sellers closing their positions may have also helped the rally as they made money and reinvested in downturns. He also suggested that Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy or other large investors may be using the latest price fluctuations to increase their Bitcoin positions. “Maybe @saylor or someone institutional using the dip to build a position ahead of inauguration 10 days, tick tock.” Adam Back This type of buying behavior often signals confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term value despite its current volatility. After the streak, Bitcoin followed a downward trend and fell by almost 3% in the next three hours. This week, the price of Bitcoin dropped significantly from its recent high of more than $100,000 to about $91,200. This has led to market-wide liquidations and increased trader’s risk aversion. As of this writing, Bitcoin has risen to $95,022 after falling to local lows within three days of a price drop. Factors behind Bitcoin’s decline Favorable conditions in the US labor market and services have made it less probable for the Fed to make an aggressive rate cut in 2025. This has led to higher treasury yields and a rise in the US Dollar, which is negative for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Market sentiment has been bearish with over $390 million in total cryptocurrency liquidations within the last 24 hours only. This is reflected in the $54 million worth of Bitcoin positions reported on Coinglass. Source: Coinglass This high level of liquidation results from the macroeconomic conditions that influence the leveraged traders and market sentiment. Further pressure comes from the US government’s plan to sell 69,370 Bitcoins seized from the Silk Road marketplace. This expected sale, which is expected to fetch $6.5 billion. In addition, institutional sentiment has deteriorated with big ETF outflows.

The term “hashrate” refers to the computational power used to secure the Bitcoin network by solving complex mathematical problems. The hashrate of #bitcoin is nearing ATH, at 57EH/s! pic.twitter.com/a4GzqAT16r — A v B (@ArminVanBitcoin) May 21, 2019 Russell Cann, Chief Development Officer of publicly traded Bitcoin mining company Core Scientific, told Cryptonews that a rising hashrate reflects greater confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. “When hashrate grows, the Bitcoin network becomes more secure, reducing risks and enhancing its reliability as a store of value,” Cann explained. “This strengthened security can boost investor confidence, prompting greater accumulation by both institutions and individuals who see Bitcoin as a safe and appreciating asset,” she added. Cann further explained that increasing hashrate plays an important role in profitability for miners. “When miners are benefiting from reduced operational costs, such as lower energy prices or more efficient equipment, and BTC prices remain stable or rise, their profit margins improve. This financial stability enables miners to retain their BTC rather than liquidating it to cover costs, further adding to the recent increase in holdings,” Cann said. US Miners Report Increasing Hashrate US-based mining firm CleanSpark reported a total of 668 BTC mined in December and 7,024 BTC for the entire year of 2024. In a report published on January 6 , the company also disclosed a 287.9% year-over-year increase in its hashrate. https://t.co/74iKIHSdKg — CleanSpark Inc. (@CleanSpark_Inc) January 6, 2025 Taylor Monning, CleanSpark’s CTO, told Cryptonews that the firm’s Bitcoin mining holding balance has grown over 236% – from 3,000 Bitcoin in December 2023 to above 10,000 last month. “We have rapidly increased our hashrate, which now exceeds 39 exahash per second (EH/s), making us the second largest public mining company by production,” Monning said. “We recently surpassed our 20,000 Bitcoin mined in just four years of mining, so holding almost half of that in our treasury demonstrates that we know how to grow while managing capital.” Similarly, Bitcoin mining company Riot has also reported steady growth in its Bitcoin production. Riot’s December 2024 operations update showed a 155% increase in its deployed hashrate for 2024. Operating across multiple mining facilities in Texas and Kentucky, Riot attributed this growth to increased production efforts and heightened network difficulty following Bitcoin’s April 2024 halving event. Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Expected to Increase in 2025 Notably, the United States accounted for over 40% of the Bitcoin network’s global hashrate at the end of 2024. According to TheMinerMag, US-based Bitcoin miner Foundry USA grew its hashrate from 157 EH/s at the start of 2024 to roughly 280 EH/s by December. The MinerMag also notes that Foundry is currently the largest mining pool by hashrate, controlling approximately 36.5% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate. Cann believes that BTC hashrate will continue to increase in the coming year. This will be due to instutional involvement in Bitcoin, along with other factors. “Large-scale mining operations continue to expand due to rising institutional interest,” Cann said. “Companies with access to capital are also deploying more mining rigs, which can be due to increased optimism in the industry.” Advancements in mining technology are also influencing hashrate growth. New-generation mining rigs with higher energy efficiency and better computational performance are enabling miners to add more hash power to the network at a lower cost. Nick Hansen, CEO of Luxor Technology – a Bitcoin mining pool provider – told Cryptonews that the large scale deployment of new generation X21 series, along with MicroBT’s M6X, is driving network hashrate growth. Riot is buying $162 million of MicroBT WhatsMiner #bitcoin rigs, 7.6 EH/s, super-efficient and immersion-ready. https://t.co/z5guNRsQDF — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) June 26, 2023 “Miners are achieving almost 50% more hashrate per MW than the previous generation machines,” he said. Monning also pointed out that the rapid interest in government nations to both mine Bitcoin and also build a Bitcoin reserve has been influential. “This level of interest has never been seen in Bitcoin before, and it is bringing new players to the market, which is increasing hashrate,” he said. Yet while rising hashrate indicates confidence in the value of Bitcoin, it also makes the mining process more competitive . “This drives miners to seek efficiency and lower operational costs to stay profitable,” Cann said. Greater Transparency in Bitcoin Mining Operations The transparency behind Bitcoin’s rising hashrate has also become noteworthy. #Bitcoin 's hashrate is more transparent than ever.

By December 2024 , approximately 31.6% of global Bitcoin production could be directly linked to 19 publicly traded mining companies that disclose their proprietary mining performance monthly. Source: TheMinerMag Jeff LaBerge, Bitdeer’s Head of Capital Markets and Strategic Initiatives, told Cryptonews that apart from disclosures as a publicly listed mining company, Bitdeer is also committed to a greater level of transparency this year in the production of its mining rigs. “This will benefit the wider ecosystem and resilience of our industry,” LaBerge said.

The CFPB took the first procedural step to open a proposal to public comment on Friday that would set up a framework to apply the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to virtual wallets and stablecoins – the digital tokens tied to the value of a steady asset, commonly the U.S. dollar. While that has heavy implications to the way U.S. stablecoin firms and crypto wallet providers would do business, it's at a preliminary stage with Trump about to arrive at the White House with the power to appoint a new CFPB chief. Unlike other agency heads, such as those at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra appears unlikely to step down voluntarily. Since the agency's creation after the 2008 global financial meltdown, its leaders have often occupied a more aggressive posture than other regulators, and Republican lawmakers have actively sought to weaken the CFPB's powers. In 2020, the Supreme Court confirmed the president can fire and replace the director at will – a power Trump is expected to exercise. This last-minute regulatory effort would have to survive the arrival of a Trump-appointed leader before it could be finalized and put into effect. Even if this were a final rule, the Republican-led Congress would have a chance to erase it with its Congressional Review Act authority. Were it to survive, the regulation as proposed – and now opened for a public comment period – looks at stablecoins as a payment mechanism. The existing law's reference to ""funds"" should include stablecoins, the proposal suggests, and it could arguably also include other more volatile cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. ""Under this interpretation, the term 'funds' would include stablecoins, as well as any other similarly-situated fungible assets that either operate as a medium of exchange or as a means of paying for goods or services,"" the proposal stated . It additionally said the law's reach into financial ""accounts"" should include ""virtual currency wallets that can be used to buy goods and services or make person-to-person transfers,"" specifically if they're being used for retail transactions and not the buying and selling of securities or commodities. Institutions who provide such accounts would fall under regulatory requirements to make consumer disclosures and provide protections against unauthorized transactions and the ability to cancel improper transfers. Those government demands could run afoul of the way crypto operations are often set up – such as in decentralized finance (DeFi) – as person-to-person platforms without outside interference, or with wallet technology provided for users to run themselves. Consumer advocacy group Better Markets applauded the agency's proposal on Friday. ""The CFPB’s proposal today extends the EFTA protections to non-bank digital payment mechanisms,"" Dennis Kelleher, the group's president, said in a statement. ""That would not only protect consumers, but also level the playing field among digital payment mechanisms whether involving a bank checking or savings account or another consumer asset account such as those used by crypto and video game firms."" The Cato Institute's Jack Solowey, a policy analyst at the conservative think tank, countered in a post on social-media site X that the CFPB's arguments for this rule are ""embarrassingly conclusory,"" without even dealing with decentralized ledgers and self-hosted wallets. Bill Hughes, director of global regulatory matters at Consensys, the Ethereum development company, also railed against the move on X , suggesting, ""Add this to the list of 'law by decree' problems that need to be fixed.""",Policy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-10 21:22:45

Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov have been charged with money laundering in connection with crypto mixing services Blender.io and Sinbad.io, according to the DOJ. Blender operated for four years, from 2018 to 2022, before U.S. authorities shut down its site. Sinbad emerged as a replacement after Blender’s closure, but federal investigators also targeted its platform. Brent S. Wible, a Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General at the DOJ, stated that the defendants created “safe havens” for criminals to launder illicit funds. The DOJ confirmed that Ostapenko and Oleynik were arrested last month, while Tarasov remains at large and is wanted by U.S. prosecutors. By allegedly operating these mixers, the defendants made it easier for state-sponsored hacking groups and other cybercriminals to profit from offenses that jeopardized both public safety and national security.

The U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, leading to legal action against its developers in the U.S. and the Netherlands. In November 2024, a federal appeals court overturned the Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash, ruling that the sanctions were unlawful. However, federal prosecutors have continued pursuing cases against the mixer’s founders, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov.

This initiative marks an important milestone in the Senate’s approach to regulating the digital assets industry. Cynthia Lummis Selected as Chair Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret shared the development in a January 10 post on X, noting that Senator Cynthia Lummis has been chosen to head the subcommittee. However, her appointment remains subject to approval in a vote scheduled for the near future. According to an earlier report , the establishment of the initiative is one of Scott’s first priorities as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. This body plays a critical role in supervising major financial regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The South Carolina lawmaker plans to structure the new entity based on a similar crypto-focused subcommittee established by Patrick McHenry in 2023 under the House Financial Services Committee. In 2024, the House passed an important crypto bill known as the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), developed by its crypto branch. This legislation aims to clarify the regulatory responsibilities of various agencies overseeing the crypto industry. Congressman French Hill, one of the legislation’s co-authors, previously highlighted its strict consumer protections, including a prohibition on the commingling of customer funds, which he believes will prevent collapses like that of FTX. Meanwhile, Hill was also recently appointed as the new chair of the House Financial Services Committee, succeeding McHenry. Members of the Committee According to an internal memo issued by Scott and reviewed by FOX Business, Republican members that have been selected for the new division include freshman senators Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania, as well as Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee. All are described as being strong crypto advocates. It remains unclear which Democratic leaders will join the new outfit. However, Elizabeth Warren, a prominent crypto critic, is the party’s most senior member on the Senate Banking Committee. This development comes just days after Republicans officially assumed control of the Senate, solidifying their legislative majority. With President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration set for January 20, the party will hold unified control of both Congress and the White House. The formation of the subcommittee is viewed as a significant step toward fulfilling the GOP’s commitment to advancing crypto-related legislation, aligning with Trump’s promise to position the United States as a global leader in the digital asset industry.

To read full editions, subscribe . Toronto-based Cypherpunk Holdings rebranded as Sol Strategies and announced it would be accumulating Solana three months ago. It’s gotten busy since then. The holding company has acquired two separate validator operations, accumulated over 142,000 SOL worth roughly $27 million at current prices, hired Kraken’s former senior director of engineering to be its head of staking, and applied to be listed on the Nasdaq. Just this week, it signed a credit facility with its board chair to buy $17.3 million worth of SOL tokens and announced a private placement deal with ParaFi Capital worth roughly $19 million. MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor is fond of saying that “there is no second best” crypto behind bitcoin. If there is a second-best version of MicroStrategy’s corporate crypto purchasing playbook , it just might be the one Sol Strategies is running. Like Saylor’s firm, Sol Strategies is focused on acquiring crypto as a treasury asset. The difference, CEO Leah Wald told me, is that Sol Strategies also runs a validator business and invests in Solana ecosystem projects, making its approach “more dynamic.” Following Sol Strategies’ two validator acquisitions, it now is responsible for a combined 1.5 million staked SOL, which makes it roughly the 65th largest Solana validator. Wald declined to say which ecosystem projects Sol Strategies has taken positions in, if any. Wald came to Cypherpunk Holdings in July 2024 after a four-year run at the helm of US-based crypto management firm Valkyrie, which had its ETF business acquired by CoinShares in March. Wald had been a board member at Cypherpunk since October 2021. Charged with taking over a company that had seen its stock trade sideways for years, Wald — who was among the first to file for and issue bitcoin futures ETFs — saw a new opportunity. Solana was hot , but it lacked ETFs that investors could trade on traditional stock exchanges. So far, the SOL strategy appears to be working out. Since debuting as Sol Strategies in September, the company’s stock price is up more than 1,700% — and that’s while a Nasdaq listing is still pending approval. There’s probably a storm approaching Sol Strategies’ parade in the form of Solana ETFs. Currently, Sol Strategies is one of just a few publicly-traded companies giving investors regulated exposure to Solana’s price action by virtue of holding the asset in its treasury. If Solana ETFs get approved, the market would gain competitors offering a similar service (although whether or not those ETF issuers include staking rewards will be key to watch). Sol Strategies will hope the market treats it like a bitcoin mining stock in that case. But for now, Wald and Sol Strategies’ big bet is paying big dividends.

Scaramucci, a former White House Communications Director and longtime Wall Street professional, provided his insights on various crypto assets—starting with his bullish stance on Ethereum (ETH) and expanding to a range of altcoins he believes will play a central role in shaping the future of decentralized technology. Ethereum: The Long-Term Crypto Winner Scaramucci began by identifying Ethereum as one of his key picks for the coming years. According to him, Ethereum’s market perception has undergone cyclical changes, which he likened to trends going “in and out of fashion.” Reflecting on his decades of experience in traditional finance, Scaramucci explained: Related Reading: Crypto Market Will Peak In Mid To Late March, Predicts Arthur Hayes “When I got into the industry, biotech stocks were hot, then it flipped over to insurance stocks, and then it was the world of alternative investing in hedge funds We go through waves and cycles of what’s in and out of fashion. And so weirdly, Ethereum is like out of fashion a little bit, which I’m surprised by because it’s got such great applications and it’s got a muscularity to it […] and it’s got dominance. So I do believe Ethereum is a winner, and I think it’s a long-term winner.” The billionaire investor underscored Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, highlighting its wide-ranging utility and established track record. His view is that while newer chains may offer speed and lower costs, Ethereum still holds a vital position as the smart contract platform of choice for countless decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols. Solana (SOL) After reaffirming his faith in Ethereum, Scaramucci turned his attention to Solana (SOL), touting its performance and cost-effectiveness: “I think that Solana—it’s cheaper and faster, and now that network is handling lots of volume. It’s got a good cross-section of different things going on […] We’re long a lot of Solana. I’ll be fully disclosed and tell you that.” Polkadot (DOT) Continuing his survey of promising altcoins, Scaramucci singled out Polkadot (DOT) for its potential in Web3 and gaming: “I own Polkadot. I like what Polkadot is capable of doing in the gaming industry, and I’m still a big believer that Web3 gaming will happen […] There’ll be sort of a Renaissance there.” Related Reading: Best Altcoins In 2025: Top Analyst Reveals His Picks He drew an analogy between today’s early-stage Web3 environment and the era of VHS tapes and Blockbuster Video. While it may be difficult to visualize the full potential of blockchain-based gaming experiences right now, Scaramucci believes Polkadot’s interoperability-focused platform could be instrumental in powering immersive digital ecosystems that lie just over the horizon. Avalanche (AVAX) Scaramucci did not stop there, briefly touching on Avalanche (AVAX) as another network he foresees doing well in the broader crypto market. Although he provided fewer specific details, his endorsement points to Avalanche’s known strengths—scalability, fast finality, and a growing suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. “I think Avalanche will do well,” he stated. Algorand (ALGO) Turning to Algorand, Scaramucci shared insights from his personal holding in the asset, which he’s maintained for four years. Acknowledging the platform’s management shifts, he nevertheless remains optimistic: “I think [Algorand] lost a step when they made some management changes, but there’s a guy by the name of John Wood there […] I think he’s a very, very, very smart guy, and he’s putting some stuff together there, and I think that one is undervalued.” Sui And Aptos Rounding out his altcoin picks, Scaramucci also named Sui (SUI) and Aptos (APT) as projects with solid long-term prospects: “Sui and Aptos—I’m a long-term believer in those as well. I don’t think there’ll be one chain.” Ultimately, Scaramucci illustrated his broader stance on the crypto asset landscape, underlining Bitcoin as the undisputed market leader, yet insisting that alternative blockchains will also play crucial roles: “Bitcoin is the pope, but there’s a college of cardinals… that will be very useful in terms of what their applications are and their networks ultimately become over the next five to fifteen years.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,319.

Pepe Rescues Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Rescues Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Rescues Trump by entering its contract address – HtgdKmNDff2UgXmmJYCryKhjVE2F89XMncNt8oThipHz – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPERTRU. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 21:32:00

The analyst predicted that ADA could rebound to $1 following a potential price breakout. Cardano Price Could Rebound To $1 As Bull Pennant Appears In an X post , Ali Martinez stated that the Cardano price could break out from a bull pennant on lower time frames, signaling a potential surge to $1. This is a price level that ADA corrected from the marketwide sell-off, which began earlier this week. The analyst had previously revealed how Whales sold over 70 million coins between January 6 and 8, which put significant selling pressure on the ADA price . However, based on Martinez’s recent analysis, Cardano could soon witness a bullish reversal. Crypto analyst Sebastian also predicted that a rebound may be imminent for the Cardano price. The analyst revealed a possible inverse head-and-shoulder that was forming on the hourly ADA chart. The crypto analyst also noted that the Bitcoin price is bouncing nicely, and ADA is following. He added that the pump after this dip would be epic and that the dip would be forgotten in a week from now. ADA Holders Are On The Rise In an X post, on-chain analytics platform Santiment revealed that ADA holders are on the rise, which provides a bullish outlook for the Cardano price. According to the platform, the number of Cardano wallets has increased by 2,800. This represents a 0.1% increase in holders since the start of 2025. Santiment noted that if wallets are rising fast, the community is confident in the project for the long term. A recent ADA technical analysis showed that the Cardano price boasts more bullish than bearish indicators, which explains why investors could be bullish on the coin for the long term. However, in the short term, ADA and the broader crypto market are undoubtedly still at risk of a significant price correction, especially following the release of the nonfarm payrolls report, which reduced optimism of a Fed rate cut in the first half of this year.

38760938,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=641448,1736544947,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38760938.jpeg,US regulator proposes making crypto wallets liable for hack-related losses,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-regulator-proposes-crypto-wallets-liable/,"The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has proposed a rule to make wallet providers responsible for hacks resulting in crypto asset loss. In a notice published on January 10, the regulator suggested that the US Electronic Fund Transfer Act could also apply to digital currencies. According to the agency , the rule will allow crypto wallets and accounts created for personal, family, or household use to enjoy the same protections as a regular bank account. Under the EFTA, consumers enjoy protection against error and fraud due to electronic fund transfers (EFTs). It said: “EFTA provides a considerable set of rights to consumers to dispute errors and limit their liability for unauthorized EFTs, among other things.” The regulator believes the protections should apply equally to virtual currency wallets for holding and transferring stablecoins or fungible tokens. This would make such wallets consumer accounts and bring them under CFPB regulations. The proposed rule reads: “Based on the plain language used in EFTA and the reasoning of judicial decisions, as well as the CFPB’s experience in market monitoring, it has long been clear that the term’ funds’ in EFTA is not limited to fiat currency like US dollars. The CFPB interprets the term ‘funds’ as assets that act or are used like money…” However, the regulator has asked for comments from the public, noting that comments will be open to the public until March 31. Although it accepts comments via mail, CFPB has advised that users opt for the electronic method, either through email or the Federal eRulemaking portal, as this would be faster. Industry stakeholders kick against the proposed rule Meanwhile, the proposed rule has attracted negative reactions from the crypto stakeholders. Despite the rising incidents of crypto hacks, with losses in 2024 exceeding that of 2023, according to several blockchain security firms, including Peckshield, Scam Sniffer, and Certik, many believe this rule will not fix the problem. Consensys lawyer Bill Hughes believes the rule burdens wallet providers unnecessarily, even for consumers’ negligence. He noted that wallet providers would become liable for any unauthorized transfer, including when someone gains control of a user’s device through fraud, robbery, hacking, and cyber theft. The firm is the maker of MetaMask, the most popular crypto wallet. He said: “Hacked because you tweeted you emailed your seed phrase or believed that fashion model in Malaysia needed 5000 bucks to fly to see you? Don’t worry your wallet might have to cover it . . .” In his opinion, this is another example of a regulatory agency choosing to legislate through administrative rulemaking, which he describes as “law by decree.” Hughes added that US regulators will keep trying to take control of crypto until someone stops their efforts, and he believes that person would be Donald Trump when he is sworn in. Hughes is not alone on this stance. One user observed that it could become an infinite money glitch, with malicious users even using it to enrich themselves. Paradigm chief legal officer Katie Biber also questioned the CFPB’s logic and how impractical it would be for noncustodial wallets. She added that this is merely an attempt by the CFPB to regulate anything that touches the dollar. She wrote: “Let’s say I choose to carry cash instead of holding $ with a bank. If I drop my wallet, CFPB thinks the manufacturer is responsible. Which means they stop selling wallets.” Meanwhile, many see it as further proof of Joe Biden’s administration’s anti-crypto position and validates why Kamala Harris did not get elected. Interestingly, the CFPB is one of the federal agencies that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is considering axing.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. These 3 cryptos could be the next to surge following XRP’s November 2024 rise. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Kaspa Tron Conclusion XRP rose by 420%, going from $0.50 to $2.63. This outstanding performance has attracted interest, particularly as investors search for the next cryptocurrency with such growth potential. Notably, three cryptocurrencies — Rexas Finance (RXS), Kaspa (KAS), and TRON (TRX) — are likely to provide similar increases soon. Rexas Finance With a novel platform focusing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance has quickly become a notable competitor in the crypto market. Rexas Finance aims to use blockchain technology to help people establish, oversee, and trade tokenized assets, including real estate, artwork, and other valuable assets. This is a major advance in democratizing access to once-restricted, high-value investment possibilities for retail investors. RXS, which started its presale at $0.175, has seen a value rise of 483%. The presale has raised $35,257,637 through sales of 392,184,213 tokens. This success is motivated not by venture capital assistance but by the great interest of private investors who believe in its objective. Timed precisely with the height of the bull run, Rexas Finance is scheduled to debut on main markets in early 2025. With estimates of a 40,000% rise by the end of 2025, analysts believe this calculated action might set off an amazing price surge. Rexas Finance is among the most exciting cryptocurrencies to watch in 2025 with its creative approach and great community support. You might also like: After Dogecoin in 2021, here’s the next token poised to turn $400 into $40000 Kaspa Both analysts and investors are drawn to the quite young but promising cryptocurrency Kaspa. At the time of writing KAS was trading at $0.114, with a market cap of $2.9 billion and a circulating supply of around 25 billion tokens. Kaspa distinguishes itself with its original GHOSTDAG consensus system, which enables it process thousands of TPS without sacrificing decentralization. Kaspa’s scalability makes it perfect for DeFi. The project offers investors an interesting chance to join in since it is still quite underrated in the larger market. Demand for KAS tokens will probably explode as awareness rises and more people see the possibilities of Kaspa’s technology. This, together with low transaction costs and remarkable scalability, makes Kaspa a fierce competitor for notable increases in the coming months. Tron TRX was trading at $0.242 at the time of writing with a market cap of $20.85 billion and a circulating supply of 86.17 billion. Tron has proven to be a dependable and scalable blockchain solution for dApps. Through alliances with big companies like BitTorrent and several entertainment platforms, Tron is promoting itself as a top platform for digital content, gaming, and more. The TRON Virtual Machine (TVM) debut has let developers create dApps with low fees and great scalability, appealing to a broad spectrum of developers. Although TRX might not see the same dramatic expansion as smaller, newer cryptocurrencies, its established presence, excellent technology, and ongoing development make it a smart long-term investment. TRX is positioned to witness significant price increases as more businesses choose Tron’s blockchain for their dApps and as DeFi keeps expanding. Conclusion The amazing increase of XRP in November 2024 brought attention to other cryptocurrencies with great development capacity. Rexas Finance, Kaspa, and Tron could follow Ripple’s route and see significant gains in the next few months. Rexas Finance leads the push in real-world asset tokenization, Kaspa offers unmatched scalability, and Tron keeps extending its blockchain ecosystem. These three projects provide a mix of creative technology, strong foundations, and long-term development potential for investors wishing to profit from the next significant movement in the crypto market.

However, a new wave of innovation is emerging in the cryptocurrency market, AI altcoins. Among these, RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out as a transformative force set to deliver significant returns.

He arrived at the agency in February 2023, a month before the CFTC sued Binance and then-CEO Changpeng Zhao for violating U.S. commodities laws. During his tenure, he also oversaw the conclusion of the enforcement work against collapsed global platform FTX, which he characterized as the largest recovery of dollars for victims in CFTC history. The agency has since pursued actions against KuCoin and Falcon Labs, among other projects. In a 2023 speech, McGinley addressed the agency's special focus on digital assets, saying, ""The CFTC has risen to the challenge in a remarkable fashion."" In the statement announcing his January 17 departure, ""establishing the CFTC as a premier law enforcement agency for digital asset enforcement"" was listed first among the priorities of his tenure. The CFTC's cousin agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, usually gets more attention (and industry criticism) for its crypto enforcement work, though both have pursued dozens of major cases.McGinley's departure opens a path for Republicans to redirect the agency's enforcement work when a Trump appointee takes over the chairmanship. Trump's transition crew has reportedly eyed a long list of potential CFTC chiefs but hasn't pulled the trigger as quickly as it did on the marquee opening atop of the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if crypto legislation makes headway in 2025, the CFTC could overtake the SEC' as the dominant agency overseeing U.S. digital assets markets.

That’s exactly what’s happening this week with some of the hottest new meme coins on the block. While Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) is charming its way into portfolios and Mog Coin (MOG) rides its community-driven wave, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is flipping the script. With over $5.1 million raised, 63 billion coins sold, and a thriving Bulls Squad community, BTFD is more than a meme—it’s a movement. Add in its live P2E game and 90% APY staking, and it’s no wonder this presale is making waves. Meanwhile, MEW and MOG hold their ground, offering compelling stories and community-driven momentum. These are the top new meme coins to buy this week, so let’s dive into what makes them tick, starting with the unstoppable BTFD Coin. The Unique Bulls Squad and BTFD Coin’s Game-Changing Rise Ready to ride the next big thing in crypto? BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token. It’s a movement built on seizing opportunities during market dips. Launched with the ethos of “ Buy The Dip,” this Ethereum-based token is rallying investors with a presale that has already raised over $5.1 million and sold more than 63 billion tokens. With an exclusive staking reward system offering 90% APY and a P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, BTFD is firing on all cylinders. At the heart of this phenomenon is the Bulls Squad—a passionate community of over 8,000 holders. This team isn’t just about holding tokens; they’re about building something bigger. Each member represents a unique facet of the BTFD ecosystem: Baby Bull: The fun-loving face of the movement, keeping everyone hyped. Raging Bull: The creative powerhouse designing bold visuals. Nerdy Bull: The tech genius ensuring seamless operations. Peoples Bull: The community connector, fostering a strong family vibe. With a presale price of $0.000142, investors who hop on now stand to gain significantly. Let’s say you invest $1,150 at this stage. You’d bag around 8,098,592 BTFD tokens. When the presale ends and BTFD launches at $0.0006, your investment’s value could soar to over $4,800. That’s the kind of potential that’s turning heads in the top new meme coins to buy this week. Plus, the referral program sweetens the deal: Share your unique code and earn 10% of purchases made by your referrals. It’s a win-win that’s fueling even more excitement. With its bold roadmap and a focus on community-driven growth, BTFD is more than a coin; it’s your ticket to a bullish future. MEW: A Cat in a Dog’s World Amidst the flood of dog-themed meme coins, MEW is a refreshing standout. Launched on Solana in March 2024, this cat-themed token has carved out its niche with a charming narrative of resilience and adaptability. It’s currently trading at $0.0059, and analysts predict it could reach $0.011 by the end of 2025. MEW’s journey isn’t just about price gains. Back in October 2024, it made headlines as its market cap approached $1 billion, a testament to its growing popularity. The token’s strength lies in its community, which thrives on the idea of a cat navigating a dog’s world—a playful metaphor for its unique position in the meme coin market. For investors, MEW offers a narrative-driven opportunity with long-term potential. It’s perfect for those who appreciate a strong story backing their investments. Mog Coin: Community-Driven Potential Mog Coin (MOG) has been making waves since its launch on Ethereum in July 2023. Known for its quirky branding—a laughing cartoon cat in Pit Viper sunglasses—MOG is all about community power. Its current price of $0.00000206 reflects its early-stage positioning, but the potential is undeniable. December 2024 marked a milestone as Coinbase added MOG to its listing roadmap, sparking a 20% surge and bringing its market cap close to $1 billion. With predictions of steady growth through 2030, MOG’s appeal lies in its community-driven ethos and speculative upside. For those who value grassroots momentum and a fun, meme-inspired vibe, MOG is a must-watch. The Final Word While MEW and MOG offer compelling stories and strong communities, BTFD Coin’s Bulls Squad is the ultimate game-changer.

At the heart of Solana is SOL , its native cryptocurrency. SOL powers the network, allowing users to make transactions and run programs while rewarding those who support the network. The potential of SOL lies in its platform’s technology. Solana avoids the complexities of splitting the network or adding extra layers for speed. Instead, it offers a high-capacity network from the start. This approach makes it attractive to developers and investors seeking fast and efficient solutions. In the current market, where scalability and speed are important, SOL stands out. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, coins with strong technology like SOL may catch the eye of those looking for the next big thing in blockchain. Conclusion The 2025 bull run will benefit coins like SOL, but XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme ecosystem may offer even greater rewards to early investors.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DTX Exchange amazes the online trading space with its hybrid platform. Table of Contents DTX Exchange to transform online trading DTX Exchange’s ICO rewards investors with a 600% return The future of DTX Exchange The DTX Exchange (DTX) is causing a major shift in online trading. For a long time centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like PancakeSwap have been the primary players in this market. However, DTX’s transformative hybrid trading system could change all that. This platform brings together CEX and DEX strengths and eliminates their weaknesses, setting new trading standards. Interest in this project is rising as CoinMarketCap listed its native token, DTX. This is a bullish development as millions of new traders could set their eyes on it. With the altcoin now in phase seven of its presale, experts suggest its long-term growth potential is great, predicting a 3x surge in 2025. DTX Exchange to transform online trading DTX Exchange made headlines recently through its hybrid trading platform. On it, people will trade over 120k asset classes like stocks, bonds, and crypto coins in total privacy, thanks to the lack of sign-up KYC checks. Not only that, fast transaction speeds of 0.04 seconds and up to 1,000x leverage on assets could make DTX Exchange a fan-favorite. However, this project is still a work in progress, as the design will continue evolving. Nevertheless, over 300k users have already been onboarded, which shows traders’ interest. The hype grew stronger since its launch was preceded by the Phoenix Wallet launch (a secure custody solution for crypto coins and stocks) and the VulcanX testnet blockchain launch. Notably, the testnet showcased a massive 100k TPS. With all these features, DTX Exchange aims to remove the weaknesses of CEXs and DEXs , including high fees, regulatory problems, and slow transaction speeds. The DTX Exchange is separating itself from rivals and could potentially rank among the leading trading platforms.

Holding it will bring many perks. For example, DTX holders will have the ability to change the future of the DTX Exchange through governance voting rights. Additionally, they will get discounts on trading fees and a percentage of the trading fee revenue generated on the platform. As a result, millions of traders are rushing to its crypto ICO event to buy DTX for a discount. The DTX Exchange has raised over $11M in its presale so far and may reach $20M soon. Currently, DTX costs $0.14, a 600% rise from its starting price of $0.02. The altcoin’s price will rise to $0.16 after phase eight begins. Furthermore, investors are waiting for a top-tier crypto exchange like Uniswap to list DTX. Once this happens, a massive rally to $0.20 is expected. This could bring a 42% return for anyone buying this crypto coin. The future of DTX Exchange DTX Exchange could be a real market disruptor. Given that data suggests the online trading market could be worth $13.3B by 2026, DTX Exchange strategically positions itself to make millions. Experts remain bullish because the DTX token also has a smaller market cap and a fair launch model that benefits both whales and retail investors. They foresee this token potentially soaring by 3x in 2025, making it one of the promising cryptos for fast returns. For more information on DTX Exchange, visit their presale , website , or Telegram .

Ethereum witnessed a huge surge in on-chain activity in the past week, with the outflow from crypto exchanges suggesting an accumulation trend. The last time such a high ETH outflow from exchanges occurred was in November 2024. IntoTheBlock’s data showed that ETH’s total exchange netflow (total inflows minus total outflows) was—$60.57M, highlighting the high amount of ETH leaving exchanges for wallets. According to the platform’s data, 74% of ETH holders held onto the asset for over a year. CryptoQuant’s data also revealed massive ETH outflows from exchanges, signaling low selling pressure among investors since the ETH was bought on exchanges and transferred to external wallets. High ETH outflow from exchanges suggests investors are accumulating This week saw significant $ETH outflows from exchanges, with net outflows surpassing $1.4 billion, the highest level since November. This suggests a strong inclination towards accumulation among investors. pic.twitter.com/IbZS8vti2P — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) January 10, 2025 CryptoQuant’s data on ETH’s exchange flows showed that both the total exchange inflow and exchange outflow rose by 1.04% in the last 24 hours to 873.53K and 896.47K, respectively. The total net flow, however, went up 0.93% in the past 24 hours to -22.93K, indicating that more ETH flowed out than into exchanges. The negative netflow suggested increasing investor ‘hodling’ behavior and low selling pressure. The amount of ETH reserved on exchanges also dropped by 0.12% in the last 24 hours to 19.255 million. On the upside, the U.S. dollar value of the ETH reserved on exchanges gained 0.34% in the last 24 hours to $63.73 billion. Transactions depositing ETH into exchanges also increased by 1.05% in 24 hours to 29.28 K. On the other hand, the number of transactions withdrawing ETH from exchanges was much higher at 224.45K, a 0.93% gain within the same period. Similarly, the number of addresses withdrawing ETH from exchanges (3.568K) was 4x higher than the number of addresses depositing ETH into exchanges (852.4). This huge difference indicated that more investors preferred to HODL Ether indefinitely than sell it. Continuing this trend could spark a strong upward momentum for ETH. Whale accumulation activity spikes amid high Ether outflow from exchanges Ethereum whales moved $82.3M worth of ETH from exchanges to private wallets. On-chain metrics from January 7th to January 10th indicate a notable decrease in exchange-held ETH supplies, dropping by 0.25 million. The reduction aligned with increased activity from whale addresses, which suggested a strategic repositioning by the market’s heavyweights. The accumulation phase coincided with Ethereum’s current trading price of $3.258K, following an 8.8% decline over the past week. Santiment’s transaction data highlighted an interesting pattern in whale behavior during Thursday’s trading session. High-value transfers ($100K-1M) significantly increased during this period. ETH’s movement from exchanges to private wallets indicated a shift toward long-term hodling strategies. The current transfer pattern mirrored previous accumulation periods seen during market corrections. This Whale behavior suggests strong confidence in future ETH price appreciation. Small-scale whales and short-term ETH holders sparked a net selling pressure of over 120K ETH after the market’s decline on January 8th, but large whales returned to action and accumulated 210K ETH. The price of ETH could decline to $3,110 if the buy-side pressure of large whales fails to outweigh the bears. The high selling activity pressured the derivatives market, where ETH led with over $130 million in long liquidation. According to CoinGlass data, the largest single liquidation order was an ETH/USDT position worth over $17 million. The whale transaction count peaked during recent price drops, and historical reports suggest that such activity marked potential bottom formations or preceded market reversals. Maintaining ETH price levels above $3,029 was crucial for bullish scenarios to play out. A breach below this threshold could trigger additional selling pressure, potentially testing the 2.8K level.
