38730454,https://coingape.com/?p=232821,1736460186,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Ripple Labs Moves 300 Million XRP, What’s Happening?",https://coingape.com/ripple-labs-moves-300-million-xrp-whats-happening/,"American blockchain payments firm Ripple Labs Inc. has transferred 300,000,000 XRP from one of its internal wallets to an anonymous one. Known for related transactions, the market is now left wondering what Ripple is up to with this new move. Ripple and XRP Transfer Consistency According to data insight from Whale Alert, the payments company transferred 300,000,000 units. This total XRP moved is valued at $682,584,540, implying that each coin was moved at an average price of $2.275. 300,000,000 #XRP (682,584,540 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet https://t.co/d5Vu4aasU6 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 9, 2025 According to the bithomp explorer , the Ripple address received a 300 million XRP inflow on New Year’s Day. This is likely the XRP Ripple Labs transferred, as spotted today. As reported earlier by Coingape, this latest transfer marks one of the high-profile transactions initiated since a major escrow fund movement earlier this month. At the time, the escrow movement and whale activity led to the XRP price jumping 15% . This shows why large Ripple transactions can impact XRP’s market sentiment. Meanwhile, the motive behind the latest transfer remains unknown. Still, this particular wallet has activated a series of addresses for Ripple, implying it is likely used for general-purpose transactions. The Push for XRP Utility Since its inception, XRP has occupied a pivotal position as a payments firm in Ripple Labs’ business. On its part, the company is helping to develop the coin’s ecosystem in different ways. Besides the liquidity control through the escrow releases, the firm is also developing the XRP Ledger. As a smart contract protocol, the XRPL has gained widespread adoption amid sustained upgrades from core developers. Recent rumors even suggested Bitstamp may be building an exchange on XRPL . In addition, the advent of the RLUSD stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum has further solidified the utility push for the coin. Beyond Retail Traders, the ETF Pursuit The broader crypto ecosystem expects a regulatory turnaround once President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. One of the major signs of this shift is the expectation for the approval of new crypto ETF products. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launched in 2024, top asset managers have filed for altcoin alternatives, expecting XRP ETF approval . If approved by the US SEC, this product will expose the coin to more whale-like transactions. Ultimately, this can impact the long-term growth prospect of XRP as an asset.

The category is still relatively small but saw a recent spike in volumes and total market capitalization. AI agents are trying to stand out with specific capabilities. Most early agents focused on personality, content, or entertainment. A few offered utility, by aggregating data or performing on-chain analysis. The most attractive feature of DeFAI would be the potential for personalized portfolio management and automated revenues. AI agents with trading capabilities are also shortened to DeFAI tokens. The collection is relatively small, with a total market capitalization still under $1B. However, the last few days saw the beginnings of more lively trading and a potential breakout for the sector. The DeFAI sector may follow the scenario of DeSci , a sector that grew its market capitalization by 500% within weeks. Only around 1% of DeFAI tokens have posted net gains, with most in various levels of correction. For those tokens, a reversal may boost a new selection of AI assets. For now, the sector remains subdued, as AI agent platforms are still the bigger and more liquid narrative. The appearance of DeFAI follows the saturation of the market by reply bots and an inflow of unwanted content. Trading or profit-maximizing agents aim to bring utility and real use cases to what otherwise looks like another meme market. DeFAI trend taps Solana, Base chains Despite Ethereum being the leading hub for DeFi, AI agents with trading capabilities have chosen Solana and Base. Those two chains offer smaller fees when testing out agentic behaviors. So far, there is no standard on how AI agents can interact and produce safe, verifiable actions with no human oversight. AI agents have only owned tokens, usually donated from other projects. Some DeFAI projects focus on building an abstraction layer to receive human instructions. The leaders in that space are also some of the top tokens, including GRIFFAIN, Hey Anon (ANON), and ORBIT (GRIFT). DeFAI tokens increased their volumes, signaling a potential breakout for a new category of assets. | Source: Coingecko Autonomous trading agents are just appearing, with the ambitious goal of tracking the market much faster than a human, and then implementing a trading strategy to achieve the prompt’s goals. Projects like Almanac are trying to find the tools to allow AI agents to access decentralized trading or other forms of DeFi. Can DeFAI outperform the market? In the early stages, all DeFAI tokens may be extremely volatile. The whole category followed Thursday’s market dip, erasing some of its valuations. The small number of tokens in that category is one of the factors for the low valuation. For the coming months, the category is expected to establish more influence and reach a higher valuation. AI agents as a whole peaked above $17B in total capitalization, later sinking to $13.4B. Tokens like GRIFFAIN and ANON have rallied previously, boosted by whale activity. Tokens like NEUR and QUAIN are also inviting early investments. The appearance of a new sector can bring more retail traders out of FOMO, expanding the category as a whole. The Griffain project has the most ambitious approach, starting with swaps based on natural language inputs. The agent may also be able to independently launch tokens on Pump.fun, with the potential to increase human-driven traffic. An AI trading agent may be able to perform actions such as identifying whale wallets, tracking social media, and noticing trends. ANON expands the potential actions with DeFi, including borrowing and staking. DeFAI agents may also be capable of participating as liquidity providers, managing pools and returns. All DeFi actions are potential tools for the agents, including bridging, staking, seeking out the best yield, and more. Some of the AI agent projects also branch out into the NFT market, unleashing faster analysis abilities. DeFAI projects also include a social media module for tracking trends and posting replies, data, or trades. AI agents may add to the bot-driven traffic on multiple chains. In general, automated trading is one of the key elements of Solana, where speed is essential. The question of agentic trading raises both technical and regulatory concerns.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides trusted and secure data to blockchains, and it is a popular solution in the Web3. This integration will improve scalability, reliability and security of applications that are developed on Aptos. Aptos Partners With Chainlink For Web3 Applications In its most recent blog post, Aptos revealed that it is now collaborating with Chainlink Data Feeds to further complement its blockchain community. This integration enables the Aptos developers to integrate reliable off-chain data in their dApps. To avoid the risk of a single point of failure, Chainlink’s infrastructure combines data from several premium sources. The integration will improve the credibility of the data required to design and build intricate applications. As a result, Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network will be utilized by Aptos to enable a secure and high throughput dApps environment. This will go a long way in helping to attend to the increasing needs of the Web3 ecosystem. Thodoris Karakostas, head of blockchain partnerships at Chainlink commented, “We are excited that Aptos has adopted the Chainlink standard. Chainlink Data Feeds will greatly enhance the reliability of applications built on the network, and we look forward to seeing the innovative ways developers leverage it.” It is worth noting that Aptos Labs co-founder and CEO, Mo Shaikh recently resigned , with co-founder Avery Ching taking over as CEO. Scalability and Security With Aptos’ Modular Architecture Aptos has positioned itself as a high-performance blockchain with a focus on scalability and security. Its use of the Move programming language and Block-STM engine allows for efficient execution of complex transactions. This modular architecture supports reduced latency, ensuring fast and seamless user experiences. With the addition of Chainlink Data Feeds, Aptos strengthens its ability to support enterprise-grade applications. Developers can now build decentralized solutions with enhanced security and scalability, addressing the evolving needs of blockchain users. Chainlink has become a trusted standard for delivering verifiable data to blockchains, supporting major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Its decentralized infrastructure eliminates manipulation risks by providing tamper-proof data through a network of reliable nodes. Chainlink’s technology plays a critical role in advancing Web3 by enabling real-time and accurate data delivery. Ripple Leverages Chainlink for RLUSD Stablecoin Notably, earlier this week, Ripple partnered with Chainlink to enhance its Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin. Consequently, Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network now delivers secure price feeds for RLUSD on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger. Ripple’s adoption underscores the growing importance of secure data delivery in blockchain-based finance. The collaboration will boost RLUSD adoption by ensuring real-time, accurate pricing data. This will actively bridge the gap between blockchain technology and traditional finance.

Whale Transfers $45.7 Million Worth of SOL to Binance On January 10, 2024, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Whale Alert posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale transferred a significant 246,064 SOL, worth $45.76 million, to Binance. 246,064 #SOL (45,761,912 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Binance https://t.co/xYzdg5gB7Y — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 9, 2025 This data from Whale Alert indicates a potential sell-off and reflects investor sentiment, as they appear unwilling to go long or hold positions due to the continuous price decline over the past three days. According to the data, SOL has experienced a price drop of over 16% during this period and has now reached a crucial support level. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Following its significant price decline over the past three days, SOL has reached a crucial support level at $178, which aligns with the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. This level appears to be a make-or-break situation for SOL in the coming days. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, if SOL breaches this support level and closes a daily candle below the $175 mark, it could potentially decline by 11% to reach $156, or even lower if the bearish sentiment persists. Conversely, if sentiment shifts and SOL manages to hold above the $178 level, a similar upside rally to what was previously observed on the daily chart may occur. Increased Whale Activity and Exchange Outflows However, this bearish outlook has not impacted just one whale. In the past 24 hours, aside from this whale’s transaction, exchanges have witnessed an outflow of over $60 million worth of SOL. Combined with the $45.7 million transfer, this market sentiment has witnessed another dump of $60.7 million worth of SOL.

On Jan. 8, Mr Pichai questioned why Thailand should not embrace cryptocurrencies, which are being exchanged globally with strong demand, answered: “With growing demand and ongoing geopolitical issues worldwide, people are increasingly seeking alternatives to conventional currencies,” he said. Thailand to Embrace Crypto? However, “Thailand is not fully prepared for digital currency at the moment,” he said, adding that the country is “trying to create a platform to identify potential users and establish a market where they can exchange and engage.” He suggested allowing tourists to use local exchanges to make property purchases in Thailand, something that is currently not possible. “For example, if tourists come to Thailand, they could register their coins on a local platform that ensures verification or allows for know-your-customer protocols. When making purchases, they could pay using coins through an exchange house of their choice,” “Buyers and sellers would not know what kind of money they are receiving, but those coins would be transferred into the app and could then be converted into Baht via the clearing houses,” he added. Mr Pichai also confirmed that a crypto payments pilot would be launched in a controlled sandbox environment on the tourist island of Phuket later this year. He emphasized that the experiment would be conducted within existing legal frameworks. Barriers Remain However, some barriers remain since Thailand’s central bank remains vehemently against decentralized digital assets, having outlawed crypto payments in 2022. Additionally, foreigners visiting or residing in the country cannot access local payment platforms or crypto exchanges such as Binance Thailand because they cannot register without a citizen’s ID card. Moreover, the Thai government is currently in the process of implementing sweeping tax reforms that will impact all money coming into the country from overseas, which could hamper foreign investment. Finally, Thailand’s digital assets market is undergoing a transition from retail to a more institutional focus, said Binance Thailand CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul in October. At the time, the Thai SEC proposed rules that would allow institutional-grade mutual and private funds to invest in crypto products such as US spot crypto ETFs, but with limits on retail access.

The market for meme coins has been buzzing with activity, and some tokens have shown they’re more than just hype—they’re serious opportunities. With the crypto world on the edge of another bull run, everyone’s talking about the best new meme coins for significant returns in 2025.

Its unique, community-driven model ensures it’s more than just another meme coin—it’s a cultural phenomenon. 3. Memecoin (MEME): The OG Meme Economy Disruptor If there’s a coin that knows memes, it’s Memecoin (MEME). This project takes the meme economy seriously, transforming viral trends into tokenized opportunities. MEME has been on a roll, with consistent community engagement and impressive developments. At the heart of MEME is its governance model, where the Meme Council votes on major decisions. This ensures the coin evolves with its community, staying relevant in the ever-changing landscape of internet culture. Memecoin allows users to create, trade, and earn from viral memes, turning what’s often seen as internet fluff into serious gains. This gamified approach has brought fresh excitement to the space, attracting artists and meme creators alike. MEME makes the cut for its ability to blend cultural relevance with economic utility, cementing its spot as a cornerstone of the meme coin world. 4. Ponke (PONKE): The Innovator Behind PonkeSwap Ponke has been shaking things up with its recent innovations, including PonkeSwap, a decentralized exchange tailored for meme coins. By addressing liquidity issues that often plague smaller tokens, Ponke is building a robust ecosystem for traders. Ponke’s recent listing on Binance Futures has catapulted it into the spotlight, proving its staying power.

He has hit a decisive legal dead end. A UK High Court judge recently dismissed his attempt to sue Newport City Council for access to a landfill. Howells claimed a hard drive containing £600 million, equivalent to $739 million in Bitcoin, is buried there. The decision marks a dramatic setback in Howells’ years-long effort to reclaim the lost fortune. James Howells’ Costly Mistake In 2013, James Howells, an early Bitcoin adopter, unknowingly lost access to what could have been one of the most valuable digital wallets in the world. His ex-partner accidentally threw away the hard drive, which he believed contained over 7,500 Bitcoin units. Bitcoin was worth nothing back then, but its explosive rise in value has turned it into a multi-billion-dollar fortune. Determined to recover his lost fortune, James Howells has spent years appealing to Newport City Council. He believes the hard drive containing his appreciated BTC fortune is buried in a South Wales landfill. Despite his efforts, the council has repeatedly denied him access to search the site. Howell Faces Legal and Environmental Hurdles Newport City Council stood firm, arguing that the hard drive became its property upon entering the landfill. The Council also cited environmental regulations prohibiting the excavation of waste from the site, which holds over 1.4 million tonnes of waste. Howells mentioned that he had narrowed his search area to 100,000 tonnes. He even offered the council a share of the asset if recovered. At a December hearing, Howells’ team presented their case, but Judge Keyser KC found the legal arguments unconvincing. The judge ruled that the case lacked reasonable grounds and had no realistic prospect of success. A Lost Fortune, but a Gift to the Bitcoin Community Judge Keyser’s decision has ended Howells’ legal fight for now, and the Bitcoin fortune he hoped to recover is still lost. The hard drive, buried in a landfill, will likely never be found. Even though Howells’ efforts failed, the value of his lost Bitcoin shows how much cryptocurrency has grown. Digital assets are changing the world economy, and Fidelity predicts Bitcoin is poised to be part of national reserves by 2025 . This shows how crypto assets are becoming more important in traditional finance.

38731380,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=640628,1736462782,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38731380.jpeg,Polymarket under fire for California’s wildfire market betting,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/polymarket-under-fire-californias-wildfir/,"Blockchain-based predictions platform Polymarket has been criticized for allowing users to bet on the Palisades wildfire in California. The wildfire, which has forced nearly 200,000 to evacuate, killed five people, and covered almost 30,000 acres, has become a subject of gambling on Polymarkets. A quick search on the platform shows that there are currently nine bets relating to the fire, all with varying interests. Two bets – “How many acres will Palisades wildfire burn by Friday?” and “Will Palisades wildfire spread to Santa Monica by Sunday?” have over $90,000 in volume each. Other bets on the subject also had volumes varying from $53,000 to as low as $8,000. Despite the clear interest in some quarters, many believe the bets are in bad taste and that an environmental disaster should not be turned into a gambling opportunity. Users on X questioned the reasoning behind such a bet, with one user describing it as immoral for anyone to bet on the spread of fire. Perhaps what is even generating criticism is that Polymarket seems to have no scruples about these bets. It has been posting about them on its social media pages, a move seen as more publicity for the bets. Some users also believe such bets could even incentivize someone to start a fire in Santa Monica and are calling for Polymarket to be banned. Writer and podcaster Tyler Harper noted that everything has been turned into a wager opportunity, which is evil and depraved. He posted: “The gamblification of everything is Evil in fullest sense of the word. Capital-E Evil.” Meanwhile, some users consider those gambling on the Wildfire markets to be sick, with one person noting it is a sign of addiction and such people should check into rehab. Polymarket defends wildfire markets Despite criticisms about creating bets based on natural disasters, the platform has insisted that the predictions serve those who want unbiased and accurate information. Each bet on the Palisades wildfire contains a note stating that the predictions market only harnesses market wisdom to create unbiased forecasts. The note reads: “The promise of prediction markets is to harness the wisdom of the crowd to create accurate, unbiased forecasts for the most important events impacting society. The devastating Pacific Palisades fire is one such event.” It added that users can get real-time and accurate information about such events from Polymarket in ways they cannot from traditional media. The platform noted that it does not charge any fees on the market. Although some, including business and tech reporter Thomas Maxwell, have called for Polymarket to be shut down, that is unlikely to happen as the platform does not even operate in the US. Politics, sports, and economics driving Polymarket volume Nevertheless, the predictions platform is not new to controversy. Since gaining popularity for correctly predicting the US presidential election in 2024, Polymarket has been at the center of a few controversies over market manipulation, with the FBI even raiding the home of its founder as part of an investigation. Its latest controversy occurred a few weeks ago after some bettors alleged market manipulation over a bet on whether Israel will invade Syria in 2024. The oracle provider for the bet, UMA, failed to settle the market in favor of those who picked YES, as UMA voters voted against the settlement on two occasions. This led many to claim that it’s the major UMA token holders, i.e., the UMA whales, who are delaying the resolution for their advantage. Meanwhile, Polymarket continued to thrive even after the election and has become one of the leading prediction platforms, with almost every issue open to wager in its markets. Although most of the wagers focus on sports events and political/economic news, users continue to bet on a wide range of topics. One bet about how many times Elon Musk would tweet within a week currently has $1 million in volume.

The subpoena, unsealed today, seeks “public customer information” tied to Polymarket, a blockchain-based prediction platform that has been gaining traction ahead of the November election. A screenshot of an email sent from Coinbase to specific users regarding the CFTC request was shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Eric Conner, founder of Ethereum information site ETHHub. The email advised users that Coinbase “may be required to submit information” to the CFTC due to upcoming regulatory procedures. Conner declined to comment on whether he personally uses Polymarket’s platform. A source confirmed that the CFTC subpoena is real and is linked to Polymarket, a platform that launched in 2020 and allows users to make predictions on the outcome of events ranging from sports to politics. Polymarket rose to fame with its predictions for Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. Related News: Experienced Analyst Says He Targets $ 10 For XRP, $ 7,000 For Ethereum - Here Are His Opinions This isn’t Polymarket’s first brush with regulators. The CFTC filed a sanctions lawsuit against the platform for failing to register its services in 2022. The case resulted in a $1.4 million fine, and the platform subsequently blocked US citizens from accessing its services. Polymarket scrutiny intensified after Trump’s victory, when the FBI raided the New York apartment of CEO Shayne Coplan. At the time, Polymarket spokespeople claimed the raid was “political retribution.” Bloomberg News later reported that the Justice Department was investigating. In response to the subpoena, Coinbase stated its commitment to protecting user data while complying with legal requirements. “Requests for information from a government are carefully reviewed by a team of trained experts,” a Coinbase spokesperson said. “In some cases, if a request is legally insufficient, the firm will object to producing information or attempt to narrow the request. However, in some cases, we may be required by law to share necessary data that is lawfully requested by a government.” *This is not investment advice.

The bearish sentiment has left many investors disheartened, with Ethereum struggling to reclaim higher price levels. Frustrated by the consistent underperformance, some investors are beginning to lose faith in the altcoin giant, seeking opportunities elsewhere. Related Reading: Expert Sets $1 Target For Dogecoin Once It Breaks A Multi-Year Trend – Details Despite the negative sentiment, top analyst Ali Martinez has shared an optimistic outlook for Ethereum. Martinez’s analysis suggests that a downswing to the $2,900 level could present a highly favorable “buy-the-dip” scenario for long-term investors. According to Martinez, this potential decline would lay the groundwork for Ethereum to target significantly higher levels, with a bullish price goal of $7,000 in the coming cycle. The current market conditions have sparked uncertainty, but many experts believe the upcoming months will prove pivotal for Ethereum. As the altcoin leader grapples with its recent declines, investors and traders alike are closely watching key support levels to assess whether ETH can rebound from this downturn. With Martinez’s bullish target on the horizon, could this dip pave the way for Ethereum’s next big rally? A Rocky Start in 2025: Optimism Remains Ethereum has faced a tough journey through 2024, with lackluster performance trailing behind Bitcoin’s dominance. The new year hasn’t offered much reprieve, as Ethereum started 2025 with additional declines, leaving many investors frustrated. While Bitcoin continues to command attention, fueling what some are dubbing a “Bitcoin cycle,” altcoins, including Ethereum, have struggled to gain momentum. However, not all hope is lost. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a more optimistic perspective on X, suggesting that Ethereum’s current price action might be setting the stage for significant future gains. Martinez’s analysis points to a potential downswing to $2,900 as a highly bullish opportunity for Ethereum. He emphasized that this level would represent an ideal “buy-the-dip” scenario, potentially setting the stage for Ethereum to target a remarkable $7,000 in the next cycle. According to Martinez, the ongoing bearish price suppression is a natural part of the market cycle. Once this phase ends, Ethereum could be primed for a substantial rally. However, for this bullish narrative to materialize, Ethereum must first reclaim key demand levels to reignite investor confidence and build momentum. Related Reading: Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point As Ethereum navigates these turbulent times, analysts and traders are keeping a close watch on critical support levels, waiting to see if this dip truly becomes a launchpad for Ethereum’s next major move. Ethereum Price Holds Key Support Amid Bearish Pressure Ethereum is trading at $3,300 after enduring a sharp sell-off that drove the price down to $3,206, creating a sense of fear and uncertainty in the market. Despite the aggressive downturn, Ethereum’s price action is showing resilience, setting a higher low on the daily time frame. This subtle shift in structure offers hope for a potential recovery, signaling that demand might be quietly building. For Ethereum to regain its bullish momentum, bulls need to reclaim the $3,900 level promptly. This critical zone acts as a gateway to reestablishing a strong upward trend and boosting market confidence. However, the path to recovery may take time as Ethereum stabilizes and recovers from its recent bearish phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Breakout Or Breakdown? While the market sentiment remains cautious, Ethereum’s ability to hold above key support levels suggests that a swift surge could follow if demand rises.

For now, patience is key as Ethereum navigates its way through this challenging phase, aiming to position itself for stronger price action in the weeks ahead.

Enthusiasts and investors are eyeing the market for coins with solid development plans and influential partnerships. This month, certain cryptocurrencies like BlockDAG (BDAG), Tron (TRX), Bittensor (TAO), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Cronos (CRO) are at the forefront, captivating the community with their potential and market appeal. This overview highlights why these most popular crypto coins are worth your attention, whether you’re a veteran in the investment arena or just beginning to explore the crypto space. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Decade’s Most Prominent Crypto Presale BlockDAG (BDAG) has become a significant player in the crypto arena, with a presale that has skyrocketed to over $177.5 million, selling more than 17.7 billion coins. With the current batch priced at $0.0248 nearly sold out, BlockDAG is clearly a frontrunner in the market. An attractive feature of BlockDAG is its Refer & Earn program, which rewards community members for referrals. Referrers receive a 6% instant cashback in USDT for each purchase made by their referrals, with potential increases to 10% based on further purchases within 24 hours. Buyers also get a 6% cashback per transaction, incentivizing participation in the community. With a minimum buy-in of $30, the platform ensures that rewards are easily accessible and stored directly in BEP-20 compatible wallets. BlockDAG’s impressive growth, combined with its innovative features and rewards program, makes it one of the most popular crypto coins in 2025. 2. Cronos (CRO): Connecting Conventional Finance & DeFi Cronos excels in linking traditional financial systems with decentralized technologies. Celebrated for its quick transactions and minimal fees, Cronos is increasingly preferred by developers and users. Its ecosystem, which includes diverse DeFi and non-fungible token (NFT) solutions, underscores its importance in these expanding fields. Even with an 11.78% drop in price to about $0.1409 recently, Cronos’ integration capabilities and adoption trajectory suggest it remains a compelling project in the evolving crypto landscape. 3. Tron (TRX): A Titan in Decentralized Finance Tron continues to solidify its position in the cryptocurrency market through significant strides in decentralized finance (DeFi) supported by its high-performance blockchain. Processing thousands of transactions per second, Tron is indispensable in the DeFi landscape. It distinguishes itself with efficient smart contract capabilities and lower transaction costs, trading at about $0.2545 currently, down slightly by 0.84% from last week. Despite this, Tron maintains strong investor interest due to its robust technical foundations. 4. Bittensor (TAO): Fusing AI with Blockchain Bittensor is making waves by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, establishing a decentralized network for machine learning. This platform incentivizes developers to create, share, and profit from AI models, fostering a decentralized marketplace. Collaborations with leading AI experts and tech companies bolster Bittensor’s growth prospects. Despite a recent 12.20% drop in price to approximately $440.56, Bittensor’s unique proposition in AI and blockchain integration remains appealing for forward-thinking investors. 5. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Speedy & Cost-Effective Transactions Known for its rapid and economical transaction capabilities, Bitcoin Cash is a favorite among businesses looking to enhance their payment processes. Its comparative advantage in speed and cost over Bitcoin ensures its continued use and relevance in various markets. Currently priced at $433.25, BCH has experienced a slight market adjustment with a 6.46% decrease in value last week, yet it continues to be a dependable choice for efficient digital transactions. A Recap of The Most Popular Crypto Coins to Watch The year 2025 presents a range of leading cryptocurrencies. Tron excels in DeFi, Bittensor pioneers decentralized AI, Bitcoin Cash is the choice for swift payments, and Cronos integrates traditional finance with DeFi innovations. Despite recent dips reflecting market volatility, BlockDAG leads with a groundbreaking presale achievement, amassing $177.5 million, a 2380% ROI, and unique features such as the Refer & Earn program. Its vibrant growth and robust community engagement position it as one of the most popular crypto coins in 2025.

Render, for instance, has risen by 32%, surpassing the $8 mark with its sights set on reaching $9 soon. A recent Filecoin update revealed a 12% increase following its successful listing on Bithumb, and a significant 200% boost in futures trading volume, indicating more possible growth if it surpasses certain levels. Among these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is creating its niche in decentralized eCommerce. By raising over $480K in presale and selling 138 million tokens, this project merges blockchain technology with a fresh vision for online shopping. As traders eye future gains, Web3 in eCommerce promises significant potential in the digital currency space. Render Price Analysis: Could Render Reach $9? Render price analysis is drawing focus as the RNDR value climbs over the $8 hurdle after a 32% increase in two weeks. This price point is both a psychological and technical challenge, as previous attempts to go beyond it often led to sales. Yet, confidence in Render’s potential is high, with 65% of its holders seeing profits and trading activity regaining momentum. On-chain data shows ongoing growth in active addresses and transactions, hinting at increasing network use and investor participation, crucial for continued price increases. While Render price analysis confirms a strong move above $8, traders remain watchful for the consistent buy-in required to reach and possibly exceed $9. Filecoin Update Draws Attention with Bithumb Listing and 12% Surge The latest Filecoin update has grabbed attention, as FIL saw a 12% uptick following its introduction on the South Korean exchange Bithumb. Its futures trading volume surged by 200%, signaling a growing trader interest. Presently valued at $6.06, FIL is approaching a crucial resistance at $6.95. Overcoming this could set the stage for a rise towards $8.50. This update also underlines important support levels, with $5.75 acting as a buffer for the coin’s positive trend. The wider market’s movements will likely influence outcomes, with FIL’s ability to sustain its momentum and break through upcoming barriers determining its path forward. Web3Bay Charts a New Course for Web3 in eCommerce Web3Bay (3BAY) is capturing attention as it transforms online shopping with a decentralized approach. Presently in its third presale phase, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $480K and sold 138 million coins. The price of its native token, 3BAY, stands at $0.0039675 in this ongoing stage, reflecting increased market confidence in its potential to innovate eCommerce through the integration of Web3 blockchain technology. The strategic roadmap of Web3Bay is well-defined, beginning with platform development and the execution of a 28-stage presale in Phase 1. Phase 2 is set to activate the marketplace, introduce cryptocurrency payments, and establish liquidity pools. The ambition extends into Phase 3, which will focus on expanding the ecosystem to include features such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and staking options for 3BAY holders. Looking ahead, Web3Bay’s objectives encompass the integration of an NFT marketplace, DeFi services, and cross-chain functionality, providing a wide array of opportunities for both traders and consumers. Its decentralized framework offers enhanced transparency, ownership, and security, effectively eliminating the reliance on traditional centralized platforms. As the Web3 eCommerce sector, Web3Bay stands poised to lead this shift, offering traders a valuable entry point through its competitive presale pricing and a visionary approach to redefining the standards of e-commerce with blockchain technology tailored to the needs of end users. Wrapping Up The cryptocurrency arena continues to unveil unique opportunities, from Render’s push towards $9 to the recent Filecoin update highlighting a 12% boost post-Bithumb listing.

Lummis",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/senate-banking-committee-to-launch-first/,"The U.S. is taking big steps to include cryptocurrency and financial technology in its official plans. Key leaders like Congressman Bryan Steil, who now heads the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, and Senator Tim Scott, are leading the Senate’s first crypto-focused subcommittee. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong supporter of Bitcoin, is also set to play a major role. These moves show the U.S. is serious about becoming a global leader in the digital economy while working on clear rules and encouraging innovation. The U.S. government has made efforts to fully implement cryptocurrency and financial technology in the official framework of the government. Crypto takes center stage in U.S. policy The latest examples include Congressman Bryan Steil, who has been selected as the chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence. The scope of work includes digital assets, such as Bitcoin, new types of financial technology, and expanding use of artificial intelligence in the financial sector. Senator Tim Scott will be the first leader of a dedicated subcommittee to cryptocurrencies in the Senate, and Senator Cynthia Lummis, a bitcoin advocate, will lead the same. Congressman Andy Barr (KY-06) has been reappointed as Chairman of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee for the 119th Congress. He will oversee financial regulators to ensure balanced rules that support small businesses, expand consumer access to financial services, and promote economic growth. “I am honored to continue serving as Chairman of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee,” said Congressman Barr. “ His leadership focuses on transparency, credit access, and ensuring U.S. financial institutions thrive in a competitive global landscape. The Senate Banking Committee, led by Senator Tim Scott, is creating its first subcommittee focused on cryptocurrency. This is similar to the effort by Patrick McHenry in 2023 with the Financial Services Committee, showing how important crypto has become in U.S. policymaking. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong supporter of Bitcoin, has been picked to lead the subcommittee, though her role will need a final vote next week. The committee will also decide on other members at the same time, alongside the nomination hearing for Scott Turner, Trump’s pick for HUD secretary. Digital Asset Economy The U.S. is now approaching cryptocurrency. Two years ago, discussions surrounding crypto were negligible, and governmental interest was minimal to nothing except in very broken pieces of legislation. Now, it is reflected in official meetings, new subcommittees, and leadership appointments, signaling an effort to be taken seriously by making the U.S. a global leader in the digital asset space. This is a period when other countries are also considering frameworks for crypto governance, and it is imperative that the U.S. stays ahead of them. Under the guidance of the new SEC chair and with Senator Lummis, the United States is looking forward to creating an open regulatory space for Bitcoin and other digital assets. It protects the consumers, encourages innovation, and helps the country to maintain its place in the global arena in the monetary financial space. Regulation along with a reserve in Bitcoin will allow the United States to step up to the challenge of being the pioneer for the future of money. However, the public has been somewhat divided about this approach. Some consider it is long overdue and actually puts weight to including digital assets within the economy. It could improve innovation for many while ushering the way toward a possible trusting attitude in the industry.. Some, however, point to issues, such as market volatility, and even consider proposals like that of Lummis’s Bitcoin reserve. However, bottom line, these actions bring much-needed order and stability to the industry on the whole. As Trump’s inauguration approaching, his support for Bitcoin is still ruling the market. He has promised to create a national Bitcoin reserve, with proposals already in Congress and backing from states like Texas and Ohio. This could be a big step forward for crypto in the U.S. From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-09 23:09:33

The move suggests Moscow hopes to trade over BTC 1,000 for fiat. Per the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the Russian Treasury has “begun the transfer” of the funds. Moscow will initially sell off almost $10 million worth of BTC it seized from the former Russian Investigative Committee investigator Marat Tambiev, the news agency confirmed. Moscow Bitcoin Selloff: Will Russia Sell Entire BTC 1,032 Stash? Tambiev was found guilty of taking a bribe from the hacker group last year. Prosecutors found hundreds of Bitcoin tokens on his computer and storage devices. Marat Tambiev during his trial in Moscow Oblast last year. (Source: Vedemostvo/VK/Screenshot) The former investigator was found guilty of taking BTC 1,032.1 from the group and was jailed for 16 years. However, bailiffs’ efforts to liquidate the entire BTC 1,032.1 have been complicated by legal hurdles. Tambiev appears to have divided the coins into several smaller amounts. This means bailiffs will have to file separate court rulings to grant Moscow access to the coins.

They say Tambiev stored these coins on a Ledger Nano X hard crypto wallet . The news agency quoted “a source familiar with the case” as stating that prosecutors also want to sell off a further cache of Bitcoin “worth several million rubles.” They also hope to sell off “several real estate properties in the Moscow region” and a “Honda motorcycle,” the source claimed. A Russian victory in Ukraine would be far more expensive for the US than the military aid it now provides, the American Enterprise Institute argues in a new report https://t.co/sgOylwnmXD — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 9, 2025 Legal Challenges Prosecutors’ efforts to sell off the entire Bitcoin haul have been complicated by legal obstacles and suggestions that Tambiev may have passed some assets to family members. At the end of November 2024, the Prosecutor-General filed a case against Tambiev and his uncle Shagaban Kubanov. It demanded courts allow much of his property “to be sold” to “the state’s benefit.” The office launched a second case on December 20, 2024. In 2023, a court in Nikulinsky ordered bailiffs to seize a record total of BTC 1,032.1 from Tambiev’s computers and other hardware devices. Tambiev is now serving his sentence in a maximum security penal colony. He was also fined 500 million rubles (almost $5 million) and stripped of his rank of major. His former colleague Kristina Lyakhovenko was also found guilty of accepting a bribe. A court jailed Lyakhovenko for nine years.

A street in the Tverskoy District of Moscow. (Source: Elisa.rolle [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Prosecutors told the court last year that Tambiev extracted a series of Bitcoin bribes “from 2020 to 2022.” In exchange, Tambiev helped divert police investigations into the group. He also let the hackers hide crypto funds worth “14 billion rubles” ($137 million). In July last year, Marina Odintsova, the head of the Kirov branch of the Association of Lawyers of Russia, spoke of a sharp recent rise in “non-cash” bribery using crypto and other assets .

(COIN) is warning customers that a U.S. regulator is demanding information about interactions with prediction market firm Polymarket, according to a person familiar with the situation, and Coinbase has sent messages to customers saying the exchange may have to share that data. Copies of the emails shared with some customers have circulated on social-media sites , and those warnings about the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) requests are accurate, the person said. The U.S. derivatives regulator has conducted a drawn-out legal battle with prediction markets firms, and this latest move comes just days before the leadership of the agency will flip from Democratic to Republican when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. ""When we receive requests for information from a government, each request is carefully reviewed by a team of trained experts using established procedures to determine its legal sufficiency,"" a Coinbase spokesperson said in an emailed statement, though the company declined to confirm receipt of the specific subpoena. ""Where necessary, we will seek to narrow requests that are overly broad or vague in order to provide a more appropriately tailored response, and in some cases we object to producing any information at all."" The CFTC lost an initial case against prediction market firm Kalshi when a U.S. federal judge ruled late last year that the agency couldn't bar the company from listing election contracts. However, the regulator quickly filed an appeal with a higher court, and Polymarket argued in that new legal clash that only Congress can halt election betting .

QUAN Unveils Web3-Based Payment Platform Quantum International (QUAN) is launching LootUpApp, a Web3-based payment platform designed to streamline cryptocurrency transactions for everyday use. Leveraging blockchain’s decentralized nature and AI capabilities, LootUpApp aims to make digital payments as intuitive as traditional systems. This innovative platform addresses common issues like wallet complexity and transaction errors, enhancing accessibility for newcomers and experienced users alike. By integrating AI, LootUpApp ensures secure, optimized transactions within a transparent Web3-based payment ecosystem. As the crypto market rebounds, Quantum International’s strategic focus on Web3 technology positions LootUpApp as a transformative tool, paving the way for broader blockchain adoption in the global financial space. Filecoin’s Bullish Trend Sparks Investor Optimism Filecoin is showing signs of a strong upward trajectory after breaking out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle, signaling the start of Filecoin’s bullish trend. Backed by a 204% surge in trading volume and rising open interest, FIL has gained significant attention from traders and investors alike. The sustained buying interest and accumulation at current price levels highlight confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Filecoin’s bullish trend aligns with technical indicators suggesting a midterm rally toward $30. Increasing accumulation and positive technical indicators strengthen the view that Filecoin’s bullish trend signals undervaluation, presenting an exciting opportunity for traders aiming to capitalize on its rally. Why Traders Are Betting Big on Web3Bay’s E-comm Platform in 2025 Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce with its decentralized model, blending Web3 blockchain technology with a future-forward ecosystem that offers unparalleled benefits to traders. As the backbone of this decentralized marketplace, the 3BAY token not only allows users to sell and buy digital assets with ease but also empowers them with governance rights and exclusive rewards. Its presale, which has already raised over $480,000 and sold over 138 million tokens, positions early adopters for a remarkable 6430% ROI at launch. Currently in presale Stage 3, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.1959. The platform ensures transparency and user ownership, alongside allowing users to sell and buy digital goods with minimal transaction costs. This makes its decentralized platform a powerful alternative to traditional marketplaces like Amazon. 3BAY tokens also provide exclusive access to discounts, loyalty rewards, and staking opportunities, driving both utility and long-term value. The buzz surrounding Web3Bay is undeniable, with its ecosystem set to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized e-commerce. As traders look for opportunities in 2025, 3BAY offers more than just an investment—it’s a gateway to a transformative Web3 e-commerce experience. This is the chance for traders to be part of a project reshaping digital trade. The Highlights The future of blockchain is unfolding through projects like Quantum International, Filecoin, and Web3Bay. While Filecoin’s bullish trend and a $30 coin forecast and Quantum’s LootUpApp demonstrate the transformative power of blockchain, Web3Bay is capturing the imagination of forward-thinking traders. Positioned as a leader in decentralized e-commerce, Web3Bay isn’t just an investment; it’s a movement reshaping how people sell & buy digital assets. Having raised $480,000 in its presale and sold over 138 million tokens, Web3Bay is capturing a lot of attention in the crypto community. Early adopters are already primed for a 6430% ROI upon launch, presenting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for traders. As momentum builds, waiting could mean missing out on the next big breakthrough in Web3 e-commerce.

This came as he revealed why BTC could still rally to as high as $200,000 in this market cycle. Bitcoin Price Set To Rally To $200,000 Despite Recent Crash In a TradingView post, TradingShot predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to $200,000 despite the recent market crash. The analyst noted that Bitcoin has started this new year with high volatility amid geopolitical and economic news input. He added that this year is the last year of this bull cycle. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board However, the recent Bitcoin price crash doesn’t mean that the flagship crypto is close to its market peak, as TradingShot remarked that the cycle top could start forming around November. He made this prediction based on historical trends, as the three previous tops have been either in November or December. The crypto analyst also noted that the last cycle top formed above the Pi Cycle Top and on the LGC Zone from the top. In line with this, TradingShot predicted that the Bitcoin price could be close to $200,000 even if BTC barely tests the bottom for the LGC 2nd Zone from the Top by November 2025. TradingShot added that, technically, the projected Peak Zone for the Bitcoin price should be between $180,000 and $200,000. He remarked that this range may still be below the Pi Cycle, so it looks to be a fair scenario. Standard Chartered also shared a similar prediction last year, stating that a rally to $200,000 by year-end 2025 is “achievable.” Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts described a $200,000 prediction by year-end as a “conservative” estimate. A Price Rebound Could Be On The Cards The Bitcoin price has suffered a terrible start to the year, dropping to as low as $93,000. However, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared some positives that suggest a price rebound may be imminent. In an X post, the crypto analyst revealed that more than 22,000 BTC, worth $2.10 billion, were withdrawn from exchanges over the past week. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidations Cross $24 Million As Bulls Suffer Double-Digit Beat Down This presents a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price since heavy Whale accumulation typically precedes a price recovery. Meanwhile, Martinez mentioned that 63.92% of Binance traders are now going long since BTC dropped to as low as $93,000. These traders were previously shorting BTC when the flagship crypto was trading above $100,000. With these traders now going long, a rebound may be imminent. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,000, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The EU’s MiCA rules and the rise of USDC and RLUSD,https://crypto.news/usdt-losing-the-eus-mica-rules-and-rise-of-usdc-rlusd/,"Is the EU’s MiCA framework forcing investors to rethink their allegiance to Tether’s USDT and explore alternatives like Circle’s USDC and Ripple’s RLUSD? Table of Contents USDT under radar Competitors closing In: USDC and RLUSD’s strategic advances Ripple’s big Moment as RLUSD gains momentum in a changing era What to expect next? USDT under radar For years, Tether’s USDT (USDT) has been the go-to stablecoin for traders and investors. Yet, as we step into 2025, its dominance is starting to waver, particularly in the European Union, where mounting regulatory scrutiny and growing competition are challenging its unshakable reputation. The turning point came on December 30, 2024, with the full implementation of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. Designed to bring order to the unpredictable crypto market, MiCA has imposed stringent compliance requirements on stablecoin issuers, including a mandate for major players like Tether to hold 60% of their reserves in EU banks. As these regulations take effect, Tether is grappling with a wave of redemptions, new regulatory hurdles, and intensifying competition from rivals like Circle’s USDC ( USDC ) and Ripple’s RLUSD ( RLUSD ). In the past, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, raised concerns over the risks of “bank failures,” arguing that such requirements could expose stablecoin issuers to systemic vulnerabilities rather than reducing them. Just to correct the statement: we're still discussing with the regulator about our concerns that I expressed in our interview, that would pose severe risks to stablecoins regulated in EU. Uninsured cash deposits are not a good idea. We should learn from what happened with… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖🍐 (@paoloardoino) April 11, 2024 But the market seems less concerned with Tether’s reasoning and more with its actions — or lack thereof. In the days leading up to MiCA’s implementation, nearly $4 billion worth of USDT was redeemed, marking the largest outflow since the 2022 crypto winter. Back then, scandals like the collapse of FTX and revelations of fraud across the industry sent shockwaves through crypto, shrinking USDT’s market cap from $83 billion in May to $65 billion by November — a 21% drop. The recent decline, while smaller, carries deeper implications. As of Jan. 9, Tether’s market cap stands at $137.5 billion, down from $141 billion just two weeks earlier. The question now is not just whether Tether can adapt but whether the market will wait for it to do so. With USDC cementing its regulatory foothold and RLUSD rapidly gaining momentum, could this be the beginning of a sharp decline for the world’s largest stablecoin? Let’s try to decode. Competitors closing In: USDC and RLUSD’s strategic advances Tether’s reluctance to comply with its strict reserve requirements has raised red flags among investors, while its competitors are thriving under the new framework. Even though EU member states have up to 18 months to fully enforce MiCA, the market isn’t waiting. Investors and exchanges are already repositioning, and USDT’s grip on the market appears to be slipping. For context, exchanges like Coinbase and OKX have already delisted USDT for European users, citing non-compliance with MiCA. Circle’s USDC stands out as a prime beneficiary of the regulatory shift. Having secured MiCA approval in mid-2024, USDC has positioned itself as the stablecoin of choice for exchanges looking to align with EU rules. Binance’s partnership with Circle, aimed at accelerating USDC adoption globally, is a direct response to growing demand for transparency and compliance. This move has already begun to pay off; USDC’s market cap has grown by $2 billion since securing the license. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD, launched on December 17, 2024, is also gaining traction as a regulatory-compliant alternative. Designed to operate seamlessly on the XRP Ledger ( XRP ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), RLUSD processed 33,953 transactions on the XRP Ledger and 1,690 on Ethereum during its testing phase alone. Ripple’s big Moment as RLUSD gains momentum in a changing era The year 2025 could be a turning point for Ripple, as a convergence of legal victories, strategic partnerships, and a crypto-friendly administration in the U.S. creates ideal conditions for expanding its foothold in the stablecoin market. With Donald Trump’s presidency expected to usher in crypto-friendly policies, Ripple may finally resolve its long-standing legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, lifting a major obstacle to its growth. Already, Ripple has scored key wins in the SEC case, including reducing a potential $2 billion penalty to just $125 million. This resolution provides the company with the breathing room needed to refocus on innovation and the rollout of RLUSD. Monica Long, Ripple’s president, has hinted at ambitious plans for RLUSD, including imminent listings on major exchanges to broaden its reach and utility. “We are continuing to expand distribution and availability of Ripple dollars on other exchanges. So, I think you can expect to see more availability, more announcements coming soon,” Long shared in a recent Bloomberg interview. Ripple President Monica Long expects to see their new stablecoin RLUSD on more platforms ""imminently"" and says we will see an XRP ETF soon https://t.co/e4TuV4XPv3 pic.twitter.com/LhfIMNDDs9 — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) January 7, 2025 Ripple’s well-established payments business is also a crucial driver for RLUSD’s adoption. Over the past year, Ripple’s payment solutions have doubled their transaction volume, reflecting their value in facilitating seamless cross-border transactions. Stablecoins like RLUSD could enhance this ecosystem by offering businesses an efficient alternative to traditional banking systems. As Ripple expands RLUSD’s availability, businesses already relying on its payment solutions could likely adopt the stablecoin, further accelerating its growth. Beyond payments, partnership with Chainlink, a leader in blockchain oracles, could propel it into the decentralized finance space. Chainlink’s infrastructure, which has supported over $18 trillion in transaction value, positions RLUSD to integrate effectively with DeFi ecosystems, offering new opportunities for both traditional and DeFi users. The stablecoin market, now valued at $206.2 billion, continues to remain dominated by USDT, which holds 66% of the market share. What to expect next? USDT’s struggles have been years in the making, marked by its unmatched dominance but shadowed by persistent questions about transparency. While Tether has consistently maintained its peg to the U.S. dollar, its reluctance to provide full-scale audits and ongoing accusations of under-collateralization have fueled mistrust. Amid this, USDC has positioned itself as the “safe” alternative, building its reputation on monthly attestations and a compliance-first approach. Its recent approval under Europe’s MiCA regulations has further strengthened its foothold in the region. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD, though a newer entrant, is also gaining traction with Ripple’s strong payment infrastructure, rapid exchange listings, and seamless integration into DeFi markets. As MiCA sets a clear regulatory benchmark in the EU, the U.S. would soon follow suit. Signals from the Trump administration suggest an acceleration of crypto-friendly policies, likely pushing the U.S. toward an accountable regulatory framework. With these shifts, 2025 may mark the beginning of a power transition in the stablecoin market. While USDT remains the leader, for now, the momentum of its competitors signals that change is upcoming.

Over the past few years, they’ve gone from being quirky novelties to serious players in the market. Remember when Dogecoin took off? Or how everyone was scrambling to get a piece of Shiba Inu? Those who hopped on those trends made a killing, while others were left wondering what just happened. If you couldn’t grab the Pudgy Penguins opportunity, don’t sweat it. The next big thing is here, and it’s called BTFD Coin. BTFD Coin is primed to take the meme coin popularity to a whole new level. With its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game launching on January 1, 2025, a robust referral program, and an eye-popping 90% APY on staking, this is not just another meme coin; it’s a full-fledged investment opportunity. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to join today, BTFD Coin deserves your attention. The presale is already creating a buzz, and analysts are predicting some impressive price surges ahead. As of now, the BTFD presale started at a mere $0.000004 per coin and has surged to $0.000142 in Stage 13. With over $5.1 million raised and 63 billion BTFD coins sold, it’s clear that the momentum is building. Analysts are forecasting a listing price of around $0.0006 at the end of the presale. If you’re ready to dive into the world of meme coins, BTFD Coin could be your next big win. BTFD Coin: The Future of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is not just another token on the block; it’s an entire ecosystem designed with its community in mind. One of the standout features is its P2E game, which is set to launch on January 1, 2025. This game isn’t merely for entertainment; players can earn BTFD coins while they play. Imagine leveling up in a fun game and stacking up your coins at the same time. It’s a win-win situation, and it adds a whole new layer of utility to the coin. But that’s just scratching the surface. The staking rewards are where things get really exciting. With a staggering 90% APY available, staking your BTFD coins isn’t just a way to hold; it’s a smart investment strategy. Staking went live on December 2, and the buzz around it has been palpable. Who wouldn’t want to earn while they snooze? This kind of return is a game-changer in the meme coin landscape, and it’s attracting a lot of eyes. Let’s not overlook the referral program. This is designed to reward you for sharing the BTFD love. Every time you bring someone new into the fold, both you and your friend can earn rewards. It’s like building your own little community of Bulls—those are BTFD holders—where everyone gets a piece of the pie. This sense of camaraderie is invigorating and makes investing feel more personal and fun. Now, let’s talk numbers. If you decided to invest $30,000 when the price was at $0.000004, you’d end up with a jaw-dropping 7.5 billion $BTFD coins. If the analysts are right and the price reaches $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your initial investment could soar to a staggering $4.5 million! That’s the kind of potential that has people buzzing. With over 8,000 holders already on board, BTFD Coin is making waves and could be one of the best new meme coins to join today. Pudgy Penguins: A Look Back Now, let’s take a moment to appreciate the Pudgy Penguins phenomenon. Launched as a fun, whimsical NFT project, Pudgy Penguins quickly gained traction for its adorable designs and vibrant community. Those who snagged these cute critters early on saw their investments soar, turning them into some of the hottest digital collectibles around. The charm of Pudgy Penguins lies in their community-driven approach and the engaging narratives that surround them, making them an attractive investment for many. However, while Pudgy Penguins were flying high, the market has shifted. The NFT craze has cooled down a bit, and many investors are left wondering if they missed the boat. The question on everyone’s mind is: Can Pudgy Penguins maintain their momentum in a landscape that’s becoming increasingly competitive? While the project still has a dedicated following, newer options like BTFD Coin are emerging with exciting features that could outshine the classic meme project. Pudgy Penguins certainly created a lot of buzz, but the volatility in the NFT market is something to keep in mind. Many investors are now looking for alternatives that offer more than just cute designs. They want utility, community engagement, and, most importantly, the potential for growth. BTFD Coin, with its robust features like the P2E game and staking rewards, presents a compelling case for those searching for the best new meme coins to join today. Conclusion: Don’t Let the BTFD Coin Opportunity Slip Away In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, meme coins have carved out a unique niche that blends fun and potential profit. BTFD Coin is here to shake things up with its innovative P2E game, remarkable staking rewards, and an inviting referral program. It’s not just another meme; it’s a community-driven investment opportunity that’s hard to ignore.

Bitcoin Hasn’t Surpassed Last MVRV Pricing Band Yet In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about the extreme euphoria threshold of the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Pricing Bands. The MVRV Pricing Bands is a pricing model for the cryptocurrency that’s based on the MVRV Ratio. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $690 Million As Bitcoin, Ethereum Crash The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of how the value held by the Bitcoin investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value that they initially put in (the realized cap). When the metric is greater than 1, the investors are holding more value than their initial investment, meaning that they are in a state of net profit. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the market as a whole is underwater. Historically, the holders being in too much profit has often signaled overheated conditions for Bitcoin, due to the fact that mass selloffs with the motive of profit-taking become probable in such conditions. Similarly, the dominance of loss has led to bottoms, as there aren’t many sellers left during these periods. The MVRV Pricing Bands aim to capture this relationship. It defines certain price levels for the cryptocurrency that correspond to important levels in the MVRV Ratio. Here is the chart for the model shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in these Bitcoin pricing bands over the last several years: From the graph, it’s visible that the 0.8 pricing band, which is where the MVRV Ratio assumes a value equal to 0.8, has been around where bear market bottoms have formed for the asset. Right now, BTC is far above this level, situated at $33,100. The coin’s price is also at a significant distance from the 1.0 level of $41,300, which corresponds to the cost basis of the average address or investor on the network. The pricing bands that BTC is currently trading under are the 2.4 and 3.2 levels, located at $99,300 and $132,400, respectively. The former of these has historically served as a signal that the bull market is getting heated. Related Reading: Less Than 1% Of Bitcoin Investors In Loss After BTC Reclaims $100,000 BTC can stay inside this zone for a while, but once the market cap surpasses the 3.2 level, it becomes very likely that some type of top is going to be hit soon. The chart below illustrates just how rare it is for the asset to trade in the region above 3.2: “BTC price has historically spent only ~5% of trading days above the 3.2 MVRV level,” notes the analytics firm. “This highlights how rare such peaks are and reinforces why it’s often considered an “extreme euphoria” zone.” So far, Bitcoin hasn’t been able to surpass this line in the current cycle. If the past bull markets are anything to go by, the top would only occur above this level, which would imply more room still left for the asset to run in the current cycle. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the pattern would actually hold this time or not. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $93,400, down more than 3% over the last seven days.

Yoshitaka Kitao, a proponent of the XRP ecosystem, said in a recent interview that Shigeru Ishiba is the “only one who is not convinced” about lowering rates to 20%. In politics — and politically embedded big business — you never know who is on what side. It might be safe to say they are all against you, pretending to be against one another. Perhaps that is why Yoshitaka Kitao, CEO of the $7.6 billion-dollar financial services firm SBI Holdings, not only lambasted the country’s new prime minister about high crypto tax rates in a recent interview , but also threw pro-crypto leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki, under the bus, claiming he is manipulating the minority ruling party. Either way you slice it, Japan is in trouble when it comes to money and keeping up with the rapid innovations of cryptocurrency, and SBI’s Kitao directed strong words toward the government’s lead figurehead on the issue. SBI’s Kitao to prime minister: ‘The only one not convinced [about crypto] is you’ While Japan’s parasitic tax system currently wrings out individuals for up to 55% of their crypto gains (and even over 100% in cases where inheritance is factored in), The SBI CEO wants to implement a separate 20% taxation system for digital assets, similar to how stocks are taxed. Kitao pointed to the dire condition of the economy, telling the publication AERA: “The fundamental reason for the weak yen is the decline of national power.” He went on to cite rising food prices not keeping up with wages, and emphasized: “I’m really worried about Japanese politics.” When asked about the PM’s administration, Kitao stated that the ruling party is being manipulated by the likes of opposition party leader Tamaki and the DPP, and brought up Ishiba’s public antipathy toward crypto. “For example, when (Prime Minister) Ishiba is asked about his opinion on lowering the tax rate on crypto assets to 20%, the same as stocks, he says, ‘Will the people be convinced?'” Kitao prefaced, declaring boldly: “From my point of view, I would say that the only one not convinced, is you.” He then reminded the interviewer that Japan is the only country that taxes crypto gains at 55%. Kitao’s stance on XRP Yoshitaka Kitao has become an influential figure not only in Japanese finance in general, but also when it comes to the world of cryptocurrencies, thanks to his company’s involvement with Ripple and XRP. In May 2024, for example, SBI VC Trade, part of SBI Group, announced it had begun operation as a validator for the XRP ledger. The financial services giant also uses XRP to reward shareholders, and has just launched a collaboration with Solana Superteam Japan, to issue exclusive NFTs to users of SBI VC Trade’s Web3 Wallet.

However, market analysts have recently observed a shift in sentiment toward negativity, with discussions around DOGE showing that a higher percentage of the community is pessimistic about DOGE’s upside potential. While negative sentiment might seem like a bearish indicator, this analyst argues that this could actually be a positive development for the Dogecoin price. Historically, market downturns driven by fear and doubt have often set the stage for strong recoveries as weak hands exit and long-term investors accumulate at lower prices. Interestingly, this sentiment shift is also drawing attention to an AI altcoin, PCHAIN, the utility token of PropiChain. PropiChain is a blockchain-based, AI-powered real estate platform designed to revolutionize the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. According to expert analysts, the negative social sentiment on the Dogecoin price drives savvy investors to crypto assets like PCHAIN , with real-world utility. However, the negative social sentiment could also be a blessing in disguise for DOGE, but that will be a long shot since the Dogecoin price primarily thrives on community hype. The Social Sentiment Impact on the Dogecoin Price and PCHAIN Social sentiment analysis involves evaluating public opinion by gathering data from social media platforms, forums, and other online communities. In the context of the Dogecoin price, social sentiment can significantly influence market dynamics, as memecoins like DOGE are heavily swayed by public perception. According to technical and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez , the Dogecoin price-weighted social sentiment has turned negative. With a score of -0.60, the result indicates a prevailing pessimistic outlook among social media users. While the analyst suggests a contrarian investment strategy for the Dogecoin price, many top market analysts have a different opinion. Going against the prevailing market sentiment for a crypto asset with solid fundamentals and real-world utility is completely different from doing the same for a memecoin like DOGE. This is why whales and retail traders are flocking to PCHAIN, as the public perception of DOGE is negative. With solid fundamentals and a unique value proposition in the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market, investors see PCHAIN as the ideal asset for potentially massive gains in the 2025 bull run. PCHAIN and DOGE: Comparative Analysis Amid Negative Social Sentiment on the Dogecoin Price Looking at the Dogecoin price movement over the past 30 days, CoinGecko data reveals that DOGE has lost 15% of its market value. This further aligns with the negative social sentiment that saw the majority of the DOGE community say they don’t believe in its upside potential. The result is a big blow to the Dogecoin price as the memecoin relies heavily on hype rather than an intrinsic value proposition. This is completely the opposite of PCHAIN, which is backed by the number one asset class in the world. PCHAIN offers investors early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate. The token combines the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets. An Economic Times publication revealed that the real-world asset tokenization market is projected to grow to $16 trillion, and real estate is the largest market share contributor. Such market growth will undoubtedly drive up the value of PCHAIN, attracting savvy investors who are skeptical about the Dogecoin price movement. PropiChain: Redefining Real Estate Investment with Cutting-Edge Technologies PropiChain is the parent project behind the AI-driven altcoin PCHAIN. Designed as a blockchain-powered ecosystem, it integrates artificial intelligence, the Metaverse, smart contracts, and RWA tokenization to reshape the global real estate industry. Using AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots, PropiChain provides all-round support for real estate investors. Its predictive AI-driven market analysis tool delivers real-time insights and predictive trends, equipping investors with the data they need to make strategic, informed investment decisions. Through the Metaverse integration, PropiChain redefines property exploration with immersive 3D visualization. This eliminates the need for physical site visits, creating a borderless digital marketplace where buyers and sellers can seamlessly connect, negotiate, and finalize transactions globally. The platform automates essential processes such as lease agreements and renewals with its smart contract technology feature. Property owners gain greater autonomy over their investments by removing intermediaries like agents and brokers while significantly reducing transaction and management costs. PropiChain digitizes real estate assets through RWA tokenization, allowing fractional ownership in high-value properties. This innovation makes premium real estate more accessible, enabling investors with smaller capital to participate in high-yield opportunities previously reserved for the wealthy elite. Conclusion While the negative social sentiment on the Dogecoin price might present an opportunity for contrarian investors, it is also dicey. On the other hand, PCHAIN presents a great opportunity for early investors to have a share of the $600 trillion global real estate market. After raising over $1.3 million in its first presale round, this token has also crossed the $700,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This highlights the growing investor confidence in the profit potential of the project. Top analysts have revealed that a $1000 investment in the ongoing presale would yield over $253,430 in profit. At the end of this presale round, the token price will increase to $0.023 from the current $0.011. Join the presale now for optimal returns on your investment. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , reiterating the project’s readiness to take the crypto space by storm.

Explore TON & AVAX Prices Trends,https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-refer-earn-program-unlimited-usdt-cashbacks/,"The cryptocurrency market is evolving rapidly, with Toncoin (TON), Avalanche (AVAX), and BlockDAG (BDAG) at the forefront of this shift. Current forecasts for Toncoin price prediction indicate a potential climb to $16.65 this year, following a notable 140% increase in 2024. Meanwhile, AVAX price trends are also looking up, with projections suggesting a rise to $81 in 2025, fueled by robust DeFi and dApp engagement. Concurrently, BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn program is gaining traction, providing 6%-10% instant USDT cashback without limits to both referrers and buyers. A mere $30 purchase is enough to participate, making the offer accessible to a broader audience. This program has propelled BlockDAG’s presale to over $177.5 million, considerably broadening its user base. Let’s dive deeper into these developments and identify the next big crypto. AVAX Price Trends: Could Reach $81 by Year-End? Avalanche (AVAX) is poised for significant growth, potentially benefiting from the expected 2025 altcoin season. The network’s increasing use in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps) could propel its price. Current AVAX price trends suggest a possible peak at $81 by year-end 2025, assuming market conditions remain favorable. However, potential bearish corrections or restrictive regulations might lower its value to $44, with an average price possibly settling at $62. Projections also indicate that ongoing adoption, partnerships, and innovations might elevate AVAX’s value to $100 by 2026, despite potential economic downturns or market obstacles. The outlook for AVAX’s long-term growth remains positive. Toncoin Price Prediction: What Lies Ahead After a 140% Increase? Toncoin continues to capture interest following its substantial growth and support from major backers such as Pantera Capital. Currently trading at approximately $5.57, the latest Toncoin price prediction highlights a significant 140% rise in 2024, pushing it into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Looking ahead to 2025, the Toncoin price prediction reveals potential growth driven by broader blockchain uptake and ecosystem achievements, possibly reaching $16.65. Nevertheless, prices might fall to $7.26 in adverse market scenarios, averaging around $12.95. The forecast from 2026 to 2030 suggests continued growth for Toncoin, with potential prices reaching $22 in 2026. BlockDAG’s Unlimited USDT Cashback Program: Only $30 to Start! BlockDAG, a leading Layer-1 blockchain, is creating waves with its interesting referral program, which provides immediate USDT cashback rewards that are both rewarding and inclusive. Participants referring others can secure a starting cashback of 6% for each purchase made through their link, which can increase to 10% from the fifth purchase onwards within the same day. At the same time, buyers get a consistent 6% cashback on each transaction they complete. This cashback is instantly deposited into wallets that accept BEP-20 USDT tokens. This program encourages ongoing participation, thus enhancing the ecosystem’s growth. Importantly, both referrers and buyers gain from every transaction, fostering a continuous cycle of rewards and setting new benchmarks in crypto referral programs. The ease of entry is also a key feature, with only a $30 minimum purchase required, enabling broader participation and benefiting even smaller buyers. This approach makes the referral program a powerful tool for financial empowerment and broadens access to the crypto rewards system. The excitement around this referral initiative continues to elevate BlockDAG’s presale, positioning it as the next big crypto of 2025. So far, the platform has collected over $177.5 million in revenue from selling more than 17.7 billion coins, demonstrating solid community trust and buyer enthusiasm. Moreover, early participants in BDAG have seen an impressive 2380% ROI as the price per coin increased from $0.001 in the first batch to $0.0248 in the latest, batch 27. Seize the Potential of the Next Big Crypto Now! Avalanche and Toncoin remain compelling prospects, with AVAX price trends indicating a potential rise to $81 by year-end and Toncoin price prediction suggesting an ascent into double-digits, spurred by increased adoption and ecosystem developments. Simultaneously, BlockDAG’s Refer & Earn program is transforming how users interact with crypto, providing up to 10% instant USDT cashback for as little as a $30 purchase.

Cardano’s current price of $0.8577 signals the close of its downward trend, with future estimates suggesting a rise to $2.50 by 2025. Meanwhile, the XRP price surge has brought hope, climbing 10% in a day with the potential to reach $3.20 amid positive market sentiment. BlockDAG’s impressive $177.5 million in presale funds and its dual EVM-WASM support underscore its position as the top crypto to buy now. The anticipated Mainnet launch further strengthens BlockDAG’s sophisticated ecosystem, captivating both developers and traders. Cardano Price Update Reveals a New Price Target Cardano’s recent correction phase has stirred discussions about its next move, with ADA now trading at $0.8577 after a 40% drop from its peak following a 300% rally. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests that ADA is nearing a recovery, identifying the $0.74–$0.98 range as a strong entry zone for investors. Long-term projections remain bullish despite the pullback, with potential price targets of $2.50 to $3.00 by 2025. As the correction phase winds down, Cardano could be set for a fresh upward trend, driven by technical indicators and ongoing ecosystem advancements. XRP Price Surge: Market Eyes Potential Highs The recent 10% leap in XRP’s value to $2.31 has kept it in the spotlight, positioning it as a market leader with traders eyeing a potential peak near its highest-ever value of $3.84. Crypto analyst The Moon Show , posting on X, noted a symmetrical triangle pattern, hinting that XRP’s price might aim for $3.20 soon, driven by robust purchasing activity. This surge in XRP reflects a growing optimism and speculative interest among traders, potentially setting the stage for XRP to surpass the $3 mark by January. Market observers are keenly watching this upward trend. BlockDAG’s Developer Base Grows With ‘EVM and WASM’ Integration! BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM technologies promises to redefine its platform, positioning it as a prime choice for developers and traders. Its compatibility with EVM allows for smooth transitions of Ethereum-based decentralized apps (dApps) to BlockDAG, encouraging swift adoption and reducing technical challenges. This functionality attracts developers from the bustling Ethereum community to BlockDAG, while WASM integration opens new possibilities in gaming, artificial intelligence, and finance, offering exceptional adaptability and performance. These innovations lay a solid groundwork for ongoing growth. BlockDAG’s fundraising success, accumulating $177.5 million with 17.7 billion coins sold, underscores its market appeal, with BDAG coins currently at $0.0248 in batch 27. Early supporters have seen an ROI of 2380%, emphasizing strong market demand. Analysts foresee BDAG reaching $30 by 2030, bolstered by its advanced technology and community support. The anticipated 2025 Mainnet launch adds a sense of urgency for those looking for the best crypto to buy now, predicting a significant uptake in BlockDAG’s adoption and value increase. This strategic blend of technology and market strategy secures BlockDAG’s position as a noteworthy project. As it pioneers EVM and WASM integrations, BlockDAG is poised to transform blockchain applications and establish itself as a decentralized technology leader.

Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says an anonymous trader moved 427 billion Pepe tokens worth $8.5 million at the time of the transfer to US-based crypto exchange Kraken where the crypto trove could potentially be sold on the open market. Meanwhile, the whale continues to hold one trillion PEPE worth $18.4 million at the time, showing a profit of about $2 million. According to Lookonchain, the same trader just last month gained millions of dollars in profit by selling all his Pepe holdings during the initial stages of a December market correction. The sale came after the trader had accumulated more than one trillion Pepe tokens between March and September of 2024. The trader subsequently bought more than one trillion PEPE again in late December as the memecoin’s price stabilized. Said Lookonchain at the time, “This smart whale sold all his PEPE during the market drop on December 19th, making a total profit of $11.7 million on PEPE! Over the past six days, after the market decline, the whale accumulated 1.42 trillion PEPE ($24.5 million) again.” Source: Lookonchain/X Pepe is trading for $0.000018 at time of writing, down 4.2% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $7.5 billion, Pepe is the 29th-largest crypto project.

Elon Invades UK (ELONUK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONUK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Invades UK can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Invades UK could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Invades UK launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Invades UK on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Invades UK by entering its contract address – JA5sb997xcRGZ9SBaPPUQ58S29Uqic2DEe14fUBjcW3d – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONUK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-10 01:16:28

While last year’s crypto headlines were dominated by Shiba Inu and SPX6900, 2025 has already ushered in a new wave of investment opportunities. The race to scoop up the best altcoins is on, with traders and investors setting their sights on projects with revolutionary utility and growth potential. From institutional investors to crypto rookies, everyone’s asking the same question: what are the top altcoins to buy this month? Enter Qubetics ($TICS), XRP, and Celestia—three altcoins offering game-changing solutions in the blockchain space. With Qubetics stealing the spotlight through its ongoing presale success, this article dives into what makes these tokens stand out and why they deserve a spot in your portfolio. But let’s zoom in on Qubetics first. This altcoin doesn’t just promise change; it delivers practical, real-world solutions that predecessors like XRP and Celestia have merely scratched the surface of. By tackling inefficiencies in asset tokenisation and digital finance, $TICS is setting the gold standard for blockchain innovation in 2025 and beyond. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Asset Tokenisation If you haven’t heard of Qubetics , you’re missing out. Currently in its 16th presale stage, Qubetics has already sold over 408 million tokens, raising an impressive $9.1 million from more than 13,800 holders. At just $0.0455 per token, the window to buy $TICS at a discount is closing fast, with prices set to surge by 10% over the weekend. So, what makes Qubetics worth your attention? At its core is the Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace—a groundbreaking feature that’s poised to redefine how businesses and individuals interact with blockchain technology. This platform allows users to tokenize physical assets like real estate, art, or commodities, making them easily tradable on the blockchain. Imagine a small business owner in Toronto tokenising a commercial property to secure funding or an artist in New York digitising their work for global sales—Qubetics makes these scenarios a seamless reality. Qubetics also boasts a strategic partnership with SWFT Blockchain, ensuring smooth and efficient cross-chain transactions. This collaboration enhances liquidity and accessibility, making $TICS a truly versatile asset. Whether you’re a real estate mogul or a solo entrepreneur, Qubetics simplifies complex financial processes, bringing blockchain tech to everyday life. But the presale isn’t just about early-bird pricing; it’s about entering a world of untapped potential. Analysts are already predicting a jaw-dropping 32,816% ROI for $TICS by the time of its mainnet launch. With $10-15 valuations on the horizon, Qubetics isn’t just an investment—it’s a movement. XRP: The Pioneer with Staying Power Next up is XRP, the OG of cross-border payments. For years, XRP has been a staple in the crypto world, thanks to its speed and efficiency. Unlike traditional payment systems that can take days to process international transactions, XRP completes them in mere seconds. It’s like upgrading from snail mail to email—you can’t go back. What’s keeping XRP relevant in 2025? Ripple’s relentless focus on partnerships and adoption. Major banks and financial institutions continue to integrate Ripple’s technology, making XRP a reliable choice for businesses looking to streamline global payments. Plus, its low transaction fees are a lifesaver for small businesses and freelancers who can’t afford to lose chunks of their income to fees. Celestia: Modular Blockchain Magic Last but not least, Celestia is shaking up blockchain architecture with its modular approach. While traditional blockchains like Ethereum bundle all functions together—from consensus to execution—Celestia unbundles them. It’s like building with LEGO blocks rather than pouring concrete. This modularity offers unparalleled flexibility and scalability, solving issues that have plagued blockchain networks for years. But why is Celestia on our radar for January 2025? Simple: its commitment to decentralisation and customisation. While other blockchains try to be a one-size-fits-all solution, Celestia embraces diversity. This approach makes it a favourite for niche projects and large-scale applications alike. For investors, Celestia represents the cutting edge of blockchain evolution. While it might not have the presale hype of Qubetics or the legacy of XRP, its disruptive potential makes it a worthy contender in any portfolio. The Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: The Game-Changer Tokenising real-world assets isn’t just a buzzword; it’s the future of finance. This concept allows individuals and businesses to convert tangible assets into digital tokens, enabling fractional ownership and effortless trading. Think about it: why should only billionaires own a Picasso or skyscraper? With asset tokenization , anyone can invest in a fraction of high-value assets, democratising wealth creation. Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is leading this charge. By simplifying asset tokenization, Qubetics bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. From small-scale farmers in Texas tokenizing crop yields to tech startups in Seattle issuing equity as tokens, the possibilities are endless. This isn’t just a tech upgrade; it’s a societal shift. For blockchain enthusiasts and sceptics alike, the marketplace highlights why blockchain is more than just crypto. It’s a tool for empowerment, transparency, and efficiency in a world desperate for smarter solutions. Conclusion: Invest in Tomorrow, Today January 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal moment in crypto history, with Qubetics, XRP, and Celestia leading the charge. Each project offers unique strengths, from Qubetics’ innovative asset tokenization to XRP’s payment solutions and Celestia’s modular flexibility. But if you’re looking for a token with the perfect blend of innovation, utility, and growth potential, $TICS is the one to watch. With the Qubetics presale in full swing and $ TICS poised for a 10% price hike this weekend, the time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to be part of a blockchain revolution that’s set to transform industries and redefine digital finance. Get your $TICS tokens today and secure your stake in the future.

Tron has earned its stripes by decentralising the entertainment and content industry, while Tezos stands out for its self-amending blockchain and governance model. However, Qubetics ($TICS) is taking centre stage, delivering next-level interoperability solutions that simplify how users and businesses interact across multiple blockchains. As of its 16th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 408 million tokens to more than 13,800 holders, raising an impressive $9.1 million. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.0455, this is your chance to invest in a project that’s solving blockchain’s most significant challenges and creating a unified ecosystem. In this article, we’ll dive deep into why Qubetics, Tron, and Tezos deserve a spot in your portfolio and why they’re the top cryptos to buy this weekend. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain with Seamless Interoperability Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project—it’s a bold vision for unifying the fragmented world of decentralised technologies. At the core of this mission is Qubetics’ interoperability feature, which makes it possible for different blockchains to communicate and share data effortlessly. Currently, blockchain users often face roadblocks when transferring assets or interacting with decentralised applications across different ecosystems. For instance, a trader might need to convert Ethereum-based tokens to Binance Smart Chain assets, often relying on third-party exchanges that can be slow, expensive, and vulnerable to security breaches. Qubetics eliminates these inefficiencies by enabling direct, secure, and cost-effective interactions between blockchains. Think about a freelance designer who’s paid in one cryptocurrency but wants to use another to invest in NFTs or trade on decentralised exchanges. With Qubetics, they can effortlessly bridge their tokens without leaving the platform. Businesses, too, gain from interoperability. A global retailer using blockchain for supply chain management can seamlessly integrate multiple systems, ensuring data flows smoothly between suppliers, warehouses, and customers. The platform’s partnership with SWFT Blockchain further enhances its cross-chain capabilities , allowing users to move assets quickly and securely across networks. But what truly sets Qubetics apart is its vision for the future. By addressing the pain points of interoperability, it’s creating a foundation for a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem, where users and developers can operate without limits. The presale success, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0455, reflects the growing confidence in its mission. Tron: Redefining Content and Entertainment on the Blockchain Tron has made a name for itself by disrupting the entertainment industry with its decentralised content-sharing platform. Founded by Justin Sun, Tron enables creators to connect directly with their audience, cutting out intermediaries and ensuring that artists and writers keep more of their earnings. At its core, Tron operates on a high-speed blockchain capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for content-heavy applications. Imagine a musician who wants to sell their album directly to fans without involving record labels or streaming platforms. Tron makes this possible, ensuring that artists receive fair compensation while fans enjoy lower prices. The platform also hosts a growing number of decentralised apps (dApps), particularly in gaming and DeFi. With its energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Tron has positioned itself as a sustainable alternative to older blockchain platforms. However, Tron’s focus on entertainment and content creation doesn’t address the broader challenges of interoperability—a problem that Qubetics tackles head-on. Even so, Tron remains one of the top cryptos to buy this weekend, especially for those interested in decentralised content ecosystems. Tezos: Leading the Way with Self-Amending Governance Tezos is a unique blockchain that prioritises governance and adaptability. Unlike most cryptocurrencies that rely on hard forks to upgrade, Tezos has a self-amending mechanism that allows stakeholders to vote on and implement changes directly within the network. This innovation reduces disruptions and ensures the platform evolves alongside its community’s needs. For example, imagine a DeFi protocol built on Tezos that needs a new feature to comply with regulatory changes. Instead of undergoing a risky hard fork, the Tezos community can vote on the update, ensuring a seamless transition that keeps the network running smoothly. Tezos also boasts energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus, making it an environmentally friendly choice for developers and users. The blockchain has found applications in tokenisation, DeFi, and NFTs, with several high-profile partnerships demonstrating its potential. While Tezos excels in governance and adaptability, it doesn’t directly address interoperability challenges like Qubetics does. Nonetheless, its innovative approach to blockchain evolution makes it one of the top cryptos to buy this weekend, particularly for those who value sustainability and user-centric design. Why Interoperability is the Future of Blockchain Interoperability is no longer just a buzzword; it’s a necessity for blockchain’s continued growth and adoption. As more blockchains emerge, each with its strengths and limitations, the ability to transfer assets and data seamlessly across networks becomes critical. Qubetics’ interoperability feature is a game-changer in this space. By enabling different blockchains to communicate without relying on centralised exchanges or bridging services, Qubetics simplifies user experiences and eliminates inefficiencies. Here’s how it works: The platform acts as a universal translator for blockchains, allowing them to share information and transfer value securely. This capability opens the door to countless possibilities. Developers can create dApps that tap into the strengths of multiple blockchains, such as combining Ethereum’s smart contracts with Solana’s high-speed transactions. Users, meanwhile, enjoy a smoother experience, whether they’re trading tokens or accessing services across different platforms. Interoperability is the key to creating a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem. By addressing this challenge, Qubetics is not just keeping up with the times—it’s setting the pace for what’s to come. Conclusion: Why Qubetics ($TICS) Leads the Top Cryptos to Buy This Weekend Qubetics, Tron, and Tezos each bring something unique to the crypto table. Tron is transforming content and entertainment, while Tezos is setting the standard for governance and sustainability. But Qubetics stands out with its focus on interoperability, solving a critical issue that affects everyone in the blockchain space. With over 408 million tokens sold and $9.1 million raised in its 16th presale stage, Qubetics is capturing the attention of savvy investors. At $0.0455 per token, it’s an exciting opportunity to be part of a project that’s building a connected blockchain future. If you’re looking for the top cryptos to buy this weekend , Qubetics deserves to be at the top of your list.

Solana trading volume remains robust, sustaining its strong presence in both spot and derivatives markets, even with minor fluctuations from prior peaks. Meanwhile, a significant Dogecoin whale transfer involving a hefty 466 million DOGE has ignited discussions regarding its impact on market trends and trading tactics. Adding excitement to the crypto market, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as one of the top cryptos to buy, following a $178 million presale and a limited-time $1M New Year’s Raffle that is drawing to a close in just 3 days. These developments demonstrate the interesting methods traders use to navigate the growing cryptocurrency market. Solana Trading Volume Demonstrates Stability Solana trading volume remains an essential indicator as the blockchain continues to be one of the top-performing networks. Recent figures show Solana reaching $112 billion in spot trading volume for December, a commendable achievement despite a slight decrease from November’s peak of $132.3 billion. This performance puts Solana’s trading volume ahead of many major industry rivals. In the derivatives market, Solana trading volume also remains solid at $34.1 billion, affirming its position as the second-largest blockchain for on-chain derivatives trading. While there are slight declines, Solana’s trading volume highlights the network’s persistent relevance to traders in Q1. Dogecoin Whale Transfer Fuels Market Conversation A noteworthy Dogecoin whale transfer of 466,890,148 DOGE, worth roughly $149 million, has prompted speculation about its market consequences. The transfer occurred between unidentified wallets and coincided with a 3.1% drop in price, setting Dogecoin’s rate at $0.3238. The Dogecoin whale transfer has led to mixed interpretations. Some analysts see it as a sign of institutional interest, possibly indicating intentions for long-term holdings that could reduce the circulating supply. Others consider the transfer as a precursor to potential sell-offs, which could exert downward pressure on DOGE’s value. Despite the short-term pessimistic view, Dogecoin’s whale transfer fits patterns that have historically led to price increases. Observers remain split on its significance, underscoring the challenges of deciphering such major movements. Countdown to BlockDAG’s $1M Raffle Finale BlockDAG’s $1M New Year’s Raffle is swiftly approaching its conclusion, presenting an exciting opportunity for participants to win big. The platform has already gathered over $178 million from its crypto presale, with 17.7 billion coins distributed. With the price per coin at $0.0248, early participants have seen a staggering 2,380% return, positioning BlockDAG as one of the top crypto to buy this season. The raffle includes a tiered ticket system catering to a variety of spending levels: Bronze Ticket ($250): Provides $250 in BDAG plus a 200% bonus, with potential winnings up to $250,000 USDT. Silver Ticket ($500): Grants $500 in BDAG along with the same bonus, offering a chance to win up to $500,000 USDT. Gold Ticket ($1000): Delivers $1000 in BDAG, improved winning odds, and the possibility to snag the grand prize of $1 million USDT. A minimum holding of $100 in BDAG is required for participation, setting a fair yet thoughtful threshold for entry. Winners will be announced on BlockDAG’s official platforms, maintaining transparency throughout the process. With the raffle nearing its end, traders are hurrying to secure their tickets and maximize their winning potential, ushering in an exhilarating start to the new year for BDAG holders. Final Say As the first quarter of the year unfolds, the cryptocurrency domain continues to offer diverse possibilities for traders.

In this ever-growing ecosystem, standout projects continue to push boundaries and offer practical applications that shape the future. This list explores the top 4 blockchain innovations that highlight the diverse potential of this technology. Featuring Web3Bay, Chainlink, IoTeX, and Hedera, these projects showcase unique advancements that cater to a wide range of industries and needs. 1. Web3Bay: Gateway to High ROI & Decentralised Shopping Experience Web3Bay ’s decentralized e-commerce platform is one of the top 4 blockchain innovations right now in the market. This new project offers an e-commerce platform that leverages blockchain to offer security, transparency, and decentralization. Designed to cater to the modern shopper, it allows users to purchase a wide range of items, including luxury goods, game cards, sneakers, and more, all while maintaining control over their data. Shoppers also get a 20% discount on every purchase on the Web3Bay platform, further enhancing the platform’s appeal as a cost-effective and future-forward solution. By incorporating cryptocurrency payments and integrating mainstream options like PayPal, Web3Bay bridges the gap between traditional online shopping and the next era of e-commerce. The presale of its 3BAY tokens is already generating impressive excitement. Web3Bay has already raised over $480,000 and sold over 138 million tokens. Plus, early adopters are set to gain a 6430% ROI when the token launches post-launch. These figures reflect the growing confidence in the platform’s potential to become a leading player in the e-commerce space. As the presale progresses, the opportunity to join this project at a $0.0039675 price tag won’t last long. Web3Bay’s commitment to redefining e-commerce positions it as an essential investment for those looking to support cutting-edge solutions. With its ability to combine blockchain security, mainstream payment methods, and exclusive shopping benefits, Web3Bay is set to reshape the way users interact with online markets. 2. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchain & Real-World Data Chainlink has established itself as one of the top 4 blockchain innovations and a cornerstone of the blockchain oracle ecosystem, seamlessly linking decentralized networks with real-world data. Its reliable data feeds support key decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, securing over $41 billion in total value across various networks. However, Chainlink has faced challenges, including a noticeable drop in its token price, which fell by 16.52% over the past month, reaching $20.76. While this decline reflects market volatility, Chainlink’s consistent efforts to expand its use cases and maintain its leadership position in oracles suggest its long-term relevance remains strong. 3. IoTeX: Building Bridges Between Blockchain & IoT IoTeX stands at the forefront of connecting blockchain with the Internet of Things (IoT), providing a platform that supports over 50 Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) projects. By enabling decentralized solutions for infrastructure management and cloud services, IoTeX continues to integrate real-world applications with blockchain technology. Despite its technological progress, IoTeX has encountered recent price volatility, with its token value falling by 31.41% in the last month to $0.03725. While this reflects broader market trends, IoTeX’s involvement in regulatory discussions through its membership in the Blockchain Association underscores its commitment to shaping the future of blockchain IoT integration. 4. Hedera: Redefining Blockchain Performance Hedera has become one of the top 4 blockchain innovations in the market due to its advanced hash graph consensus mechanism that delivers an impressive throughput of over 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). Its unique architecture, featuring asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) and a leaderless design, ensures a secure and efficient environment for enterprise use cases. The recent launch of Hedera’s Asset Tokenization Studio introduces a comprehensive solution for managing tokenized assets on-chain. Despite a 9.85% drop in its token price over the past month to $0.2779, Hedera continues to focus on enterprise adoption and advancing blockchain technology for real-world applications. Which of These Top 4 Blockchain Innovations Lead? The blockchain ecosystem is filled with top blockchain innovations succeeding in different domains. Chainlink continues to lead the way in connecting blockchain networks with real-world data. IoTeX is breaking new ground by merging blockchain with the IoT. Hedera offers unparalleled transaction speeds and innovative tools for enterprise blockchain applications. However, among these, Web3Bay stands out as a game-changer in e-commerce with its decentralized platform, secure blockchain foundation, and integration of both cryptocurrency and mainstream payment options. The platform’s impressive presale performance highlights the confidence it has garnered from early adopters.

The rally, which many investors hoped would solidify Bitcoin’s bullish structure, quickly reversed, driving the price down to a low of $92,500. The sudden downturn has rattled market sentiment, leaving investors cautious about the immediate direction of the crypto market leader. Related Reading: Expert Sets $1 Target For Dogecoin Once It Breaks A Multi-Year Trend – Details Top analyst Axel Adler has shared crucial data on X, highlighting Bitcoin’s nearest support levels. According to Adler, the key levels to watch are between $86.8K and $89.7K, representing the short-term holders’ realized price. These metrics suggest that Bitcoin is approaching a significant demand zone, where accumulation might take place if the selling pressure eases. As Bitcoin consolidates near these levels, the market waits for signs of stabilization. Whether Bitcoin can recover from this setback or extend its correction remains uncertain. However, the current support levels could serve as a turning point, offering a foundation for bulls to regain momentum. Bitcoin Consolidates Between Key Levels Bitcoin is navigating a critical consolidation phase, with the price fluctuating between $100K and $92K. While there have been brief deviations above the $100K mark, the market leader has struggled to maintain momentum, raising concerns about a potential drop to lower demand zones. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring this range, with expectations of Bitcoin finding stronger footing below the $90K area. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, shedding light on Bitcoin’s nearest support levels. According to Adler, the Short-Term Holders 1M-3M Realized Price is currently $89.7K, while the broader Short-Term Holders Realized Price sits at $86.8K. These levels represent key demand zones that could provide Bitcoin with the fuel needed for its next rally. A dip into these areas would likely attract buyers, setting the stage for a potential reversal. Related Reading: Solana Must Reclaim Momentum In The Coming Weeks – SOL/BTC Ratio At A Pivotal Point This period of consolidation is seen as pivotal for Bitcoin, as holding above or reclaiming key levels like $92K will determine its trajectory. While the broader market sentiment remains cautious, a drop into these lower support zones could offer a significant accumulation opportunity for long-term investors. The coming days will be crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin can stabilize and prepare for a renewed bullish push. BTC Faces Critical Support Test Below $95,000 Bitcoin is trading at $93,400, navigating a precarious position as it faces increasing risk with each moment spent below the $95,000 mark. After a brief surge above $100K earlier this month, the bulls lost control, failing to sustain support above this psychological level. This decline has left Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside, with investors closely watching key support levels. For bulls to regain momentum, reclaiming the $95K level is crucial. Beyond this, the $98K mark must also be retaken to confirm a bullish consolidation and signal strength in the market. Until then, uncertainty looms, with Bitcoin’s current range reflecting a lack of decisive control by either side.

However, losing this level would expose Bitcoin to lower demand zones around $85K, a key area that could attract buyers and stabilize the price.

BNB & AVAX Insights,https://nulltx.com/bdags-evm-wasm-drive-bdag-to-1-aim-bnb-avax-insights/,"Explore Latest BNB & AVAX Price Predictions – BlockDAG’s Dual Power with EVM & WASM Propels BDAG to $1 Goal! Price projections for major assets are catching the attention of traders and analysts. The BNB price forecast displays a hopeful tone, with potential to reach $750 resistance while keeping support beyond $680. Simultaneously, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction offers a varied view for 2025, straddling hopeful advancements and possible regulatory challenges. These views mirror the wider market dynamics of risks and prospects. Meanwhile, the combined efforts of EVM and WASM are pushing BlockDAG (BDAG) ahead as a standout venture among top crypto coins for 2025. BlockDAG’s impressive crypto presale, amassing over $178 million, along with robust ecosystem growth, highlights its interesting aspects and strong potential for adoption. This positions BDAG as an attractive option for forward-looking traders. BNB Price Forecast Stays Optimistic Despite Hurdles The BNB price forecast shows hopeful prospects, with the cryptocurrency now trading at $708. Analysts predict a positive trend could elevate BNB to $750 or even $800, assuming it remains above the 21-day SMA. Nonetheless, the $750 resistance level has been a notable obstacle, limiting upward progress. If downward pressure increases, the BNB price forecast suggests a potential drop to $635 or less, if downward momentum breaks the support. Recent technical signals show prices fluctuating between $680 and $720, restricted by moving average lines. The BNB price forecast highlights the need for a clear breakout to set its future course as the market awaits further developments. Avalanche Price Prediction Indicates Possible Growth The Avalanche price prediction portrays a diverse outlook for 2025, with analysts pointing out factors that could shape its path. Projections vary from $50 to $150, influenced by market dynamics and the adoption of the Avalanche network. Positive movements in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could significantly elevate AVAX’s value. The Avalanche price prediction also stresses the importance of network scalability and compatibility. As more dApps and users join the platform, its value could increase. Analysts remain watchful, recognizing competition from other blockchain platforms and regulatory uncertainties as potential hurdles. Whether the future leans towards optimism or caution, Avalanche continues to be a critical asset to monitor. Driving BDAG’s Ascent: BlockDAG’s EVM & WASM Technologies BlockDAG is capturing attention with its dual technologies, EVM compatibility and WASM integration, paving the way for potential price increases for BDAG. These technological integrations facilitate the easy migration of Ethereum-based dApps and expand the developer base by supporting multiple programming languages, including Rust and C++. This positions BlockDAG as a formidable contender among top crypto coins for 2025. With a current price of $0.0248, BlockDAG’s crypto presale has garnered $178 million, selling 17.7 billion BDAG coins since its inception. Early supporters have enjoyed an ROI of 2,380%, highlighting its growing appeal. The EVM allows Ethereum developers a smooth transition, and WASM enhances performance and scalability for demanding uses like gaming and DeFi. BlockDAG’s comprehensive roadmap underscores BDAG’s potential for a substantial increase—particularly after its launch. Analysts predict a possible $1 price in 2025, indicative of the strength of its technological and ecosystem development. As the ongoing presale’s batch 27 approaches completion, traders are encouraged to participate soon. BlockDAG’s EVM and WASM compatibility is attracting developers and purchasers alike, making BDAG a top crypto to consider. Analysts anticipate considerable returns for early participants as the project advances towards its $600 million funding target. Key Trends in Top Crypto Coins! Binance Coin (BNB) price forecast shows hopeful expectations, focusing on overcoming resistance levels to foster growth. In contrast, the Avalanche (AVAX) price prediction presents a balanced view, weighing promising network adoption against challenges like competition and regulatory uncertainties. BlockDAG emerges prominently with its community-driven approach, burgeoning ecosystem, and clear trajectory toward a $1 valuation. BlockDAG’s integration of EVM and WASM technologies solidifies its status as a project poised for remarkable growth, delivering functionality and scalability that meet market demands. These elements combine to offer a compelling opportunity for proactive crypto traders.

33767162,[object Object],1736474452,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Sees Social Sentiment Crash To New Lows, Why This Could be A Good Thing For Its Price",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-social-sentiment/,"Dogecoin, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies and the first meme coin, has experienced a crash in social sentiment and market cap in recent weeks. According to a new report by crypto analytics firm Santiment, the public’s attention on DOGE is dwindling, driven by its 26% drop in value since its price high one month ago. Despite this bearish trend, Santiment analysts believe that this decline in sentiment could be a good sign for Dogecoin’s future growth . Dogecoin Sentiment Hits New Low Dogecoin has struggled to reclaim past previous highs following its brief surge in November 2024. Interestingly, the meme coin also saw a slight uptick at the start of the year when Elon Musk temporarily changed his X social media profile name to ” Kekius Maximus ,” a new frog-themed meme coin. After Musk’s sudden name change, Dogecoin experienced a sharp price surge, but it was short-lived. The meme coin eventually erased 28% of its market capitalization while experiencing a dramatic decline in social media activity and general public interest. According to Santiment crypto analyst Brainq, Dogecoin’s crowd sentiment is at its lowest point over the past year. The analyst rates Dogecoin’s crowd sentiment at just 1 out of 5, signaling a lack of enthusiasm and engagement from investors and traders. Dogecoin’s social sentiment results also contrast significantly with the more optimistic ratings of other popular cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana (SOL) , which scored 4 out of 5. Fluctuations in social sentiment is not unusual for meme coins, which are primarily driven by market trends and social activity. Earlier in 2024, DOGE’s popularity across social media grew significantly following news of Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) proposal and Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential elections. At the time, the meme coin’s rising popularity had coincided with a sharp rise in its price, pushing it well above the $0.4 level. However, with social sentiment now at a notable low point , it seems likely that DOGE could face further price declines and increased volatility. Contrary to this outlook, Santiment suggests that Dogecoin’s social sentiment crash could serve as a springboard to a major price rebound . Why DOGE Sentiment Crash Might Signal An Opportunity While Dogecoin’s declining sentiment may seem like a bearish signal, Santiment argues it could present an opportunity for risk-tolerant investors. Brianq notes that low crowd sentiment often coincides with periods of undervaluation, potentially creating a chance to accumulate tokens before the price rebounds. The Santiment analyst predicts that if the broader crypto market trends upwards again, DOGE could experience a significant reversal, pushing its price away from bearish trends to the upside. Essentially, the analyst’s report suggests that the decline in Dogecoin’s social interest could be a classic case of ‘buy low, sell high’ for investors willing to take a calculated risk.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-10 02:00:52

Nevermined, a decentralized AI payment infrastructure provider, has secured $4 million in early investment to enhance AI-to-AI transaction capabilities. Generative Ventures led the funding round, which also included Polymorphic Capital, Halo Capital, and Arca. Today, we're thrilled to announce Nevermined's $4MM seed round led by @genventurecap along with @polymorphiccap , @halo__xyz , @arca , & more. https://t.co/HPLn55a5sp — Nevermined (@Nevermined_io) January 9, 2025 Self-proclaimed as the “PayPal for AI Commerce,” Nevermined aims to create a financial system designed for self-governing AI agents . AI agents are self-governing software programs created to carry out certain activities, frequently on behalf of humans or other systems. These agents use artificial intelligence to react dynamically to their surroundings by negotiating, making decisions, and acting on their own. They are being used more and more in industries including banking, healthcare, logistics, and e-commerce to manage processes, streamline operations, and complete transactions. You might also like: Crypto VC funding set to surge: PitchBook predicts $18b in venture capital for 2025 However, the shortcomings of human-centric payment systems have been made clear by the emergence of these agents. Because AI interactions are dynamic, high-frequency, and autonomous, current financial infrastructures are not prepared to handle them. To overcome these obstacles, Nevermined’s protocol allows AI agents to price, negotiate, and settle payments on their own. This invention opens the door to a time when billions of transactions powered by AI may happen without any human involvement. The company plans to use the new funding to develop features such as Multi-Agent Payments (MAP) and a dynamic pricing engine for AI services. These MAP tools are expected to enhance the platform’s ability to manage dynamic AI interactions, promoting a decentralized and open infrastructure for the emerging AI economy. The development of Nevermined’s protocol reflects the growing focus on creating infrastructures that facilitate autonomous economic transactions between AI agents . By combining AI and blockchain technologies, the initiative leverages blockchain’s transparency and trust mechanisms to address the unique requirements of AI-driven interactions. The funding round, led by Generative Ventures with contributions from other notable investors, highlights the increasing demand for scalable and efficient solutions in the evolving landscape of AI-driven commerce. As artificial intelligence continues to expand its capabilities, the need for payment systems tailored to autonomous agents is becoming more pronounced. Nevermined’s work represents a step toward building decentralized payment systems designed to accommodate AI agents operating independently.

This initiative comes amid increased government attention on digital assets, including the recent sale of $6.7 billion in Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road case by the U.S. Department of Justice. The move is seen as part of broader efforts to provide regulatory clarity for the rapidly growing cryptocurrency industry. According to a report shared by FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, Senator Cynthia Lummis has been tentatively selected to chair the subcommittee. Senate Banking Committee Pushes for Dedicated Crypto Subcommittee The new cryptocurrency subcommittee is similar to the one established in the House Financial Services Committee in 2023 by Patrick McHenry. The decision made by the Senate Banking Committee is in line with the efforts made by both parties to fill the gaps in the regulation of cryptocurrencies, which has been a concern within the digital asset industry. A Senate aide stated that a vote to formalize Senator Lummis as chair with new Republican and Democrat members will most probably take place next Thursday. This vote is to occur before another confirmation hearing for Scott Turner, the person chosen by President-elect Donald Trump for the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. NEW: The Senate Banking Committee, led by @SenatorTimScott , is set to establish its first ever subcommittee dedicated to #crypto . The subcommittee will mirror the @FinancialCmte version established by @PatrickMcHenry in 2023. A Senate aide confirmed that @SenLummis has been… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) January 9, 2025 Senator Lummis has been one of the biggest proponents of the growth of digital assets and blockchain technologies. Her leadership in the subcommittee may be able to help bring more attention to addressing industry issues, for example the uncertainty of regulation that has led some companies to shift operations overseas. Industry Seeks Clearer Regulations Amid Government Action Senator Lummis has been one of the biggest proponents of the growth of digital assets and blockchain technologies. Her leadership in the subcommittee may be able to help bring more attention to addressing industry issues, for example the uncertainty of regulation that has led some companies to shift operations overseas. The formation of the Senate’s crypto subcommittee is likely to make the process of enacting coherent and comprehensible legislation even easier. This follows other actions by the government in the crypto sphere such as the sale of Bitcoin that was seized from Silk Road. The DOJ’s auctioning off of $6.7 billion worth of Bitcoin not only represented a significant enforcement action, but also highlighted the government’s increasing presence within the asset class. As the change of government admin looms, the cryptocurrency industry is also putting pressure on the incoming President of the United States, Donald Trump, to support friendlier policies. Moreover, sources indicate that industry leaders have called for formation of a US Bitcoin reserve and executive orders to foster advancement of the blockchain technology. Expectations for Senator Lummis’s Leadership If approved as chair, Senator Cynthia Lummis will have a pivotal influence on setting up the new course for the U.S. cryptocurrency policies. Lummis has long been a proponent of digital assets, often campaigning for their acceptance into the US financial system. This comes amidst appointments by the Trump administration to replace important regulatory heads such as SEC Chair Gary Gensler with others that are more liberal in the cryptocurrency space. There has also been a suggestion of a new White House position called the “Crypto Czar” within the transition team’s plans. The creation of the Senate’s cryptocurrency subcommittee has been seen as a significant move to help combat the problems facing the sector. This is anticipated to help promote discussions between the government and businesses to support growth and coordination on regulations. The vote to set the final list of the members of the subcommittee will be held on Thursday.
