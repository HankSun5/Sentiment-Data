Bitcoin surged to a fresh record of $124,128 just last month. At the same time, the ecosystem continues to broaden, with strong investor enthusiasm carrying over into prominent altcoins and best meme coins . Over the past year, many tokens have achieved new peaks, showcasing the market’s renewed optimism. This resurgence has largely been fueled by two major policy developments out of Washington. First, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first major legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins. Second, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, a framework designed to modernize and clarify how securities laws intersect with digital assets. With improving sentiment, investors are eyeing leading altcoins like XRP, Pepe, and Dogecoin as some of the most attractive dip-buying plays ahead of the next potential bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payment Pioneer and 2025 Blue-Chip Candidate Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , hit a record high of $3.65 on July 18, the same day as the passage of the GENIUS Act. In doing so, it surpassed its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since pulled back to roughly $2.84, representing about a 22% decline from its recent high. XRP’s strength lies in its role as a low-cost, efficient solution for global money transfers, positioning it as a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. This reputation has been bolstered by backing from the UN Capital Development Fund and recognition from the U.S. Ripple’s policy influence was highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a White House crypto regulation roundtable earlier this year. Additionally, with the rollout of RLUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple has set its sights on capturing a meaningful share in the stablecoin market. Momentum accelerated after a pivotal 2023 court ruling declared XRP’s retail transactions were not securities, ending a lengthy battle with the SEC and marking a major victory for the industry. Over the past year, XRP has delivered a 383% gain, quintupling Bitcoin’s 76% growth. After July’s rally, the token established support near $3, though seasonal weakness in September saw it dip below that level. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 42 and may be continuing downward, further discounting the price. While rate cuts and the recent approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t trigger an immediate breakout, probably because markets had already priced it in, additional higher-profile spot ETF decisions expected in mid-October could push XRP above $4 within weeks. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme-Culture Favorite With Room to Run Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, quickly rose to the ranks of top meme tokens by market capitalization, inspired by Matt Furie’s famous frog character from his Boy’s Club webcomic. Its meteoric rise inspired countless imitators, though none replicated its success. With a market cap of around $4 billion, Pepe has attracted worldwide attention, even appearing as Elon Musk’s profile picture on X for a brief stint. Currently trading at about $0.000009433, PEPE is currently feeling the effects of a market-wide dip. The coin currently sits 66% below its record high of $0.00002803 from late 2024. However, historically, October tends to be bullish for crypto, and if the “Uptober” trend holds, Pepe could claim new highs as early as November. At present, its RSI is 38 and trending downward, suggesting that further near-term declines may create additional dip-buying opportunities. Supporters argue that a stronger macro backdrop, combined with growing investor optimism, could help propel PEPE to fresh highs later this year. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Is the Original Meme Coin Ready for $1? Initially created in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since transformed into the most recognized meme coin, supported by a loyal fan base and a market capitalization of $35.4 billion. The coin gained mainstream attention in 2021 thanks to backing from celebrities like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. This past May, renewed institutional activity pushed DOGE back above $0.25 amid speculation of a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF. It now trades around $0.2334, down about 3% alongside a broader correction across all crypto that has hit the meme coin sector a little harder. Meme coins collectively fell 2% to a combined $75.1 billion market cap. Zooming out, the wider $4 trillion crypto market slipped 1.5% today, signalling a general pullback. For long-term holders, this could represent an ideal entry point to stack DOGE. Technically, DOGE’s RSI stands at 44, indicating more potential downside as the selloff continues going into the weekend. However, a rebound later by Monday ahead of “Uptober” could pave the way for meaningful gains, since October has historically been a bullish month for crypto. With increasing adoption, Tesla accepting DOGE for certain purchases and platforms like PayPal and Revolut expanding support, the coin’s real-world utility continues to grow. If positive momentum continues, DOGE could approach the $0.50 level by mid-October, with the coveted $1 target remaining in sight. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Layer 2 Presale Targeting 2025 Growth Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of 2025’s most notable presales, aiming to become the first Bitcoin Layer 2 project that merges viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. The initiative seeks to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster transactions, expanded smart contract functionality, and community-driven governance. So far, the presale has attracted approximately $18.1 million, with analysts projecting potential post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER enables fast, low-cost smart contracts. A key feature is its Canonical Bridge, which allows near-instant Bitcoin transfers while also supporting dApps, meme tokens, and payment solutions. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. The $HYPER token has multiple utilities within the ecosystem, including staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early buyers can secure staking rewards up to 65% APY and gain voting privileges once the platform is live.

52263636,https://cryptonews.com/?p=428300,1758839400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52263636.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Shiba Inu and Solana by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/googles-gemini-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-shiba-inu-and-solana-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Google’s in-house ChatGPT rival Gemini AI paints a bullish outlook for the crypto market, suggesting that XRP, Shiba Inu, and Solana could emerge as the biggest gainers if digital assets move into a strong upward trend heading into the final quarter. Bitcoin recently smashed past its previous record, hitting $124,128 last month before easing back slightly after an unexpected rise in July inflation numbers. A week ago, the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% rate cut, briefly boosting risk assets. However, Trump’s surprise proposal of a one-off $100,000 H-1B visa application fee rattled investors, sparking heavy liquidations across crypto markets over the weekend. On the policy front, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act earlier this summer, the first U.S. law to regulate stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold full reserves. Meanwhile, the SEC launched Project Crypto, a major initiative to modernize how securities rules apply to blockchain assets. Together, these catalysts could set the stage for the next explosive altcoin cycle. If Gemini AI’s projections hold true, XRP, Shiba Inu, and Solana could be among the biggest winners in the months ahead. XRP (Ripple): Gemini AI Forecasts $20—A 7× Upside Gemini AI projects Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could surge to $20 by late 2025, around seven times higher than its current trading price of around $2.83. The token has already had a strong year, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40 and climbing to $3.65 on July 18 before retracing about 22%. Ripple’s international reach is growing, underscored by the UN Capital Development Fund’s recognition in 2024 of XRP as a practical solution for cross-border payments in developing regions. Earlier this year, Ripple finally put its long-standing battle with the SEC behind it, as the regulator dropped its case. This reinforced the landmark 2023 court decision that XRP’s retail sales are not securities, a precedent that resonates in victory across the altcoin sector. According to Gemini AI, XRP’s likely New Year trading zone sits between $5 and $10, with more optimistic scenarios targeting $20, particularly if the Trump administration implements long-promised crypto legislation. Additionally, the SEC is likely to approve a raft of high-profile spot XRP ETFs in mid-October, which could add substantial inflows. Technical indicators support optimism: XRP’s RSI recently dipped to 42, signaling undervaluation and the possibility of a rebound rally. Multiple bullish flag patterns across the chart this year may also hint at a breakout. Positive sentiment could drive XRP back to $4 by October. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 383%, hurtling past Bitcoin’s 76% and Ethereum’s 51% gains over the same period. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Gemini AI Predicts Up to 8.5× Growth in a Bull Market Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become Dogecoin’s fiercest competitor, boasting a market cap of around $7 billion. Currently trading near $0.00001176 after a 4% dip in the past 24 hours, SHIB has corrected a little harder than the rest of the meme coin market, which collectively lost 2.2% overnight to post a capitalization of $75.1 billion. On the technical front, SHIB has already broken out of both a falling wedge and a bull flag this year. A move above $0.000025 by November could validate Gemini AI’s target range of $0.00005–$0.00008 by year-end. In the event of a major bull run, the model suggests SHIB could rocket as high as $0.0001, a tidy potential 8.5× gain from current prices. Its RSI sits at 37 following recent corrections. This serves both as a signal that the token is discounted and it potentially sets up a rapid bounce if traders capitalize on the dip when the correction ends. Shiba Inu has also expanded beyond its meme coin roots, powering Shibarium, a dedicated Layer-2 blockchain that supports fast, low-cost transactions, decentralized apps, and added privacy, distinguishing it from rival meme projects. Solana (SOL): Gemini AI Sees ETF Buzz and Ecosystem Strength Driving a Push to $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has cemented itself as a top smart contract network with a market cap of over $108.4 billion and total value locked (TVL) at around $11 billion across its ecosystem. Developer activity and institutional adoption continue to grow. Speculation is mounting that a U.S. spot Solana ETF could be on the horizon, which may trigger similar inflows to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding to the intrigue, Trump has even floated the idea of including Solana in a potential U.S. national Bitcoin reserve. Under his plan, however, the government would only obtain SOL through asset seizures, not direct purchases. Price-wise, Solana hit $250 in January, dropped to $100 in April, and rebounded to $198 last week, nearly retesting this year’s high. Having recently broken out of a descending wedge, Gemini AI projects Solana could climb as high as $1,000 by year-end, more than tripling its all-time high of $293.31. That said, regulatory clarity and ETF approvals will be crucial to achieving this milestone. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Speculative Alternative to Dogecoin For those exploring riskier meme coin plays outside Gemini AI’s top picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as Dogecoin’s more volatile cousin. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap token often moving with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Maxi Doge embraces high-risk speculation, bolstered by edgy branding and a grassroots community. Its presale has already raised $2.5 million within its first month. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI cultivates community engagement through Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and cross-project collaborations. Out of its 150.24 billion token supply, 25% is allocated to the Maxi Fund for marketing and partnerships. Staking is live with eye-catching rewards of 133% APY, though yields will gradually decline as participation rises. Currently selling for $0.000259, although the price rises in scheduled nominal increments as the presale progresses through the funding rounds. Interested investors can join via wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The application was submitted today. The goal is to launch a fund that pays investors income using premiums tied to Bitcoin. This isn’t the same kind of product as their earlier spot Bitcoin ETF. It’s built to hand out actual income, not track the price of Bitcoin. This filing follows the success of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , known as IBIT, which reached $90 billion in assets by September, and now controls 60% of the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market. Both BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have achieved over $260 million in annual revenue within two years. BlackRock shifts focus to Bitcoin income generation The new fund is built for yield-focused investors; people who want income, not just exposure to Bitcoin’s price. That’s different from IBIT , which only follows Bitcoin’s price movements. This premium income ETF will likely use Bitcoin-linked strategies to generate steady payouts. A BlackRock statement said, “Investors are looking for ways to benefit from Bitcoin while minimizing price volatility.” The company has already raked in serious cash from its crypto lineup. Its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs pulled in $260 million in yearly revenue, and that was in under two years. And BlackRock didn’t stop at launching ETFs. It’s been adding crypto to its model portfolios too. They’re now allocating 1% to 2% of those portfolios to Bitcoin, giving regular investors small but steady exposure to digital assets. The new income-focused ETF also targets a different type of investor than their previous products, and instead of tracking value, this ETF will focus on generating returns from Bitcoin premiums, which could come from covered call strategies or similar income-producing methods. BlackRock’s statement continued, “There’s a growing class of investors who want to access Bitcoin’s potential without being exposed to its full volatility.” The firm said this new fund was made to meet that demand directly.

These three coins have all taken significant hits, although some alts—such as Solana, Dogecoin, and Avalanche—have seen 24-hour losses rising above 4% today. This may be disappointing news for anyone who expected last week’s (priced-in) rate cut to result in a bull rally, yet overselling increases the odds of a vigorous comeback. And this is what we’re seeing with XRP, Cardano and Litecoin, which we’ll analyse in this article. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Approvals Will Push Alt to New Record Highs XRP has dropped back down to $2.82 today, making for a 1.5% loss in 24 hours and a 9.5% decline in a week. But while the altcoin is also down by 3% in a month, it retains a very healthy 380% increase in the past year, making it one of the best-performing top-100 coins over this timeframe. There are two main things to point out when it comes to its crypto price prediction, with the first being that the SEC is very likely to approve several XRP ETFs in the next few weeks. And once these gain the green light, XRP could witness an influx in institutional demand, pushing its price ever higher. Secondly, its indicators show that it’s in a decidedly oversold position, and given its rock-solid fundamentals, this should result in a rebound very soon. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have both fallen into negative positions over the past few days, meaning that XRP is selling below a ‘fair’ average price. In turn, this means it could recover very soon, potentially reaching $3 by the middle of October, before ETF approvals send it towards $5 for the end-of-year rally. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA)—Oversold Alt About to Receive Big Push from Grayscale ETF ADA has been one of the bigger losers today, having fallen by 4.5% in 24 hours, to $0.7844. This also represents a 14% loss in a week and a 7% decline in 30 days, although the alt remains up by 100% in a year. And as with XRP, ADA is also waiting on the SEC to approve ETF applications, although it has only one outstanding application to wait for, from Grayscale. Even though it’s less popular among ETF providers, the approval of Grayscale’s ETF could be a massive boost for ADA. Such approvals may arrive just at a time when ADA’s indicators bottom out, meaning that the coin could experience a big price swing upwards. Source: TradingView Its RSI is on its way down to 30 or even lower, so soon ADA will be trading at a discount that investors may be unable to resist. Whales have already been stocking up on the coin, with data showing that one big investor bought $56.8 million in ADA on Coinbase this week. Given such interest in Cardano, which is one of the biggest layer-one networks in crypto , its price is likely to experience a sharp recovery soon. It could reach $1 again by the end of October, while it has the potential to pass $2 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Litecoin ($LTC)—Altcoin Preparing for Big Push Towards $1,000 Today has also been difficult for Litecoin, which at $103.45 is down by 3.5% in 24 hours and by 10% in a week. However, the same theme applies to LTC as it does to the coins above, in that its oversold price is about to combine with several ETF approvals. In fact, Litecoin is the likeliest altcoin to gain SEC approval, given its forking from Bitcoin. Canary, CoinShares and Grayscale are all waiting on decisions from the SEC, with Bloomberg analysts giving their applications a 95% chance of approval each. Source: TradingView We could therefore see the Litecoin price rise strongly, with its chart today showing that a bullish pennant has been forming since mid-July. Even more so than the two coins above, its RSI and MACD indicators are very close to bottoms, so we may not be that far from a rebound. Assuming SEC approval of the three coins above, it could reach $150 by the middle of October, before entering the New Year at above $500. PEPENODE Raises $1.4 Million in Presale: Could Mine-to-Earn Coin Be Next to 100x? The market is shaping up nicely for a end-of-year bull rally, so traders may want to diversify into newer tokens, in order to widen their exposure to the biggest possible gains. One way of doing this is to allocate some holdings to presale tokens, which can often surge when they list for the first time. Possibly the most interesting presale coin at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that’s introducing some very novel mine-to-earn functionality. PEPENODE has now raised over $1.4 million in its ICO, which it opened only a few weeks ago, with this figure providing an early warning of its future potential. The PEPENODE presale is live.

XRP / USD 1-day chart, triple bottom fuels bull flag breakout. Source: TradingView. Still, momentum indicators are not decidedly bullish, a sentiment echoed by analysts who call for sustained buy pressure for the triple bottom to be realised. The RSI is stabilizing in the 40s, showing sellers still hold some sway even as buying interest builds. The MACD histogram shows a similar trend shift, flattening into what could be an early golden cross above the signal line, which would confirm a bullish shift. If the flag pattern plays out, XRP could eye a breakout towards $5, an 80% gain from current levels, and a push towards all-time highs into new price discovery. With further U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approvals stacking as catalysts for demand running into Q4, the rally could even extend as far as $10, marking a 260% gain . However, this bullish case heavily relies on the $2.70 level holding as support.

Bitcoin mining giant TeraWulf is making headlines as it pursues a massive TeraWulf financing deal worth an astonishing $3 billion. This ambitious endeavor aims to fuel a substantial expansion of its data centers, signaling a strong belief in the future of digital assets. What’s Behind This Monumental TeraWulf Financing Push? According to reports from Bloomberg, TeraWulf is actively seeking this substantial capital injection. The core purpose is clear: to significantly boost its data center capacity. More data centers mean more power for Bitcoin mining, which is crucial for the company’s growth strategy. What makes this particular TeraWulf financing effort stand out is the reported involvement of tech behemoth Google. The search giant is said to be providing a guarantee for the funds, adding a layer of credibility and stability to the deal. Leading the charge on the financial side is Morgan Stanley, a global leader in investment banking. Key Players: TeraWulf (the mining firm), Google (guarantee provider), Morgan Stanley (lead financier). Goal: Expand data centers to enhance Bitcoin mining operations. Scale: A staggering $3 billion in capital. Why is Data Center Expansion So Crucial for Bitcoin Mining? For a Bitcoin mining company like TeraWulf, data centers are the lifeblood of their operations. These facilities house thousands of specialized computers, known as ASICs, that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Successfully solving a puzzle allows the miner to add a new block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and earn new bitcoins as a reward. Expanding data centers means: Increased Hash Rate: More machines translate to a higher hash rate, improving the company’s chances of mining Bitcoin.

Imagine an investment vehicle that not only offers exposure to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies but also champions environmental responsibility. This is precisely what 7RCC is proposing with its innovative application for a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF . This groundbreaking filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aims to combine spot Bitcoin with carbon credits, as reported by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. This move, submitted under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, marks a significant moment for both digital assets and sustainable investing. What Exactly is the Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF? At its core, the proposed Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF seeks to blend two distinct asset classes: spot Bitcoin and carbon credits. Spot Bitcoin refers to directly holding the cryptocurrency itself, rather than derivatives. Carbon credits, on the other hand, are measurable, verifiable permits that allow the owner to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. These credits are typically generated by projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere. 7RCC’s vision is to create a single investment product that gives investors exposure to both. This unique combination could offer a fresh approach to diversification, appealing to a broader range of investors interested in both growth potential and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. It’s a bold step that could redefine what a traditional ETF can encompass, especially in the rapidly expanding digital asset space. Why Combine Bitcoin and Carbon Credits in an ETF? The decision to pair Bitcoin with carbon credits might seem unconventional at first glance, but it addresses several key market trends and investor demands. For years, Bitcoin has faced criticism regarding its energy consumption and environmental footprint. By integrating carbon credits, the Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF could offer a mechanism to offset some of these concerns, presenting a “greener” way to invest in Bitcoin. Moreover, this innovative structure offers a dual benefit: Environmental Responsibility: The inclusion of carbon credits directly supports projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with growing global efforts towards sustainability. Diversification and Growth: Investors gain exposure to Bitcoin’s potential for significant returns while also participating in the burgeoning carbon credit market, which is vital for combating climate change. This approach could potentially attract institutional investors who are increasingly mandated to consider ESG factors in their portfolios. It’s an attempt to bridge the gap between traditional finance, digital assets, and environmental stewardship, all within a regulated framework. Navigating the Challenges of a Hybrid Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF While the concept of a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF is exciting, its path to approval and market acceptance comes with inherent challenges. The U.S. SEC has historically been cautious about approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, though recent approvals signal a shift. However, adding carbon credits introduces another layer of complexity. The regulatory landscape for carbon markets is still evolving, and integrating it with a digital asset like Bitcoin requires careful consideration. Key challenges include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously evaluate the fund’s structure, custody arrangements for both Bitcoin and carbon credits, and valuation methodologies. Market Volatility: Both Bitcoin and carbon credit markets can experience significant price fluctuations, which could impact the ETF’s performance. Operational Complexity: Managing two distinct and often volatile asset classes within a single fund requires robust operational frameworks and expertise. Despite these hurdles, 7RCC’s filing represents a proactive step towards addressing environmental concerns often associated with cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for more sustainable crypto investment products. What Does This Revolutionary ETF Mean for Investors? For investors, the potential approval of a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF could open up new avenues for portfolio diversification and values-aligned investing. It provides a simplified way to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and the environmental commodities market without the complexities of direct ownership. This could be particularly appealing to those who have been hesitant about Bitcoin due to its environmental impact, offering a more palatable entry point. Should this ETF come to fruition, it could: Enhance Accessibility: Make investing in Bitcoin and carbon credits easier for retail and institutional investors through traditional brokerage accounts. Promote Sustainable Investing: Encourage more capital flow into environmental projects by increasing demand for carbon credits. Set a Precedent: Potentially inspire other asset managers to develop hybrid funds that blend digital assets with other socially responsible investments. The journey to approval will be closely watched, as its success could significantly influence the future of sustainable investing in the digital asset space. The filing by 7RCC for a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF is undoubtedly a pioneering move, pushing the boundaries of what an exchange-traded fund can achieve. By proposing to combine the innovation of spot Bitcoin with the environmental commitment of carbon credits, 7RCC is attempting to create a unique investment vehicle that addresses both financial growth and ecological responsibility. While regulatory hurdles and market complexities remain, this initiative highlights a growing trend towards integrating sustainability into the core of digital finance. It’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of investment products designed to meet the diverse and increasingly conscientious demands of today’s investors.

A significant development has emerged that could reshape how investment firms operate in the digital asset space: US regulators are now actively probing potential crypto insider trading . What Sparked the Current Scrutiny into Crypto Insider Trading ? Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have launched an investigation into potential crypto insider trading . This isn’t just a casual inquiry; it’s a serious look into the trading activities of companies that have adopted cryptocurrency treasury strategies. Authorities sent letters to approximately 200 companies. Concerns were raised over unusual surges in trading volume and stock prices. These surges often occurred immediately before public disclosures about crypto strategies. The letters also highlighted possible violations of fair disclosure rules, which aim to prevent selective sharing of material non-public information. Industry observers view this move as a clear signal: a full-scale regulatory probe into crypto insider trading is likely underway, marking a critical moment for market integrity. Understanding Insider Trading in the Crypto Context Insider trading, in essence, involves using material, non-public information to make trades for personal gain. While traditionally associated with conventional stocks, its application to the crypto market, especially concerning company treasury strategies, presents new challenges. When a company announces it has added cryptocurrency to its balance sheet, it often impacts its stock price. If individuals with advance knowledge of such an announcement trade the company’s stock before the public disclosure, they could be engaging in insider trading. This practice undermines market fairness and investor confidence. The regulators’ focus on firms with ‘crypto treasury strategies’ means they are looking at how companies manage their digital asset holdings and how information about these holdings is handled before it becomes public knowledge. How Regulators Are Tackling Potential Violations The SEC and FINRA’s approach is methodical. By sending letters and requesting information, they are gathering data to identify patterns that suggest illicit activities. This proactive stance is crucial for maintaining transparency and trust in both traditional and emerging markets. Fair disclosure rules, such as Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) in the US, mandate that companies disseminate material non-public information broadly and simultaneously to all investors. This prevents select individuals from gaining an unfair advantage. Violating these rules can lead to significant penalties, including fines and legal action. Moreover, this investigation highlights the increasing convergence of traditional financial regulations with the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. As more mainstream companies embrace digital assets, the need for robust oversight against activities like crypto insider trading becomes paramount. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market and Investment Firms? This probe carries significant implications. For investment firms, it underscores the urgent need for stringent internal controls and clear communication policies regarding their crypto holdings and strategies. Compliance departments will need to be extra vigilant. For the broader crypto market, this regulatory action could be a double-edged sword. While it might initially create uncertainty, in the long run, it could foster greater investor confidence by signaling that authorities are serious about combating market manipulation. A transparent and fair market is essential for sustained growth and institutional adoption. Increased Scrutiny: Expect more regulatory attention on crypto-related announcements and trading patterns. Enhanced Compliance: Firms must review and strengthen their internal policies to prevent crypto insider trading . Investor Confidence: Stronger enforcement can lead to a more trusted market environment. Regulatory Clarity: This probe may pave the way for clearer guidelines on digital asset disclosures. Actionable Insights for Firms and Investors In this evolving landscape, vigilance is key. For firms with crypto treasury strategies, it’s vital to: Ensure strict adherence to fair disclosure rules. Implement robust internal trading policies. Educate employees on what constitutes material non-public information. Conduct regular audits of trading activities preceding major announcements. For investors, understanding these regulatory developments can help in making more informed decisions. It reinforces the importance of researching a company’s compliance practices and being aware of the broader regulatory environment. A Critical Juncture for Crypto Integrity The ongoing probe into crypto insider trading marks a critical juncture for the digital asset space. It signals a maturing market where traditional financial regulations are increasingly being applied to new technologies. While the full extent of this investigation is yet to unfold, its message is clear: transparency, fairness, and compliance are non-negotiable. As the crypto ecosystem continues to grow, such regulatory actions are essential steps toward building a more robust and trustworthy financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is crypto insider trading ? Crypto insider trading refers to the illegal practice of trading a company’s stock or related assets based on material, non-public information about its cryptocurrency treasury strategies or other crypto-related developments. This information is typically obtained through privileged access and gives an unfair advantage. Q2: Which regulatory bodies are involved in this probe? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) are the primary bodies conducting this investigation. Q3: Why are companies with ‘crypto treasury strategies’ being targeted? These companies are being targeted because their announcements of adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies have often been preceded by suspicious surges in their stock prices. This pattern suggests that non-public information might have been used for illicit trading. Q4: What are ‘fair disclosure rules’ and why are they important? Fair disclosure rules, like the SEC’s Regulation FD, require companies to disseminate material non-public information broadly and simultaneously to all investors. They are crucial for preventing selective disclosure and ensuring that all market participants have equal access to information, thus promoting a fair and level playing field. Q5: What are the potential consequences for firms found guilty of insider trading? Firms and individuals found guilty of insider trading can face severe penalties, including substantial fines, disgorgement of illicit gains, civil lawsuits, and even criminal charges, leading to imprisonment.

The overlapping signals, he argues, identify a well-defined take-profit band for XRP between roughly $8.43 and $13.58. “Four charts to rule them all,” he wrote, adding that the market is “clearly positioning itself for higher prices.” Four Charts Signal XRP $8.43–$13.58 Peak On the XRP/USD monthly chart, Bobby plots a multi-month consolidation which is built above “Base Camp 1” and, more recently, above “Base Camp 2.” The structure sits on top of a series of higher lows marked on the chart, with the consolidation developing after price reclaimed long-term moving-average clusters and the upper Bollinger band expanded. The Fibonacci extension grid anchored to the prior cycle shows 1.618 at approximately $5.26, 2.618 at about $8.43, 3.618 near $11.66, and 4.236 at roughly $13.58. Bobby labels the $8.43–$13.58 span as the “Take Profit Zone,” aligning it with the 2.618–4.236 extensions that capped previous euphoric runs on the same timeframe. Beneath the candles, the monthly momentum suite is turning higher: the RSI sits in a positive regime “preparing to initiate one final move toward overbought territory,” while stochastic and MACD lines have curled up from mid-range, consistent with trend continuation rather than exhaustion. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming As Axelar And Flare Target 8 Billion Tokens That price-based roadmap is cross-checked against XRP’s total market capitalization on the weekly timeframe. Here, Bobby highlights “price acceptance above the 2018 peak surrounded by skepticism and uncertainty” and annotates “over 300 days consolidating above 2018 highs.” The Fibonacci projection on market cap places the 1.618 extension near ~$210.7 billion, with a boxed “Take Profit Zone” parked just below the ultimate extension band and an overhead dashed guide around ~$13.00 that visually rhymes with the 4.236 price extension on the USD chart. The message of this pane is less about day-to-day candles and more about location: a lengthy basing and re-accumulation phase above a historic ceiling, which converts that ceiling into support and sets up measured-move targets. Macro risk appetite is addressed in the third panel via the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) on the monthly chart. “IWM 1M is firing on all cylinders, and new ATHs are inbound regardless of any short-term noise,” Bobby writes. The chart shows a strong bullish candle reclaiming the 0.786–0.886 retracement area and pressing back into the prior range top around $244–$252. Upside Fibonacci targets are mapped at 1.272 ~$267.1, 1.414 ~$278.9, and 1.618 ~$296.8. The RSI, stochastic oscillator, and MACD on this timeframe are all pointed higher, with Bobby calling the breakout candle “very telling,” the kind of multi-indicator alignment he says “occurs only a few times per decade.” The implication is that a risk-on tone in US small-caps historically pairs well with liquidity rotating into higher-beta crypto segments. Related Reading: Analyst Highlights 2 Scenarios That Sends XRP Price To $9.6 And $33 The final piece is Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) on the weekly chart. Bobby’s retracement panel measures the advance from ~38.9% to ~66.1% share and now shows BTC.D slipping beneath the 23.6% line (~59.7%) and hovering near the 38.2% (~55.5%). Notably, the BTC.D slipped below an ascending channel. Based on that, he draws a downward arrow toward the 50% level (~52.3%) and then into the 61.8% retracement (~49.1%), with a target rectangle in the mid-to-low-40s bracketed by the 78.6% (~45.9%) and 88.6% (~43.2%) levels. “BTC.D will inevitably initiate a move toward the mid to low 40% zone,” he writes. A decline in dominance of that magnitude typically coincides with capital rotating from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins—precisely the regime in which XRP has historically captured outsized relative performance. At press time, XRP traded at $2.84.

In it, they openly admit that developers made mistakes in the way the bridge was set up and managed. They also acknowledge that they initially didn’t make decentralization a priority. Now, they claim that addressing this issue and improving security are their primary objectives. Shibarium Bridge Security Update: Shiba Inu Devs Accept Responsibility In the latest update , Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya explains that the project’s leadership holds full responsibility for validator key management. She also admits that the team did not prioritize decentralization during the early stages of the bridge, a choice the developers now call a mistake and are working to correct immediately. The team is actively reinforcing Shibarium’s bridge controls and custody policies to prevent similar issues from occurring again. The compromised validators included internal ones, and while a full forensic review is still underway, the possible attack paths include a cloud breach, a compromised developer device, or a supply-chain weakness. The update revealed validator signing keys were in AWS Key Management Service, with limited use on developer machines for administrative tasks. It also provides operational context, noting that each validator held approximately 10,000 BONE in self-delegation, and the team never utilized the rewards from these validators. To increase transparency, the Shibarium bridge security update includes a detailed FAQ section that directly addresses the validator compromise. It clarifies that all answers reflect the team’s current understanding and may evolve as forensic analysis and third-party reviews continue. By sharing these details openly, the Shiba Inu developers are showing that they are not avoiding the Shibarium bridge issue but instead are confronting it directly. Roadmap Forward: Stronger Decentralization And Security With the security review underway, the Shiba Inu developers are now focusing on how to strengthen Shibarium for the long term. In the update, Kaal Dhairya said decentralization will no longer be an afterthought. The network, which had leaned too much on internal validators, will now open up to professional operators and trusted applicants. Dhairya explained that developer recruitment now includes government ID checks and verification through a recognized HR platform, steps that guarantee only trusted individuals can handle sensitive parts of the network. At the end of the update, they made their priorities clear – to protect users, secure the network, contain the attacker, and bring services back online safely. They note that decentralization has always been at the core of Shibarium’s roadmap. Still, early validator applicants refused to complete KYC, and outreach to professional operators failed to progress, which delayed the process. That setback forced the Shiba Inu team to rely on internal validators, a choice they now regret and commit to correcting by expanding validator decentralization , introducing stricter key-rotation rules, and improving custody solutions.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium network|Shibarium news|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 23:00:28

The meme coin faces a decisive moment that could spark a deeper correction or mark a buy-the-dip opportunity. Whales appear to be betting on the latter. Over the past week, the top 100 BONK wallets have deepened their holdings by 3.80 trillion tokens, according to Nansen data . Top 100 Bonk wallets accumulate alongside price decline. Source: Nansen. This show of conviction comes as market narratives continue to favor a Q4 bull run. Rex-Osprey, the issuer behind the first Dogecoin spot ETF, may have a clear shot at a first Bonk spot ETF under new SEC generic listing standards to fast-track crypto ETP approvals. And with U.S. inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for further interest rate cuts are strengthening, fuelling risk-on sentiment and capital rotation into more speculative plays like Bonk.

The current retest of psychological support at $0.000019 marks the final barrier to a breakdown of Bonk’s 6-month support trendline and a wider ascending broadening wedge pattern. BONK / USDT 12-hour chart, ascending broadening wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators lean toward a bounce. The RSI is approaching the oversold threshold at 30, a level that often marks local bottoms as sellers reach exhaustion. The MACD histogram shows a similar shift, reversing toward the signal line in what could be the early stages of a golden cross, signaling a potential new uptrend. If the wedge’s lower boundary holds as a launchpad, the next upward move could target a retest of its upper resistance. That would put the $0.0001 level back in focus, a potential 425% gain from current levels . Still, resistance levels like the $0.00004075 July high and Bonk’s $0.000062 all-time high stand as critical hurdles. To flip them to support, fresh demand catalysts such as U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approvals will likely be necessary to sustain the rally into 2026. History Says This Bull Run Could Deliver Bonk’s Successor – the Market Has Already Spoken With this breakout setup, Bonk continues to demonstrate a trend: the strongest social momentum lies with Doge-branded tokens. It all started with Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. Every bull run eventually delivers its own parabolic Doge-themed runner. Now, early momentum is pointing to Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the next in line. Maxi Doge blends a no-utility ethos with gym-culture satire and trader degeneracy, positioning itself as more than just a meme coin—it’s a lifestyle asset. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has already pulled in close to $2.5 million in its initial weeks, with early backers locking in a massive 134% APY through staking rewards. You can take part in the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale now on the official website . With exchange listings coming soon, now could be the best opportunity to get involved early.

This aggressive move suggests the company believes the market is undervaluing its position – and that sentiment could extend to DOGE, especially as institutional exposure to mining grows.

The firm recently acquired DogeHash Technologies, a Dogecoin miner that will own 3,500 rigs by the end of the year. In addition, Thumzup owns 19 Bitcoin (BTC) tokens and 7.5 million DOGE worth approximately $1.7 million. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Market Retests Key Trend Line Support Today’s price action has pushed DOGE to retest a key trend line support that could be decisive in determining the asset’s trajectory in the next few days. This key demand zone aligns with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), making it a critical area for buyers to defend. A strong bounce here could ignite a move toward $0.29, while a breakout above the rising wedge formation shown in the chart would confirm a bullish Dogecoin price prediction – with $0.40 as the first major target, and a potential run to $1 if momentum accelerates. Institutional backing from firms like Thumzup, combined with the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, are adding fuel to the fire, setting the stage for DOGE to shine this cycle. Meanwhile, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could deliver even greater upside. With nearly $2.5 million raised so far, this project is building serious traction and could be the next breakout star. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Presale Unleashes Leverage-Powered Meme Trading Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin that draws inspiration from the popular Doge meme. Maxi Doge taps into a familiar cultural reference that already resonates with the crypto community. The presale has seen early traction, surpassing $2.4 million just a few weeks after its launch . What sets $MAXI apart is its focus on leveraged trading and capturing the market’s hype. Through the Maxi Fund, the project will devote up to 25% of the proceeds raised via the presale to make leveraged bets on the most promising tokens of the cycle. Partnerships with several crypto news aggregators will increase the token’s visibility, and buyers will reap the highest returns once it is listed on exchanges. To buy $MAXI, simply head to the Maxi Doge website and link a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap crypto for this meme coin or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

One of the most pressing issues gaining attention is crypto conflicts of interest . Recently, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced a pivotal move to address these very concerns, aiming to establish clear regulatory standards. This initiative comes amid heightened scrutiny, particularly concerning the cryptocurrency dealings of influential figures and their families. The goal is simple yet crucial: to safeguard market integrity and protect investors from potential abuses arising from undisclosed or unmanaged interests. What Exactly Are Crypto Conflicts of Interest ? At its core, a conflict of interest arises when an individual or entity has competing professional or personal interests. In the crypto space, this could mean: An exchange owner also trading on their own platform with insider knowledge. A project founder promoting their token while holding a significant, undisclosed stake. Regulators or policymakers having financial ties to crypto businesses they oversee. These situations can create an unfair advantage, erode trust, and potentially lead to market manipulation. Chairman Atkins, speaking at Georgetown University’s Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy conference, emphasized the SEC’s commitment. He stated that the agency will “root out” any such situations uncovered and “set clear standards.” Why Is Addressing These Conflicts So Crucial Now? The digital asset market has matured rapidly, attracting significant investment and mainstream attention. However, this growth also amplifies the risks associated with unchecked conflicts. When key players operate without transparent guidelines, it undermines the very principles of fair and open markets. Consider the potential impact: Investor Protection: Unscrupulous practices can lead to significant financial losses for everyday investors. Market Integrity: Undisclosed interests can distort market prices and create an uneven playing field. Public Trust: A lack of clear rules erodes confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, potentially hindering its long-term adoption and growth. The SEC’s proactive stance on crypto conflicts of interest is a direct response to these growing concerns, signaling a move towards greater accountability. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Regulating Crypto Conflicts of Interest ? Regulating the crypto space is notoriously complex due to its global, decentralized, and often pseudonymous nature. Establishing clear rules for conflicts of interest presents unique hurdles: Jurisdictional Issues: Crypto businesses often operate across borders, making it challenging to apply a single set of rules. Anonymity/Pseudonymity: Identifying beneficial owners and their diverse interests can be difficult. Rapid Innovation: New crypto products and services emerge constantly, often outpacing regulatory frameworks. Despite these challenges, the SEC’s intent is to create adaptable and robust standards. The goal is not to stifle innovation but to foster a healthier, more transparent environment where participants can operate with confidence. What Will New Standards for Crypto Conflicts of Interest Look Like? While the specifics are yet to be detailed, we can anticipate new standards focusing on transparency and disclosure. This might involve: Mandatory disclosure requirements for crypto project founders, exchange operators, and key influencers regarding their holdings and related business interests. Stricter ethical guidelines for individuals involved in crypto regulation and policy-making. Enhanced enforcement mechanisms to penalize non-compliance and deter future conflicts. These measures aim to create a level playing field, ensuring that all participants, from large institutions to individual investors, can engage in the crypto market with greater assurance. A Path Towards Greater Transparency The SEC’s commitment to addressing crypto conflicts of interest marks a significant step towards a more mature and trustworthy digital asset landscape. By setting clear standards, the agency aims to mitigate risks, enhance investor protection, and foster sustainable growth within the crypto ecosystem. This move is not just about enforcement; it’s about building a foundation of trust. As the crypto market continues to evolve, transparent and fair practices will be paramount for its long-term success. All stakeholders, from innovators to investors, stand to benefit from a clearer, more equitable regulatory environment.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a conflict of interest in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: A conflict of interest in crypto occurs when an individual or entity has competing interests—personal or professional—that could improperly influence their actions or decisions in the digital asset market, potentially for personal gain and at the expense of others. Q2: Why is the SEC addressing crypto conflicts of interest now? A2: The SEC is addressing these conflicts due to the rapid growth of the crypto market, increased investor participation, and growing controversies surrounding undisclosed interests of prominent figures. The aim is to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Q3: Who is Paul Atkins, and what is his role in this initiative? A3: Paul Atkins is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has announced the agency’s intention to establish clear regulatory standards to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest within the cryptocurrency sector. Q4: How might new regulations on crypto conflicts of interest benefit investors? A4: New regulations are expected to benefit investors by increasing transparency, reducing the potential for market manipulation, and ensuring a fairer playing field. This fosters greater trust and reduces the risks associated with undisclosed or unethical practices. Q5: Will these new rules stifle innovation in the crypto space? A5: The SEC’s stated goal is not to stifle innovation but to create a more secure and transparent environment. By setting clear boundaries, the rules aim to build a foundation of trust that can support sustainable and responsible innovation in the long term. Did you find this article insightful?

So I cried when I heard the court ruling.” Hunminjeongeum was Hwang’s own one-person entertainment agency, a company she owned in its entirety. The court heard that was found that Hwang Jung-eum invested most of the money she embezzled in cryptoassets. Prosecutors also explained that she also used money from her agency’s accounts to pay her credit card bills, and settle her property tax and local tax bills. The prosecution had asked the court to jail Hwang for three years during an August hearing . Prosecutors did not say whether they would seek to appeal the district court’s verdict. Hwang’s legal team noted that she had admitted to all the charges and had repaid the funds in two installments, on May 30 and June 5 this year.

The judge said that it had taken the fact that it was Hwang’s first offense into consideration. The presiding judge also concluded that the damages were “only limited to the defendant,” and noted that she had “repaid the entire amount of money she had embezzled.” Hwang, a former member of the South Korean pop group Sugar, made her small-screen breakthrough in the late 2000s when she appeared in the MBC sitcom High Kick Through The Roof.

With deadlines approaching in October and November, speculation is rising on how XRP’s price could respond if approvals are granted. Industry Braces for Wave of ETF Approvals A new report from Reuters revealed that the SEC has advanced work on its revised ETF rules, setting the stage for the first decisions within weeks. Market analysts expect multiple products, including those for XRP and Solana , to be among the earliest candidates for approval. Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital, confirmed that nearly a dozen applications have already been submitted, reflecting growing anticipation of rapid launches once the SEC finalizes its stance. He added that the sector is preparing for a significant influx of ETF products. The groundwork for these filings began in July, when the SEC initially introduced the updated standards. Since then, fund managers have revised documents and responded to regulatory inquiries. According to people familiar with the process, one last round of amendments is expected before the final review. Bitwise president Teddy Fusaro also noted that most applications have progressed deep into the review process and that the SEC’s adjustments have aligned with what firms had been anticipating. XRP ETFs Could Be Among the First Approved ETF analyst Nate Geraci, co-founder of The ETF Institute, stated that final submissions are expected by the end of this week. He confirmed that several spot ETFs linked to XRP are already well advanced in the process, describing the situation as entering its final countdown phase. Chad Steingraber, a developer and XRP advocate, shared this view, predicting that approvals could arrive soon after the last submissions are filed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Pending applications include products from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, CoinShares, WisdomTree, Canary Capital, and Franklin Templeton. The SEC’s earliest deadline for a decision is October 18, with later rulings extending into mid-November. At present, XRP trades around $2.75. Some analysts argue that the current price already reflects optimism surrounding the ETF discussions, leaving uncertainty about how much of an additional rally might occur once official decisions are made. Potential Price Impact if Approved If spot ETFs tied to XRP are approved, analysts expect the token could benefit from institutional inflows and greater regulatory legitimacy. In a recent assessment, Google’s Gemini chatbot suggested that XRP could rise into the $5 to $7 range, referencing the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum following their ETF approvals. The chatbot highlighted two key drivers: the entry of professional investors seeking managed exposure to XRP, and the credibility boost that would come from SEC recognition of an ETF product. However, the analysis also included a cautionary note. Markets often react with a “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern, in which initial gains are followed by profit-taking and heightened volatility. The long-term outcome for XRP would likely depend on whether ETFs attract sustained inflows rather than short-lived speculation. With the SEC’s decision window approaching, the digital asset industry is closely watching the fate of the pending XRP ETF applications. While approval could support a sharp price increase and expand institutional participation, short-term reactions may vary. For now, XRP investors await clarity on whether October will mark a turning point for the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the New York Times, the company wants the ruling paused while it appeals, warning that if the changes go into effect on October 22, its entire Android ecosystem will take a serious hit. In their words, the company and platform “will suffer irreparable harm.” This all started with a case filed by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, who accused Alphabet’s Google of blocking competition by locking developers into the Google Play Store and paying companies to keep it that way. A jury agreed with Epic in December 2023, saying Google crossed the line by cutting secret deals with major phone makers and developers to stop them from using other app stores or billing tools. Following that verdict, Judge James Donato in San Francisco ruled that Google needed to open the gates and stop shutting out its rivals. Google says Android will suffer if mandate kicks in In July 2024, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals backed the jury and ruled that Google has to lift restrictions that block app developers from setting up their own marketplaces and payment systems. The court said developers deserve the right to run their businesses without being locked into Google’s ecosystem. Google didn’t take it lightly. The company said the ruling would “significantly harm user safety” and “undermine innovation for Android.” Epic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, responded by calling the decision a big win and said it would finally allow Epic to offer its Epic Games Store on Android through Google Play. With Google now running to the highest court, it’s trying to freeze everything before that October deadline hits. The filing hasn’t shown up on the Supreme Court’s website, but the company’s message is clear: if the order isn’t blocked, Android users and developers are going to lose out—at least according to Google. But this fight with Epic isn’t the only legal storm the company’s in. Google is also staring down another penalty in Europe, where regulators under the European Commission are preparing to hit the company with its first fine under the Digital Markets Act. The law took effect in 2023 and was built specifically to rein in Big Tech and give competitors a fair shot. It lays out what massive platforms can and cannot do. Break those rules, and companies can be fined up to 10% of global yearly revenue. Google faces second EU penalty as Commission reviews case The upcoming fine is separate from the €2.95 billion (about $3.45 billion) penalty Google already got earlier this month. That fine was for favoring its own display ad technology and giving its ad exchange, AdX, more power at the expense of rival ad services and publishers. But the next charge focuses on Google’s treatment of vertical search engines, specifically how Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels were promoted over other travel and shopping platforms. The complaint was first filed in March 2024. Since then, Google has submitted multiple proposals to try and fix things, but airline companies, hotel chains, retail sites, and comparison tools said nothing has really changed. The Commission isn’t commenting, but Google pointed to comments made earlier by its Senior Director for Competition, Oliver Bethell, who said, “While we have invited feedback throughout this process, we now need to bring this debate to an end without the interests of a few being prioritised over the millions of people and businesses in Europe who benefit from Search.” Even with growing pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration over Europe’s crackdown on American tech, the EU Commission has no intention of stepping back. Officials say they’ll keep holding companies accountable, even if it stirs up more trade tension between the U.S. and the 27-nation bloc. If the fine under the DMA moves forward, Google would become the third American tech company punished under the law—following Apple and Meta Platforms, who were both hit with penalties in April.

Despite launching with major hype, Pi (PI) has struggled to live up to expectations, crashing by 91% from its all-time high of $2.98 set back in February. This wallet’s aggressive accumulation suggests it may be operating on privileged information or strong insider conviction. According to Pi Scan, wallet GASWBDODM currently holds 383.3 million PI , worth around $103 million – making it the 7th largest Pi holder overall, ahead of major exchanges like Gate.io and Bitget . Even more intriguing, this whale added 6.3 million PI tokens to their stack in the past week alone, signaling continued confidence despite the wider market’s retreat. The identity of GASWBD[…]ODM remains a mystery, but its positioning has sparked widespread speculation. Could this investor have early access to Pi’s roadmap, insider knowledge of an exchange listing, or an upcoming ecosystem update? Whatever the case, it adds serious weight to the bullish Pi Coin price prediction thesis – especially if other large players start following suit. Pi Coin Price Prediction: 26% Downside Risk If PI Fails to Break Above $0.30 Pi has rebounded slightly after hitting a new all-time low near $0.22 , consolidating around $0.26 in recent sessions. However, continued market weakness could drag the token back toward last week’s lows. On the 4-hour chart , the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is beginning to show signs of recovery, hinting that Pi Coin might attempt a retest of the $0.30 mark. Still, unless the token break out from its current downtrend decisively, the overall setup continues to support a bearish outlook. If bearish momentum accelerates, the $0.20 level becomes a likely target – implying a 26% downside risk from current levels. Rather than holding underperforming tokens this cycle, many traders are turning their focus to high-upside presales showing strong momentum. One standout is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a new project that enables users to build virtual mining rigs and earn crypto. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Turns Crypto Mining Into a Rewarding Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) lets users build their own virtual meme coin mining rig. You can buy nodes, build server rooms, and earn more crypto by building more rigs. The game leverages the popularity of the Pepe meme and combines it with an innovative virtual mining model that consists of buying and upgrading rigs to climb the leaderboard. Buyers will use $PEPENODE to set up and boost their mining operation while competing for attractive rewards, like airdrops of top meme coins like Pepe ($PEPE) and Bonk ($BONK). Every upgrade performed to a node adds a deflationary twist: 70% of the tokens spent on improving rigs are burned permanently, reducing the circulating supply as the community expands. As the game gains popularity, the demand for $PEPENODE could skyrocket. To buy $PEPENODE at its presale price, visit the official Pepenode website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap crypto or use a bank card to get started.

The recovered funds came from global operations to crack down on cybercrime, which claimed $40.9B in illegal crypto funds last year. The operation, codenamed HAECHI VI, involved law enforcement agencies from 40 countries across multiple continents between April and August 2025, targeting seven major categories of financial cybercrime: investment fraud, romance scams, phishing , money laundering linked to online gambling, sextortion, e-commerce fraud, and business email compromise schemes. Interpol has recovered $97M in crypto Interpol has announced the recovery of $439M in criminal proceeds following a multinational operation targeting cyber financial crimes. Among the seized assets were $97M in cryptocurrencies and physical property. Authorities blocked more than 68,000 bank accounts and froze nearly 400 cryptocurrency wallets as part of the operation. From the seized wallets alone, investigators recovered around $16M in illegal digital assets. In Portugal, the police dismantled a syndicate accused of siphoning funds from social security accounts intended for vulnerable families. Forty-five suspects were arrested, and losses amounting to $270,000 were traced back to 531 victims. In Thailand , the Royal Thai Police officers seized $6.6M in stolen assets linked to a transnational business email compromise scheme that tricked a Japanese corporation into transferring funds to a fraudulent Bangkok-based entity. The network was allegedly run by Thai and West African nationals. Other notable successes involved the recovery of $3.91M in the United Arab Emirates. Investigators retrieved the funds after a Korean steel company identified forged shipping documents and flagged the fraudulent transfer. The stop was made possible through Interpol’s Global Rapid Intervention of Payments (I-GRIP) system. This mechanism enables law enforcement agencies to freeze criminal proceeds in real time. Global efforts against cybercrime Aside from Europe and Asia, African nations have also intensified cybercrime enforcement. Earlier in 2025, authorities across 18 African countries and the United Kingdom conducted Operation Serengeti 2.0, which led to 1,209 arrests and the recovery of $97.4M. Criminal infrastructures, such as 25 illegal crypto mining centers in Angola and a $300M online investment scam in Zambia, were also dismantled. A separate operation, Operation Red Card, conducted between November 2024 and February 2025, resulted in 306 arrests across seven African nations. Nigerian authorities arrested 130 suspects, including foreign nationals, who were allegedly involved in cyber-enabled investment and casino fraud. South Africa and Zambia also reported large-scale arrests connected to SIM box fraud and malware-driven scams, respectively. “While many people believe that funds lost to fraud and scams are often irretrievable, the outcomes of HAECHI operations demonstrate that recovery is indeed possible,” Theos Badege, the Director pro tempore of Interpol’s Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre, said. Lee Jun Hyeong, the head of South Korea’s Interpol National Central Bureau, also noted that the country has played a leading role in international cooperation. “Operation HAECHI has time and again demonstrated the power of unified global action in eradicating cyber-enabled financial crime,” he said. Experts have also pointed out that cryptocurrencies have accelerated the globalization of financial crime. Phil Larratt, the Director of Investigations at Chainalysis, stressed the effectiveness of cross-border partnerships. He cited Operation Destabilise, which is a joint effort by the UK, France, and the U.S. that dismantled a Russian money laundering network and resulted in $25.5M in cryptocurrency getting recovered. “These outcomes are only possible when governments, regulators and private companies share intelligence and act together,” he added.

Brussels regulators said they want to check if SAP has been playing unfair when it comes to helping customers who use its business management software installed on company computers. The probe will look at “whether SAP may have distorted competition in the aftermarket for maintenance and support services related to an on-premises type of software, licensed by SAP, used for the management of companies’ business operations,” the Commission said. SAP pushed back Thursday, saying its way of doing business follows EU rules. “However, we take the issues raised seriously and we are working closely with the EU Commission to resolve them,” a spokesperson said. “We do not anticipate the engagement with the European Commission to result in material impacts on our financial performance.” The company is worth almost 282 billion euros ($331 billion), making it one of Europe’s biggest companies by value. Its shares fell 2% by 12:45 p.m. in London (7:45 a.m. ET) Thursday. The case centers on its Enterprise Resource Planning software, called ERP for short. Big companies use ERP to handle their money and accounting work day to day. The company has a big chunk of this market, but isn’t the only player – Microsoft and Oracle also sell ERP products. The Commission is looking specifically at the “on-prem” version of SAP ERP. This means software that sits on a company’s own servers, not the cloud version that gets accessed through the firm’s remote data centers. SAP still makes a lot of money from on-prem IT services. But the company has been trying for years to get more customers using cloud services instead. This push comes as SAP battles tech heavyweights like Microsoft and Amazon, who run most of the public cloud market. This EU investigation is different because it doesn’t go after Big Tech. Most of the bloc’s competition work has targeted powerful American tech companies. This has upset both tech firms and US politicians, who say American companies get picked on unfairly. Wednesday, Apple asked for the Digital Markets Act – the EU’s big digital competition law – to be scrapped, saying it was “leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU.” SAP is partnering with OpenAI and AWS Based on an earlier report by Cryptopolitan , SAP announced new deals with OpenAI and Amazon Web Services to grow its “digital sovereignty” services for European governments. The company will work with OpenAI to bring AI services like ChatGPT to Germany’s government workers. The project, called “OpenAI for Germany,” will run through the company’s Delos Cloud, which keeps data stored locally under European laws. SAP and Amazon.com Inc. also said the German company will offer its sovereign cloud service through AWS. Several European countries are rushing to build their own “sovereign” AI services because officials and business leaders worry about Europe losing control of this key technology. SAP has said it will spend around €20 billion ($23.5 billion) on its sovereign services. These partnership announcements come as the company faces regulatory heat, showing how software companies must deal with both government oversight and fast-changing technology demands in Europe.

Reminder to Eligible Users Cardano community member Rick McCracken issued a notice on social media earlier today, pointing out that the claim window for NIGHT tokens is closing soon. A screenshot shared with the post showed just over 10 days remaining before the first phase of claims officially ends. The claim portal, launched on August 5, made NIGHT tokens available to 33.6 million eligible addresses spread across eight supported blockchains. These include Cardano, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Basic Attention Token, and BNB Chain. (1/3) 10 days left to claim Cardano $NIGHT tokens! If you hold $BTC , $ETH , $AVAX , $SOL , $BNB , $BAT , $XRP or $ADA on their native chains, you may be eligible. Claim here https://t.co/Vrl26vLyu5 List of supported chains, wallets & HW in next post pic.twitter.com/RLHSU4sski — Rick McCracken DIGI (@RichardMcCrackn) September 24, 2025 According to the distribution plan, 50% of the total supply was reserved for Cardano users, while Bitcoin holders received 20%. The remaining 30% was divided among the other six networks, including XRP Ledger . Although some participants initially reported technical difficulties when the process began, the Midnight team confirmed that most of those issues have since been resolved, ensuring smoother access for claimants. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has provided several updates on claim activity since the portal went live. On August 19, he revealed that more than 69,000 addresses across the supported blockchains had successfully claimed around 1.32 billion NIGHT tokens, equal to 5.5% of the 24 billion total supply. At that time, Cardano users represented the largest share of claims at 61.3%, while Bitcoin and XRP holders accounted for 19.43% and 5.72%, respectively. By August 23, Hoskinson confirmed that over 70,000 participants had claimed more than 1.6 billion NIGHT tokens in total. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Next Phases of the Airdrop The initial phase of the distribution, known as the Glacier Drop , will close on October 4 at 12:00 p.m. UTC. Once this stage concludes, Midnight will move directly into its second phase, titled the Scavenger Mine. During this stage, which will run for 30 days, users will be able to earn shares of unclaimed NIGHT tokens by completing specific computational tasks. Afterward, a third stage called the Lost and Found phase will allow users who missed earlier deadlines another opportunity to claim tokens. Any remaining supply after these rounds will be directed to the project’s treasury. Importantly, tokens that are successfully claimed will not be distributed in one lump sum. Instead, beneficiaries will receive their allocation in four equal installments of 25%, spread across one year. With only 10 days left before the Glacier Drop ends, eligible XRP, Cardano, and other blockchain users are encouraged to complete their claims promptly. Missing this window will mean waiting for later phases, where the conditions and rewards may differ from the current allocation system.

Despite its struggle to decisively break above the $3 mark, XRP is now forming a Falling Wedge pattern that signals the potential for a powerful breakout by October. Falling Wedge Signals XRP Breakout By October In a recent XRP price analysis, published on Monday, Dark Defender noted that the third-largest cryptocurrency has once again respected its key support levels at $2.85, despite being rejected at $3.13. The XRP price tapped into the primary support trendline, highlighted in orange on the chart, which has consistently held as a structural base. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Definitely Reach $10,000, Gives Reasons Why Importantly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is edging closer to oversold territory, a signal often associated with potential price reversals. While skepticism spreads across the market, Dark Defender insists that the XRP bullish structure remains intact and that disbelief itself is a sign that many could be caught off guard by what’s to come. The analyst notes that the cryptocurrency has been consolidating within a Falling Wedge pattern between July and September. According to him, October could be the month when XRP finally breaks free from the wedge and delivers a rally strong enough to surprise the broader market. Building on this momentum, Dark Defender has forecasted three potential price targets for XRP by October: $4.17, $4.92, and $5.85. These levels correspond to upper Fibonacci Extension zones, specifically 261.8%, 361.8%, and 236.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, XRP has its closest supports set at $2.80 and $2.64, ensuring a strong base for the projected Falling Wedge breakout. XRP Bullish Run Just Starting Following his earlier predictions, Dark Defender further reinforced his bullish case by asserting that XRP has not begun its true rally. He suggested a power shift is underway, hinting that what the market has seen so far is only the beginning of a larger bullish wave. Related Reading: Analyst Unveils 3-Month Prediction For Bitcoin, XRP, And Dogecoin – It’s Very Bullish This perspective arrives at a time when XRP has already delivered a remarkable performance in 2025. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the cryptocurrency has gained 384% Year-to-Date, a surge fueled by increasing demand, rumors of a potential XRP ETF, and renewed confidence after the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. With XRP reaching a high of $3.65 earlier this year and trading just over 5% shy of reclaiming its former all-time high of $3.84, Dark Defender remains certain that the asset’s real growth is still ahead. Based on this view, the recent pullback below $3 is not seen as a weakness, but rather as a consolidation phase before the next leg higher. He highlighted that XRP is nearing the end of this corrective ABCDE consolidation phase and preparing for a lift-off. According to his chart analysis, once the cryptocurrency reclaims the $3.33 level, it could pave the way for double-digit prices.

52266715,589282,1758844823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52266715.jpeg,"Liquid Staking Debuts On XRP Ledger, What mXRP Means For Investors",https://bitcoinist.com/liquid-staking-debuts-on-mxrp/,"Midas, in partnership with Axelar, has launched the first XRP liquid staking token, mXRP. The token will provide investors with yields from the XRP DeFi ecosystem and further expand the altcoin’s utility. XRP Liquid Staking Token Launches Midas revealed that the mXRP liquid staking token will be issued on the XRP Ledger EVM via the Axelar bridge, which also facilitates the transfer of the token to the Ledger. The tokenization platform noted that this is a first-of-its-kind tokenized exposure product, offering meaningful XRP-denominated yield strategies. The token is expected to provide an APY of up to 8% for holders, although Axelar indicated it could reach 10%. In an X post , Panek Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, which offers the token on the Ledger, broke down key details about the liquid staking token. He explained that token is a yield-bearing version of XRP that generates yields for its holders. As such, the price of mXRP should continuously grow against the XRP price and trade at a premium. Panek further stated that the yield comes from various strategies, including lending, market making, and depositing on DeFi protocols , among others. He noted that asset managers first lock XRP and then borrow against it in stablecoins, using the capital for various strategies to generate profits. The Anodos Finance co-founder also clarified that investors simply need to hold the staking token to claim their yields or redeem their XRP. He added that holders of the liquid staking token do not receive extra tokens. Instead, the yield and rewards are automatically added and embedded into mXRP’s value. Panek noted that token works similarly to other liquid staking tokens , such as stETH, jitoSOL, and sAVAX, meaning that those looking to get yields from it have to buy the asset and hold it. They can do this by selling XRP or adding new capital to buy the token. What mXRP Means For XRP Panek indicated that the launch of mXRP is beneficial for XRP, as it will add constant buying pressure to the altcoin. He noted that Midas and Axelar said that the goal is to become a perpetual buyer of XRP. Meanwhile, every XRP used to mint mXRP is locked, thereby removing it from circulation. Flare Network also recently announced the launch of ‘FXRP’ to expand XRP’s DeFi. Panek noted that mXRP and FXRP are slightly different, but ultimately, both are beneficial for XRP and the XRP Ledger. mXRP’s capital is managed by asset managers who generate yield on behalf of investors. At the same time, FXRP is a trustless version of XRP on the Flare network, which doesn’t inherently generate yield but can be used in DeFi protocols to generate yields. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $2.84, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Anodos Finance|Axelar Bridge|Coinmarketcap|DeFi|Flare Network|FXRP|jitoSOL|Panek Mekras|ripple|sAVAX|stETH|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BUSINESS|FLR,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 00:00:23

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has taken a significant dive, plummeting 16 points from yesterday to a concerning reading of 28. This sharp drop firmly places market sentiment in the ""Fear"" stage, according to data from Alternative. For many investors, this number can be a stark indicator of prevailing uncertainty and anxiety. But what exactly does this index tell us, and how should we interpret such a low reading? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Drives It? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful barometer of market psychology. It gauges investor sentiment on a scale from 0 (representing extreme fear) to 100 (signifying extreme optimism). Understanding its components helps us grasp the bigger picture: Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum, comparing it with average values. Low volume in a downtrend can indicate fear. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and mentions, assessing their sentiment and engagement. Increased negative sentiment can contribute to fear. Surveys (15%): Gathers weekly sentiment surveys from thousands of crypto investors (currently paused, but historically a component). Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance of Bitcoin often signals fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in ""Bitcoin price manipulation"" or ""crypto crash"" searches indicates fear. When the index registers a low number like 28, it clearly reflects widespread investor apprehension. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a significant shift indicating that many market participants are feeling uncertain about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. Why Does a Low Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matter for Your Portfolio? A reading of 28 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just an abstract metric; it has real implications for your investment decisions. When fear grips the market, several common behaviors emerge: Panic Selling: Investors, driven by fear, might sell off their holdings to avoid further losses, exacerbating price declines. Reduced Buying Pressure: New money often stays on the sidelines, waiting for clearer signals, leading to lower trading volumes and slower recovery. Increased Volatility: Emotional trading can lead to sharper price swings, making the market even more unpredictable. However, it’s crucial to remember that fear in the market can also present unique opportunities. Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries. Savvy investors sometimes view these times as chances to accumulate assets at lower prices, following the old adage: ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" Navigating Market Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index deep in the ""Fear"" zone, what should you do? Reacting emotionally is often detrimental. Instead, consider these strategies: Revisit Your Investment Thesis: Remind yourself why you invested in certain assets. Has the fundamental value changed, or is it just market sentiment? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Focusing on the long-term potential rather than daily fluctuations can help you weather downturns. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Keep an eye on reliable news and data, but avoid constant monitoring that can lead to emotional decisions. The current reading of 28 should serve as a prompt for caution and strategic thinking, not panic. It’s a moment to assess, plan, and potentially act with a clear head. What’s Next for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and the Market? While the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals significant apprehension, market sentiment is dynamic. It can shift rapidly based on news, regulatory developments, or major price movements. A sustained period of low fear could indicate a capitulation phase, where most weak hands have exited, potentially paving the way for a recovery. Conversely, continued negative news or price drops could push the index even lower, into ""Extreme Fear."" Monitoring this index, alongside other fundamental and technical indicators, can provide a more holistic view of the market’s health and potential direction. It serves as a reminder that emotional biases often play a huge role in financial markets, and understanding them is key to making rational decisions. Summary: Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The recent drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 28 is a clear signal of heightened fear in the cryptocurrency market. This index, powered by factors like volatility, trading volume, and social media sentiment, provides a crucial snapshot of investor psychology. While fear can lead to panic selling and increased volatility, it also historically presents opportunities for long-term investors. By adopting a disciplined approach, focusing on risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can navigate these challenging times effectively. Remember, understanding market sentiment is a powerful tool, but it should always be combined with sound research and a well-defined investment strategy.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods of rapid growth for various assets. Recently, a significant shift has caught the attention of many investors: the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, has taken a notable dip. Falling three points from yesterday, the index now stands at 69. This movement isn’t just a number; it signals a potential change in the prevailing market winds, moving away from a strong altcoin dominance. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the crypto world, understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental. CoinMarketCap developed this index to provide a clear snapshot of market performance. It helps investors determine whether the current period favors altcoins or Bitcoin. How does it work? It meticulously compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when 75% of these top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin during that specific timeframe. A score closer to 100 indicates a much stronger and more pervasive altcoin trend. Conversely, a lower score, especially one like 69, suggests that Bitcoin might be regaining its footing or that altcoins are broadly underperforming relative to the crypto king. Understanding the Current Dip in the Altcoin Season Index The recent three-point drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 69 is a significant event. While 69 is still above the 75 threshold for a full “altcoin season,” the downward trend is what truly matters. This movement implies that fewer altcoins, among the top 100, are currently outperforming Bitcoin compared to previous days. What could be driving this? Market Rotation: Often, after periods of strong altcoin gains, investors rotate profits back into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven, or even into stablecoins. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin itself might be experiencing a resurgence, attracting capital away from altcoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to favor less volatile assets within crypto, often meaning Bitcoin. It’s vital to remember that the crypto market is highly interconnected. A shift in the Altcoin Season Index can reflect a complex interplay of various factors, from specific project news to global economic sentiment. How Does This Affect Your Crypto Portfolio and Strategy? A falling Altcoin Season Index prompts investors to re-evaluate their strategies. If you’ve been heavily invested in altcoins, this might be a signal to: Review Your Holdings: Assess the performance of your individual altcoin assets. Are they still strong performers, or are they lagging behind Bitcoin? Consider Rebalancing: You might consider rebalancing your portfolio to increase your Bitcoin exposure, especially if you anticipate further Bitcoin dominance. Research New Opportunities: While some altcoins might be struggling, others could still present unique opportunities. Always do your due diligence. Conversely, for those with a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio, a lower Altcoin Season Index could be seen as validation of a more conservative approach. However, even during “Bitcoin season,” specific altcoins can still deliver impressive gains due to unique developments or strong community support. The key is never to rely solely on one metric but to use it as part of a broader analytical framework. Navigating the Shifting Tides: Actionable Insights from the Altcoin Season Index Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is just the first step. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these shifting market tides: Stay Informed: Regularly check the index and other market indicators. Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. Diversify Wisely: Even if the index suggests a Bitcoin season, a well-diversified portfolio that includes a mix of strong altcoins and Bitcoin can mitigate risks. Long-Term Vision: Short-term fluctuations are common. A long-term investment strategy, based on fundamental analysis of projects, often yields better results than reacting to every index movement. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits when appropriate. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin is a continuous narrative. While the Altcoin Season Index provides a valuable snapshot, it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Smart investors use such tools to inform, not dictate, their decisions, always prioritizing research and a balanced approach. In conclusion, the recent three-point drop in CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index to 69 serves as a timely reminder of the market’s ebb and flow. It signals a potential recalibration where Bitcoin might be asserting more dominance over a broader range of altcoins. For investors, this isn’t a call for panic, but rather an invitation to reassess strategies, rebalance portfolios if necessary, and remain vigilant. By understanding the underlying dynamics and utilizing tools like this index, you can better position yourself to thrive in the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions About the Altcoin Season Index Q1: What does it mean when the Altcoin Season Index falls? A1: A falling Altcoin Season Index indicates that fewer altcoins, among the top 100 by market capitalization, are outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It suggests a potential shift towards Bitcoin dominance or a general underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. Q2: Is an Altcoin Season Index score of 69 considered good or bad? A2: An index score of 69 is still below the 75% threshold needed to officially declare an an “altcoin season.” While it’s not extremely low, the recent drop from a higher point suggests a weakening trend for altcoins relative to Bitcoin. It’s a signal to reassess market conditions. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A3: The Altcoin Season Index is typically updated daily by CoinMarketCap, providing a continuous snapshot of market performance trends between altcoins and Bitcoin. Q4: Should I sell all my altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is falling? A4: Not necessarily. A falling Altcoin Season Index is one indicator among many. It’s crucial to perform your own research (DYOR) on individual altcoin projects, consider your long-term investment goals, and assess your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. It might be a time to rebalance your portfolio, not to panic sell. Q5: What’s the difference between an “altcoin season” and a “Bitcoin season”? A5: An “altcoin season” occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A “Bitcoin season” is the inverse, where Bitcoin significantly outperforms most altcoins during the same timeframe. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Today marks a significant Bitcoin options expiration event, alongside a substantial expiry for Ethereum options. These events, involving billions of dollars, often create ripples across the market, making it essential for traders and enthusiasts to pay close attention. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Options Expiration? To fully grasp the implications of today’s Bitcoin options expiration , it’s helpful to understand what options contracts are. Simply put, an option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. This date is known as the expiration. Call options: Grant the right to buy. Traders typically buy calls if they expect the price to rise. Put options: Grant the right to sell. Traders often buy puts if they anticipate a price drop. When these contracts expire, they can influence market sentiment and even price action, especially when large volumes are involved. The underlying assets, in this case, are Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Scale of Today’s Bitcoin Options Expiration: A Deep Dive Today’s expiry is particularly notable due to its sheer scale. According to crypto options exchange Deribit, a staggering $16 billion worth of Bitcoin options expiration is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 26th. This massive notional value represents a significant portion of the derivatives market. Additionally, Ethereum options totaling $5 billion will expire concurrently. Such large expiries can sometimes lead to increased volatility as traders adjust their positions. For Bitcoin, the put/call ratio stands at 0.71. This ratio indicates the number of put options relative to call options. A ratio below 1 suggests a slightly bullish sentiment, as more call options are open compared to put options. Ethereum’s put/call ratio is 0.86, also leaning slightly bullish. These ratios offer a snapshot of market participants’ collective expectations regarding future price movements. Understanding ‘Max Pain’ and Its Market Influence A key metric associated with options expiration is the ‘max pain price.’ For the expiring Bitcoin options expiration , the max pain price is currently $111,000. For Ethereum, it’s $3,800. What does ‘max pain’ mean? It’s the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. Essentially, it’s the price point where the majority of options traders would experience the most pain. While not a definitive prediction, the market sometimes gravitates towards this price point as expiration approaches. This phenomenon is often attributed to the actions of options writers (those who sell options) who might hedge their positions, potentially influencing the underlying asset’s price. However, it’s crucial to remember that max pain is just one indicator among many and should not be the sole basis for trading decisions. What Does This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for Traders? With such a substantial Bitcoin options expiration looming, what should traders consider? Historically, large options expiries can usher in periods of heightened volatility, though outcomes are never guaranteed. Here are some actionable insights: Increased Volatility: Be prepared for potential price swings around the expiration time as market participants close or roll over their positions. Sentiment Shift: Observe how the market reacts post-expiration. A significant move away from the max pain price could indicate a strong directional bias. Risk Management: Ensure your trading strategies account for potential increased risk. Consider using stop-losses or reducing position sizes if you are sensitive to volatility. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and analysis from reputable sources. While the expiry itself doesn’t guarantee a specific price movement, it does create an environment where significant capital is in play, potentially leading to dynamic market behavior. In conclusion, today’s colossal Bitcoin options expiration , coupled with a notable Ethereum options expiry, marks a critical moment for the crypto markets. While the max pain prices offer a fascinating insight into potential market gravitating points, the true impact will unfold as the expiration time arrives. Traders should remain vigilant, practice sound risk management, and stay informed to navigate any potential shifts. The crypto market’s inherent dynamism means every major event, like this one, presents both challenges and opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin options expiration? A1: It’s the specific date and time when Bitcoin options contracts become void. At expiration, option holders decide whether to exercise their right to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at the agreed-upon strike price, or let the option expire worthless. Q2: What is the significance of the put/call ratio? A2: The put/call ratio indicates market sentiment. A ratio below 1 (like Bitcoin’s 0.71) suggests more call options are open than put options, often interpreted as a slightly bullish sentiment. Conversely, a ratio above 1 could suggest bearish sentiment. Q3: How does ‘max pain’ affect Bitcoin’s price? A3: The ‘max pain’ price is the strike price where the most options contracts expire worthless, causing maximum loss for option holders. While not a direct price predictor, some believe the underlying asset’s price can gravitate towards this point as expiration nears, potentially due to hedging activities by options writers. Q4: Will today’s $16B Bitcoin options expiration cause a price crash? A4: A large options expiration doesn’t automatically lead to a price crash or surge. It can, however, contribute to increased volatility and potential price adjustments as large positions are settled or rolled over. Market dynamics are complex, and many factors influence price. Q5: Where can I find data on options expirations? A5: Reputable crypto options exchanges like Deribit, CME, and others provide data on open interest, put/call ratios, and max pain prices for their listed options contracts. Financial news outlets also often report on these significant events. Did you find this analysis of the Bitcoin options expiration insightful?

The move comes after mass demonstrations this month that called out suspected corruption in public works and flood control projects. Integrity Chain Piloted For Infrastructure Contracts According to reports, a platform called Integrity Chain — developed with BayaniChain Ventures — is being used to log public-works contracts and progress updates. The system anchors cryptographic hashes on the Polygon network so files can be proven unchanged later. Local civic groups and some universities have been named as independent validators who can attest to entries, and their attestations are also recorded. Budget Documents Notarized On-Chain Reports have disclosed that the Philippines Department of Budget and Management has already been using blockchain notarization for budget paperwork. Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) can be hashed and uploaded so anyone can check whether a document was altered after publication. Officials describe this as a way to make parts of the budget trackable in public view while keeping sensitive details protected. Why The Shift Happened Now Public anger spiked in September after large protests over alleged corruption tied to infrastructure projects. Demonstrations reached tens, and some estimates said crowds swelled to over 100,000 in the capital on September 21, 2025. Based on reports, lawmakers and city officials pointed to those street protests as a key reason to speed up transparency measures. City Launches Local Pilot At the city level, Baguio has rolled out a local system branded GoodGovChain to log municipal financial statements, procurement records, and infrastructure reports. The launch, according to city leaders, is aimed at making official documents available and nearly impossible to tamper with after publication. Philippines Lawmakers Propose A National System Meanwhile, a Senate filing — Senate Bill No. 1330 — was lodged to create a National Budget Blockchain System, according to press releases. The proposal would let Philippines citizens trace national spending more easily. Lawmakers backing the measure argue that blockchain logs could give the public a clearer view of where funds move, though opponents warn about cost and complexity.

Dogecoin Whale Has Made A Massive Move During The Past Day According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large move has been spotted on the Dogecoin blockchain over the past day. The transfer in question involved the movement of nearly 122.4 million DOGE, worth around $28.5 million at the time the network processed it.

Whales refer to the big-money investors of the cryptocurrency, who can carry some degree of influence in the market thanks to their large holdings. Moves related to such holders can be worth keeping an eye on, due to their standing. The transfers may not directly impact the memecoin’s price, but they can still contain information about the sentiment among these giants. A lot of these moves are anonymous, however, meaning it can be hard to infer anything from them. Luckily, the latest Dogecoin whale transaction involved a wallet that has already been identified. Below are the address details related to the transfer. As is visible, the sending address in the case of this Dogecoin whale transaction was a wallet attached to cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The receiver, on the other hand, was an unknown wallet, suggesting that it was likely to be an investor’s self-custodial address. Moves of this type, where coins flow from centralized exchanges to self-custody, are known as Exchange Outflows. Generally, holders move coins away from the custody of these platforms when they plan to hold them in the long term, so Exchange Outflows can have a bullish impact on the asset’s price. The latest Binance Exchange Outflow from the whale has interestingly come following a drop of almost 18% for the memecoin over the past week. As such, it’s possible that the withdrawal corresponds to the large investor using the lower prices to accumulate DOGE.

As displayed in the above chart, the total supply of the Dogecoin investors carrying between 100 million and 1 billion tokens has gone up by 2 billion DOGE (about $465 million) within this window. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.23, down more than 4.5% over the last 24 hours.
