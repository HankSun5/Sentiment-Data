Bitcoin surged to a fresh record of $124,128 just last month. At the same time, the ecosystem continues to broaden, with strong investor enthusiasm carrying over into prominent altcoins and best meme coins . Over the past year, many tokens have achieved new peaks, showcasing the market’s renewed optimism. This resurgence has largely been fueled by two major policy developments out of Washington. First, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first major legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins. Second, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, a framework designed to modernize and clarify how securities laws intersect with digital assets. With improving sentiment, investors are eyeing leading altcoins like XRP, Pepe, and Dogecoin as some of the most attractive dip-buying plays ahead of the next potential bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payment Pioneer and 2025 Blue-Chip Candidate Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , hit a record high of $3.65 on July 18, the same day as the passage of the GENIUS Act. In doing so, it surpassed its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since pulled back to roughly $2.84, representing about a 22% decline from its recent high. XRP’s strength lies in its role as a low-cost, efficient solution for global money transfers, positioning it as a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. This reputation has been bolstered by backing from the UN Capital Development Fund and recognition from the U.S. Ripple’s policy influence was highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a White House crypto regulation roundtable earlier this year. Additionally, with the rollout of RLUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple has set its sights on capturing a meaningful share in the stablecoin market. Momentum accelerated after a pivotal 2023 court ruling declared XRP’s retail transactions were not securities, ending a lengthy battle with the SEC and marking a major victory for the industry. Over the past year, XRP has delivered a 383% gain, quintupling Bitcoin’s 76% growth. After July’s rally, the token established support near $3, though seasonal weakness in September saw it dip below that level. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 42 and may be continuing downward, further discounting the price. While rate cuts and the recent approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t trigger an immediate breakout, probably because markets had already priced it in, additional higher-profile spot ETF decisions expected in mid-October could push XRP above $4 within weeks. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme-Culture Favorite With Room to Run Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, quickly rose to the ranks of top meme tokens by market capitalization, inspired by Matt Furie’s famous frog character from his Boy’s Club webcomic. Its meteoric rise inspired countless imitators, though none replicated its success. With a market cap of around $4 billion, Pepe has attracted worldwide attention, even appearing as Elon Musk’s profile picture on X for a brief stint. Currently trading at about $0.000009433, PEPE is currently feeling the effects of a market-wide dip. The coin currently sits 66% below its record high of $0.00002803 from late 2024. However, historically, October tends to be bullish for crypto, and if the “Uptober” trend holds, Pepe could claim new highs as early as November. At present, its RSI is 38 and trending downward, suggesting that further near-term declines may create additional dip-buying opportunities. Supporters argue that a stronger macro backdrop, combined with growing investor optimism, could help propel PEPE to fresh highs later this year. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Is the Original Meme Coin Ready for $1? Initially created in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since transformed into the most recognized meme coin, supported by a loyal fan base and a market capitalization of $35.4 billion. The coin gained mainstream attention in 2021 thanks to backing from celebrities like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. This past May, renewed institutional activity pushed DOGE back above $0.25 amid speculation of a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF. It now trades around $0.2334, down about 3% alongside a broader correction across all crypto that has hit the meme coin sector a little harder. Meme coins collectively fell 2% to a combined $75.1 billion market cap. Zooming out, the wider $4 trillion crypto market slipped 1.5% today, signalling a general pullback. For long-term holders, this could represent an ideal entry point to stack DOGE. Technically, DOGE’s RSI stands at 44, indicating more potential downside as the selloff continues going into the weekend. However, a rebound later by Monday ahead of “Uptober” could pave the way for meaningful gains, since October has historically been a bullish month for crypto. With increasing adoption, Tesla accepting DOGE for certain purchases and platforms like PayPal and Revolut expanding support, the coin’s real-world utility continues to grow. If positive momentum continues, DOGE could approach the $0.50 level by mid-October, with the coveted $1 target remaining in sight. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Layer 2 Presale Targeting 2025 Growth Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of 2025’s most notable presales, aiming to become the first Bitcoin Layer 2 project that merges viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. The initiative seeks to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster transactions, expanded smart contract functionality, and community-driven governance. So far, the presale has attracted approximately $18.1 million, with analysts projecting potential post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER enables fast, low-cost smart contracts. A key feature is its Canonical Bridge, which allows near-instant Bitcoin transfers while also supporting dApps, meme tokens, and payment solutions. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. The $HYPER token has multiple utilities within the ecosystem, including staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early buyers can secure staking rewards up to 65% APY and gain voting privileges once the platform is live.

52263636,https://cryptonews.com/?p=428300,1758839400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52263636.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Shiba Inu and Solana by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/googles-gemini-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-shiba-inu-and-solana-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Google’s in-house ChatGPT rival Gemini AI paints a bullish outlook for the crypto market, suggesting that XRP, Shiba Inu, and Solana could emerge as the biggest gainers if digital assets move into a strong upward trend heading into the final quarter. Bitcoin recently smashed past its previous record, hitting $124,128 last month before easing back slightly after an unexpected rise in July inflation numbers. A week ago, the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% rate cut, briefly boosting risk assets. However, Trump’s surprise proposal of a one-off $100,000 H-1B visa application fee rattled investors, sparking heavy liquidations across crypto markets over the weekend. On the policy front, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act earlier this summer, the first U.S. law to regulate stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold full reserves. Meanwhile, the SEC launched Project Crypto, a major initiative to modernize how securities rules apply to blockchain assets. Together, these catalysts could set the stage for the next explosive altcoin cycle. If Gemini AI’s projections hold true, XRP, Shiba Inu, and Solana could be among the biggest winners in the months ahead. XRP (Ripple): Gemini AI Forecasts $20—A 7× Upside Gemini AI projects Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could surge to $20 by late 2025, around seven times higher than its current trading price of around $2.83. The token has already had a strong year, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40 and climbing to $3.65 on July 18 before retracing about 22%. Ripple’s international reach is growing, underscored by the UN Capital Development Fund’s recognition in 2024 of XRP as a practical solution for cross-border payments in developing regions. Earlier this year, Ripple finally put its long-standing battle with the SEC behind it, as the regulator dropped its case. This reinforced the landmark 2023 court decision that XRP’s retail sales are not securities, a precedent that resonates in victory across the altcoin sector. According to Gemini AI, XRP’s likely New Year trading zone sits between $5 and $10, with more optimistic scenarios targeting $20, particularly if the Trump administration implements long-promised crypto legislation. Additionally, the SEC is likely to approve a raft of high-profile spot XRP ETFs in mid-October, which could add substantial inflows. Technical indicators support optimism: XRP’s RSI recently dipped to 42, signaling undervaluation and the possibility of a rebound rally. Multiple bullish flag patterns across the chart this year may also hint at a breakout. Positive sentiment could drive XRP back to $4 by October. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 383%, hurtling past Bitcoin’s 76% and Ethereum’s 51% gains over the same period. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Gemini AI Predicts Up to 8.5× Growth in a Bull Market Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become Dogecoin’s fiercest competitor, boasting a market cap of around $7 billion. Currently trading near $0.00001176 after a 4% dip in the past 24 hours, SHIB has corrected a little harder than the rest of the meme coin market, which collectively lost 2.2% overnight to post a capitalization of $75.1 billion. On the technical front, SHIB has already broken out of both a falling wedge and a bull flag this year. A move above $0.000025 by November could validate Gemini AI’s target range of $0.00005–$0.00008 by year-end. In the event of a major bull run, the model suggests SHIB could rocket as high as $0.0001, a tidy potential 8.5× gain from current prices. Its RSI sits at 37 following recent corrections. This serves both as a signal that the token is discounted and it potentially sets up a rapid bounce if traders capitalize on the dip when the correction ends. Shiba Inu has also expanded beyond its meme coin roots, powering Shibarium, a dedicated Layer-2 blockchain that supports fast, low-cost transactions, decentralized apps, and added privacy, distinguishing it from rival meme projects. Solana (SOL): Gemini AI Sees ETF Buzz and Ecosystem Strength Driving a Push to $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has cemented itself as a top smart contract network with a market cap of over $108.4 billion and total value locked (TVL) at around $11 billion across its ecosystem. Developer activity and institutional adoption continue to grow. Speculation is mounting that a U.S. spot Solana ETF could be on the horizon, which may trigger similar inflows to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding to the intrigue, Trump has even floated the idea of including Solana in a potential U.S. national Bitcoin reserve. Under his plan, however, the government would only obtain SOL through asset seizures, not direct purchases. Price-wise, Solana hit $250 in January, dropped to $100 in April, and rebounded to $198 last week, nearly retesting this year’s high. Having recently broken out of a descending wedge, Gemini AI projects Solana could climb as high as $1,000 by year-end, more than tripling its all-time high of $293.31. That said, regulatory clarity and ETF approvals will be crucial to achieving this milestone. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Speculative Alternative to Dogecoin For those exploring riskier meme coin plays outside Gemini AI’s top picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as Dogecoin’s more volatile cousin. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap token often moving with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Maxi Doge embraces high-risk speculation, bolstered by edgy branding and a grassroots community. Its presale has already raised $2.5 million within its first month. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI cultivates community engagement through Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and cross-project collaborations. Out of its 150.24 billion token supply, 25% is allocated to the Maxi Fund for marketing and partnerships. Staking is live with eye-catching rewards of 133% APY, though yields will gradually decline as participation rises. Currently selling for $0.000259, although the price rises in scheduled nominal increments as the presale progresses through the funding rounds. Interested investors can join via wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The application was submitted today. The goal is to launch a fund that pays investors income using premiums tied to Bitcoin. This isn’t the same kind of product as their earlier spot Bitcoin ETF. It’s built to hand out actual income, not track the price of Bitcoin. This filing follows the success of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , known as IBIT, which reached $90 billion in assets by September, and now controls 60% of the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market. Both BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have achieved over $260 million in annual revenue within two years. BlackRock shifts focus to Bitcoin income generation The new fund is built for yield-focused investors; people who want income, not just exposure to Bitcoin’s price. That’s different from IBIT , which only follows Bitcoin’s price movements. This premium income ETF will likely use Bitcoin-linked strategies to generate steady payouts. A BlackRock statement said, “Investors are looking for ways to benefit from Bitcoin while minimizing price volatility.” The company has already raked in serious cash from its crypto lineup. Its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs pulled in $260 million in yearly revenue, and that was in under two years. And BlackRock didn’t stop at launching ETFs. It’s been adding crypto to its model portfolios too. They’re now allocating 1% to 2% of those portfolios to Bitcoin, giving regular investors small but steady exposure to digital assets. The new income-focused ETF also targets a different type of investor than their previous products, and instead of tracking value, this ETF will focus on generating returns from Bitcoin premiums, which could come from covered call strategies or similar income-producing methods. BlackRock’s statement continued, “There’s a growing class of investors who want to access Bitcoin’s potential without being exposed to its full volatility.” The firm said this new fund was made to meet that demand directly.

These three coins have all taken significant hits, although some alts—such as Solana, Dogecoin, and Avalanche—have seen 24-hour losses rising above 4% today. This may be disappointing news for anyone who expected last week’s (priced-in) rate cut to result in a bull rally, yet overselling increases the odds of a vigorous comeback. And this is what we’re seeing with XRP, Cardano and Litecoin, which we’ll analyse in this article. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Approvals Will Push Alt to New Record Highs XRP has dropped back down to $2.82 today, making for a 1.5% loss in 24 hours and a 9.5% decline in a week. But while the altcoin is also down by 3% in a month, it retains a very healthy 380% increase in the past year, making it one of the best-performing top-100 coins over this timeframe. There are two main things to point out when it comes to its crypto price prediction, with the first being that the SEC is very likely to approve several XRP ETFs in the next few weeks. And once these gain the green light, XRP could witness an influx in institutional demand, pushing its price ever higher. Secondly, its indicators show that it’s in a decidedly oversold position, and given its rock-solid fundamentals, this should result in a rebound very soon. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have both fallen into negative positions over the past few days, meaning that XRP is selling below a ‘fair’ average price. In turn, this means it could recover very soon, potentially reaching $3 by the middle of October, before ETF approvals send it towards $5 for the end-of-year rally. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA)—Oversold Alt About to Receive Big Push from Grayscale ETF ADA has been one of the bigger losers today, having fallen by 4.5% in 24 hours, to $0.7844. This also represents a 14% loss in a week and a 7% decline in 30 days, although the alt remains up by 100% in a year. And as with XRP, ADA is also waiting on the SEC to approve ETF applications, although it has only one outstanding application to wait for, from Grayscale. Even though it’s less popular among ETF providers, the approval of Grayscale’s ETF could be a massive boost for ADA. Such approvals may arrive just at a time when ADA’s indicators bottom out, meaning that the coin could experience a big price swing upwards. Source: TradingView Its RSI is on its way down to 30 or even lower, so soon ADA will be trading at a discount that investors may be unable to resist. Whales have already been stocking up on the coin, with data showing that one big investor bought $56.8 million in ADA on Coinbase this week. Given such interest in Cardano, which is one of the biggest layer-one networks in crypto , its price is likely to experience a sharp recovery soon. It could reach $1 again by the end of October, while it has the potential to pass $2 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Litecoin ($LTC)—Altcoin Preparing for Big Push Towards $1,000 Today has also been difficult for Litecoin, which at $103.45 is down by 3.5% in 24 hours and by 10% in a week. However, the same theme applies to LTC as it does to the coins above, in that its oversold price is about to combine with several ETF approvals. In fact, Litecoin is the likeliest altcoin to gain SEC approval, given its forking from Bitcoin. Canary, CoinShares and Grayscale are all waiting on decisions from the SEC, with Bloomberg analysts giving their applications a 95% chance of approval each. Source: TradingView We could therefore see the Litecoin price rise strongly, with its chart today showing that a bullish pennant has been forming since mid-July. Even more so than the two coins above, its RSI and MACD indicators are very close to bottoms, so we may not be that far from a rebound. Assuming SEC approval of the three coins above, it could reach $150 by the middle of October, before entering the New Year at above $500. PEPENODE Raises $1.4 Million in Presale: Could Mine-to-Earn Coin Be Next to 100x? The market is shaping up nicely for a end-of-year bull rally, so traders may want to diversify into newer tokens, in order to widen their exposure to the biggest possible gains. One way of doing this is to allocate some holdings to presale tokens, which can often surge when they list for the first time. Possibly the most interesting presale coin at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that’s introducing some very novel mine-to-earn functionality. PEPENODE has now raised over $1.4 million in its ICO, which it opened only a few weeks ago, with this figure providing an early warning of its future potential. The PEPENODE presale is live.

XRP / USD 1-day chart, triple bottom fuels bull flag breakout. Source: TradingView. Still, momentum indicators are not decidedly bullish, a sentiment echoed by analysts who call for sustained buy pressure for the triple bottom to be realised. The RSI is stabilizing in the 40s, showing sellers still hold some sway even as buying interest builds. The MACD histogram shows a similar trend shift, flattening into what could be an early golden cross above the signal line, which would confirm a bullish shift. If the flag pattern plays out, XRP could eye a breakout towards $5, an 80% gain from current levels, and a push towards all-time highs into new price discovery. With further U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approvals stacking as catalysts for demand running into Q4, the rally could even extend as far as $10, marking a 260% gain . However, this bullish case heavily relies on the $2.70 level holding as support.

Bitcoin mining giant TeraWulf is making headlines as it pursues a massive TeraWulf financing deal worth an astonishing $3 billion. This ambitious endeavor aims to fuel a substantial expansion of its data centers, signaling a strong belief in the future of digital assets. What’s Behind This Monumental TeraWulf Financing Push? According to reports from Bloomberg, TeraWulf is actively seeking this substantial capital injection. The core purpose is clear: to significantly boost its data center capacity. More data centers mean more power for Bitcoin mining, which is crucial for the company’s growth strategy. What makes this particular TeraWulf financing effort stand out is the reported involvement of tech behemoth Google. The search giant is said to be providing a guarantee for the funds, adding a layer of credibility and stability to the deal. Leading the charge on the financial side is Morgan Stanley, a global leader in investment banking. Key Players: TeraWulf (the mining firm), Google (guarantee provider), Morgan Stanley (lead financier). Goal: Expand data centers to enhance Bitcoin mining operations. Scale: A staggering $3 billion in capital. Why is Data Center Expansion So Crucial for Bitcoin Mining? For a Bitcoin mining company like TeraWulf, data centers are the lifeblood of their operations. These facilities house thousands of specialized computers, known as ASICs, that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Successfully solving a puzzle allows the miner to add a new block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and earn new bitcoins as a reward. Expanding data centers means: Increased Hash Rate: More machines translate to a higher hash rate, improving the company’s chances of mining Bitcoin.

Imagine an investment vehicle that not only offers exposure to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies but also champions environmental responsibility. This is precisely what 7RCC is proposing with its innovative application for a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF . This groundbreaking filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aims to combine spot Bitcoin with carbon credits, as reported by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. This move, submitted under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, marks a significant moment for both digital assets and sustainable investing. What Exactly is the Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF? At its core, the proposed Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF seeks to blend two distinct asset classes: spot Bitcoin and carbon credits. Spot Bitcoin refers to directly holding the cryptocurrency itself, rather than derivatives. Carbon credits, on the other hand, are measurable, verifiable permits that allow the owner to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. These credits are typically generated by projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere. 7RCC’s vision is to create a single investment product that gives investors exposure to both. This unique combination could offer a fresh approach to diversification, appealing to a broader range of investors interested in both growth potential and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. It’s a bold step that could redefine what a traditional ETF can encompass, especially in the rapidly expanding digital asset space. Why Combine Bitcoin and Carbon Credits in an ETF? The decision to pair Bitcoin with carbon credits might seem unconventional at first glance, but it addresses several key market trends and investor demands. For years, Bitcoin has faced criticism regarding its energy consumption and environmental footprint. By integrating carbon credits, the Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF could offer a mechanism to offset some of these concerns, presenting a “greener” way to invest in Bitcoin. Moreover, this innovative structure offers a dual benefit: Environmental Responsibility: The inclusion of carbon credits directly supports projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with growing global efforts towards sustainability. Diversification and Growth: Investors gain exposure to Bitcoin’s potential for significant returns while also participating in the burgeoning carbon credit market, which is vital for combating climate change. This approach could potentially attract institutional investors who are increasingly mandated to consider ESG factors in their portfolios. It’s an attempt to bridge the gap between traditional finance, digital assets, and environmental stewardship, all within a regulated framework. Navigating the Challenges of a Hybrid Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF While the concept of a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF is exciting, its path to approval and market acceptance comes with inherent challenges. The U.S. SEC has historically been cautious about approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, though recent approvals signal a shift. However, adding carbon credits introduces another layer of complexity. The regulatory landscape for carbon markets is still evolving, and integrating it with a digital asset like Bitcoin requires careful consideration. Key challenges include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously evaluate the fund’s structure, custody arrangements for both Bitcoin and carbon credits, and valuation methodologies. Market Volatility: Both Bitcoin and carbon credit markets can experience significant price fluctuations, which could impact the ETF’s performance. Operational Complexity: Managing two distinct and often volatile asset classes within a single fund requires robust operational frameworks and expertise. Despite these hurdles, 7RCC’s filing represents a proactive step towards addressing environmental concerns often associated with cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for more sustainable crypto investment products. What Does This Revolutionary ETF Mean for Investors? For investors, the potential approval of a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF could open up new avenues for portfolio diversification and values-aligned investing. It provides a simplified way to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and the environmental commodities market without the complexities of direct ownership. This could be particularly appealing to those who have been hesitant about Bitcoin due to its environmental impact, offering a more palatable entry point. Should this ETF come to fruition, it could: Enhance Accessibility: Make investing in Bitcoin and carbon credits easier for retail and institutional investors through traditional brokerage accounts. Promote Sustainable Investing: Encourage more capital flow into environmental projects by increasing demand for carbon credits. Set a Precedent: Potentially inspire other asset managers to develop hybrid funds that blend digital assets with other socially responsible investments. The journey to approval will be closely watched, as its success could significantly influence the future of sustainable investing in the digital asset space. The filing by 7RCC for a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF is undoubtedly a pioneering move, pushing the boundaries of what an exchange-traded fund can achieve. By proposing to combine the innovation of spot Bitcoin with the environmental commitment of carbon credits, 7RCC is attempting to create a unique investment vehicle that addresses both financial growth and ecological responsibility. While regulatory hurdles and market complexities remain, this initiative highlights a growing trend towards integrating sustainability into the core of digital finance. It’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of investment products designed to meet the diverse and increasingly conscientious demands of today’s investors.

A significant development has emerged that could reshape how investment firms operate in the digital asset space: US regulators are now actively probing potential crypto insider trading . What Sparked the Current Scrutiny into Crypto Insider Trading ? Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have launched an investigation into potential crypto insider trading . This isn’t just a casual inquiry; it’s a serious look into the trading activities of companies that have adopted cryptocurrency treasury strategies. Authorities sent letters to approximately 200 companies. Concerns were raised over unusual surges in trading volume and stock prices. These surges often occurred immediately before public disclosures about crypto strategies. The letters also highlighted possible violations of fair disclosure rules, which aim to prevent selective sharing of material non-public information. Industry observers view this move as a clear signal: a full-scale regulatory probe into crypto insider trading is likely underway, marking a critical moment for market integrity. Understanding Insider Trading in the Crypto Context Insider trading, in essence, involves using material, non-public information to make trades for personal gain. While traditionally associated with conventional stocks, its application to the crypto market, especially concerning company treasury strategies, presents new challenges. When a company announces it has added cryptocurrency to its balance sheet, it often impacts its stock price. If individuals with advance knowledge of such an announcement trade the company’s stock before the public disclosure, they could be engaging in insider trading. This practice undermines market fairness and investor confidence. The regulators’ focus on firms with ‘crypto treasury strategies’ means they are looking at how companies manage their digital asset holdings and how information about these holdings is handled before it becomes public knowledge. How Regulators Are Tackling Potential Violations The SEC and FINRA’s approach is methodical. By sending letters and requesting information, they are gathering data to identify patterns that suggest illicit activities. This proactive stance is crucial for maintaining transparency and trust in both traditional and emerging markets. Fair disclosure rules, such as Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) in the US, mandate that companies disseminate material non-public information broadly and simultaneously to all investors. This prevents select individuals from gaining an unfair advantage. Violating these rules can lead to significant penalties, including fines and legal action. Moreover, this investigation highlights the increasing convergence of traditional financial regulations with the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. As more mainstream companies embrace digital assets, the need for robust oversight against activities like crypto insider trading becomes paramount. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market and Investment Firms? This probe carries significant implications. For investment firms, it underscores the urgent need for stringent internal controls and clear communication policies regarding their crypto holdings and strategies. Compliance departments will need to be extra vigilant. For the broader crypto market, this regulatory action could be a double-edged sword. While it might initially create uncertainty, in the long run, it could foster greater investor confidence by signaling that authorities are serious about combating market manipulation. A transparent and fair market is essential for sustained growth and institutional adoption. Increased Scrutiny: Expect more regulatory attention on crypto-related announcements and trading patterns. Enhanced Compliance: Firms must review and strengthen their internal policies to prevent crypto insider trading . Investor Confidence: Stronger enforcement can lead to a more trusted market environment. Regulatory Clarity: This probe may pave the way for clearer guidelines on digital asset disclosures. Actionable Insights for Firms and Investors In this evolving landscape, vigilance is key. For firms with crypto treasury strategies, it’s vital to: Ensure strict adherence to fair disclosure rules. Implement robust internal trading policies. Educate employees on what constitutes material non-public information. Conduct regular audits of trading activities preceding major announcements. For investors, understanding these regulatory developments can help in making more informed decisions. It reinforces the importance of researching a company’s compliance practices and being aware of the broader regulatory environment. A Critical Juncture for Crypto Integrity The ongoing probe into crypto insider trading marks a critical juncture for the digital asset space. It signals a maturing market where traditional financial regulations are increasingly being applied to new technologies. While the full extent of this investigation is yet to unfold, its message is clear: transparency, fairness, and compliance are non-negotiable. As the crypto ecosystem continues to grow, such regulatory actions are essential steps toward building a more robust and trustworthy financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is crypto insider trading ? Crypto insider trading refers to the illegal practice of trading a company’s stock or related assets based on material, non-public information about its cryptocurrency treasury strategies or other crypto-related developments. This information is typically obtained through privileged access and gives an unfair advantage. Q2: Which regulatory bodies are involved in this probe? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) are the primary bodies conducting this investigation. Q3: Why are companies with ‘crypto treasury strategies’ being targeted? These companies are being targeted because their announcements of adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies have often been preceded by suspicious surges in their stock prices. This pattern suggests that non-public information might have been used for illicit trading. Q4: What are ‘fair disclosure rules’ and why are they important? Fair disclosure rules, like the SEC’s Regulation FD, require companies to disseminate material non-public information broadly and simultaneously to all investors. They are crucial for preventing selective disclosure and ensuring that all market participants have equal access to information, thus promoting a fair and level playing field. Q5: What are the potential consequences for firms found guilty of insider trading? Firms and individuals found guilty of insider trading can face severe penalties, including substantial fines, disgorgement of illicit gains, civil lawsuits, and even criminal charges, leading to imprisonment.

The overlapping signals, he argues, identify a well-defined take-profit band for XRP between roughly $8.43 and $13.58. “Four charts to rule them all,” he wrote, adding that the market is “clearly positioning itself for higher prices.” Four Charts Signal XRP $8.43–$13.58 Peak On the XRP/USD monthly chart, Bobby plots a multi-month consolidation which is built above “Base Camp 1” and, more recently, above “Base Camp 2.” The structure sits on top of a series of higher lows marked on the chart, with the consolidation developing after price reclaimed long-term moving-average clusters and the upper Bollinger band expanded. The Fibonacci extension grid anchored to the prior cycle shows 1.618 at approximately $5.26, 2.618 at about $8.43, 3.618 near $11.66, and 4.236 at roughly $13.58. Bobby labels the $8.43–$13.58 span as the “Take Profit Zone,” aligning it with the 2.618–4.236 extensions that capped previous euphoric runs on the same timeframe. Beneath the candles, the monthly momentum suite is turning higher: the RSI sits in a positive regime “preparing to initiate one final move toward overbought territory,” while stochastic and MACD lines have curled up from mid-range, consistent with trend continuation rather than exhaustion. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming As Axelar And Flare Target 8 Billion Tokens That price-based roadmap is cross-checked against XRP’s total market capitalization on the weekly timeframe. Here, Bobby highlights “price acceptance above the 2018 peak surrounded by skepticism and uncertainty” and annotates “over 300 days consolidating above 2018 highs.” The Fibonacci projection on market cap places the 1.618 extension near ~$210.7 billion, with a boxed “Take Profit Zone” parked just below the ultimate extension band and an overhead dashed guide around ~$13.00 that visually rhymes with the 4.236 price extension on the USD chart. The message of this pane is less about day-to-day candles and more about location: a lengthy basing and re-accumulation phase above a historic ceiling, which converts that ceiling into support and sets up measured-move targets. Macro risk appetite is addressed in the third panel via the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) on the monthly chart. “IWM 1M is firing on all cylinders, and new ATHs are inbound regardless of any short-term noise,” Bobby writes. The chart shows a strong bullish candle reclaiming the 0.786–0.886 retracement area and pressing back into the prior range top around $244–$252. Upside Fibonacci targets are mapped at 1.272 ~$267.1, 1.414 ~$278.9, and 1.618 ~$296.8. The RSI, stochastic oscillator, and MACD on this timeframe are all pointed higher, with Bobby calling the breakout candle “very telling,” the kind of multi-indicator alignment he says “occurs only a few times per decade.” The implication is that a risk-on tone in US small-caps historically pairs well with liquidity rotating into higher-beta crypto segments. Related Reading: Analyst Highlights 2 Scenarios That Sends XRP Price To $9.6 And $33 The final piece is Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) on the weekly chart. Bobby’s retracement panel measures the advance from ~38.9% to ~66.1% share and now shows BTC.D slipping beneath the 23.6% line (~59.7%) and hovering near the 38.2% (~55.5%). Notably, the BTC.D slipped below an ascending channel. Based on that, he draws a downward arrow toward the 50% level (~52.3%) and then into the 61.8% retracement (~49.1%), with a target rectangle in the mid-to-low-40s bracketed by the 78.6% (~45.9%) and 88.6% (~43.2%) levels. “BTC.D will inevitably initiate a move toward the mid to low 40% zone,” he writes. A decline in dominance of that magnitude typically coincides with capital rotating from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins—precisely the regime in which XRP has historically captured outsized relative performance. At press time, XRP traded at $2.84.

In it, they openly admit that developers made mistakes in the way the bridge was set up and managed. They also acknowledge that they initially didn’t make decentralization a priority. Now, they claim that addressing this issue and improving security are their primary objectives. Shibarium Bridge Security Update: Shiba Inu Devs Accept Responsibility In the latest update , Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya explains that the project’s leadership holds full responsibility for validator key management. She also admits that the team did not prioritize decentralization during the early stages of the bridge, a choice the developers now call a mistake and are working to correct immediately. The team is actively reinforcing Shibarium’s bridge controls and custody policies to prevent similar issues from occurring again. The compromised validators included internal ones, and while a full forensic review is still underway, the possible attack paths include a cloud breach, a compromised developer device, or a supply-chain weakness. The update revealed validator signing keys were in AWS Key Management Service, with limited use on developer machines for administrative tasks. It also provides operational context, noting that each validator held approximately 10,000 BONE in self-delegation, and the team never utilized the rewards from these validators. To increase transparency, the Shibarium bridge security update includes a detailed FAQ section that directly addresses the validator compromise. It clarifies that all answers reflect the team’s current understanding and may evolve as forensic analysis and third-party reviews continue. By sharing these details openly, the Shiba Inu developers are showing that they are not avoiding the Shibarium bridge issue but instead are confronting it directly. Roadmap Forward: Stronger Decentralization And Security With the security review underway, the Shiba Inu developers are now focusing on how to strengthen Shibarium for the long term. In the update, Kaal Dhairya said decentralization will no longer be an afterthought. The network, which had leaned too much on internal validators, will now open up to professional operators and trusted applicants. Dhairya explained that developer recruitment now includes government ID checks and verification through a recognized HR platform, steps that guarantee only trusted individuals can handle sensitive parts of the network. At the end of the update, they made their priorities clear – to protect users, secure the network, contain the attacker, and bring services back online safely. They note that decentralization has always been at the core of Shibarium’s roadmap. Still, early validator applicants refused to complete KYC, and outreach to professional operators failed to progress, which delayed the process. That setback forced the Shiba Inu team to rely on internal validators, a choice they now regret and commit to correcting by expanding validator decentralization , introducing stricter key-rotation rules, and improving custody solutions.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium network|Shibarium news|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 23:00:28

The meme coin faces a decisive moment that could spark a deeper correction or mark a buy-the-dip opportunity. Whales appear to be betting on the latter. Over the past week, the top 100 BONK wallets have deepened their holdings by 3.80 trillion tokens, according to Nansen data . Top 100 Bonk wallets accumulate alongside price decline. Source: Nansen. This show of conviction comes as market narratives continue to favor a Q4 bull run. Rex-Osprey, the issuer behind the first Dogecoin spot ETF, may have a clear shot at a first Bonk spot ETF under new SEC generic listing standards to fast-track crypto ETP approvals. And with U.S. inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for further interest rate cuts are strengthening, fuelling risk-on sentiment and capital rotation into more speculative plays like Bonk.

The current retest of psychological support at $0.000019 marks the final barrier to a breakdown of Bonk’s 6-month support trendline and a wider ascending broadening wedge pattern. BONK / USDT 12-hour chart, ascending broadening wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators lean toward a bounce. The RSI is approaching the oversold threshold at 30, a level that often marks local bottoms as sellers reach exhaustion. The MACD histogram shows a similar shift, reversing toward the signal line in what could be the early stages of a golden cross, signaling a potential new uptrend. If the wedge’s lower boundary holds as a launchpad, the next upward move could target a retest of its upper resistance. That would put the $0.0001 level back in focus, a potential 425% gain from current levels . Still, resistance levels like the $0.00004075 July high and Bonk’s $0.000062 all-time high stand as critical hurdles. To flip them to support, fresh demand catalysts such as U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approvals will likely be necessary to sustain the rally into 2026. History Says This Bull Run Could Deliver Bonk’s Successor – the Market Has Already Spoken With this breakout setup, Bonk continues to demonstrate a trend: the strongest social momentum lies with Doge-branded tokens. It all started with Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. Every bull run eventually delivers its own parabolic Doge-themed runner. Now, early momentum is pointing to Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the next in line. Maxi Doge blends a no-utility ethos with gym-culture satire and trader degeneracy, positioning itself as more than just a meme coin—it’s a lifestyle asset. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has already pulled in close to $2.5 million in its initial weeks, with early backers locking in a massive 134% APY through staking rewards. You can take part in the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale now on the official website . With exchange listings coming soon, now could be the best opportunity to get involved early.

This aggressive move suggests the company believes the market is undervaluing its position – and that sentiment could extend to DOGE, especially as institutional exposure to mining grows.

The firm recently acquired DogeHash Technologies, a Dogecoin miner that will own 3,500 rigs by the end of the year. In addition, Thumzup owns 19 Bitcoin (BTC) tokens and 7.5 million DOGE worth approximately $1.7 million. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Market Retests Key Trend Line Support Today’s price action has pushed DOGE to retest a key trend line support that could be decisive in determining the asset’s trajectory in the next few days. This key demand zone aligns with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), making it a critical area for buyers to defend. A strong bounce here could ignite a move toward $0.29, while a breakout above the rising wedge formation shown in the chart would confirm a bullish Dogecoin price prediction – with $0.40 as the first major target, and a potential run to $1 if momentum accelerates. Institutional backing from firms like Thumzup, combined with the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, are adding fuel to the fire, setting the stage for DOGE to shine this cycle. Meanwhile, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could deliver even greater upside. With nearly $2.5 million raised so far, this project is building serious traction and could be the next breakout star. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Presale Unleashes Leverage-Powered Meme Trading Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin that draws inspiration from the popular Doge meme. Maxi Doge taps into a familiar cultural reference that already resonates with the crypto community. The presale has seen early traction, surpassing $2.4 million just a few weeks after its launch . What sets $MAXI apart is its focus on leveraged trading and capturing the market’s hype. Through the Maxi Fund, the project will devote up to 25% of the proceeds raised via the presale to make leveraged bets on the most promising tokens of the cycle. Partnerships with several crypto news aggregators will increase the token’s visibility, and buyers will reap the highest returns once it is listed on exchanges. To buy $MAXI, simply head to the Maxi Doge website and link a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap crypto for this meme coin or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

One of the most pressing issues gaining attention is crypto conflicts of interest . Recently, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced a pivotal move to address these very concerns, aiming to establish clear regulatory standards. This initiative comes amid heightened scrutiny, particularly concerning the cryptocurrency dealings of influential figures and their families. The goal is simple yet crucial: to safeguard market integrity and protect investors from potential abuses arising from undisclosed or unmanaged interests. What Exactly Are Crypto Conflicts of Interest ? At its core, a conflict of interest arises when an individual or entity has competing professional or personal interests. In the crypto space, this could mean: An exchange owner also trading on their own platform with insider knowledge. A project founder promoting their token while holding a significant, undisclosed stake. Regulators or policymakers having financial ties to crypto businesses they oversee. These situations can create an unfair advantage, erode trust, and potentially lead to market manipulation. Chairman Atkins, speaking at Georgetown University’s Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy conference, emphasized the SEC’s commitment. He stated that the agency will “root out” any such situations uncovered and “set clear standards.” Why Is Addressing These Conflicts So Crucial Now? The digital asset market has matured rapidly, attracting significant investment and mainstream attention. However, this growth also amplifies the risks associated with unchecked conflicts. When key players operate without transparent guidelines, it undermines the very principles of fair and open markets. Consider the potential impact: Investor Protection: Unscrupulous practices can lead to significant financial losses for everyday investors. Market Integrity: Undisclosed interests can distort market prices and create an uneven playing field. Public Trust: A lack of clear rules erodes confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, potentially hindering its long-term adoption and growth. The SEC’s proactive stance on crypto conflicts of interest is a direct response to these growing concerns, signaling a move towards greater accountability. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Regulating Crypto Conflicts of Interest ? Regulating the crypto space is notoriously complex due to its global, decentralized, and often pseudonymous nature. Establishing clear rules for conflicts of interest presents unique hurdles: Jurisdictional Issues: Crypto businesses often operate across borders, making it challenging to apply a single set of rules. Anonymity/Pseudonymity: Identifying beneficial owners and their diverse interests can be difficult. Rapid Innovation: New crypto products and services emerge constantly, often outpacing regulatory frameworks. Despite these challenges, the SEC’s intent is to create adaptable and robust standards. The goal is not to stifle innovation but to foster a healthier, more transparent environment where participants can operate with confidence. What Will New Standards for Crypto Conflicts of Interest Look Like? While the specifics are yet to be detailed, we can anticipate new standards focusing on transparency and disclosure. This might involve: Mandatory disclosure requirements for crypto project founders, exchange operators, and key influencers regarding their holdings and related business interests. Stricter ethical guidelines for individuals involved in crypto regulation and policy-making. Enhanced enforcement mechanisms to penalize non-compliance and deter future conflicts. These measures aim to create a level playing field, ensuring that all participants, from large institutions to individual investors, can engage in the crypto market with greater assurance. A Path Towards Greater Transparency The SEC’s commitment to addressing crypto conflicts of interest marks a significant step towards a more mature and trustworthy digital asset landscape. By setting clear standards, the agency aims to mitigate risks, enhance investor protection, and foster sustainable growth within the crypto ecosystem. This move is not just about enforcement; it’s about building a foundation of trust. As the crypto market continues to evolve, transparent and fair practices will be paramount for its long-term success. All stakeholders, from innovators to investors, stand to benefit from a clearer, more equitable regulatory environment.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a conflict of interest in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: A conflict of interest in crypto occurs when an individual or entity has competing interests—personal or professional—that could improperly influence their actions or decisions in the digital asset market, potentially for personal gain and at the expense of others. Q2: Why is the SEC addressing crypto conflicts of interest now? A2: The SEC is addressing these conflicts due to the rapid growth of the crypto market, increased investor participation, and growing controversies surrounding undisclosed interests of prominent figures. The aim is to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Q3: Who is Paul Atkins, and what is his role in this initiative? A3: Paul Atkins is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has announced the agency’s intention to establish clear regulatory standards to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest within the cryptocurrency sector. Q4: How might new regulations on crypto conflicts of interest benefit investors? A4: New regulations are expected to benefit investors by increasing transparency, reducing the potential for market manipulation, and ensuring a fairer playing field. This fosters greater trust and reduces the risks associated with undisclosed or unethical practices. Q5: Will these new rules stifle innovation in the crypto space? A5: The SEC’s stated goal is not to stifle innovation but to create a more secure and transparent environment. By setting clear boundaries, the rules aim to build a foundation of trust that can support sustainable and responsible innovation in the long term. Did you find this article insightful?

So I cried when I heard the court ruling.” Hunminjeongeum was Hwang’s own one-person entertainment agency, a company she owned in its entirety. The court heard that was found that Hwang Jung-eum invested most of the money she embezzled in cryptoassets. Prosecutors also explained that she also used money from her agency’s accounts to pay her credit card bills, and settle her property tax and local tax bills. The prosecution had asked the court to jail Hwang for three years during an August hearing . Prosecutors did not say whether they would seek to appeal the district court’s verdict. Hwang’s legal team noted that she had admitted to all the charges and had repaid the funds in two installments, on May 30 and June 5 this year.

The judge said that it had taken the fact that it was Hwang’s first offense into consideration. The presiding judge also concluded that the damages were “only limited to the defendant,” and noted that she had “repaid the entire amount of money she had embezzled.” Hwang, a former member of the South Korean pop group Sugar, made her small-screen breakthrough in the late 2000s when she appeared in the MBC sitcom High Kick Through The Roof.

With deadlines approaching in October and November, speculation is rising on how XRP’s price could respond if approvals are granted. Industry Braces for Wave of ETF Approvals A new report from Reuters revealed that the SEC has advanced work on its revised ETF rules, setting the stage for the first decisions within weeks. Market analysts expect multiple products, including those for XRP and Solana , to be among the earliest candidates for approval. Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital, confirmed that nearly a dozen applications have already been submitted, reflecting growing anticipation of rapid launches once the SEC finalizes its stance. He added that the sector is preparing for a significant influx of ETF products. The groundwork for these filings began in July, when the SEC initially introduced the updated standards. Since then, fund managers have revised documents and responded to regulatory inquiries. According to people familiar with the process, one last round of amendments is expected before the final review. Bitwise president Teddy Fusaro also noted that most applications have progressed deep into the review process and that the SEC’s adjustments have aligned with what firms had been anticipating. XRP ETFs Could Be Among the First Approved ETF analyst Nate Geraci, co-founder of The ETF Institute, stated that final submissions are expected by the end of this week. He confirmed that several spot ETFs linked to XRP are already well advanced in the process, describing the situation as entering its final countdown phase. Chad Steingraber, a developer and XRP advocate, shared this view, predicting that approvals could arrive soon after the last submissions are filed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Pending applications include products from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, CoinShares, WisdomTree, Canary Capital, and Franklin Templeton. The SEC’s earliest deadline for a decision is October 18, with later rulings extending into mid-November. At present, XRP trades around $2.75. Some analysts argue that the current price already reflects optimism surrounding the ETF discussions, leaving uncertainty about how much of an additional rally might occur once official decisions are made. Potential Price Impact if Approved If spot ETFs tied to XRP are approved, analysts expect the token could benefit from institutional inflows and greater regulatory legitimacy. In a recent assessment, Google’s Gemini chatbot suggested that XRP could rise into the $5 to $7 range, referencing the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum following their ETF approvals. The chatbot highlighted two key drivers: the entry of professional investors seeking managed exposure to XRP, and the credibility boost that would come from SEC recognition of an ETF product. However, the analysis also included a cautionary note. Markets often react with a “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern, in which initial gains are followed by profit-taking and heightened volatility. The long-term outcome for XRP would likely depend on whether ETFs attract sustained inflows rather than short-lived speculation. With the SEC’s decision window approaching, the digital asset industry is closely watching the fate of the pending XRP ETF applications. While approval could support a sharp price increase and expand institutional participation, short-term reactions may vary. For now, XRP investors await clarity on whether October will mark a turning point for the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the New York Times, the company wants the ruling paused while it appeals, warning that if the changes go into effect on October 22, its entire Android ecosystem will take a serious hit. In their words, the company and platform “will suffer irreparable harm.” This all started with a case filed by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, who accused Alphabet’s Google of blocking competition by locking developers into the Google Play Store and paying companies to keep it that way. A jury agreed with Epic in December 2023, saying Google crossed the line by cutting secret deals with major phone makers and developers to stop them from using other app stores or billing tools. Following that verdict, Judge James Donato in San Francisco ruled that Google needed to open the gates and stop shutting out its rivals. Google says Android will suffer if mandate kicks in In July 2024, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals backed the jury and ruled that Google has to lift restrictions that block app developers from setting up their own marketplaces and payment systems. The court said developers deserve the right to run their businesses without being locked into Google’s ecosystem. Google didn’t take it lightly. The company said the ruling would “significantly harm user safety” and “undermine innovation for Android.” Epic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, responded by calling the decision a big win and said it would finally allow Epic to offer its Epic Games Store on Android through Google Play. With Google now running to the highest court, it’s trying to freeze everything before that October deadline hits. The filing hasn’t shown up on the Supreme Court’s website, but the company’s message is clear: if the order isn’t blocked, Android users and developers are going to lose out—at least according to Google. But this fight with Epic isn’t the only legal storm the company’s in. Google is also staring down another penalty in Europe, where regulators under the European Commission are preparing to hit the company with its first fine under the Digital Markets Act. The law took effect in 2023 and was built specifically to rein in Big Tech and give competitors a fair shot. It lays out what massive platforms can and cannot do. Break those rules, and companies can be fined up to 10% of global yearly revenue. Google faces second EU penalty as Commission reviews case The upcoming fine is separate from the €2.95 billion (about $3.45 billion) penalty Google already got earlier this month. That fine was for favoring its own display ad technology and giving its ad exchange, AdX, more power at the expense of rival ad services and publishers. But the next charge focuses on Google’s treatment of vertical search engines, specifically how Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels were promoted over other travel and shopping platforms. The complaint was first filed in March 2024. Since then, Google has submitted multiple proposals to try and fix things, but airline companies, hotel chains, retail sites, and comparison tools said nothing has really changed. The Commission isn’t commenting, but Google pointed to comments made earlier by its Senior Director for Competition, Oliver Bethell, who said, “While we have invited feedback throughout this process, we now need to bring this debate to an end without the interests of a few being prioritised over the millions of people and businesses in Europe who benefit from Search.” Even with growing pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration over Europe’s crackdown on American tech, the EU Commission has no intention of stepping back. Officials say they’ll keep holding companies accountable, even if it stirs up more trade tension between the U.S. and the 27-nation bloc. If the fine under the DMA moves forward, Google would become the third American tech company punished under the law—following Apple and Meta Platforms, who were both hit with penalties in April.

Despite launching with major hype, Pi (PI) has struggled to live up to expectations, crashing by 91% from its all-time high of $2.98 set back in February. This wallet’s aggressive accumulation suggests it may be operating on privileged information or strong insider conviction. According to Pi Scan, wallet GASWBDODM currently holds 383.3 million PI , worth around $103 million – making it the 7th largest Pi holder overall, ahead of major exchanges like Gate.io and Bitget . Even more intriguing, this whale added 6.3 million PI tokens to their stack in the past week alone, signaling continued confidence despite the wider market’s retreat. The identity of GASWBD[…]ODM remains a mystery, but its positioning has sparked widespread speculation. Could this investor have early access to Pi’s roadmap, insider knowledge of an exchange listing, or an upcoming ecosystem update? Whatever the case, it adds serious weight to the bullish Pi Coin price prediction thesis – especially if other large players start following suit. Pi Coin Price Prediction: 26% Downside Risk If PI Fails to Break Above $0.30 Pi has rebounded slightly after hitting a new all-time low near $0.22 , consolidating around $0.26 in recent sessions. However, continued market weakness could drag the token back toward last week’s lows. On the 4-hour chart , the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is beginning to show signs of recovery, hinting that Pi Coin might attempt a retest of the $0.30 mark. Still, unless the token break out from its current downtrend decisively, the overall setup continues to support a bearish outlook. If bearish momentum accelerates, the $0.20 level becomes a likely target – implying a 26% downside risk from current levels. Rather than holding underperforming tokens this cycle, many traders are turning their focus to high-upside presales showing strong momentum. One standout is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a new project that enables users to build virtual mining rigs and earn crypto. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Turns Crypto Mining Into a Rewarding Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) lets users build their own virtual meme coin mining rig. You can buy nodes, build server rooms, and earn more crypto by building more rigs. The game leverages the popularity of the Pepe meme and combines it with an innovative virtual mining model that consists of buying and upgrading rigs to climb the leaderboard. Buyers will use $PEPENODE to set up and boost their mining operation while competing for attractive rewards, like airdrops of top meme coins like Pepe ($PEPE) and Bonk ($BONK). Every upgrade performed to a node adds a deflationary twist: 70% of the tokens spent on improving rigs are burned permanently, reducing the circulating supply as the community expands. As the game gains popularity, the demand for $PEPENODE could skyrocket. To buy $PEPENODE at its presale price, visit the official Pepenode website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap crypto or use a bank card to get started.

The recovered funds came from global operations to crack down on cybercrime, which claimed $40.9B in illegal crypto funds last year. The operation, codenamed HAECHI VI, involved law enforcement agencies from 40 countries across multiple continents between April and August 2025, targeting seven major categories of financial cybercrime: investment fraud, romance scams, phishing , money laundering linked to online gambling, sextortion, e-commerce fraud, and business email compromise schemes. Interpol has recovered $97M in crypto Interpol has announced the recovery of $439M in criminal proceeds following a multinational operation targeting cyber financial crimes. Among the seized assets were $97M in cryptocurrencies and physical property. Authorities blocked more than 68,000 bank accounts and froze nearly 400 cryptocurrency wallets as part of the operation. From the seized wallets alone, investigators recovered around $16M in illegal digital assets. In Portugal, the police dismantled a syndicate accused of siphoning funds from social security accounts intended for vulnerable families. Forty-five suspects were arrested, and losses amounting to $270,000 were traced back to 531 victims. In Thailand , the Royal Thai Police officers seized $6.6M in stolen assets linked to a transnational business email compromise scheme that tricked a Japanese corporation into transferring funds to a fraudulent Bangkok-based entity. The network was allegedly run by Thai and West African nationals. Other notable successes involved the recovery of $3.91M in the United Arab Emirates. Investigators retrieved the funds after a Korean steel company identified forged shipping documents and flagged the fraudulent transfer. The stop was made possible through Interpol’s Global Rapid Intervention of Payments (I-GRIP) system. This mechanism enables law enforcement agencies to freeze criminal proceeds in real time. Global efforts against cybercrime Aside from Europe and Asia, African nations have also intensified cybercrime enforcement. Earlier in 2025, authorities across 18 African countries and the United Kingdom conducted Operation Serengeti 2.0, which led to 1,209 arrests and the recovery of $97.4M. Criminal infrastructures, such as 25 illegal crypto mining centers in Angola and a $300M online investment scam in Zambia, were also dismantled. A separate operation, Operation Red Card, conducted between November 2024 and February 2025, resulted in 306 arrests across seven African nations. Nigerian authorities arrested 130 suspects, including foreign nationals, who were allegedly involved in cyber-enabled investment and casino fraud. South Africa and Zambia also reported large-scale arrests connected to SIM box fraud and malware-driven scams, respectively. “While many people believe that funds lost to fraud and scams are often irretrievable, the outcomes of HAECHI operations demonstrate that recovery is indeed possible,” Theos Badege, the Director pro tempore of Interpol’s Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre, said. Lee Jun Hyeong, the head of South Korea’s Interpol National Central Bureau, also noted that the country has played a leading role in international cooperation. “Operation HAECHI has time and again demonstrated the power of unified global action in eradicating cyber-enabled financial crime,” he said. Experts have also pointed out that cryptocurrencies have accelerated the globalization of financial crime. Phil Larratt, the Director of Investigations at Chainalysis, stressed the effectiveness of cross-border partnerships. He cited Operation Destabilise, which is a joint effort by the UK, France, and the U.S. that dismantled a Russian money laundering network and resulted in $25.5M in cryptocurrency getting recovered. “These outcomes are only possible when governments, regulators and private companies share intelligence and act together,” he added.

Brussels regulators said they want to check if SAP has been playing unfair when it comes to helping customers who use its business management software installed on company computers. The probe will look at “whether SAP may have distorted competition in the aftermarket for maintenance and support services related to an on-premises type of software, licensed by SAP, used for the management of companies’ business operations,” the Commission said. SAP pushed back Thursday, saying its way of doing business follows EU rules. “However, we take the issues raised seriously and we are working closely with the EU Commission to resolve them,” a spokesperson said. “We do not anticipate the engagement with the European Commission to result in material impacts on our financial performance.” The company is worth almost 282 billion euros ($331 billion), making it one of Europe’s biggest companies by value. Its shares fell 2% by 12:45 p.m. in London (7:45 a.m. ET) Thursday. The case centers on its Enterprise Resource Planning software, called ERP for short. Big companies use ERP to handle their money and accounting work day to day. The company has a big chunk of this market, but isn’t the only player – Microsoft and Oracle also sell ERP products. The Commission is looking specifically at the “on-prem” version of SAP ERP. This means software that sits on a company’s own servers, not the cloud version that gets accessed through the firm’s remote data centers. SAP still makes a lot of money from on-prem IT services. But the company has been trying for years to get more customers using cloud services instead. This push comes as SAP battles tech heavyweights like Microsoft and Amazon, who run most of the public cloud market. This EU investigation is different because it doesn’t go after Big Tech. Most of the bloc’s competition work has targeted powerful American tech companies. This has upset both tech firms and US politicians, who say American companies get picked on unfairly. Wednesday, Apple asked for the Digital Markets Act – the EU’s big digital competition law – to be scrapped, saying it was “leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU.” SAP is partnering with OpenAI and AWS Based on an earlier report by Cryptopolitan , SAP announced new deals with OpenAI and Amazon Web Services to grow its “digital sovereignty” services for European governments. The company will work with OpenAI to bring AI services like ChatGPT to Germany’s government workers. The project, called “OpenAI for Germany,” will run through the company’s Delos Cloud, which keeps data stored locally under European laws. SAP and Amazon.com Inc. also said the German company will offer its sovereign cloud service through AWS. Several European countries are rushing to build their own “sovereign” AI services because officials and business leaders worry about Europe losing control of this key technology. SAP has said it will spend around €20 billion ($23.5 billion) on its sovereign services. These partnership announcements come as the company faces regulatory heat, showing how software companies must deal with both government oversight and fast-changing technology demands in Europe.

Reminder to Eligible Users Cardano community member Rick McCracken issued a notice on social media earlier today, pointing out that the claim window for NIGHT tokens is closing soon. A screenshot shared with the post showed just over 10 days remaining before the first phase of claims officially ends. The claim portal, launched on August 5, made NIGHT tokens available to 33.6 million eligible addresses spread across eight supported blockchains. These include Cardano, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Basic Attention Token, and BNB Chain. (1/3) 10 days left to claim Cardano $NIGHT tokens! If you hold $BTC , $ETH , $AVAX , $SOL , $BNB , $BAT , $XRP or $ADA on their native chains, you may be eligible. Claim here https://t.co/Vrl26vLyu5 List of supported chains, wallets & HW in next post pic.twitter.com/RLHSU4sski — Rick McCracken DIGI (@RichardMcCrackn) September 24, 2025 According to the distribution plan, 50% of the total supply was reserved for Cardano users, while Bitcoin holders received 20%. The remaining 30% was divided among the other six networks, including XRP Ledger . Although some participants initially reported technical difficulties when the process began, the Midnight team confirmed that most of those issues have since been resolved, ensuring smoother access for claimants. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has provided several updates on claim activity since the portal went live. On August 19, he revealed that more than 69,000 addresses across the supported blockchains had successfully claimed around 1.32 billion NIGHT tokens, equal to 5.5% of the 24 billion total supply. At that time, Cardano users represented the largest share of claims at 61.3%, while Bitcoin and XRP holders accounted for 19.43% and 5.72%, respectively. By August 23, Hoskinson confirmed that over 70,000 participants had claimed more than 1.6 billion NIGHT tokens in total. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Next Phases of the Airdrop The initial phase of the distribution, known as the Glacier Drop , will close on October 4 at 12:00 p.m. UTC. Once this stage concludes, Midnight will move directly into its second phase, titled the Scavenger Mine. During this stage, which will run for 30 days, users will be able to earn shares of unclaimed NIGHT tokens by completing specific computational tasks. Afterward, a third stage called the Lost and Found phase will allow users who missed earlier deadlines another opportunity to claim tokens. Any remaining supply after these rounds will be directed to the project’s treasury. Importantly, tokens that are successfully claimed will not be distributed in one lump sum. Instead, beneficiaries will receive their allocation in four equal installments of 25%, spread across one year. With only 10 days left before the Glacier Drop ends, eligible XRP, Cardano, and other blockchain users are encouraged to complete their claims promptly. Missing this window will mean waiting for later phases, where the conditions and rewards may differ from the current allocation system.

Despite its struggle to decisively break above the $3 mark, XRP is now forming a Falling Wedge pattern that signals the potential for a powerful breakout by October. Falling Wedge Signals XRP Breakout By October In a recent XRP price analysis, published on Monday, Dark Defender noted that the third-largest cryptocurrency has once again respected its key support levels at $2.85, despite being rejected at $3.13. The XRP price tapped into the primary support trendline, highlighted in orange on the chart, which has consistently held as a structural base. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Definitely Reach $10,000, Gives Reasons Why Importantly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is edging closer to oversold territory, a signal often associated with potential price reversals. While skepticism spreads across the market, Dark Defender insists that the XRP bullish structure remains intact and that disbelief itself is a sign that many could be caught off guard by what’s to come. The analyst notes that the cryptocurrency has been consolidating within a Falling Wedge pattern between July and September. According to him, October could be the month when XRP finally breaks free from the wedge and delivers a rally strong enough to surprise the broader market. Building on this momentum, Dark Defender has forecasted three potential price targets for XRP by October: $4.17, $4.92, and $5.85. These levels correspond to upper Fibonacci Extension zones, specifically 261.8%, 361.8%, and 236.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, XRP has its closest supports set at $2.80 and $2.64, ensuring a strong base for the projected Falling Wedge breakout. XRP Bullish Run Just Starting Following his earlier predictions, Dark Defender further reinforced his bullish case by asserting that XRP has not begun its true rally. He suggested a power shift is underway, hinting that what the market has seen so far is only the beginning of a larger bullish wave. Related Reading: Analyst Unveils 3-Month Prediction For Bitcoin, XRP, And Dogecoin – It’s Very Bullish This perspective arrives at a time when XRP has already delivered a remarkable performance in 2025. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the cryptocurrency has gained 384% Year-to-Date, a surge fueled by increasing demand, rumors of a potential XRP ETF, and renewed confidence after the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. With XRP reaching a high of $3.65 earlier this year and trading just over 5% shy of reclaiming its former all-time high of $3.84, Dark Defender remains certain that the asset’s real growth is still ahead. Based on this view, the recent pullback below $3 is not seen as a weakness, but rather as a consolidation phase before the next leg higher. He highlighted that XRP is nearing the end of this corrective ABCDE consolidation phase and preparing for a lift-off. According to his chart analysis, once the cryptocurrency reclaims the $3.33 level, it could pave the way for double-digit prices.

52266715,589282,1758844823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52266715.jpeg,"Liquid Staking Debuts On XRP Ledger, What mXRP Means For Investors",https://bitcoinist.com/liquid-staking-debuts-on-mxrp/,"Midas, in partnership with Axelar, has launched the first XRP liquid staking token, mXRP. The token will provide investors with yields from the XRP DeFi ecosystem and further expand the altcoin’s utility. XRP Liquid Staking Token Launches Midas revealed that the mXRP liquid staking token will be issued on the XRP Ledger EVM via the Axelar bridge, which also facilitates the transfer of the token to the Ledger. The tokenization platform noted that this is a first-of-its-kind tokenized exposure product, offering meaningful XRP-denominated yield strategies. The token is expected to provide an APY of up to 8% for holders, although Axelar indicated it could reach 10%. In an X post , Panek Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, which offers the token on the Ledger, broke down key details about the liquid staking token. He explained that token is a yield-bearing version of XRP that generates yields for its holders. As such, the price of mXRP should continuously grow against the XRP price and trade at a premium. Panek further stated that the yield comes from various strategies, including lending, market making, and depositing on DeFi protocols , among others. He noted that asset managers first lock XRP and then borrow against it in stablecoins, using the capital for various strategies to generate profits. The Anodos Finance co-founder also clarified that investors simply need to hold the staking token to claim their yields or redeem their XRP. He added that holders of the liquid staking token do not receive extra tokens. Instead, the yield and rewards are automatically added and embedded into mXRP’s value. Panek noted that token works similarly to other liquid staking tokens , such as stETH, jitoSOL, and sAVAX, meaning that those looking to get yields from it have to buy the asset and hold it. They can do this by selling XRP or adding new capital to buy the token. What mXRP Means For XRP Panek indicated that the launch of mXRP is beneficial for XRP, as it will add constant buying pressure to the altcoin. He noted that Midas and Axelar said that the goal is to become a perpetual buyer of XRP. Meanwhile, every XRP used to mint mXRP is locked, thereby removing it from circulation. Flare Network also recently announced the launch of ‘FXRP’ to expand XRP’s DeFi. Panek noted that mXRP and FXRP are slightly different, but ultimately, both are beneficial for XRP and the XRP Ledger. mXRP’s capital is managed by asset managers who generate yield on behalf of investors. At the same time, FXRP is a trustless version of XRP on the Flare network, which doesn’t inherently generate yield but can be used in DeFi protocols to generate yields. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $2.84, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Anodos Finance|Axelar Bridge|Coinmarketcap|DeFi|Flare Network|FXRP|jitoSOL|Panek Mekras|ripple|sAVAX|stETH|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BUSINESS|FLR,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 00:00:23

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has taken a significant dive, plummeting 16 points from yesterday to a concerning reading of 28. This sharp drop firmly places market sentiment in the ""Fear"" stage, according to data from Alternative. For many investors, this number can be a stark indicator of prevailing uncertainty and anxiety. But what exactly does this index tell us, and how should we interpret such a low reading? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Drives It? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful barometer of market psychology. It gauges investor sentiment on a scale from 0 (representing extreme fear) to 100 (signifying extreme optimism). Understanding its components helps us grasp the bigger picture: Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum, comparing it with average values. Low volume in a downtrend can indicate fear. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and mentions, assessing their sentiment and engagement. Increased negative sentiment can contribute to fear. Surveys (15%): Gathers weekly sentiment surveys from thousands of crypto investors (currently paused, but historically a component). Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance of Bitcoin often signals fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in ""Bitcoin price manipulation"" or ""crypto crash"" searches indicates fear. When the index registers a low number like 28, it clearly reflects widespread investor apprehension. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a significant shift indicating that many market participants are feeling uncertain about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. Why Does a Low Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matter for Your Portfolio? A reading of 28 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just an abstract metric; it has real implications for your investment decisions. When fear grips the market, several common behaviors emerge: Panic Selling: Investors, driven by fear, might sell off their holdings to avoid further losses, exacerbating price declines. Reduced Buying Pressure: New money often stays on the sidelines, waiting for clearer signals, leading to lower trading volumes and slower recovery. Increased Volatility: Emotional trading can lead to sharper price swings, making the market even more unpredictable. However, it’s crucial to remember that fear in the market can also present unique opportunities. Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries. Savvy investors sometimes view these times as chances to accumulate assets at lower prices, following the old adage: ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" Navigating Market Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index deep in the ""Fear"" zone, what should you do? Reacting emotionally is often detrimental. Instead, consider these strategies: Revisit Your Investment Thesis: Remind yourself why you invested in certain assets. Has the fundamental value changed, or is it just market sentiment? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Focusing on the long-term potential rather than daily fluctuations can help you weather downturns. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Keep an eye on reliable news and data, but avoid constant monitoring that can lead to emotional decisions. The current reading of 28 should serve as a prompt for caution and strategic thinking, not panic. It’s a moment to assess, plan, and potentially act with a clear head. What’s Next for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and the Market? While the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals significant apprehension, market sentiment is dynamic. It can shift rapidly based on news, regulatory developments, or major price movements. A sustained period of low fear could indicate a capitulation phase, where most weak hands have exited, potentially paving the way for a recovery. Conversely, continued negative news or price drops could push the index even lower, into ""Extreme Fear."" Monitoring this index, alongside other fundamental and technical indicators, can provide a more holistic view of the market’s health and potential direction. It serves as a reminder that emotional biases often play a huge role in financial markets, and understanding them is key to making rational decisions. Summary: Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The recent drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 28 is a clear signal of heightened fear in the cryptocurrency market. This index, powered by factors like volatility, trading volume, and social media sentiment, provides a crucial snapshot of investor psychology. While fear can lead to panic selling and increased volatility, it also historically presents opportunities for long-term investors. By adopting a disciplined approach, focusing on risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can navigate these challenging times effectively. Remember, understanding market sentiment is a powerful tool, but it should always be combined with sound research and a well-defined investment strategy.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods of rapid growth for various assets. Recently, a significant shift has caught the attention of many investors: the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, has taken a notable dip. Falling three points from yesterday, the index now stands at 69. This movement isn’t just a number; it signals a potential change in the prevailing market winds, moving away from a strong altcoin dominance. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the crypto world, understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental. CoinMarketCap developed this index to provide a clear snapshot of market performance. It helps investors determine whether the current period favors altcoins or Bitcoin. How does it work? It meticulously compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when 75% of these top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin during that specific timeframe. A score closer to 100 indicates a much stronger and more pervasive altcoin trend. Conversely, a lower score, especially one like 69, suggests that Bitcoin might be regaining its footing or that altcoins are broadly underperforming relative to the crypto king. Understanding the Current Dip in the Altcoin Season Index The recent three-point drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 69 is a significant event. While 69 is still above the 75 threshold for a full “altcoin season,” the downward trend is what truly matters. This movement implies that fewer altcoins, among the top 100, are currently outperforming Bitcoin compared to previous days. What could be driving this? Market Rotation: Often, after periods of strong altcoin gains, investors rotate profits back into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven, or even into stablecoins. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin itself might be experiencing a resurgence, attracting capital away from altcoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to favor less volatile assets within crypto, often meaning Bitcoin. It’s vital to remember that the crypto market is highly interconnected. A shift in the Altcoin Season Index can reflect a complex interplay of various factors, from specific project news to global economic sentiment. How Does This Affect Your Crypto Portfolio and Strategy? A falling Altcoin Season Index prompts investors to re-evaluate their strategies. If you’ve been heavily invested in altcoins, this might be a signal to: Review Your Holdings: Assess the performance of your individual altcoin assets. Are they still strong performers, or are they lagging behind Bitcoin? Consider Rebalancing: You might consider rebalancing your portfolio to increase your Bitcoin exposure, especially if you anticipate further Bitcoin dominance. Research New Opportunities: While some altcoins might be struggling, others could still present unique opportunities. Always do your due diligence. Conversely, for those with a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio, a lower Altcoin Season Index could be seen as validation of a more conservative approach. However, even during “Bitcoin season,” specific altcoins can still deliver impressive gains due to unique developments or strong community support. The key is never to rely solely on one metric but to use it as part of a broader analytical framework. Navigating the Shifting Tides: Actionable Insights from the Altcoin Season Index Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is just the first step. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these shifting market tides: Stay Informed: Regularly check the index and other market indicators. Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. Diversify Wisely: Even if the index suggests a Bitcoin season, a well-diversified portfolio that includes a mix of strong altcoins and Bitcoin can mitigate risks. Long-Term Vision: Short-term fluctuations are common. A long-term investment strategy, based on fundamental analysis of projects, often yields better results than reacting to every index movement. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits when appropriate. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin is a continuous narrative. While the Altcoin Season Index provides a valuable snapshot, it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Smart investors use such tools to inform, not dictate, their decisions, always prioritizing research and a balanced approach. In conclusion, the recent three-point drop in CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index to 69 serves as a timely reminder of the market’s ebb and flow. It signals a potential recalibration where Bitcoin might be asserting more dominance over a broader range of altcoins. For investors, this isn’t a call for panic, but rather an invitation to reassess strategies, rebalance portfolios if necessary, and remain vigilant. By understanding the underlying dynamics and utilizing tools like this index, you can better position yourself to thrive in the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions About the Altcoin Season Index Q1: What does it mean when the Altcoin Season Index falls? A1: A falling Altcoin Season Index indicates that fewer altcoins, among the top 100 by market capitalization, are outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It suggests a potential shift towards Bitcoin dominance or a general underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. Q2: Is an Altcoin Season Index score of 69 considered good or bad? A2: An index score of 69 is still below the 75% threshold needed to officially declare an an “altcoin season.” While it’s not extremely low, the recent drop from a higher point suggests a weakening trend for altcoins relative to Bitcoin. It’s a signal to reassess market conditions. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A3: The Altcoin Season Index is typically updated daily by CoinMarketCap, providing a continuous snapshot of market performance trends between altcoins and Bitcoin. Q4: Should I sell all my altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is falling? A4: Not necessarily. A falling Altcoin Season Index is one indicator among many. It’s crucial to perform your own research (DYOR) on individual altcoin projects, consider your long-term investment goals, and assess your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. It might be a time to rebalance your portfolio, not to panic sell. Q5: What’s the difference between an “altcoin season” and a “Bitcoin season”? A5: An “altcoin season” occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A “Bitcoin season” is the inverse, where Bitcoin significantly outperforms most altcoins during the same timeframe. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Slowing momentum has deflated expectations, and XRP’s destiny is still robust but kept in check compared to previous estimates. Meanwhile, new Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum in a big way. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 presale level 6 which is already 45% sold out. The protocol has already raised over $16.25 million from over 16,570 holders. With lending-and-borrowing exclusively designed for utility-driven adoption, MUTM has been highlighted by analysts as one of the probable high-growth altcoins. There are even predictions of a price explosion of 4,500%, putting it on the list of the most viral emerging coins by 2025. XRP Price Prediction: Projections Reduced as Resistance Continues XRP is trading at $2.87 currently. Analysts have toned down previous bull predictions, with predictors who had put XRP at $10 now anticipating a lower cap at about $5 as a result of repeated resistance at $3, declining volumes, and macroeconomic headwinds. Absent until demand buyers stage a robust comeback or new catalysts emerge, XRP may range from $2.80–$3.50 in the near-medium term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outranks XRP by comparison. Stellar Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has kicked off Presale Stage Six, with the tokens selling at $0.035 after a 16.17% price appreciation from the previous round. Investors are famished, with over 16,570 buyers and more than $16.25 million of capital raised. In its bid to provide the platform with added security, Mutuum Finance is introducing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Bugs are differentiated into four categories, that is, critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure their greatest discovery and fixing. The protocol depends on stringent management of collateralized funds to safeguard the system and participants. Controls are imposed through certain collateral ratios, lending caps, and deposit caps. Undercollateralized positions get shut down very rapidly, and call penalties and remediation fees are levied to ensure systemic stability. Creating an Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved by maximising Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially for overcollateralised credit. Reserve requirements also serve as a shock absorber for the market, and excess reserves are available for undertaking risk-absorbing activities with risky assets. Mutuum Finance’s overall goal is to reorganize the DeFi structure on the pillars of long-term viability, reliability, and inclusiveness. The project provides not only a secure borrowing and lending facility but also represents a new era of decentralized finance being made more available to retail and institutional investors. To encourage early adoption as well as community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway contest in which 10 participants will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This initiative focuses on the project’s commitment to inspiring its backers while ensuring awareness and contribution across the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance utilizes a dynamic, liquidity-based interest rate framework. It maintains lending and borrowing in harmony with fluctuations in market conditions at all times. Where there is excess money in the platform, borrowing rates are kept deliberately low to encourage greater utilization of available funds as well as fuel market activity. Where liquidity is nonetheless tight, borrowing rates rise and that encourages existing borrowers to repay outstanding loans as well as draw in new deposits. This positive feedback mechanism builds a better, stronger climate which protects user interests, slows down liquidity flows, and lowers the overall protocol exposure during both times of market stability and stress. Why Investors are Abandoning XRP for MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly becoming the investor’s go-to as forecasts about Ripple lose their appeal. In spite of the capped future value of XRP reaching $5 today, Mutuum Finance presale tokens are priced at $0.035 in Stage 6, already sold 45%, and more than $16.25M raised.

Today marks a significant Bitcoin options expiration event, alongside a substantial expiry for Ethereum options. These events, involving billions of dollars, often create ripples across the market, making it essential for traders and enthusiasts to pay close attention. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Options Expiration? To fully grasp the implications of today’s Bitcoin options expiration , it’s helpful to understand what options contracts are. Simply put, an option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. This date is known as the expiration. Call options: Grant the right to buy. Traders typically buy calls if they expect the price to rise. Put options: Grant the right to sell. Traders often buy puts if they anticipate a price drop. When these contracts expire, they can influence market sentiment and even price action, especially when large volumes are involved. The underlying assets, in this case, are Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Scale of Today’s Bitcoin Options Expiration: A Deep Dive Today’s expiry is particularly notable due to its sheer scale. According to crypto options exchange Deribit, a staggering $16 billion worth of Bitcoin options expiration is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 26th. This massive notional value represents a significant portion of the derivatives market. Additionally, Ethereum options totaling $5 billion will expire concurrently. Such large expiries can sometimes lead to increased volatility as traders adjust their positions. For Bitcoin, the put/call ratio stands at 0.71. This ratio indicates the number of put options relative to call options. A ratio below 1 suggests a slightly bullish sentiment, as more call options are open compared to put options. Ethereum’s put/call ratio is 0.86, also leaning slightly bullish. These ratios offer a snapshot of market participants’ collective expectations regarding future price movements. Understanding ‘Max Pain’ and Its Market Influence A key metric associated with options expiration is the ‘max pain price.’ For the expiring Bitcoin options expiration , the max pain price is currently $111,000. For Ethereum, it’s $3,800. What does ‘max pain’ mean? It’s the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. Essentially, it’s the price point where the majority of options traders would experience the most pain. While not a definitive prediction, the market sometimes gravitates towards this price point as expiration approaches. This phenomenon is often attributed to the actions of options writers (those who sell options) who might hedge their positions, potentially influencing the underlying asset’s price. However, it’s crucial to remember that max pain is just one indicator among many and should not be the sole basis for trading decisions. What Does This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for Traders? With such a substantial Bitcoin options expiration looming, what should traders consider? Historically, large options expiries can usher in periods of heightened volatility, though outcomes are never guaranteed. Here are some actionable insights: Increased Volatility: Be prepared for potential price swings around the expiration time as market participants close or roll over their positions. Sentiment Shift: Observe how the market reacts post-expiration. A significant move away from the max pain price could indicate a strong directional bias. Risk Management: Ensure your trading strategies account for potential increased risk. Consider using stop-losses or reducing position sizes if you are sensitive to volatility. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and analysis from reputable sources. While the expiry itself doesn’t guarantee a specific price movement, it does create an environment where significant capital is in play, potentially leading to dynamic market behavior. In conclusion, today’s colossal Bitcoin options expiration , coupled with a notable Ethereum options expiry, marks a critical moment for the crypto markets. While the max pain prices offer a fascinating insight into potential market gravitating points, the true impact will unfold as the expiration time arrives. Traders should remain vigilant, practice sound risk management, and stay informed to navigate any potential shifts. The crypto market’s inherent dynamism means every major event, like this one, presents both challenges and opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin options expiration? A1: It’s the specific date and time when Bitcoin options contracts become void. At expiration, option holders decide whether to exercise their right to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at the agreed-upon strike price, or let the option expire worthless. Q2: What is the significance of the put/call ratio? A2: The put/call ratio indicates market sentiment. A ratio below 1 (like Bitcoin’s 0.71) suggests more call options are open than put options, often interpreted as a slightly bullish sentiment. Conversely, a ratio above 1 could suggest bearish sentiment. Q3: How does ‘max pain’ affect Bitcoin’s price? A3: The ‘max pain’ price is the strike price where the most options contracts expire worthless, causing maximum loss for option holders. While not a direct price predictor, some believe the underlying asset’s price can gravitate towards this point as expiration nears, potentially due to hedging activities by options writers. Q4: Will today’s $16B Bitcoin options expiration cause a price crash? A4: A large options expiration doesn’t automatically lead to a price crash or surge. It can, however, contribute to increased volatility and potential price adjustments as large positions are settled or rolled over. Market dynamics are complex, and many factors influence price. Q5: Where can I find data on options expirations? A5: Reputable crypto options exchanges like Deribit, CME, and others provide data on open interest, put/call ratios, and max pain prices for their listed options contracts. Financial news outlets also often report on these significant events. Did you find this analysis of the Bitcoin options expiration insightful?

The move comes after mass demonstrations this month that called out suspected corruption in public works and flood control projects. Integrity Chain Piloted For Infrastructure Contracts According to reports, a platform called Integrity Chain — developed with BayaniChain Ventures — is being used to log public-works contracts and progress updates. The system anchors cryptographic hashes on the Polygon network so files can be proven unchanged later. Local civic groups and some universities have been named as independent validators who can attest to entries, and their attestations are also recorded. Budget Documents Notarized On-Chain Reports have disclosed that the Philippines Department of Budget and Management has already been using blockchain notarization for budget paperwork. Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) can be hashed and uploaded so anyone can check whether a document was altered after publication. Officials describe this as a way to make parts of the budget trackable in public view while keeping sensitive details protected. Why The Shift Happened Now Public anger spiked in September after large protests over alleged corruption tied to infrastructure projects. Demonstrations reached tens, and some estimates said crowds swelled to over 100,000 in the capital on September 21, 2025. Based on reports, lawmakers and city officials pointed to those street protests as a key reason to speed up transparency measures. City Launches Local Pilot At the city level, Baguio has rolled out a local system branded GoodGovChain to log municipal financial statements, procurement records, and infrastructure reports. The launch, according to city leaders, is aimed at making official documents available and nearly impossible to tamper with after publication. Philippines Lawmakers Propose A National System Meanwhile, a Senate filing — Senate Bill No. 1330 — was lodged to create a National Budget Blockchain System, according to press releases. The proposal would let Philippines citizens trace national spending more easily. Lawmakers backing the measure argue that blockchain logs could give the public a clearer view of where funds move, though opponents warn about cost and complexity.

Dogecoin Whale Has Made A Massive Move During The Past Day According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large move has been spotted on the Dogecoin blockchain over the past day. The transfer in question involved the movement of nearly 122.4 million DOGE, worth around $28.5 million at the time the network processed it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Sell 147,000 BTC Since August, Fastest Selloff Of Cycle Considering the scale of the transaction, it’s likely that a whale entity was behind it. Whales refer to the big-money investors of the cryptocurrency, who can carry some degree of influence in the market thanks to their large holdings. Moves related to such holders can be worth keeping an eye on, due to their standing. The transfers may not directly impact the memecoin’s price, but they can still contain information about the sentiment among these giants. A lot of these moves are anonymous, however, meaning it can be hard to infer anything from them. Luckily, the latest Dogecoin whale transaction involved a wallet that has already been identified. Below are the address details related to the transfer. As is visible, the sending address in the case of this Dogecoin whale transaction was a wallet attached to cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The receiver, on the other hand, was an unknown wallet, suggesting that it was likely to be an investor’s self-custodial address. Moves of this type, where coins flow from centralized exchanges to self-custody, are known as Exchange Outflows. Generally, holders move coins away from the custody of these platforms when they plan to hold them in the long term, so Exchange Outflows can have a bullish impact on the asset’s price. The latest Binance Exchange Outflow from the whale has interestingly come following a drop of almost 18% for the memecoin over the past week. As such, it’s possible that the withdrawal corresponds to the large investor using the lower prices to accumulate DOGE.

As displayed in the above chart, the total supply of the Dogecoin investors carrying between 100 million and 1 billion tokens has gone up by 2 billion DOGE (about $465 million) within this window. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.23, down more than 4.5% over the last 24 hours.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang sat down with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen during the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. The talks came as the world’s second and third largest economies try to smooth over their own trade disputes while dealing with new tariffs from Washington. Von der Leyen posted about the meeting on her social media account, saying she talked with China’s second-highest leader about trade issues. She said she was glad to see China ready to work with Europe “in a spirit of mutual understanding.” I had a good and frank exchange with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. The main focus of our meeting was to follow up on the productive EU–China Summit in July. We both agreed on the importance of moving from words to action as soon as possible. The best way forward is to build on… pic.twitter.com/eW4eQo0xPD — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) September 24, 2025 The EU chief mentioned that Europe has well-known worries about export controls, getting access to markets, and having too much production capacity. These have been significant issues between the two sides for months. China and the EU have been close to starting a trade war for two years now. Most experts say this started when European officials decided in 2023 to look into whether China was giving unfair favors to its electric car companies. This led to China checking EU brandy, dairy products, pork, and other goods in return. Trade relations between China and Brussels are improving Now that Trump’s trade moves are hurting EU and Chinese exports, Brussels and Beijing have good reasons to improve their relations. According to a statement from China’s foreign ministry on Thursday, Li said he hoped China and the EU could remember why they started working together. He also said he wanted the EU to keep its promise to maintain open trade and investment markets. The Chinese statement added that “as two important poles in the world, China and the EU should demonstrate responsibility and maintain strategic independence.” Chinese trade workers have found it hard to deal with Washington and Brussels simultaneously. Foreign business groups have complained about long waits, while government workers work long hours on complex issues like permits to export rare earth materials. The European Commission, which makes trade rules for all 27 EU countries, has also had trouble getting everyone to agree. Last October, when it came to tariffs on Chinese electric cars, 10 countries supported them, 12 stayed neutral, and five said no. Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, was one of those that opposed the tariffs. China has also become more important to Europe’s thinking about the war in Ukraine, say diplomats. Many see Chinese President Xi Jinping’s influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s role as Russia’s economic support as a better way to reach peace than Trump’s hard-to-predict foreign policy. Von der Leyen said she asked China to use its power to stop the killing and push Russia to talk about peace. The Chinese foreign ministry’s statement did not mention the Ukraine conflict. “Time for diplomacy is now. It would send a strong signal to the world,” Von der Leyen said. China links purchases of American soybeans to tariff removal A Chinese commerce ministry spokesman said Thursday that America should get rid of what China calls unreasonable tariffs and create better conditions for more trade between the two countries. China buys more soybeans than any other country, but according to a recent Cryptopolitan report, China has not ordered any soybeans from the US recently. Instead, it has been buying from South America. American farmers could lose billions of dollars in soybean sales because of ongoing trade problems that have stopped exports to China. Senior Chinese trade official Li Chenggang met with business and political leaders from the American Midwest on Monday. This area grows most of America’s soybeans. The meeting suggested that China buy some American soybeans before bigger trade talks happen.

This move is more than just a financial transaction; it signals a powerful shift in corporate strategy and highlights the growing confidence in digital assets as a primary form of capital. For those watching the convergence of AI and blockchain, this strategic decision by Silex is certainly one to keep an eye on. Why is Silex Making a BTC Investment in DatavaultAI? Silex’s decision to invest $150 million in DatavaultAI is notable for several reasons. Firstly, the sheer scale of the investment demonstrates a strong commitment to the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. DatavaultAI, as an AI data firm, likely offers innovative solutions that Silex believes will drive future growth and competitive advantage. However, the most striking aspect is the payment method. Instead of traditional U.S. dollars, Silex will execute this substantial BTC investment . This choice underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage cryptocurrencies not just as speculative assets, but as functional currency for large-scale transactions. It also positions Silex as a pioneer in integrating digital assets directly into its corporate finance strategy. This strategic move could offer several benefits: Reduced Transaction Costs: Cryptocurrencies can often facilitate cross-border transactions with lower fees compared to traditional banking systems. Faster Settlement: Bitcoin transactions can settle much quicker than conventional wire transfers, especially internationally. Alignment with Innovation: Using Bitcoin for such a significant investment aligns Silex with the innovative spirit of both AI and blockchain technologies. Potential for Appreciation: While carrying risks, a Bitcoin holding could potentially appreciate in value over time, adding another layer of strategic benefit. Exploring New Frontiers: RWA Tokenization and the Future of Finance Beyond the immediate BTC investment in DatavaultAI, Silex has also unveiled plans to delve into the market for blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This initiative represents another bold step into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. RWA tokenization involves converting tangible assets—like real estate, art, or commodities—into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process offers enhanced liquidity, fractional ownership, and transparency, making previously illiquid assets more accessible to a broader range of investors. Silex’s interest in this area suggests a vision for a future where digital assets play a central role in representing and transferring value across various sectors. This exploration could lead to: New revenue streams for Silex. Increased adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance. Greater efficiency and accessibility for asset management. The convergence of AI, blockchain, and real-world assets is creating exciting opportunities, and Silex appears keen to be at the forefront of this transformation. What Does This BTC Investment Mean for the Crypto Market? Silex’s significant BTC investment sends a strong signal to the broader cryptocurrency market. When a Nasdaq-listed company chooses Bitcoin for a major corporate investment, it lends considerable credibility to the digital asset space. This action can: Boost Institutional Confidence: It encourages other corporations to consider Bitcoin for treasury management and strategic investments. Validate Bitcoin’s Utility: It reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a viable medium of exchange for substantial transactions, not just a store of value. Drive Further Adoption: Such high-profile moves can inspire more mainstream businesses and individuals to engage with cryptocurrencies. This development is a testament to the increasing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin within the global financial landscape. It highlights a growing understanding that digital assets are not just for early adopters but are becoming integral to modern corporate strategy. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While Silex’s move is undeniably innovative, navigating the crypto and RWA tokenization landscape comes with its own set of challenges. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and technological complexities are all factors that companies like Silex must carefully manage. However, the potential rewards—disrupting traditional markets, fostering innovation, and tapping into new growth vectors—are substantial. Silex’s strategic BTC investment into DatavaultAI and its foray into RWA tokenization positions the company at the intersection of several high-growth industries. This bold strategy could redefine its future, setting a precedent for how traditional companies engage with the digital economy. It’s a clear indicator that the lines between conventional finance and the crypto world are blurring rapidly. Concluding Thoughts on Silex’s Bold Move Silex Holding Company’s $150 million BTC investment into DatavaultAI, coupled with its ambitions in RWA tokenization, marks a pivotal moment. It’s a powerful demonstration of how leading companies are embracing blockchain and artificial intelligence to drive innovation and secure a competitive edge. This development not only strengthens the position of Bitcoin as a corporate asset but also paves the way for a more integrated and digitally-driven financial future. We are witnessing the evolution of corporate finance, where digital assets are no longer an alternative but a strategic imperative. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Asia’s hunger for US tech stocks is rising, with retail investors from Taiwan and South Korea flooding into new ETFs. Leading the way is JPMorgan Asset Management. Earlier this month, JPMorgan introduced a new Taiwan-listed active ETF. The product allows local investors to gain exposure to technology giants in the United States, including Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Subscription will begin on September 30 and run until October 3. The bank considers this a critical move to increase its ETF business in Asia. Philippe El-Asmar, head of APAC ETF, digital & direct at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the firm views active ETFs as a key growth driver in the region. Mirae Asset Global Investments in South Korea is also making a big push. This month, its Tiger ETF arm introduced a fund that invests in US software companies linked to artificial intelligence. Mirae’s executives say the move is a direct reaction to the boom in retail trading. Nathan Namki Kim, head of ETF management at Mirae Asset, said the rise in retail investing has created a strong demand for new product development. These launches have brought the total to 19 US tech-focused ETFs in Asia just this year. That paces the region to surpass the 22 debuts of last year. In all, 63 of these ETFs are now listed in Asia. Retail money fuels momentum and risk Retail investors across Asia are proving to be strong fans of US tech equities , especially the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps. These companies, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple, have driven the Nasdaq 100 up more than 115 percent since late 2022. However, the flows are volatile as US tech ETFs in Asia have seen more than $500 million of net outflows over the last three months. Analysts caution that the rally may be overheating and that too much money is piled into just a few stocks. Yet the broader trend remains intact: over the last three years, Asian investors poured more than $4.3 billion into US tech ETFs, betting that Federal Reserve rate cuts and AI-driven optimism will extend the rally. The Nasdaq 100 gained more than 4.5% in September through its close on the 24th, making it the best month since June. Rebecca Sin, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said US tech remains a strong growth area in Asia with many opportunities for issuers, adding that recent outflows may reflect profit-taking after months of solid gains. Asia’s ETF explosion broadens beyond tech The rush into tech ETFs is part of a broader wave crashing across Asia’s ETF marke t. In just the first eight months of 2025, 461 new ETFs have started trading. It is that pace that could exceed the 508 recorded last year. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts that total ETF assets in Asia will soar to $8 trillion by 2035, from just under $2 trillion today. China is poised to lead the charge, but markets in Taiwan and South Korea are also growing rapidly. The US ETF market is already valued at about $12.5 trillion. Retail-heavy Asian markets like JPMorgan are a huge new opportunity for large asset managers worldwide. Day traders in South Korea, Taiwan, and elsewhere in the region are increasingly looking for higher returns overseas, notably in US technology. The momentum is not without danger as heavy concentration in a handful of megacap US companies leaves investors exposed if sentiment shifts. A rising tide of competition among ETF sponsors also means that any product must stand out in a crowd. Still, the aggressive entry by JPMorgan puts it at the head of the pack.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have contacted some of the more than 200 firms that announced crypto treasury strategies this year, sources told the Journal. Officials warned companies about possible breaches of rules against selectively sharing material non-public information. The scrutiny comes amid a wave of companies adopting crypto treasury strategies. Inspired by the success of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, dozens of firms outside the crypto sector have announced plans to raise capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases. According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. regulators have flagged unusual trading activity ahead of crypto-treasury announcements by some companies. The SEC and Finra suspect potential violations of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) and have issued inquiry letters, which… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 25, 2025 Crypto Treasury Craze Fuels $20 Billion Fundraising Wave The trend accelerated in early 2025 after a Trump administration executive order established a national strategic Bitcoin reserve . Since then, more than 60 companies, from software and gaming to biotech and energy, have unveiled plans to put portions of their balance sheets into crypto. Together, they have targeted over $20b in fundraising through stock offerings, convertible debt and private placements. The aim has been to hedge against inflation, attract younger investors and mirror the outsized gains seen by early movers. However, stock prices often soared in the days before announcements, sometimes doubling or tripling. These unexplained moves have raised questions about whether insiders leaked details or tipped investors, prompting regulators to act. Corporate Crypto Buys Spur Stock Surges, Draw SEC And FINRA Attention Trump Media and Technology Group is among the most high-profile cases. Ahead of its May 27 disclosure that it planned to raise $2.5b for a Bitcoin treasury , its shares posted a week of unusual volatility. The announcement pushed the firm into the ranks of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders, alongside Strategy and Marathon Digital Holdings, but regulators quickly flagged suspicious trading. GameStop followed a similar path. The retailer revealed a $500m Bitcoin buy on May 28, but its shares had already surged 40% in the three trading sessions before the news. SEC officials are examining clustered buy orders tied to company vendors, while FINRA is reviewing broker communications. Biotech firm MEI Pharma also drew attention in July when it announced plans to allocate a quarter of its cash reserves to Litecoin. Its stock nearly doubled in four days leading up to the filing, with unusually heavy call option activity. Investigators are reviewing whether investor briefings breached disclosure rules. Debt-Funded Buybacks Signal Strain On Firms Chasing Crypto Gains SharpLink Gaming, a small-cap marketing firm specializing in sports betting and iGaming affiliates, made a major shift into an Ethereum treasury strategy in mid-2025. On May 28, its shares spiked roughly 433% during intraday trading , market data showed. The craze for crypto treasuries that swept through small and mid-cap firms is already showing cracks. Several companies that only months ago trumpeted crypto holdings are now launching share buybacks , often using debt, to counter sliding stock prices. In some cases, market values have fallen below the worth of the Bitcoin on their balance sheets. That gap signals rising investor doubt about whether crypto treasury strategies can deliver long-term value.

The leasing units of at least two state-owned banks are in very advanced talks with Beijing’s financial regulator about converting long-term vessel leases into mortgage loans. This is a defensive proposal against the US tariff move. In altering the composition of their shipping portfolios, banks want to shield themselves from steep US port fees first imposed in mid-October and possibly from Chinese shipowners. Industry insiders say the timing is key: Some of China’s biggest leasing houses have billions of dollars locked in vessels that often visit American ports, and the overall trade war backdrop can only heighten tensions. The National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA), China’s top banking watchdog, is closely watching the talks, and people familiar with the matter said the regulator hasn’t made a decision and is considering the financial risks of allowing banks to hold shipping mortgages. This industry was traditionally seen as too risky. People in the talks say it is a highly sensitive process. On the one hand, Beijing would like to protect its lenders and shipping companies from Washington’s measures. On the other hand, regulators are wary of exposing banks to new risks when China’s financial system is already under pressure from soft property markets and slower growth. The deliberations underscore the scale of China’s footprint in shipping. With nearly $100 billion in shipping assets already on long-term leases to China-backed firms, Chinese banks and leasing companies lead the global market. Any change to the structure of how those assets are funded would reverberate across international shipping and could reshape China’s standing as the world’s largest maritime lender. Chinese lenders explore mortgage model for ships The thought arose in August when leasing companies and the shipowners met with NFRA officials. In China, lessors have been the key players in shipping finance worldwide for over a decade, replacing Western banks that have retreated. In a standard leasing contract, the owner buys the vessel and leases it to the operator for over ten years or longer. The legal liability and financial responsibility are reversed if the leases become mortgages. The ship owner owns the ships, but the bank finances them. Mortgages are generally shorter — around five years — and shift the risk of market downturns and defaults from landlords to operators and their lenders. By crossing that line, Chinese banks would be taking an extraordinary leap. Shipping assets have long been considered cyclical and volatile, with values influenced by the ebbs and flows of trade, freight rates, and global demand. In case of default, these banks would have to spend years in court trying to recoup their money. However, other lenders say the risk could be worth it if mortgages shield their portfolios from US exposure. Banks brace for US penalties The urgency comes from an American plan unveiled in April by President Donald Trump. Effective October 14, Chinese-built and Chinese-operated vessels calling at US ports will be charged fees based on cargo volume. The highest fees are likely imposed on vessels directly owned by Chinese companies. The United States says the duties are intended to revitalize its shipbuilding industry and reduce dependence on Chinese maritime muscle. However, Beijing views this step as a direct challenge to controlling global shipping finance. As of last year, Chinese leasing companies owned about $100 billion worth of shipping assets in total, according to Clarkson Research Services. Shipping makes up as much as 40% of some lessors’ portfolios, underscoring their US policy exposure. Industry sources said some shipowners are already looking for ways around the levies. Among the ideas under consideration is raising charter rates on ships that do not call at US ports and overhauling financing for vessels that do. Others are tapping non-Chinese banks for the new money to cut risk.

The new fund distinguishes itself as the first US ETF to pair spot ETH exposure with direct staking payouts. REX-Osprey passes Ethereum rewards to investors According to the release, the new ETF fund gives investors exposure to spot Ethereum while passing through monthly staking rewards. It holds a mix of directly staked ETH and exchange-traded products (ETPs) that also stake ETH. All ETH staking rewards are passed to investors, with none retained by Rex or Osprey. The ETH fund trades under the ticker ESK and is structured under the 1940 Act. Greg King, the CEO of REX Financial, said , “With ESK, we’re giving investors access to Ethereum plus staking rewards in the most broad-based US ETF format.” He explained that the launch of ESK is a continuation of the joint venture work of “introducing crypto staking through the ETF structure.” REX-Osprey is a partnership between REX Shares and Osprey Funds. The joint venture focuses on launching crypto-focused ETFs that give investors regulated access to digital assets. Competitors like BlackRock , Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton are still waiting for approval from the SEC. The Securities and Exchange Commission postponed rulings on staking features for Ethereum funds filed by these companies. Spot Ethereum ETFs in the US already manage close to $25 billion, with BlackRock’s ETHA holding the largest share. On September 25, Bitcoin ETFs recorded strong inflows, while Ethereum funds saw continued outflows. Bitcoin ETFs added more than $149 million in new money, led by BlackRock’s IBIT product. Ethereum ETFs lost about $79 million, showing weaker demand as investors pulled capital from ETH funds. Dogecoin and XRP ETFs go live through Rex-Osprey Last week, Rex-Osprey launched the first US based Dogecoin and XRP ETFs. The Dogecoin ETF trades under the ticker DOJE, while the XRP ETF lists as XRPR. Cryptopolitan reported that XRPR recorded about $37.7 million in trading volume, while DOJE saw around $17 million on launch day. The funds are listed on US exchanges under the 1940 Act structure, the same framework used for Rex-Osprey’s other products. XRPR continues to trade actively with over 200,000 shares exchanged daily, while DOJE has attracted about $8 million in inflows since launch. According to Yahoo Finance data , XRPR closed trading at $22.80 while DOJE is standing at $21.24 per share. The new ETFs were launched to meet rising investor demand for crypto access inside regulated vehicles. Rex-Osprey secured compliance using the 1940 Act framework, while offering a familiar structure to the market.

Who the winner will be is not for certain, but there will be more than 1. — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) September 24, 2025 Background of SHIB and its Market Position SHIB, originally known as a meme coin, has grown into a much larger ecosystem over the years. Developers have expanded SHIB’s utility and functionality beyond its original branding, working on projects designed to drive real-world adoption. Efforts such as token burns , aimed at reducing supply, have sought to create scarcity and potentially improve value over time. This activity has elevated SHIB’s status from a speculative digital asset to one seeking recognition as a legitimate participant in the wider crypto market. Potential Impact of an SHIB ETF An exchange-traded fund tied to SHIB could provide institutional and retail investors with easier access to the asset, eliminating the need to hold the token directly. This approach mirrors what has already taken place with Bitcoin and Ethereum, where ETFs have provided a regulated investment vehicle for a previously complex asset class. A SHIB ETF could also enhance market liquidity, increase institutional participation, and provide additional opportunities for investors who prefer traditional brokerage platforms. While asset managers have not shown much interest in an SHIB ETF , Del Crxpto’s initiative could begin that push toward increased participation and multiple filings. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Industry Interest and Regulatory Considerations The path to an ETF involves close regulatory scrutiny. However, Del Crxpto’s public statement highlights that more than one entity is interested in advancing this product. He said, “Who the winner will be is not for certain, but there will be more than 1.” Additionally, the SEC has softened its stance on ETF regulation and approval, recently allowing Grayscale to launch its Digital Large Cap Fund as an ETF under the new Generic Listing Standards. Supporters of SHIB see it as a strong candidate for a regulated investment product, and applications for ETFs based on the asset might start showing up soon.

US Senate To Put Crypto Taxes Under The Microscope The panel will hear testimony from industry and tax-policy experts, including Jason Somensatto, director of policy at Coin Center; Andrea S. Kramer, a founding member of AS Kramer Law; Lawrence Zlatkin, vice president of tax at Coinbase; and Annette Nellen, chair of the Digital Assets Tax Task Force at the American Institute of CPAs. The committee’s notice lists Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking Member Ron Wyden for opening statements and says a livestream will be available on the committee’s website. The formal notice follows early reporting on social media. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett wrote : “The @SenFinance Committee has just announced a hearing next Wednesday, October 1st at 10AM EST on crypto taxes,” adding the witness list and framing the session as a focused review of current rules . Although the witness lineup spans advocacy, corporate, legal, and professional-standards perspectives, the committee has not released draft legislation attached to the hearing. The agenda suggests a broad fact-finding remit as senators weigh how to treat the complex spectrum of digital-asset activity for federal income-tax purposes, from staking , token launches, and protocol-level distributions to basis tracking, wash-sale parity, and information-reporting obligations. Market participants are already attempting to read the political tea leaves. The trader known as “HORSE” (TheFlowHorse) posted a pointed aside on X: “Tinfoil hat. Trump admin will do anything to make their crypto activity have less of a tax burn. Major favorable changes are coming.” The hearing lands against a shifting backdrop for US crypto tax policy. Earlier this year, the Senate voted with a wide bipartisan margin to roll back a Biden-era rule that would have extended broker-style reporting to certain decentralized finance platforms beginning in 2027, a move the industry argued misfit the technology and imposed disproportionate costs. The October 1 session is therefore less a narrow technical hearing than a barometer of where the next wave of federal tax guidance may head. The Finance Committee’s site lists the hearing time as 10:00 a.m. ET on October 1; for European readers, that corresponds to 16:00 CEST. A livestream link will be posted on the committee page closer to the start.

The fall in ETH’s price can be attributed to a mix of macroeconomic, structural, and crypto-specific factors. Ethereum Dips Below $4,000, Analyst Explains Why According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, ETH’s latest descent below $4,000 can be blamed on a complex mix of factors. First, a strong US dollar, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) cautious stance following its September rate cut, dampened risk appetite. Related Reading: Ethereum Close To Local Bottom? Analyst Flags Drop In Binance Open Interest Furthermore, rising bond yields and the increasing risk of a US government shutdown have spooked investors, discouraging them from investing in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies like ETH. Second, the analyst points to the role of leverage in ETH’s latest dip. On September 22, more than $500 million in ETH longs were wiped out within 24 hours, resulting in the unwinding of high leverage that was building up in Q2 2025. During the sell-off, ETH whales faced close to $45 million in forced sales. In addition, low weekend trading volume and shallow order books enhanced ETH’s price swings. Notably, institutional investors turned to OTC redemptions, following the Fed meeting to reduce their exposure to ETH. From a technical perspective, ETH failed to decisively break through the stiff resistance near $4,500 – $4,600. Failure to defend the $4,200 support worsened things for ETH, turning the momentum sharply bearish. The fifth reason was regulatory headwinds surrounding digital assets, especially the uncertainty around MiCA in the EU and US crypto legislation. ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows worth $76 million weighed on investor sentiment. Finally, a surge in validator exit queues and reduced staking inflows weakened natural buy-side support. Other factors, such as seasonal weakness and Bitcoin’s (BTC) rising dominance in the market, contributed to ETH’s sell-off. Arab Chain concluded: While this correction reflects structural positioning and macro forces rather than a broken thesis, volatility may persist until liquidity returns and regulatory clarity improves. Will ETH Stage A Recovery? While the momentum is against ETH currently, some analysts are optimistic about a turnaround in ETH’s fortunes in the coming months. For instance, ETH’s CME futures open interest is inching closer to new highs, setting a new potential target for ETH of $6,800 by the end of 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Stalls As Spot And Perpetual Volumes Flatten On Binance Similarly, the surge in ETH contracts throughout the year has some analysts convinced that the digital asset may soon embark on a rally to $5,000. ETH’s illiquid supply could further propel it to new highs. In his latest analysis, crypto commentator Ted Pillows predicted that the increase in global M2 money supply could pave the way for $20,000 ETH. At press time, ETH trades at $3,959, down 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

The move erased more than $18 billion in market value over the past week and confirmed fresh resistance at $2.80, leaving traders bracing for a test of $2.70 support. News Background • XRP slid 5.83% over the Sept. 25–26 session, falling from $2.92 to $2.75 on heavy institutional selling. • A sharp rejection at $2.80 during the 17:00 hour triggered a 276.77 million volume spike — more than 2.5x the 24-hour average. • Despite SEC approval of the first U.S. XRP ETF, optimism has been offset by Powell’s warnings on valuations and rising Treasury yields. • Over the past week, XRP’s market value has contracted by $18.94 billion, down 10.22%, breaking below the $3.00 psychological threshold. Price Action Summary XRP traded between $2.92 and $2.74 — a 6.3% intraday range — before closing near $2.75. • Sellers dominated after $2.80 rejection on extreme volume, creating a distribution zone that capped further upside. • Subsequent recovery attempts stalled around $2.81–$2.82, confirming fresh resistance clusters. • Final hour saw a brief 1.09% bounce from $2.75 to $2.78, driven by concentrated flows between 00:50–00:57 on volumes above 3 million per candle. • Short-term support is now seen at $2.75–$2.77, with downside risk toward $2.70 if breached. Technical Analysis • Range: $0.18 (6.3%) between $2.92 high and $2.74 low. • Resistance: $2.80 initial rejection; $2.81–$2.82 clusters formed on failed retests. • Support: $2.75 zone defended in late session; $2.70 psychological level next watch. • Volume: 276.77M at 17:00 vs. 108.42M daily average. • Pattern: High-volume rejection signals distribution. Short-term consolidation near $2.77 suggests indecision before next move. What Traders Are Watching • Whether $2.75 holds through Asia session or breaks toward $2.70. • ETF optimism versus real money outflows — sell-the-news pattern remains in play. • Whale flows after $800M in transfers over past week; positioning risk if selling resumes. • Macro overhang: Powell’s hawkish tone, Treasury yields climbing, Fed cut expectations capped.",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-26 02:12:06

Market research group Sistine Research has outlined this repeating structure, identifying a sequence of compression and expansion phases that appear consistently in XRP’s long-term chart. These phases highlight how price consolidates within narrowing ranges before breaking upward into significant rallies. Currently, XRP is in what Sistine Research describes as its third compression since the election. Expecting a large expansionary move from XRP soon (within months). As the price action compresses, so does the orderbook, with most liquidity compressing into a tighter and tighter range. This results in very large gaps in liquidity. XRP is on its 3rd compression since the… pic.twitter.com/hjRVzeK8wc — Sistine Research (@sistineresearch) September 24, 2025 XRP’s Current Journey The firm emphasized that the current compressive phase is “the tightest one yet at 3 consecutively higher price points.” According to their chart, each compression has occurred at progressively higher levels, suggesting structural strength within the market. The first compression, which began in July 2023 following the first favorable ruling in the XRP lawsuit , concluded in late 2024, causing a breakout of over 500% for the digital asset. Following that, XRP entered another compressive phase, with a major breakout in July that sent it to an all-time high of $3.65 . The digital asset has now entered another phase of compression, and Sistine research anticipates a major breakout in the coming months. Historical Patterns Suggest Repetition Based on XRP’s trajectory since 2014, the recurring setup of compression followed by expansion stood out. During each past cycle, extended consolidation was followed by steep upward moves, validating the technical structure highlighted in the research. The sequence of higher lows paired with contracting ranges suggests that price has not only stabilized at stronger levels but has also formed the conditions that historically led to sharp advances. The repeated occurrence of these patterns strengthens the case that XRP may be preparing for another large-scale move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Liquidity Tightening Across the Orderbook The analysis also examines the behavior of XRP’s orderbook , where trading activity reflects shifts in liquidity. Sistine Research explained that as the price action compresses, “so does the orderbook, with most liquidity compressing into a tighter and tighter range.” This condition leaves fewer layers of liquidity available outside of the narrowing bands, which in turn creates large gaps in liquidity. Such gaps often contribute to accelerated price movements once consolidation phases end. By charting both historical and recent price action, Sistine Research illustrates how these compression phases have consistently preceded expansions in XRP’s market history. Earlier cycles displayed the same buildup before notable surges, reinforcing the expectation that the present formation could deliver another expansionary move.

The debt is expected to be issued either through the high-yield bond market or via leveraged loans, Fleury told Bloomberg in a recent interview. Morgan Stanley is arranging the potential transaction, which could be launched as early as October. Credit rating agencies are still reviewing the deal, with expectations that it could fall between BB and CCC, the typical range for junk-rated debt. Google’s backstop could reportedly help secure a higher grade. Negotiations are ongoing, and there is no guarantee the deal will move forward. TeraWulf didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. TeraWulf is expected to raise approximately $3 billion to support the build-out of its data centers via a structure supported by Google https://t.co/ceLrIX7oRv — Bloomberg (@business) September 25, 2025 AI Boom Drives Demand For Data Centers, Puts Crypto Miners In Spotlight The push comes as demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure has outstripped supply. The rapid rise of AI has created shortages of data center space, graphics processing chips and access to electricity. Crypto mining firms like TeraWulf, already operating large-scale power-hungry facilities, have become attractive partners for companies seeking to expand into AI computing. TeraWulf has already seen growing interest in its facilities. In August, Fluidstack, an AI cloud platform, expanded its use of a TeraWulf-run data center in New York. Around the same time, Google increased its backstop commitment to TeraWulf by $1.4b, taking its total to $3.2b and lifting its equity stake in the miner to 14% from 8%. TeraWulf, Cipher Raise Capital To Expand Data Center Capacity Meanwhile, another mining firm, Cipher Mining, has signed a colocation deal with Fluidstack and Google. Under the agreement, Cipher will supply data center capacity. In return, Google will backstop US$1.4 billion in obligations and take an equity stake. In addition, Cipher is expected to seek more debt financing, similar to TeraWulf. Separately, in August TeraWulf said it plans to raise $400m through a private offering of convertible senior notes due 2031. The company explained that proceeds will partly fund capped call transactions. The rest will go toward expanding its data centers and other corporate needs. If completed, this financing would be one of the largest debt deals by a crypto miner shifting into AI infrastructure. Furthermore, it shows how Google is expanding its role in building out computing power to meet surging demand from AI developers.

Ark Invest also notes that Ethereum stands to be one of the biggest winners in this scenario, with XRP also set to capture significant value. Ethereum’s Share Of The Projected $25 Trillion Market Lorenzo Valente, Director of Research at Ark Invest, explained in a video post on X social media that Ethereum currently accounts for approximately 13.5% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization . He predicts that if the global crypto market cap climbs to $25 trillion within the next five years, Ethereum could command a market valuation of approximately $3.37 trillion. This translates into a price of about $28,000 per token—a level that would mark a historic moment for ETH. The Ark Invest Director pointed to key drivers underpinning the cryptocurrency’s strength to reach such a valuation. These include the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) on the Ethereum blockchain, the network’s rapid growth in DeFi, the growing presence of stablecoins, and ongoing innovations across Layer 2 solutions . Valente further notes that more than $120 billion in total value is already locked within Ethereum and its scaling networks, highlighting its liquidity dominance. For stablecoins, the blockchain accounts for over $100 billion of the sector’s $200 billion capitalisation, a commanding position that underscores its role as the backbone of the DeFi landscape . Notably, Valente emphasized ETH’s yield-bearing nature, with staking making the cryptocurrency one of the few revenue-generating digital assets. Beyond its ability to generate yield, the Ark Invest Director notes that Ethereum is also the number one collateral used on Layer 2s, a medium of exchange within NFT marketplaces, and the currency for paying network fees . He also believes that scaling improvements on Layer 1 and Layer 2 over the next five years could attract millions more users, reinforcing ETH’s dominance and positioning it as a unique asset unlike any other in the crypto market. XRP’s Growth Potential In A $25 Trillion Crypto Market While Ethereum is positioned at the forefront of Ark Invest’s projection, XRP remains one of the most closely watched altcoins in the market. Currently valued at approximately $2.8 billion after a recent decline , the cryptocurrency has a total market capitalization of $170.6 billion. For reference, the entire crypto market also has a market cap of $3.93 trillion, as of the time of this report. Based on these figures, XRP’s current market share is about 4.3% of the entire industry. If this ratio is maintained during the broader market’s projected rise to a $25 trillion valuation, XRP could achieve a market cap of roughly $1.05 trillion. With its current circulating supply , this would imply a price of approximately $17 per token, representing a more than sixfold increase from current levels.",Ethereum|Altcoin|ARK Invest|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Layer 1|Layer 2|Lorenzo Valente|real-world assets|RWAs|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 03:00:24

The expert, also a Bitcoin author and economist, predicts that there is at least a 50% chance that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high of $200,000 by June 2026, a forecast he shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday. Optimistic Projections For The Bitcoin Price Peterson’s optimistic outlook is grounded in his analysis of the Median Bitcoin Yearly Price Path chart, which suggests that October typically marks the beginning of a new upward trend for the Bitcoin price, extending through to June of the following year. He elaborated that achieving the $200,000 target would require an average monthly return of approximately 7%, translating to an 120% annualized increase. Furthermore, he noted a 50% or greater likelihood of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high by early November of this year. Related Reading: All-Time Highs For Gold, S&P500; Crypto Stands Alone In The Red – What’s The Root Cause? As seen in the chart below, Peterson outlined additionally, two potential bullish scenarios for Bitcoin’s trajectory. The most scenario points toward a surge to a new record of $240,000, while a more conservative estimate suggests a rise toward $160,000. Regardless, these indicators he referenced imply that the remainder of the year and subsequent months of 2026, could be marked by significant price increases for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. However, the broader crypto market performance has not been without its challenges. Investors Brace For Friday’s PCE Data On Thursday, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), experienced a downturn as investors shifted their focus to upcoming economic data, particularly following a sharp market correction earlier in the week. Traders are particularly attentive to Friday’s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred measure of inflation, which could have implications for future interest rate decisions. When interest rates decrease, more stable investments such as bonds or equities tend to offer lower yields, encouraging investors to seek riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ex-Binance CEO CZ Criticizes FT Report On YZi Labs, Calls It A ‘Negative Narrative’ Earlier in the week, a substantial sell-off occurred across the crypto market, marking the largest deleveraging event of the year. On Monday, many digital asset investors unwound bullish positions that had been established after the Fed’s recent quarter-point interest rate cut. Maja Vujinovic, CEO of Digital Assets at FG Nexus, commented on the situation, emphasizing that the recent liquidations stemmed from excessive leverage rather than failing market fundamentals. She noted, “Overheated funding post-Fed left traders exposed; once Bitcoin rolled over, forced unwinds hit ETH and altcoins hard.” Despite the cautious sentiment prevailing in the crypto market this week, Vujinovic pointed out that historical trends suggest these “leverage washes” often pave the way for a healthier market foundation.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Technically, Bitcoin trades inside a descending triangle, with resistance at $111,128 and support near $109,000. A breakdown risks $107,282 or $105,201, but the RSI near 38 suggests oversold conditions. A bullish candle at these levels could trigger a rebound to $113,900 and $117,372, where major resistance sits. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For traders, cautious accumulation between $109,000–$110,000 with stops under $105,000 remains viable. A recovery above $114,000 would confirm a breakout path toward $120,000. With U.S. states embracing crypto payments, altcoins expanding ecosystems, and stablecoin firms attracting billions, Bitcoin may be setting up for a renewed rally into year-end.

We’re not just building a treasury; we’re investing in the infrastructure that will empower billions of users to truly own their digital life. Growth-centric financing AlphaTON completed the latest financing package through two channels. Firstly, a private placement of around 6.32 million ordinary shares (at $5.73 each) raised about $36.2 million. The second one involved a $35 million loan secured with digital asset service provider BitGo Prime. These sources gave AlphaTON the funds it needed to make its first $30 million Toncoin tranche.

This significant event saw long positions, betting on price increases, getting overwhelmingly liquidated across major digital assets. It’s a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and rapid shifts that define the crypto landscape, leaving many traders caught off guard by sudden market movements. What Exactly Are Ethereum Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the market moves against their trade, and they no longer have enough collateral to maintain the position. For example, if you bet on Ethereum’s price rising (a long position) but it unexpectedly drops, your position might be liquidated to prevent further losses for the exchange. Over the past 24 hours, these forced closures were immense. Here’s a breakdown of the liquidation volumes for major cryptocurrency perpetual futures: ETH: $440 million liquidated, with long positions accounting for a substantial 89.86%. BTC: $280 million liquidated, with an even higher 96.34% of long positions affected. SOL: $85.56 million liquidated, with 92.93% of these being long positions. These figures highlight how predominantly long positions were hit, underscoring a market largely positioned for upward momentum that quickly reversed. Unpacking the $805 Million Crypto Market Shockwave This massive wave of liquidations, totaling over $805 million, highlights a crucial aspect of leveraged trading: it dramatically magnifies losses as well as gains. The overwhelming dominance of long liquidations suggests a market caught off guard by a sudden downturn or unexpected consolidation. Traders with high leverage, anticipating continued upward momentum, were the most vulnerable to these swift market corrections. The fact that Ethereum liquidations led the charge underscores ETH’s pivotal role. Often, ETH’s price movements can signal trends for other digital assets. Its significant decline contributed to a cascading effect across the ecosystem. This interconnectedness means a major move in one asset, especially Ethereum, can trigger widespread consequences and volatility. Navigating Volatility: Lessons from Recent Ethereum Liquidations For crypto participants, this event offers critical lessons in risk management. The allure of amplified profits through leverage is strong, but it comes with equally amplified risks. Understanding market dynamics and having a robust exit strategy are paramount. Diversification, setting stop-loss orders, and avoiding excessive leverage are fundamental practices to protect capital during volatile periods. Moreover, keeping an eye on fundamental developments and technical indicators can provide insights into potential market shifts. While no one can predict the market perfectly, informed decision-making based on thorough research can mitigate some risks associated with widespread Ethereum liquidations . Always remember, the crypto market can turn on a dime, making vigilance essential for any trader. In conclusion, the recent $805 million in crypto liquidations, heavily led by Ethereum, serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s unpredictable nature. It emphasizes caution and strategic planning, especially in leveraged trading. As the market evolves, adapting to its inherent volatility through sound risk management will be key to long-term success in digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations What exactly are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange. This happens when their collateral falls below a required margin due to the market moving significantly against their prediction. Why were long positions predominantly affected in this event? Long positions are bets that an asset’s price will increase. The high number of long liquidations indicates a sudden and significant price drop, catching traders expecting upward momentum off guard. This decline pushed many leveraged long positions below their liquidation thresholds. How can traders protect themselves from significant Ethereum liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, diversifying portfolios, and conducting thorough market research.

It’s crucial to be aware of an upcoming development that might impact your ability to move these digital assets. Binance has announced a temporary Binance KSM DOT suspension of deposits and withdrawals for both KSM and DOT, a move essential for supporting their respective network migrations. Understanding the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind this decision is key for every crypto enthusiast. What’s Happening with the Binance KSM DOT Suspension? Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently issued an official notice detailing the temporary halt of services for two significant blockchain projects: Kusama (KSM) and Polkadot (DOT). This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a standard procedure to facilitate important network upgrades. For Kusama (KSM) , the suspension of deposits and withdrawals will commence at 7:00 a.m. UTC on October 7 . Subsequently, Polkadot (DOT) will experience its service suspension starting at 7:00 a.m. UTC on November 4 . These specific dates highlight Binance’s proactive approach to ensure the safety and integrity of user assets during critical network transitions. It’s a temporary measure designed to support the underlying technology, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem. Why the Temporary Halt? Understanding Network Migrations The core reason behind this Binance KSM DOT suspension is to support ongoing “network migrations.” But what exactly does that mean for these prominent projects? Both Kusama and Polkadot are at the forefront of the Web3 movement, known for their innovative parachain architecture. Network migrations typically involve: Upgrades to Core Infrastructure: Enhancements to the blockchain’s fundamental code, improving performance, security, or adding new features. Parachain Slot Auctions & Migrations: Both KSM and DOT ecosystems regularly undergo processes where new parachains are integrated or existing ones migrate, requiring careful coordination. Ensuring Asset Safety: During complex upgrades, temporarily pausing transfers helps prevent potential issues like transaction errors, lost funds, or security vulnerabilities that could arise from interacting with a network in transition. Binance’s decision to implement the Binance KSM DOT suspension ensures that all user assets are securely handled and accurately reflected once the network upgrades are complete and stable. It’s a testament to the exchange’s commitment to protecting its users. Impact on Users: What You Need to Know and Do About the Binance KSM DOT Suspension While the suspension is temporary, it’s essential for KSM and DOT holders to understand its implications. During the specified periods, you will not be able to deposit new KSM or DOT into your Binance account, nor will you be able to withdraw existing KSM or DOT from the platform. Here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you anticipate needing to move KSM or DOT during these windows, ensure you complete your transactions well before the announced suspension times. Trading Remains Active: Typically, trading of KSM and DOT on Binance’s spot markets will remain unaffected. This means you can still buy, sell, or trade these assets within the exchange. However, always refer to Binance’s official announcements for the most precise details. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Binance’s official announcement channels and social media for updates regarding the exact resumption times. These can sometimes be adjusted based on the progress of the network migrations. The key is to avoid last-minute rushes and ensure your asset management aligns with these scheduled pauses. This temporary Binance KSM DOT suspension is a minor inconvenience for a greater good: a more robust and efficient blockchain. Ensuring a Seamless Transition: Binance’s Commitment Binance’s role in facilitating these network migrations goes beyond simply pausing services. The exchange actively collaborates with the Kusama and Polkadot development teams to understand the technical requirements of the upgrades. This proactive engagement allows Binance to: Conduct Thorough Testing: Before resuming services, Binance will conduct rigorous internal testing to confirm the stability and functionality of the upgraded networks. Safeguard User Funds: The primary objective of any suspension is to protect user assets from potential risks associated with network changes. Provide Clear Communication: Binance is committed to transparently informing its users about the status of the suspension and when services are expected to resume. Such coordinated efforts are vital in the fast-evolving crypto landscape, demonstrating Binance’s dedication to maintaining a secure and reliable trading environment. The Binance KSM DOT suspension is a testament to this commitment. Looking Ahead: When Will Services Resume? Once the respective Kusama and Polkadot network migrations are successfully completed and deemed stable by Binance, deposits and withdrawals will be reactivated. Binance will issue a separate announcement to inform users of the exact resumption time. It’s important to remember that the duration of these suspensions can vary. While specific dates are given for the start of the suspension, the end date is often contingent on the successful completion and verification of the network upgrades. Patience during these periods is appreciated, as the goal is always to ensure a smooth and secure transition for all. In conclusion, the upcoming Binance KSM DOT suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a strategic, temporary measure by Binance to support crucial network migrations for Kusama and Polkadot. This proactive step underscores the exchange’s commitment to asset security and network integrity. By understanding the reasons behind these suspensions and planning accordingly, users can navigate these periods with confidence, knowing that these upgrades pave the way for a more robust and advanced blockchain ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is Binance suspending KSM and DOT deposits and withdrawals? A1: Binance is implementing the Binance KSM DOT suspension to support crucial network migrations and upgrades for both the Kusama (KSM) and Polkadot (DOT) blockchains, ensuring the safety and integrity of user assets during these technical transitions. Q2: Will I still be able to trade KSM and DOT on Binance during the suspension? A2: Typically, spot trading for KSM and DOT on Binance will remain active during the suspension period. However, it’s always best to check Binance’s official announcements for any specific exceptions or changes. Q3: What should I do if I need to move my KSM or DOT during the suspension period? A3: If you anticipate needing to deposit or withdraw KSM or DOT, it is strongly advised to complete these transactions well in advance of the announced suspension times (October 7 for KSM, November 4 for DOT). Q4: How will I know when deposits and withdrawals for KSM and DOT resume? A4: Binance will issue a separate official announcement to inform users once the network migrations are successfully completed and deposits and withdrawals for KSM and DOT are reactivated. Users should monitor Binance’s official communication channels. Q5: Is there any risk to my KSM or DOT holdings during this suspension? A5: No, the suspension is a protective measure. Your KSM and DOT holdings on Binance remain secure.

Some analysts see recovery hinging on ETH reclaiming $4,200, while others lean bearish, eyeing a slide to $3,500 unless support holds. Are the Bulls Coming Back? Ethereum, which was at the forefront of gains this summer, briefly plunged below $4,000 earlier today (September 25) amid an ongoing red wave passing through the entire crypto market. It later surpassed the psychological level but remains 12% down on a weekly scale. Despite the negative performance, three crucial factors signal that a resurgence could be on the way. The first one is the diminishing supply of ETH tokens stored on crypto exchanges. CryptoQuant’s data shows that today the figure has dropped to a nine-year low of around 16.3 million coins. This development indicates that many investors have switched from centralized platforms to self-custody solutions, which in turn reduces immediate selling pressure. Next in line is Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). The technical analysis tool examines the asset’s recent price movements to indicate whether it has entered oversold or overbought territory. It ranges from 0 to 100, and readings below 30 suggest that the first scenario could be in play, which can result in a rally. As of press time, the RSI stands at roughly 22. ETH RSI, Source: CryptoWaves Last but not least , we will touch upon the latest whale activity that may also positively impact ETH’s valuation. X user ZYN revealed that ten new wallets have purchased over 200,000 tokens worth more than $800 million in the last 24 hours. Such actions reduce the amount of coins available on the open market and could be followed by a price pump (should demand remain constant or rise). Additionally, smaller players may view this as an encouraging sign and join the ecosystem by distributing fresh capital. The Analysts’ Take According to X user Lennaert Snyder, Ethereum’s road to recovery goes through a crucial reclaim of $4,200. “Watching that level for confirmation shorts and longs after the gain. Losing $3,900 support brings us to the $3,700 zone, holding that is key to maintain the weekly uptrend,” he argued . The analyst, using the X moniker Ted, leaned more bearish for the short term. He predicted that ETH will most likely retest $3,800, which could result in a further downtrend to $3,500. On the other hand, if it holds this level, “a rally will happen.” The post 3 Reasons Ethereum’s (ETH) Bull Run Isn’t Over Yet appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-26 03:38:42

The price is pinned closest to the lower Bollinger Band at $262.68, confirming it is still deep in a bearish zone. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Recent candles show repeated attempts to break lower, but buyers currently provide minimal support just above $260. The MACD remains strongly negative, though the histogram seems to be slightly easing. A breakdown below $260 would invalidate recovery hopes and could drag AAVE toward $245.

AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Momentum suggests AAVE may attempt a push toward $270–$274 if buyers sustain volume.

Authorities said the ordeal lasted nine hours before law enforcement intervened and the suspects fled the state. Kidnappers hold the family at gunpoint Prosecutors identified the men as Raymond Christian Garcia, 23, and Isiah Angelo Garcia, 24. The brothers are from Waller, Texas. Officials said they traveled to Minnesota and carried out the crime. The brothers confronted the father of a family outside his home in Grant, Minnesota. He was taking out the trash when the criminals appeared with an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun. They zip-tied his hands and forced him back inside. Inside the home, the suspects woke the man’s wife and adult son. Both were tied up and held at gunpoint. Prosecutors say that Raymond kept watch over them while Isiah focused on transferring cryptocurrency from the father’s accounts. Investigators say the brothers demanded access to digital wallets and forced large transfers into their own accounts. They also made repeated phone calls to an unidentified third person who appeared to guide the operation. The victim told them more funds were stored on a hardware wallet at a family cabin nearly three hours away. Isiah then drove the father to the cabin while carrying the shotgun. There, the victim was forced to move the remaining funds. During this time, Raymond stayed in the family home, holding the wife and son hostage with the rifle. Prosecutors estimate the suspects stole a total of $8 million in cryptocurrency. A criminal flees after seeing the policemen After hours, the son managed to call 911 when Raymond stepped outside the house. The police arrived within minutes, and they found the wife and son restrained inside the house. They saw Raymond fleeing out the back door. The police found a suitcase hidden in a tree line after searching the area. They found a disassembled AR-15 rifle, ammunition, clothes, and drinks. At the same time, Isiah was driving back with the father. Several emergency vehicles passed them on the road unknowingly. Isiah later abandoned the shotgun near a middle school parking lot. The situation forced the school to cancel its homecoming football game for safety. Authorities connected the brothers to the crime using receipts and surveillance. A Wendy’s receipt from the suitcase showed that Isiah had rented a car in Houston days earlier. Surveillance footage confirmed Raymond had rented a Motel 6 room in Roseville, Minnesota, before the attack. The car used in the kidnapping was later tracked on traffic cameras. It was seen in Oklahoma before returning to Texas a day later. Authorities arrest the brothers Law enforcement arrested the brothers in Waller, Texas. Officials say Isiah confessed after being taken into custody. He admitted that he and his brother traveled to Minnesota, tied up the family, and forced the crypto transfers. County prosecutors filed state charges, including kidnapping with a firearm, aggravated robbery, and burglary. Moreover, federal prosecutors filed additional kidnapping charges. Both brothers are awaiting their first federal court appearance, and prosecutors will seek detention until trial. Prosecutors said the investigation is ongoing. Authorities are still trying to identify the third person who allegedly guided the transfers by phone.

Some analysts suggest the altcoin’s price is retesting a make-or-break level that will determine the direction of its next big move. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Holds Key Support, But Analyst Warns Rally Could Be At Risk SUI Hits Two-Month Low On Thursday, SUI is retesting the local range lows after an 8% daily drop from the $3.40 area to a key support level. The recent market pullbacks have momentarily halted most bullish rallies, sending leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) to an eight-week low of $3,800. Now, SUI’s rally, which was fueled by institutional interest, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), and positive developments for the network, has declined over 21% in the weekly timeframe. The cryptocurrency has seen a strong three-month rally following its early Q3 breakout to its multi-month high of $4.44. The altcoin has hovered between the $3.10-$4.00 levels over the past three months, attempting to break out of this range multiple times. Last week, SUI’s price retested this area for the third time during this period, but has since been rejected from the range highs after failing to hold the $3.80 mark as support. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been “stuck” inside the $3.10-$4.30 range since May, briefly losing the support area during the June pullback. According to the trader, the five-month consolidation should eventually lead to a big price move out of the range. “As we approach the range low/support, it’s back on my radar for a potential range play,” he noted, adding that it would need a strong bounce from this area to hold the macro range. On the contrary, Daan suggested that “If it sits there and doesn’t do anything, then that’s a red flag,” as it would risk losing the crucial multi-month support and retracing toward the June lows. Price Retests Make-Or-Break Level Amid the retracement, SUI is also retesting another crucial support. As multiple analysts pointed out, the cryptocurrency is trading within a textbook ascending triangle pattern on a higher timeframe. Notably, the price has been compressing within the pattern’s upper and lower boundaries since early Q2. Throughout the multi-month consolidation, each time the altcoin has bounced from the ascending support, it has retested the flat upper trendline. Ali Martinez highlighted that a successful breakout from the bullish formation’s resistance line around the $4 barrier would set the stage for a retest of its all-time high (ATH) level of $5.35 and an overall 75% rally toward the $7 area. Similarly, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that “it’s really time to pay attention” to the bullish formation, as the price compression continues and a break from the pattern seems imminent. Related Reading: Solana DATs Arrive In Australia: Fitell Corporation Announces $100M SOL Treasury Strategy Per the post, SUI’s price must hold the triangle’s rising lower trendline to be able to attempt to break out of the pattern again. Failing to maintain this key support, currently located around the $3.10 area, could invalidate the setup and lead to a retest of the $2.40-$2.90 zone. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $3.15, a nearly 10% decline in the monthly timeframe.

ING, UniCredit, & Other European Banks Are Coming Together For Stablecoin As announced in a press release by Italian banking giant UniCredit, the bank is joining forces with eight other major European institutions to launch a stablecoin pegged to the euro. “This digital payment instrument, leveraging blockchain technology, aims to become a trusted European payment standard in the digital ecosystem,” read the press release. The stablecoin will have compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), the bloc’s comprehensive framework on cryptocurrencies. MiCAR covers a range of areas, like issuance and custody of digital assets, as well as the operation of platforms related to them. The full list of banks that have come together to form the consortium for the euro-denominated token includes: ING, Banca Sella, KBC, Danske Bank, DekaBank, UniCredit, SEB, CaixaBank, and Raiffeisen Bank International. All of these are major banking players, but two are perhaps particularly prominent: ING and UniCredit. ING is a Dutch multinational bank that’s designated as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). G-SIBs are considered to be institutions so ingrained into the world financial order that any disruptions related to them can have widespread economic consequences. Italy’s UniCredit was also included in this category until 2023, when FSB removed it from the list. The nine banks have formed a new company in the Netherlands, planning to get approval from the Dutch Central Bank as an e-money institution. The press release noted that the consortium is welcoming more banks to join them. The stablecoin, which is currently slated for issuance in the second half of 2026, will be positioned as a real European alternative to the currently US-dominated market. “At UniCredit, we believe in the importance of a stronger Europe and in the power of constructive dialogue and collaboration,” said Fiona Melrose, Head of Group Strategy and ESG at UniCredit. “By joining this consortium of leading European banks, we are contributing to fill the need for a trusted, regulated solution for on-chain payments and settlement.” The consortium also intends to appoint a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the near future, subject to regulatory approval, to lead the new entity in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, in the US, stablecoins have been seeing regulatory momentum lately. Just this Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) launched an initiative to explore their use as collateral in derivatives markets, a move that could further integrate them into mainstream finance.

It dropped to a low of $2.75, down from the all-time high of nearly $3.2. Still, its strong technicals and the ongoing asset growth in the XRPR ETF will likely lead to a strong rebound soon. REX-Osprey XRPR ETF is thriving One catalyst for the XRP price is that the recently launched REX-Osprey XRPR ETF is thriving. It has had inflows in the last five days, even as the crypto market crashed . According to its website, it has gained over $70 million in assets since it launch last week. Data on ETF.com shows that the XRPR ETF has had inflows in each day since its launch last week. The ongoing ETF inflows is important because it is happening in the same week that the XRP price has moved into a bear market after plunging by over 25% from its highest level this year. It is common for cryptocurrency ETFs to have outflows when they are plunging. The inflows are also notable because XRPR is not a cheap ETF as it has an expense ratio of 0.75%, much higher than other cryptocurrency funds. For example, the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) has an expense ratio of 0.15%, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has a 0.25% ratio. The popular Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has a ratio of 0.03%. A 0.75% ratio is a big one because it means that a $100,000 investment costs about $750 a year for an asset that one can invest in directly and avoid the fee. As such, it means that Wall Street is ready for more XRP ETFs. XRP ETF approval is coming up The ongoing inflows into the XRPR ETF is a sign that the more mainstream XRP ETFs will be popular among investors. For one, these funds are being issued by companies that are more mainstream than REX-Osprey. They include popular firms like Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Invesco. The funds will also be much cheaper than the XRPR ETF. Like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the expense ratios are likely to range between 0.15% and 0.25%. Most importantly, these funds will be based on the more common 33’ Act that has been used on other mainstream ETFs. XRPR fund is based on the Investment Company Act of 1940. XRP price technical analysis XRP chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the XRP price has moved into a bear market. It has plunged by over 25% from its highest point this year. Ripple’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a descending channel and has moved below the neutral point at 50. On the positive side, the coin wants to form a break-and-retest pattern by moving to the upper side of the falling wedge. This pattern is one of the most popular continuation signs. The XRP price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is now in the handle section. It has also formed a bullish pennant pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout a bulls target the year-to-date high of $3.6655, up by about 35% from the current level.

From new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, furniture, and heavy trucks to a TikTok US divestiture order, Asian equities opened lower, while crypto markets faced over $1 billion in liquidations. Investors are navigating rising trade tensions, regulatory shifts, and market volatility worldwide. Here’s a glance at major developments on Friday morning. Trump slaps latest salvo of tariffs US President Donald Trump announced a new wave of tariffs set to begin on October 1, 2025, targeting key imports like branded pharmaceutical drugs, kitchen cabinets, upholstered furniture, and heavy-duty trucks. The most impactful move is a 100% tariff on patented medicines, unless companies are actively building manufacturing plants in the US. This is part of Trump’s ongoing “America First” drive to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign imports. The tariffs also include a 50% duty on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on furniture, and 25% on heavy trucks, affecting industries from home renovation to logistics. Though supporters highlight job protection and industrial revival, economists warn these tariffs could raise consumer prices and intensify inflation pressures. The pharmaceutical industry, especially companies operating globally, faces a critical challenge to ramp up US manufacturing fast or pay heavy tariffs, which might lead to higher medicine costs for consumers. Read full report here. Trump signs executive order on TikTok deal Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order declaring that his plan to sell TikTok’s US operations meets the requirements of a 2024 federal law aimed at preventing a ban on the popular app. The order sets the stage for a divestiture of TikTok’s US business from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to a consortium of American and international investors, including Oracle, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and tech entrepreneur Michael Dell. The deal, valued at around $14 billion, aims to ensure US user data is managed securely by American entities while keeping the platform operational. Trump noted he won approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping for the arrangement and emphasized that the new governance would treat all viewpoints fairly. The executive order also delays enforcement of the TikTok ban until January 23, 2026, allowing time to finalize the sale. TikTok’s 170 million US users get a reprieve amid national security concerns. Read full report here. Asian markets open in red Asian markets opened lower on Friday, weighed down by a complex mix of factors including fresh US tariffs and stronger-than-expected US economic data. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.7%, with traders cautious about how a stronger dollar could hurt export-heavy economies. South Korea’s Kospi 100 dropped over 2%, pressured by tech stocks facing supply chain uncertainties and export challenges. China’s Hang Seng index fell 0.9%, dragged down by drugmakers hit hard by the US 100% tariff on pharmaceutical imports. The mainland’s CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite were also in the red, reflecting renewed valuation concerns and a global risk-off sentiment. India’s markets are expected to open under pressure, especially in pharma and export-oriented sectors, given its role as a major supplier of generics to the US. Investors remain watchful ahead of crucial US inflation data, balancing hopes for economic recovery against rising trade tensions. Read full report here. Crypto liquidations mount ot $1 billion Cryptocurrency markets faced intense selling pressure on Thursday, triggering more than $1 billion in liquidations of leveraged trading positions, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin tumbled below $109,000, hitting its lowest level in nearly a month, while ether plummeted 8% toward $3,800. The sharp selloff wiped out over $400 million in ether longs alone, with bitcoin liquidations totaling $265 million. Crypto equities took a hit as well, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) stock falling as much as 10% to a five-month low, erasing all its gains for 2025. Other bitcoin mining companies like MARA and Riot Platforms also declined by 7-8%. This sudden downturn has pushed bitcoin towards critical support levels near $107,000, raising questions about whether it can hold or if further declines lie ahead. The selloff reflects mounting concerns about market volatility and leverage risk in crypto trading.

The world of cryptocurrency is often rife with strong opinions and bold forecasts. Recently, a significant and often controversial debate has ignited around Ethereum price predictions , particularly those made by prominent figures. This article delves into the claims surrounding these forecasts and their potential implications for the market. Are Recent Ethereum Price Predictions Creating Exit Liquidity? Andrew Kang, the insightful co-founder of crypto trading firm Mechanism Capital, has presented a compelling, albeit controversial, argument. He suggests that the recent optimistic Ethereum price predictions from figures like Tom Lee might be serving a different purpose than simply boosting investor confidence. Kang argues these bullish forecasts could be inadvertently creating “exit liquidity.” This means they encourage new capital to enter the market, allowing large holders – potentially including the Ethereum Foundation itself – to sell off their significant holdings at favorable prices. He drew a parallel to the Celsius bankruptcy events of 2021-2022, implying a pattern where market hype facilitates strategic exits. The sentiment from Kang also touched upon the tendency of what he termed “Baby Boomer investors” – an apparent reference to Lee – to promote established, rather than truly innovative, technologies. This perspective adds another layer to the discussion, questioning the underlying motivations behind such high-profile endorsements. Understanding Tom Lee’s Bullish Ethereum Price Predictions Tom Lee, a managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, has certainly not shied away from making significant bullish calls for Ethereum. His recent statements have undeniably fueled market excitement and contributed to the current buzz around Ethereum price predictions . Specifically, Lee has predicted that ETH could soar to an impressive range of $10,000 to $12,000 by the end of the year . This audacious forecast has naturally captured the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Furthermore, he has expressed a belief that Ethereum holds more promise than Bitcoin, suggesting its market capitalization is likely to eventually surpass that of the leading cryptocurrency. These predictions, coming from a well-known financial analyst, carry considerable weight and can significantly influence market sentiment. They often lead to increased buying pressure as investors look to capitalize on potential gains, creating the very liquidity that Kang refers to. Navigating the Volatility of Ethereum Price Predictions In the dynamic crypto landscape, discerning the true intent and impact of any Ethereum price prediction is crucial. While bullish forecasts can inspire confidence, they also highlight the inherent volatility and speculative nature of digital assets. Here are some key considerations for investors: Verify Information: Always cross-reference predictions with fundamental analysis and broader market trends. Understand Motivations: Consider who is making the prediction and what their potential stake or influence might be. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, regardless of how optimistic a prediction appears. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between long-term technological potential and short-term price movements driven by sentiment. The debate between Kang and Lee underscores the complexity of the crypto market. It’s a reminder that while expert opinions can be valuable, they should always be weighed against a broader understanding of market mechanics and personal investment goals. Ultimately, the crypto market thrives on information, but it also demands critical thinking.

But what if a project could paradoxically exploit these very inefficiencies to eliminate them, paving the way for a more robust and efficient ecosystem? This is precisely the groundbreaking vision behind Treehouse DeFi , as highlighted in a recent report by global crypto research firm Four Pillars. Unpacking the Paradox: What Makes Treehouse DeFi So Unique? Four Pillars’ insightful report, titled “Treehouse: Looking at the Next Chapter of DeFi,” delves into Treehouse’s innovative strategy. At its core, Treehouse aims to generate profit by identifying and leveraging market inefficiencies, while simultaneously working to eradicate these same discrepancies. This might sound counterintuitive, but it’s a powerful mechanism designed to bring greater stability and fairness to the DeFi landscape. DOR (Decentralized Reference Interest Rate): Imagine a benchmark interest rate that isn’t controlled by a central entity but is instead determined by the market itself, in a transparent and decentralized manner. DOR is designed to be this foundational element, providing a reliable and unbiased reference rate for various financial products within DeFi. This is crucial because a standardized, trustworthy rate is essential for complex financial instruments to thrive. tAsset (Treehouse Asset): This component actively seeks out and capitalizes on market discrepancies. By identifying mispricings or imbalances, tAsset can generate returns. However, its ultimate goal isn’t just profit; it’s to push the market towards greater equilibrium. As tAsset exploits these inefficiencies, it naturally reduces them, making the market more efficient over time. Think of it as a self-correcting mechanism for the DeFi ecosystem. This dual approach suggests a future where profitability and market improvement are not mutually exclusive but rather intertwined, driving positive change within decentralized finance. Navigating Risks in Treehouse DeFi: Ensuring Stability Any innovative financial system, especially in the volatile crypto space, must prioritize robust risk management. The Four Pillars report acknowledges this, detailing Treehouse’s prudent measures to safeguard its operations and user funds. Managing risk effectively is paramount for the long-term viability and adoption of any Treehouse DeFi solution. Limited Leverage for tETH: Currently, Treehouse restricts the leverage process for its tETH asset to a single cycle. This is a critical step in preventing excessive risk-taking and cascading liquidations, which can destabilize the entire system during periods of high volatility. By limiting leverage, Treehouse aims to build a more resilient platform. WstETH Liquidity for Emergency Redemptions: Furthermore, Treehouse strategically holds back a portion of wrapped staked Ethereum (wstETH) liquidity. This reserved liquidity acts as an emergency buffer, ensuring that users can redeem their assets even during unforeseen market shocks or liquidity crunches. This commitment to liquidity provision instills confidence and enhances the platform’s reliability. These proactive risk management strategies demonstrate Treehouse’s commitment to building a sustainable and secure environment, a crucial factor for attracting broader participation in Treehouse DeFi solutions. The Future Impact: How Treehouse DeFi Could Transform Finance The implications of Treehouse’s approach, particularly with DOR, are profound. Four Pillars draws a compelling parallel to the past: just as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) served as a benchmark that facilitated the creation of a massive $600 trillion fixed-income market four decades ago, DOR possesses the potential to unlock a similar, perhaps even larger, era for decentralized finance. The introduction of a reliable, decentralized reference rate could pave the way for a plethora of new financial products and services. Imagine a future where: New types of fixed-income instruments, previously difficult to implement in DeFi due to a lack of stable reference rates, become commonplace. Lending and borrowing protocols gain greater transparency and efficiency, reducing costs and increasing accessibility for users worldwide. More sophisticated derivatives and hedging tools emerge, offering better risk management options for participants in the crypto market. The potential for Treehouse DeFi to standardize and stabilize key aspects of decentralized finance is immense, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. Concluding Thoughts: A New Horizon for DeFi The report from Four Pillars paints a vivid picture of Treehouse as a potential game-changer. By embracing a paradoxical strategy of profiting from and simultaneously eliminating market inefficiencies, Treehouse offers a fresh perspective on overcoming the persistent limitations within decentralized finance. Its core components, DOR and tAsset, are not just theoretical constructs but practical solutions designed to foster a more robust, transparent, and efficient financial ecosystem. If successful, Treehouse DeFi could indeed usher in a new era, making DeFi more accessible, reliable, and ultimately, more impactful for global finance. Frequently Asked Questions About Treehouse DeFi Here are some common questions about Treehouse and its innovative approach to decentralized finance: Q1: What is the main problem Treehouse DeFi aims to solve? A1: Treehouse aims to overcome the inherent limitations and inefficiencies within decentralized finance by creating a more robust, transparent, and stable ecosystem. It does this by paradoxically exploiting and then eliminating market discrepancies. Q2: How does DOR contribute to Treehouse’s vision? A2: DOR, the Decentralized Reference Interest Rate, is designed to provide a reliable, market-driven benchmark interest rate. This is crucial for the development of complex financial products in DeFi, much like LIBOR was for traditional finance. Q3: What is the role of tAsset in the Treehouse ecosystem? A3: tAsset actively identifies and capitalizes on market inefficiencies. While generating profit, its primary function is to drive the market towards greater efficiency and equilibrium by correcting these discrepancies. Q4: How does Treehouse manage risk for its users? A4: Treehouse implements robust risk management, including limiting tETH leverage to a single cycle to prevent excessive risk, and holding back wstETH liquidity for emergency redemptions, ensuring user asset safety and platform stability. Q5: What impact could Treehouse DeFi have on the future of decentralized finance? A5: By establishing a decentralized reference rate (DOR) and improving market efficiency (tAsset), Treehouse could unlock a new era for DeFi, fostering the creation of new fixed-income markets, enhancing lending/borrowing protocols, and offering more sophisticated financial tools.

With the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now adopting a more favorable stance toward crypto assets, the stage is set for a surge in ETF applications. Industry insiders are optimistic about the potential for new products that aim to provide exposure to alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Hedera (HBAR). SEC Streamlines Crypto ETF Approval Process The SEC’s newly updated standards for crypto ETFs, announced just last week, promise to stimulate demand for exchange-traded products linked to these cryptocurrencies. Analysts are particularly eager about the anticipated approval of products associated with Solana and XRP, with expectations that these ETFs could make their debut as early as October. Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group, noted a surge in filings with the SEC, stating , “We’ve got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming. We’re all getting ready for a wave of launches.” Jonathan Groth, partner at DGIM Law, also pointed that the fourth quarter of the year is shaping up as “boom time” for the crypto ETF market, further adding to the anticipation for the altcoins to join this trend. The SEC’s recent vote to adopt new listing standards streamlines the approval process, reducing the time required for new crypto products to launch from up to 270 days to 75 days or less. This change eliminates the need for individual regulatory reviews for each application, allowing firms to bring products to market more swiftly. As Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, explained, “These are the rules we had been anticipating.” Market Readiness In Question Grayscale has already taken advantage of this, rolling out its Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF less than 48 hours after receiving approval from the SEC to transition from a private to a publicly traded fund. This ETF includes major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside XRP, Solana, and Cardano. To qualify for the expedited approval process, an ETF must meet at least one of three criteria: the underlying asset must already be traded on a regulated market or have futures contracts regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that have been active for at least six months. Alternatively, an existing crypto ETF tied to that coin, with at least 40% of its assets invested directly in the cryptocurrency , could also pave the way for approval. Despite the excitement surrounding these new developments, questions remain about the market’s appetite for a flood of crypto ETFs centered on lesser-known coins. Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets product at asset manager VanEck, highlighted the need for investor education, noting, “There will be a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of, and instead of years, there will be weeks or months to provide that education.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|bitcoin|BTCUSDT|crypto|Crypto ETF|crypto ETFs|Crypto ETFs approval|cryptocurrencies|Cryptocurrency|spot crypto ETF,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MARKET|SOL|ADA,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 05:00:47

Chainlink Is Coiling Inside A Triangle Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a triangle pattern forming in the weekly price of Chainlink. Triangles refer to consolidation channels from technical analysis (TA) that involve an asset trading between two converging trendlines. Like any other consolidation channel, the upper trendline acts a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. In other words, tops can be likely to occur on retests of the former and bottoms at the latter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 18%, But Whale Withdraws 122 Million DOGE From Binance There are a few different types of triangles, with some of the popular ones being the ascending, descending, and symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides which type a particular triangle falls into. Ascending and descending triangles have one trendline parallel to the time-axis: upper line in the former and lower one in the latter. Symmetrical triangles lie between the two, having both lines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. Chainlink has potentially been trading inside a triangle over the last few years, but as the below chart shared by Martinez shows, this particular triangle doesn’t cleanly fit into any of these types. From the graph, it’s visible that Chainlink’s triangle lies is angled upward, but not fully, so it lies somewhere between a symmetrical triangle and an ascending one. LINK made a retest of the upper line of the pattern earlier in the year and ended up finding rejection. The cryptocurrency is now on the way down, but the analyst thinks an extended drawdown may not actually be so bad. “A dip to $16 on Chainlink $LINK would be a gift,” says Martinez. This price is where the 0.5 Fibonacci level lies. Fibonacci Extension/Retracement levels are lines drawn using ratios derived from the famous Fibonacci series. The analyst has taken LINK’s top and bottom from the last few years as the 1 and 0 levels, respectively, and has drawn retracement levels between them. The $16 mark happens to be where one such key retracement level lies. Martinez has highlighted in the chart what path the asset could end up following if it bounces off this level. It would appear that in the analyst’s view, a rebound from the line could end up leading to a breakout from the triangle and set a potential target at the 1.272 extension level, drawn up from the 1 level (top). In Chainlink price terms, this level corresponds to almost $100.

LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is floating around $20.25, down over 17% in the last seven days.

This article provides a DOGE price forecast as a risky pattern forms despite the ongoing DOJE ETF inflows. Dogecoin price technical analysis as a rising wedge forms The daily timeframe chart indicates that the DOGE price has declined significantly over the past few days. It has plunged from a high of $0.3076 on September 13 to the current $0.2275, its lowest level since September 8. The coin has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It has also moved below the ascending trendline that connects the lowest level since June 23. Read more: XRP price prediction as XRPR ETF assets near $100 million The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have moved downwards. The RSI has dropped below the neutral point at 50, a sign that the downward momentum is continuing. Worse, the Dogecoin price has formed a rising wedge pattern. This pattern comprises of two ascending and converging trendlines. In most periods, this pattern leads to a strong bearish breakout. However, a closer look shows that the two lines of the wedge are not nearing their convergence. As such, the coin could rebound and move to the upper side of the wedge at around $0.3076. DOGE price will ultimately have a strong bearish breakout, potentially to the key support level at $0.1884, its lowest level on August 3. This lowest point is notable because it formed a double-top point at $0.2870. A move above the upper side of the channel at $0.3076 will invalidate the bearish Dogecoin price forecast. DOGE price chart | Source: TradingView DOJE ETF is gaining momentum There are some potential catalysts for the Dogecoin price in the coming weeks. One of these main catalysts is the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF , which was launched last week. Data on the website shows that the DOJE ETF is gaining momentum in a very difficult period. It now has over $27 million in assets a few days after it was launched. Mot notably, it has had inflows in each trading day, which is a sign of robust demand. The ongoing ETF inflows is a positive thing as market participants wait for the spot ETF approval for companies like Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs will be better, simpler, and cheaper than the REX-Osprey one because they will use the ‘33 Act. The other potential catalyst for the DOGE price is that the Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates. It slashed them by 0.25% last week, and hinted of two more this year. Cryptocurrency prices do well when the Federal Reserve is cutting rates. Most importantly, there are signs of more demand of Dogecoin from companies launching their treasury companies. CleanCore Solutions has launched a $600 million DOGE treasury fund, while Bit Origin and Neptune Origin have announced plans to buy 70.5 million and 1 million coins.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum had a tough week after losing support at $4,000. Its price also closes with a 13% loss. This correction is quite significant and comes after bulls failed to move ETH above $5,000. Since then, sellers have had the upper hand. If buyers cannot reclaim $4,000 as support, this level will turn into a key resistance and push this cryptocurrency much lower and towards $3,345, which is the next major support on the chart. Looking ahead, the next few days are critical for Ethereum as they will decide if the price continues down or reverses. Ideally, buyers return in force soon to stop this downtrend, but that appears unlikely at the time of this post. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) With most of the market in red, XRP also lost 10% of its valuation this week, and its price fell to the key support at $2.72. This level was tested before in early September and held well, but a second test could be less successful if buyers don’t show interest soon. Should $2.72 fall, then this level will turn into a resistance, and buyers will retreat to $2.55, where the asset has a higher chance to bounce. The momentum is also bearish on the daily and higher timeframes, which makes this an uphill battle for bulls. Looking ahead, XRP failed to make a higher high most recently. That’s a sign of weakness that could prolong this downtrend for some time. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano holders had a disappointing week after the price fell by 16%. That’s a significant crash for such a short period of time, which has taken the price to the $0.77 support. Should that fall, buyers will retreat to $0.64 next. This most recent impulse up in mid-September failed to reclaim a price of $1. With a lower high confirmed, sellers took over and pushed ADA lower. Because of this, this cryptocurrency has a high chance of making lower lows in the near future. Looking ahead, this downtrend is likely to continue and only find relief around the $0.60 area where buyers were active in the past. Moreover, the price action shows Cardano has lost its bullish momentum and would be a surprise to see it recover the recent losses. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin made a new record price last Sunday at $1,083. However, the celebrations were short-lived. Since that moment, the price entered a correction that made it close the week with a 5% loss. The asset also fell back under $1,000, but has great support at $900 and $830, where buyers could return in the future. The $1,000 level could also act as resistance going forward. Looking ahead, despite the ongoing correction, this cryptocurrency remains one of the strongest performers in the market. Any future recovery will likely see BNB perform very well, which could see it attempt new price records towards the end of 2025. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) Surprisingly, HYPE is the worst performer on our list this week after a crash of 26%! This huge loss came on the back of the recent launch of Aster, the Binance-backed decentralized exchange created to compete with Hyperliquid. Liquidity left HYPE and moved to Aster, which had a tremendous impact on its price. Sellers visited the $40 support before buyers returned. The current resistance levels are found at $44 and $50. Looking ahead, the battle between decentralized exchanges just got tuned to the max as liquidity and traders switch between platforms chasing quick gains. While Hyperliquid may suffer right now, this could also be a good opportunity to get exposure at discounted prices.

Most altcoins crashed even harder, which is why the leveraged liquidations have skyrocketed to nearly $1 billion, according to CoinGlass. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView It was less than a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency stood tall at $118,000 after the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the first time this year. However, the asset failed to maintain its run and started to lose value rapidly. Harrowing trading days were Monday (September 22) and Thursday (September 25). At first, BTC dumped from $115,500 to $112,000. It managed to recover some ground mid-week, but the bears initiated another leg down yesterday, which drove bitcoin further south to its lowest position since the start of the month at $108,600 (on Bitstamp). Although it has recovered around a grand since then, BTC is still below $110,000, which is a crucial support level, according to Ali Martinez. The next one actually managed to hold the freefalls, which is set at $108,530. As usual, many industry observers and commentators began speculating on the state of the correction. Some, such as Peter Schiff, called it the start of a bear market. Crypto analysts remain more optimistic. Captain Fabrik, for instance, referred to the current retracement as a ‘healthy’ one and predicted a surge to $140,000 as long as BTC can reclaim the $113,000 resistance. Nevertheless, almost all altcoins followed bitcoin on the way south, posting massive losses. Ethereum is among the poorest performers as it lost the $4,000 support and slumped beneath $3,900 yesterday. XRP is deep in the red as well, dumping by 10% weekly and struggling to remain close to $2.80. This enhanced volatility has harmed over-leveraged traders, as the total value of wrecked positions has shot up to almost $1 billion on a daily scale.

According to the bank's new report, stablecoin issuance could reach $1.9 trillion by 2030. The previous estimate was $1.6 trillion. In an optimistic scenario, that figure could reach as much as $4 trillion. The report, authored by Ronit Ghose, Global Head of Future Finance at Citi Institute, and Ryan Rugg, Global Head of Digital Assets at Citi Services, described stablecoins as “the ChatGPT moment in institutional blockchain adoption.” Related News: Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Makes Statement Addressing the Future of All Cryptocurrencies The report estimates that the $1.9 trillion stablecoin issuance could support approximately $100 trillion in annual transactions. However, it notes that this amount is still small compared to the $5 trillion to $10 trillion that major banks transfer every day. Citi argued that stablecoins “help us reimagine, rather than disrupt,” the current system, but also noted that these tools cannot provide solutions in every area. It noted that many countries already use low-cost instant payment systems, particularly for local payments, and that cross-border transactions remain the main problem. *This is not investment advice.

The “core-core” rate, excluding fresh food and energy prices, cooled to 2.5% in September after hitting 3.0% in August. While still above the BOJ’s 2% target, the pullback has spurred yen weakness and sharpened focus on the US CPI report later in the day. Tokyo’s inflation figures are often seen as a preview of nationwide trends. Friday’s numbers signaled a slowdown in underlying price growth, potentially making it harder for the Bank of Japan to justify more rate hikes. Nonetheless, the unchanging main gauge shows the data’s sensitivity to government measures, reinforcing why the BOJ is unlikely to base its rate decisions on just one data release. Yoshiki Shinke, senior executive economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, even commented, “With today’s Tokyo data not showing much change other than the special one-off factors, I don’t think this will prevent the BOJ from mulling a rate hike. This won’t push the BOJ, but it won’t make them hesitate either, as factors are clear.” Rice prices dropped to 46.8% from 67.9% in August Energy prices were a key driver of September’s inflation , with the impact amplified by a smaller drag from government utility subsidies compared with last year. Subsidies cut 0.5% from overall inflation in September 2024, versus 0.3% this year, creating a base effect that led to the first annual rise in energy costs in three months. The broader free daycare program, introduced this month, also trimmed 0.3% from inflation, and water prices also slipped, dragging the index lower. Shinke remarked, “The expanded free daycare was the factor that brought the Tokyo CPI much lower than market consensus. The daycare fees offset a boost from base effects from last year’s utility subsidies. Other than that, there was little surprise.” The annual rise in rice prices also eased to 46.8% from 67.9% in August, extending a five-month streak of deceleration. More moderation is anticipated, though households may not feel much relief yet. Japan’s central bank maintained rates at 0.5% Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stepped down this month after suffering multiple election setbacks that cost him party backing. Much of the discontent stemmed from the ongoing cost-of-living squeeze. The race to head the Liberal Democratic Party has drawn five candidates, all of whom have vowed to address household cost pressures. The leadership election will be held on Oct. 4. Meanwhile, Japan’s central bank decided to keep rates steady at 0.5% on Friday, as markets had predicted. However, Friday’s decision wasn’t unanimous: board members Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata opposed holding rates steady. The dissent spurred markets to see around a 50% probability of a rate change at the Oct. 30 meeting, more than double previous expectations. Former BOJ board member Makoto Sakurai said the bank can hike rates when it sees fit, with inflation still rising. He added, however, that the timing will depend on how carefully officials want to review the economic fallout from US tariffs. Tokyo’s housing market is still heating up, with prices in the city’s 23 central wards surging. Tokyo Kantei data shows that the average price of a second-hand family condo jumped 38% in August from a year earlier to ¥107 million ($719,680).

Second, he noted that a selection of smaller-cap cryptocurrencies achieved returns ranging from four times to as high as thirty-three times their initial value within only a few months. These movements underline the rapid growth potential that exists in the altcoin sector when conditions are favorable. By bringing attention to both major and minor assets, the analyst presented a picture of a market that has delivered meaningful opportunities across different categories of tokens.

He stated that take-profit targets were made publicly available for all followers. At the same time, the analyst mentioned that more specific levels were shared through his Patreon and Discord communities. The analyst concluded by contrasting disciplined strategies with the behavior of those who rely on influencer-driven content. He stated that many traders miss opportunities when they choose to follow hype rather than charts and technical signals. In his view, ignoring technical analysis in favor of unverified promotional narratives has been a key reason why some participants failed to leverage the profitable moves witnessed in recent months. The analyst’s remarks underscore the importance of structured market analysis. Technical analysis offers clear signals and entry and exit levels, while hype-driven approaches are unpredictable and often expose traders to unnecessary risk. He implied that those who remained committed to chart-based strategies were better positioned to benefit during this cycle.

The complaint was submitted on Wednesday in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Elon Musk-led artificial intelligence company alleges that OpenAI unlawfully targeted former xAI employees, including engineers Xuechen Li and Jimmy Fraiture, along with a redacted former senior executive, believed to be former CFO Mike Liberatore. xAI: OpenAI recruited former employees to extract information According to the filing, OpenAI was trying to access Grok’s source code, internal business strategies, and data center operations through a “deeply troubling pattern” of recruiting its former employees “OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans, including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers, then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” the complaint stated. The defendant company’s spokesperson has called the lawsuit “the latest chapter in Mr. Musk’s ongoing harassment” and denied any wrongdoing. In the last 2 years, there has been a long-running feud between Elon Musk and OpenAI’s leadership, Sam Altman. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before leaving the company in 2018, has tried to convince the courts to shut down CEO Altman’s decision to change the organization’s business model from a nonprofit into a for-profit business. xAI propounded that OpenAI had violated both federal and California state law by inducing former employees to share confidential information. The complaint identified Li, Fraiture, and a senior finance executive as examples of staff recruited by OpenAI to obtain access to xAI’s trade secrets, allegedly. “By hook or by crook, OpenAI clearly will do anything when threatened by a better innovator, including plundering and misappropriating the technical advancements, source code, and business plans of xAI,” the complaint read. Musk goes after OpenAI, Apple over leaked emails The case also included communications between Musk’s legal team and former xAI executives. A screenshot of an email from Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, sent in July, accused a former executive of breaching confidentiality obligations, who replied with a short email saying, “suck my dick.” “We sent them many warning letters, but they continued to cheat. Lawsuit was the only option after exhausting all others,” CEO Musk wrote on X Thursday. A little over a month ago, the Grok developer slapped Apple with a separate lawsuit, lodged in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. It accused Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings to favor OpenAI’s ChatGPT while suppressing rivals like Grok. “Apple has joined forces with the company that most benefits from inhibiting competition and innovation in AI: OpenAI, a monopolist in the market for generative AI chatbots,” the filing said. Musk had threatened to sue Apple directly earlier in the month, claiming the company had committed “an unequivocal antitrust violation” for effectively making it impossible for competing AI applications to top App Store rankings. Apple is the gateway to the Internet for half of America. They are making it impossible for any other AI company to succeed by relentlessly promoting OpenAI in every way possible! https://t.co/p6WdOLuzO5 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2025 Apple denied the claims, saying its App Store operations were “fair and free of bias.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, responded to Musk’s accusations in a statement posted earlier this month. “This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like,” Altman wrote. xAI mulls expansion into government contracts Elsewhere, through a statement on X published Thursday evening, xAI announced it was launching “xAI For Government,” a program designed to give federal agencies access to its Frontier AI models. According to the public notice, every federal department and agency will be able to use Grok 4 and Grok 4 Fast for a fee of $0.42 per department for 18 months. The initiative also includes hiring and assigning teams of Grok engineers to help agencies integrate and maximize the models’ capabilities. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This significant acquisition, reported by Lookonchain, involved 60,333 ETH through over-the-counter (OTC) trades with major players like Wintermute and Coinbase. While such a massive purchase often signals strong conviction, the address currently shows an unrealized loss of $16 million, adding a layer of mystery to this high-stakes play. Unpacking the Mysterious Ethereum Whale Accumulation This recent acquisition by an anonymous Ethereum whale represents one of the largest individual ETH purchases in recent times. The whale executed these trades over a week, choosing OTC desks rather than public exchanges. OTC trades are often preferred by institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals for several reasons: Price Stability: Large orders on public exchanges can significantly impact market prices, leading to slippage. OTC desks facilitate trades directly, minimizing this effect. Privacy: These transactions are less visible to the broader market, allowing buyers and sellers to move large volumes without immediate public scrutiny. Liquidity: OTC desks can handle massive volumes that might overwhelm regular exchange order books. Wintermute and Coinbase, both prominent entities in the crypto space, served as the intermediaries for these substantial transactions. This highlights their role in facilitating large-scale institutional or private capital movements within the Ethereum ecosystem. Decoding the Whale’s Strategy: What Drives Such a Bold ETH Play? The fact that this particular Ethereum whale is currently sitting on an unrealized loss of $16 million raises questions about their immediate strategy. Why would an entity purchase such a large amount of ETH only to see its value dip shortly after? One common perspective is that whales often operate with a long-term investment horizon. Short-term price fluctuations might be less concerning if the investor believes in Ethereum’s fundamental value and future growth. This accumulation could be part of a broader strategy to build a substantial position ahead of anticipated future price appreciation, perhaps driven by: Upcoming Ethereum Upgrades: Continued development and upgrades to the Ethereum network, such as improvements in scalability and efficiency, could be a key factor. Growing DeFi and NFT Ecosystems: Ethereum remains the backbone for a vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects. Institutional Adoption: Increasing interest from traditional financial institutions in Ethereum as a digital asset. However, it also underscores the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Even the most sophisticated players can face immediate paper losses, demonstrating that timing the market perfectly is a challenge for everyone. The Market Impact of a Major Ethereum Whale When an Ethereum whale makes such a significant move, it naturally draws attention and can influence market sentiment. While the immediate effect of OTC trades is limited due to their private nature, the sheer volume of 60,333 ETH entering a single address is noteworthy. It signals strong conviction from a deep-pocketed investor, which can sometimes inspire confidence among smaller investors. Conversely, if the whale were to begin selling off such a large holding, it could potentially exert downward pressure on ETH prices. This dynamic highlights the significant influence that large individual holders can wield in the relatively less liquid cryptocurrency markets compared to traditional finance. Tracking these anonymous addresses, often dubbed “whales,” provides valuable insights into potential market trends and sentiment. While the identity of this particular whale remains shrouded in mystery, their actions offer a fascinating glimpse into high-stakes crypto investment strategies. Navigating Volatility: What Does This Mean for ETH Investors? For everyday investors, the actions of an Ethereum whale like this serve as a powerful reminder of several key aspects of the crypto market: Market Volatility is Real: Even large, well-funded players can experience immediate unrealized losses. This emphasizes the importance of risk management and investing only what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Vision: Whale accumulations often suggest a belief in long-term value, encouraging a similar mindset for retail investors rather than chasing short-term gains. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While whale movements can be indicative, they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Thorough personal research into Ethereum’s fundamentals, technology, and ecosystem is crucial. This whale’s move could be a strategic accumulation phase, anticipating future growth. However, it’s also a testament to the unpredictable nature of asset prices, even for those with substantial capital. In conclusion, the mysterious accumulation of $240 million in ETH by an anonymous Ethereum whale is a captivating development in the crypto space. Despite an initial unrealized loss, this substantial investment through OTC desks points towards a strategic, long-term conviction in Ethereum’s future. It serves as a compelling example of the bold moves that define the cryptocurrency market and reminds all investors of the importance of strategic planning and understanding market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale? A1: An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH), typically enough to influence market prices or sentiment with their trades. Q2: Why do whales use OTC trades instead of exchanges? A2: Whales use over-the-counter (OTC) trades to execute large orders without causing significant price fluctuations on public exchanges, maintain privacy, and access deep liquidity. Q3: What does “unrealized loss” mean in this context? A3: An unrealized loss means the current market value of an asset is lower than its purchase price, but the loss has not yet been “realized” because the asset has not been sold. Q4: How do whale movements impact the crypto market? A4: Whale movements can impact market sentiment and prices. Large accumulations can signal confidence, while significant sales can create downward pressure, especially in less liquid markets. Q5: Should I base my investment decisions on whale activity? A5: While whale activity can offer insights, it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and consider your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) inaugurated an international operations centre for its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan (e-CNY) in Shanghai, according to a report from the South China Morning Post. PBOC Deputy Governor, Lu Lei, framed the move as part of a “historical inevitability” in payments innovation, with the aim of offering a more efficient, inclusive, and open global cross-border payment system. The initiative is intended to enhance settlement efficiency, and serve as building blocks toward a broader framework for e-CNY integration. China's CBDC push comes in the wake of the country pulling the brakes on tokenization efforts. Earlier this week, China's securities regulator warned some brokerages to pause their real-world asset (RWA) tokenization businesses in Hong Kong.

The blue-chip universe that XRP (XRP) occupies is an ongoing discussion on regulatory clarity, cross-border payments, and centralized exchange liquidity. However, a recent wave of sub $0.50 tokens continues to emerge. Market data indicates a handful of ecosystem-rich, community-valuable, and scaling tokens are good candidates to multiply over the next few years. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Tron (TRX), and Hedera (HBAR) are three that rally with XRP and test $5 before 2027. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): $0.0022 Trading while in Stage 13 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022. $25,964,729 has been raised with a goal of $28,775,000, and over 15.9 billion tokens have been sold. Investor traction indicates a high conviction in LILPEPE’s plan to become the world’s first meme-centric Layer 2 blockchain. Little Pepe’s infrastructure is differentiated by the fact that it isn’t a meme coin. The team’s infrastructure is built around ultra-low fees, fast finality, and sniper-bot resistance. The ecosystem plan includes a dedicated memes launchpad, a hub for creators and community-owned projects. With 0% tax, a staking rewards pool, and deep liquidity allocations, LILPEPE may offer both stability and scalability uncommon in meme-based assets. Community engagement is further fueled by the Little Pepe Mega Giveaway, running across Stages 12–17. With 68,700 entries and 105 days left, top buyers will share over 15 ETH in rewards. The biggest investor may secure 5 ETH, while 15 random buyers could each win 0.5 ETH. In parallel, the project has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, with commitments to debut on two leading centralized exchanges at launch and long-term ambitions to target the world’s largest platform. If meme culture continues to blend with DeFi innovation, market indicators suggest that Little Pepe could evolve into a top-performing ecosystem by 2027. Tron (TRX): $0.3447 Tron (TRX) has quietly maintained its relevance through scalability and adoption in decentralized entertainment and payments. Trading at $0.3447, TRX processes millions of daily transactions, supported by its robust ecosystem of stablecoins and DeFi applications. Tron’s appeal lies in its low transaction costs and high throughput, which continue to attract developers building consumer-focused dApps. The integration of USDT on Tron’s network has also driven liquidity, making it one of the most used blockchains for payments. Although regulatory pressures may pose challenges, the consistent on-chain volume suggests TRX could benefit if digital assets gain broader adoption. Historical performance suggests that projects that sustain utility while keeping fees minimal often exhibit long-term appreciation. Hedera (HBAR) – $0.2466 At its current market price of $0.2466, Hedera (HBAR) serves as a business-focused blockchain alternative. Hedera’s hashgraph consensus produces fast transaction speeds, low energy consumption, and gas fees that are stable in price. A governing council oversees Hedera, comprising companies such as Google, IBM, and Boeing, which lends the project credibility and potentially a more secure blockchain for real-world tokenization efforts. HBAR’s supply chain, tokenized carbon credits, and digital identity use cases could potentially play into blockchain adoption among institutions. Hedera continues to see an increasing number of partnerships being announced, which could lead to an increase in volume as more entities seek scalable and eco-friendly infrastructure. Should more global enterprises adopt distributed ledger technology, Hedera could maintain relevance deep into the next bull cycle due to its unique form of governance. Final Thought As XRP continues to absorb investor focus as the regulatory situation clarifies, sub-$0.50 tokens like Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Tron (TRX), and Hedera (HBAR) may present some of the biggest upside crypto assets to go up significantly in price before 2027. Research indicates that these projects possess ideal combinations of scalability, ecosystem activity, and community strength. However, in the case of Little Pepe, the project has a Layer 2 chain with an exclusive focus on memes. This added to Little Pepe’s community incentivization, such as the Mega Giveaway, may make its meme-based blockchain a unique hedge for investors.

These tokens demonstrate substantial growth potential propelled by unique technological advances and strategic market positions. This discussion pivots around these under-the-radar tokens, their ecosystems, and their potential to mimic or surpass the investment trajectory of well-known cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The Case for Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Stirring interest in the crypto community, LILPEPE stands out with its unique position as a meme-centric Layer 2 blockchain solution. Currently in Stage 13 of its presale at $0.0022, it has already garnered $25,964,729 towards a goal of $28,775,000. The infrastructure of Little Pepe dismisses typical meme coin characteristics, focusing instead on ultra-low fees, fast transaction finality, and resistance to sniper bots. The project's emphasis on community engagement through events like the Little Pepe Mega Giveaway, which offers significant ETH rewards to top buyers, adds to its allure. The development team has ambitious plans for listings on major exchanges, indicating a robust growth trajectory. Tron (TRX) - A Staple in Decentralized Solutions Trading at $0.3447, Tron continues to secure its position in the crypto space through its scalable network designed for decentralized applications focused on entertainment and payments. With a high transaction volume and integration of stablecoins like USDT, TRX presents a compelling case for sustained relevance and potential price increases, given its utility and minimal transaction fees. Hedera (HBAR) - Pioneering Business Applications Hedera distinguishes itself with a price point of $0.2466 and a business-oriented approach. Leveraging hashgraph consensus technology, Hedera offers rapid transactions, low energy consumption, and predictable gas fees. Governed by a council that includes industry giants like Google and IBM, Hedera's use cases in supply chains, carbon credit tokenizations, and digital identity are positioned to catalyze broader institutional adoption. Final Analysis As XRP garners mainstream attention and possibly gains regulatory clarity, emerging tokens like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , TRX, and HBAR are poised to captivate the market's interest. Their unique propositions in technology and market engagement position them as potential dark horses capable of reaching or even surpassing the $5 mark by 2027.

Four tokens under $1 are drawing serious attention for their growth potential in 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) all offer different paths to profit. These four may answer those wondering if $500 could become far larger. And while each has strong points, Little Pepe could deliver the sharpest 12x upside, giving investors a chance to ride early momentum before it becomes mainstream. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The New Meme Leader with Utility At the time of writing, Little Pepe's presale price is $0.0022 during stage 13. Early investors from stage 1 are already up by 120% and current buyers still have a 36.36% potential gain before the listing price of $0.003. The project has raised $25.9 million with more than 15.9 billion tokens sold, proving demand is not slowing down. What makes Little Pepe stand out is not just its meme energy but the real infrastructure behind it. Built on a next-generation Layer 2 network with zero tax on transactions, it blends fun with functionality. It has been audited by CertiK, giving it a security seal, and is already listed on CoinMarketCap, which signals credibility. The team has introduced a $777k giveaway plus a Mega Giveaway rewarding top presale buyers from stage 12 to stage 17 with over 15 ETH in prizes. Community is a big part of the project’s DNA; online energy reflects that. From June to August, LILPEPE peaked in question volume on ChatGPT 5, surpassing Dogecoin, SHIB, and PEPE. That is no small deal in a world where online trends shape financial outcomes. If adoption continues as expected, Little Pepe could be the under $1 token that delivers 12x returns by the end of 2025. Tron (TRX) – The Utility Powerhouse At the time of writing, TRON is trading around $0.35. It has carved out a massive role in stablecoin transactions, particularly USDT, which flows heavily through the TRON network. Its ecosystem is practical, widely used, and quietly building momentum. While a 12x jump would take TRX near $4.20, which is ambitious given its current market cap, the strength of its utility cannot be ignored. Stablecoin settlement volumes are critical to crypto adoption, and TRON is in the middle. Investors looking for steady exposure to one of the most used blockchains may find TRON an interesting part of a diversified $500 bet. Cardano (ADA) – The Smart Contract Visionary At the time of writing, Cardano is trading around $0.92. It has seen accumulation in the $0.85 to $0.95 range, with whales building positions ahead of a potential breakout. ADA’s appeal is its slow but deliberate development of innovative contract features, staking, and scalability upgrades. For ADA to deliver 12x gains, it would need to hit around $11, which would mean a massive surge in adoption and use cases. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Community Titan At the time of writing, Dogecoin trades around $0.28. What continues to drive DOGE is its meme status and the constant reinforcement from the community and culture. Recently, U.S. markets saw ETFs offering exposure to DOGE, which adds legitimacy and may attract institutional buyers. A 12x rise would push DOGE toward $3.36, which feels like a stretch but not entirely out of reach if sentiment explodes in another wave of meme mania. Final Thoughts Crypto is unpredictable, but that is also where opportunity hides. TRON offers utility, ADA delivers long-term vision, and DOGE thrives on community. Yet it is Little Pepe that feels like the breakout contender. With a current presale price of $0.0022, 120% gains already achieved by early investors, and still 36.36% upside before its launch, it stands out as the under $1 token with the strongest shot at 12x growth in 2025. For those ready to take a chance with $500, spreading across these four could work, but anchoring around LILPEPE might just turn today’s small bet into tomorrow’s big win.

Its growing utility across its network demonstrates its potential to make strides in market value, positioning it as a steady investment for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Innovative Pioneering with Cardano (ADA) Cardano, typically found at around $0.92, is progressively enhancing its system with smart contracts and scalability solutions.

Ohio To Accept Payments In Bitcoin According to a recent official announcement , the Ohio Board of Deposit has selected a vendor to enable the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments – including BTC – for state fees and services. It is worth highlighting that Ohio’s move to legitimize crypto payments follows a proposal that was passed by the board in May 2025, which designated cryptocurrencies as an authorized financial transaction device. Commenting on the development, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said that the Ohio Board of Deposit’s decision to accept crypto payments will aid Ohio in maintaining its position as a leading state for business. LaRose added: There’s a reason why we now rank among the top five states in the nation to do business. It’s because we’re not afraid to embrace the tools, trends and technologies that incentivize job creators to come here. My office processes hundreds of thousands of financial transactions each year, and we’ve heard a growing demand for a cryptocurrency payment option. I’m excited and ready to be the first to provide it to our customers. With this development, Ohio has become the fourth US state to go ahead with allowing payments in digital assets for government services. Other states that offer similar facilities are Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana. To recall, in April 2025, Colorado became the first US state to accept tax payments in cryptocurrencies. At the time, the state’s Governor, Jared Polis, remarked that Colorado residents can use PayPal’s Cryptocurrency Hub to pay taxes with crypto. Similarly, Utah’s Senate passed House Bill 230 earlier this year to establish several custody protections for the state’s crypto miners. Among other things, the Bill provides the right to mine Bitcoin, run a node, develop software, and participate in staking without regulatory overreach. Are State BTC Reserves Next? While Ohio has become the latest state to accept cryptocurrencies for government fees and services, there are several other states currently in contention to create their own strategic Bitcoin reserves. The following chart shows the current status of strategic Bitcoin reserve plans across different states in the US. Currently, only Texas , Arizona, and New Hampshire have approved state-level strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation. On the contrary, states like Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming have rejected the proposal of having a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, 16 states are still in the proposed stage. At press time, BTC trades at $111,121, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Frank LaRose|Ohio|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|USA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 06:00:18

XRP’s liveliness metric recently hit a two-month low, signaling that long-term holders are keeping their coins off exchanges rather than selling. This dormancy reflects strong confidence in XRP’s future, and historically, such periods of low liveliness have often preceded bullish price movements, making it a key indicator for potential upward momentum. The Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (LTH NUPL) indicates that major XRP holders are sitting on minimal unrealized gains, giving them little reason to sell. This metric, a key measure of holder conviction, suggests that despite market weakness, LTHs remain steadfast, a strong signal that XRP could be poised for a rebound. Together, these metrics highlight XRP’s on-chain resilience, with long-term holders providing a stabilizing force amid short-term volatility. Their steadfast positions often signal accumulation phases, which historically precede significant price rallies, positioning XRP for a potential upward move amid intensified accumulation at the $2.70-$3.0 range. XRP Technical Analysis: Bearish Pressure Intensifies XRP is showing signs of increasing bearish momentum as recent price action indicates a potential continuation of the downtrend. Technical indicators on the 2-hour chart highlight growing selling pressure, signaling caution for traders and investors. Chart Overview The Ichimoku Cloud , a widely respected trend-following indicator, has turned bearish for XRP. The price has decisively moved below the cloud, which historically signals weakness and a higher probability of further declines. This breakdown indicates that XRP has lost key support levels, confirming that sellers are currently in control. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending downward, reflecting waning buying momentum. An RSI moving lower suggests that bullish interest is fading, and bears may continue to exert influence on the market. The combination of a bearish Ichimoku Cloud and a declining RSI creates a technical backdrop for potential additional downside pressure. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.76, representing a 3.1% drop in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data . Conclusion XRP’s on-chain metrics reveal a resilient long-term holder base that could underpin a bullish reversal. With low liveliness and minimal selling pressure from major stakeholders, the cryptocurrency shows signs of strategic accumulation and market confidence despite currently facing significant bearish pressure.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-26 06:04:50

The model in question revealed that Bitcoin follows M2 changes with a delay of approximately 12 weeks and predicted that if this correlation continues, BTC could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. However, Pal argued that this relationship broke down starting July 16th. While global M2 continued to expand, Bitcoin traded sideways throughout the summer. According to Pal, this was not due to the model's obsolescence, but rather to the liquidity tightening measures implemented by the US Treasury Department through the Treasury General Account (TGA). Related News: Surprise Altcoin Launches Major Buyback Program - Sets Date for Radical Update The NPL is the US government's main operating account at the Federal Reserve, where tax revenues, bond sales, and other cash flows are collected and used to cover federal spending. Pal noted that the Treasury has refilled the NPL by issuing approximately $500 billion worth of bonds since July, bringing the balance to a multi-year high of approximately $800 billion. This liquidity drain has depressed cryptocurrencies the most among risk assets. Pal predicts that the TGA has now strengthened sufficiently that the liquidity drawdown will be completely over by the end of the month. He argues that Bitcoin could re-enter its M2-driven upward trajectory once market conditions return to normal. *This is not investment advice.

This expiry event is a big one because it is the end of the month and the end of the third quarter, so there could be some volatility on spot markets, which have tanked this week. More uncertainty from the US Federal Reserve has rattled markets as high-risk assets become less appealing, deepening the September correction. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.76, meaning that there are more long contracts expiring than shorts, as the asset continues to retreat. Max pain is around $110,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has reached $2.7 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also around $2.2 billion OI at $120,000, but $95,000 is a popular strike price for short sellers with $1.9 billion in OI. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is around $60 billion, which is close to record highs. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $80 billion, which is still close to peak levels, according to Coinglass. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $22.3B in crypto options expire on Deribit; one of the biggest quarter-end expiries. $BTC : Notional: $17.06B | Put/Call: 0.76 | Max Pain: $110K $ETH : Notional: $5.20B | Put/Call: 0.80 | Max Pain: $3,800 Q3’s largest… pic.twitter.com/FDT1tWomYH — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) September 25, 2025 Following the market slump earlier this week, “implied volatility (IV) for major terms showed little change, but skew significantly shifted toward puts, with put premiums substantially exceeding call premiums,” said derivatives provider Greeks Live. “This indicates a sharp increase in the options market’s expectation of downside risk.” In addition to today’s bumper batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 1.3 million Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $5.3 billion, max pain at $3,800, and a put/call ratio of 0.80. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $18 billion, reports Coinglass. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $22.4 billion. Crypto Market Correction Deepens Crypto markets have continued their downward slide all week, with total capitalization falling to a four-week low of $3.84 trillion by Friday morning. Bitcoin fell below $109,000 in late trading on Thursday, losing support at the $112,000 zone. The asset is now 12% down from its peak and poised for further losses as the ‘Septembear’ correction appears to be deepening. Ethereum is even weaker, slumping to $3,830 before recovering to $3,950 on Friday morning in Asia. ETH is now 20% down from its all-time high.

Imagine a scenario where companies strategically investing in digital assets could face a staggering 50% drop in their stock value. This isn’t just speculation; it’s a stark warning based on an analysis by CryptoQuant, specifically highlighting the danger posed by PIPE investor sell-offs . Understanding the Threat of PIPE Investor Sell-Offs Many companies entering the crypto space seek capital through various means. One common method is a Private Investment in Public Equity, or PIPE, deal. In essence, PIPE financing allows private investors to purchase newly issued shares of a public company at a discount to the current market price. It’s a way for companies to raise funds quickly, and for private investors, it offers a potentially lucrative entry point. However, these deals come with a catch: mandatory lock-up periods. During this time, private investors cannot sell their shares. Once this lock-up period expires, a significant risk emerges. CryptoQuant’s report explains that with current stock prices often trading above the original PIPE offering prices, these investors are highly incentivized to sell their holdings for a profit. This rush to sell, often by a large number of investors simultaneously, can flood the market with shares, creating immense selling pressure. This pressure is precisely what can drive down a company’s stock price, potentially by as much as 50%. Why Are Crypto Strategy Firms Especially Vulnerable to PIPE Investor Sell-Offs? Companies that have strategically invested in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies after securing PIPE funding are particularly exposed. Their business model, which often involves holding volatile assets, adds another layer of complexity. The market may already be sensitive to their crypto exposure, making them more susceptible to investor sentiment shifts. CryptoQuant specifically identified several firms facing this risk, including Kindley MD, Strive, and Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). These companies have notably integrated BTC into their strategic investments. The impending expiration of lock-up periods for their PIPE investors means they are on the clock, facing a critical juncture that could significantly impact their valuations. It’s a classic supply-and-demand scenario. When a large supply of shares suddenly becomes available, and there isn’t equivalent buying demand, prices tend to fall. For companies with substantial PIPE financing, the volume of shares held by these private investors can be considerable, making the potential impact of PIPE investor sell-offs quite severe. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies for Firms and Investors So, what can companies do to mitigate these risks? Proactive management is key. Transparency with shareholders about PIPE deal structures and upcoming lock-up expirations can help manage expectations. Companies might also consider strategies such as: Share Buybacks: If financially feasible, a company could buy back its own shares to absorb some of the selling pressure. Investor Relations: Engaging with PIPE investors to understand their intentions and potentially stagger sales. Diversified Funding: Exploring alternative funding methods to reduce reliance on PIPE deals in the future. Strategic Communication: Clearly articulating the long-term value of their crypto strategy to maintain investor confidence. For individual and institutional investors, understanding these dynamics is crucial. When evaluating companies that have engaged in PIPE financing, especially those with significant crypto exposure, it’s vital to: Monitor Lock-Up Schedules: Keep an eye on when these periods are set to expire. Assess Valuation: Evaluate if the current stock price fully accounts for potential selling pressure. Diversify Portfolios: Spread investments across various asset classes and companies to reduce concentrated risk. Due Diligence: Thoroughly research a company’s funding structure and investor base. The potential for a 50% stock drop is not something to be taken lightly. It underscores the importance of understanding the mechanics behind how companies raise capital and the subsequent obligations and risks that can arise. The analysis by CryptoQuant serves as a powerful reminder for both companies and investors to remain vigilant. Conclusion: Vigilance Against PIPE Investor Sell-Offs is Paramount The warning from CryptoQuant about the risk of substantial stock drops due to PIPE investor sell-offs is a critical insight for anyone involved in the crypto market. While PIPE deals offer a quick way for crypto strategy firms to raise capital, the deferred selling pressure from private investors can create significant volatility. Both companies leveraging these deals and investors holding their shares must remain acutely aware of lock-up expiration dates and their potential market impact. Understanding these financial mechanisms is essential for navigating the complex and often unpredictable landscape of crypto-infused public markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a PIPE deal in simple terms? A PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) deal is when a public company sells its stock to private investors, often at a discount, to raise capital quickly. These investors typically agree not to sell their shares for a specific period, known as a lock-up. Q2: Why are PIPE investor sell-offs a risk for crypto strategy firms? Crypto strategy firms that have used PIPE deals face a risk because once the private investors’ lock-up periods expire, they are likely to sell their discounted shares for profit. This large volume of selling can flood the market and drive down the stock price, potentially by a significant margin, especially if the firm’s core assets are volatile cryptocurrencies. Q3: Which companies were mentioned by CryptoQuant as facing this risk?

Executives say Australia is high on the list of potential new markets. The milestone marks a turning point for the company. After years of heavy investment in artificial intelligence and self-driving technology, Baidu’s autonomous vehicle business is beginning to prove it can stand on its own. Apollo Go’s domestic performance is laying the groundwork for its push abroad. It has given more than 14 million rides since it started, logging millions of trips a quarter. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it completed 2.2 million fully driverless rides, almost two and a half times its number from a year prior. While profits remain modest, Baidu sees global pilots as viable if each vehicle can cover its costs. The company has already held discussions with Australian officials about potential deployments. It is also in talks with Southeast Asian regulators, where cities like Singapore and Kuala Lumpur are advancing frameworks for autonomous transport. Baidu builds a global robotaxi network Baidu isn’t just setting its sights on Australia; it is keen to spread beyond Asia. Earlier this month, Apollo Go received 50 more trial licenses in Dubai, doubling its total fleet to about a hundred cars in the United Arab Emirates. According to Dubai’s Roads & Transport Authority, the partnership could reach more than 1,000 fully autonomous vehicles in the next few years. And then there’s Baidu in Europe, which is moving cautiously but ambitiously. The company set up a Swiss corporation to abide by local laws that govern where data must be stored, and hired staff on the ground to oversee operations. Deals with American ride-hailing giants are providing other openings, too. A tie-up with Uber will enable Apollo Go vehicles to ply to certain international markets, excluding China and the U.S. At the same time, a partnership with Lyft will open doors for launches in the UK and Germany from 2026, upon receiving regulatory approvals. Europe, however, brings its own hurdles. Technical obstacles and concerns over cybersecurity, privacy, and road safety are slowing the approval process. Halton Niu, general manager of Baidu’s overseas intelligent driving unit, noted that some regulators may initially be hesitant. But seeing Apollo Go in action often changes minds. During a June visit to Baidu’s Beijing campus, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde even took a ride in a robotaxi herself. Baidu faces rising competition and risks Baidu is not the only one that is running to build lucrative robotaxi services. Rivals like Alphabet’s Waymo and General Motors-backed Cruise are scaling their own fleets, as Tesla continues to promise broader autonomous capabilities through its vehicles. What sets Baidu apart, analysts say, is price. With China’s established electric vehicle supply chain, Apollo Go vehicles are less costly to make and deploy than Western competitors. That price advantage could be especially important in markets sensitive to cost, including Southeast Asia and Australia. Still, Baidu faces steep hurdles in convincing regulators, gaining public trust, and adapting vehicles for different traffic systems. So far, only a handful of Chinese cities are profitable, and expanding the bedrock globally will require further investment. Since 2013, Baidu has poured billions into autonomous driving research, building a fleet of more than 1,000 vehicles operating in China and abroad. With Apollo Go reaching profitability, the company says its long years of investment are finally beginning to pay off. However, for Australian commuters, the Baidu robotaxi may be available soon. The era draws closer, as China’s largest search engine turns its driverless cars into a global business. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

52281456,589784,1758870048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52281456.jpeg,Global Crypto Crackdown: Interpol Freezes 400 Wallets In Massive Scam Operation,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-crackdown-interpol-freezes-400-wallets/,"Interpol has announced a significant recovery of assets totaling $439 million as part of a recent operation aimed at dismantling online scams, which included a substantial amount in crypto assets. This initiative, which took place from April to August of this year, involved collaboration among authorities from over 40 countries and territories. The operation resulted in the blocking of 68,000 bank accounts and the freezing of approximately 400 cryptocurrency wallets. $97 Million In Crypto Seized The scams targeted during this operation were varied, encompassing voice phishing, romance scams, online sextortion, investment fraud, money laundering linked to illegal online gambling, business email compromise, and e-commerce fraud. According to Interpol, the recovered assets included $342 million in traditional currencies along with $97 million worth of physical and crypto assets. This marked the sixth phase of an ongoing international law enforcement collaboration known as HAECHI, which has been financially supported by South Korea. Previous phases of this initiative, culminating in November 2024, had also yielded significant financial recoveries along with 5,500 arrests from crypto-related crimes. Theos Badege, Director of Interpol’s Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre stated: While many people believe that funds lost to fraud and scams are often irretrievable, the outcomes of HAECHI operations demonstrate that recovery is indeed possible. As one of INTERPOL’s flagship financial crime operations, HAECHI is a prime example of how global cooperation can protect communities and safeguard financial systems. While Interpol did not provide specific figures on arrests made during this latest operation , it did note that authorities in Portugal apprehended 45 individuals involved in a complex syndicate that had been siphoning funds intended for “vulnerable families.” Cyber-Crime Tactics In another notable case, the Royal Thai Police reported seizing $6.6 million in a single operation—marking the largest recovery in the country to date. This case involved a sophisticated business email compromise scheme executed by a transnational organized crime group consisting of Thai and West African nationals. Additionally, South Korean national police collaborated with authorities in the United Arab Emirates to recover about $3.9 million in Korean won that had been sent to an illegitimate bank account in Dubai. This incident occurred after a Korean steel company discovered that shipping documents had been forged. Romance scams, investment fraud, and other cyber-enabled crimes to target digital asset investors are also said to frequently originate from Southeast Asia, operated by organized crime groups, which often employ tactics involving kidnapping and human trafficking to staff these operations.

The new moves were revealed by the White House via Trump’s posts on Truth Social and they’re aimed at forcing companies to build inside the U.S. or deal with costly consequences. But not every company is treated the same. The new drug tariffs won’t apply to pharmaceutical firms that are already building drug plants in America. If the company has started construction—even if it’s just breaking ground—their drugs will be exempt. “There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started,” Trump posted . The rule applies to all branded or patented drugs, meaning those protected by intellectual property rights and sold under trade names, blocking generic versions from competing until the patents run out. Trump raises tariffs to push factories back to the U.S. Trump said the goal is simple: bring drug production back home. And it’s not an empty threat. U.S. drug manufacturing has declined sharply over the years, but companies like Eli Lilly, AbbVie, and Johnson & Johnson have already started investing in domestic plants. Trump is trying to accelerate that change with financial pressure. For him, it’s about getting manufacturing jobs out of overseas labs and back into American factories. That same logic is being used on trucks. Just hours after the pharma announcement, Trump said he’s hitting imported “Heavy (big!) Trucks” with a 25% tariff, also effective from October 1. He said the trucks are hurting U.S. companies and called the move necessary to protect national security. “Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,” he wrote on Truth Social. These U.S.-based truck builders are expected to gain an edge over foreign competition once the tariffs kick in. Just a day earlier, the Department of Commerce said it launched new national security probes into imports of robotics, industrial equipment, and medical devices. And this isn’t limited to machines. The investigation now covers personal protective gear, including N95 masks, surgical gloves, syringes, needles, and other medical supplies. Any new duties from these sector-specific probes would stack on top of Trump’s country-specific tariffs, multiplying the cost for foreign manufacturers. However, both Japan and the European Union have made agreements that may keep them safe from additional fees. Asia markets slide as Trump widens tariff dragnet The global markets didn’t sit quietly. Japan’s Topix Pharma Index dropped 1.47% immediately after the announcement. Major Japanese drugmakers like Daiichi Sankyo and Chugai Pharmaceutical fell 2.11% and 3.64%, while Sumitomo Pharma took a heavier hit, plunging 5.33%. In South Korea, big names like Samsung Biologics dropped 1.71%, and SK Bio Pharmaceuticals tumbled 3.71%. The hits kept coming. In Hong Kong, Alibaba Health Information Technology fell 2.92%, and JD Health lost 2.23%, both pulling the market down. Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 stayed flat, but the Topix index managed a 0.59% gain, reaching a new all-time high. Investors were also reacting to new inflation numbers from Tokyo, where core inflation came in at 2.5%, lower than the 2.8% economists expected. The headline number was steady at 2.5%. Tokyo’s stats often signal where national inflation is headed. South Korea’s Kospi index posted the biggest loss in the region, falling 2.02%, while the smaller Kosdaq shed 1.57%. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 hovered just below flat. Over in China, the CSI 300 stayed flat, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped 0.86%, showing that the tariff shock was felt widely across Asia-Pacific.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-to-xrp-investors-supply-shock-is-coming-heres-why/,"Egrag Crypto, a well-followed analyst in the digital asset community, recently emphasized the significance of a development reported by Whale Insider. In a post highlighting the update, Whale Insider announced that FAssets have officially gone live on the Flare mainnet. According to the update, holders of XRP can now mint FXRP and utilize it within Flare’s decentralized finance ecosystem. Egrag’s brief commentary on the matter pointed towards an incoming “Supply Shock.” His comment underscored his view that the new functionality could have a substantial effect on XRP’s supply dynamics and broader adoption. The introduction of FAssets represents a technical breakthrough, particularly for XRP, which has historically been constrained in terms of integration with smart contract platforms. Flare’s system allows assets like XRP to be wrapped and deployed on its network, enabling holders to access opportunities that were previously unavailable. This advancement provides a pathway for XRP to become more versatile within decentralized finance applications. Supply Shock is Coming …………. https://t.co/NQyXsob3Ja — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 24, 2025 Community Perspective on XRP Utility Following Whale Insider’s announcement, several community voices weighed in on the significance of the development. One notable perspective came from X user Contrarian DNA, who described the launch of FAssets as a “major leap for XRP utility.” He explained that the ability to mint FXRP allows XRP to be used in DeFi without requiring holders to liquidate their tokens. This capability is seen as a solution to what he termed XRP’s “historical isolation from DeFi,” offering access to yield generation and broader participation in the smart contract economy. Contrarian DNA highlighted three aspects of this shift: First, the ability for XRP holders to earn yield on assets that were previously inactive. By minting FXRP, they can now provide liquidity, participate in staking, or engage in lending protocols on Flare. Second, the mechanism avoids creating selling pressure on XRP itself, as the tokens remain locked while FXRP is minted for DeFi activity. Third, the interoperability introduced through Flare’s architecture effectively transforms XRP into a cross-chain asset, broadening its utility beyond its established role as a payment-focused token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Strategic Implications for XRP The launch of FAssets signals a structural upgrade in the way XRP can be deployed across blockchain ecosystems. By bridging XRP into smart contracts, the asset gains new capabilities while preserving its underlying supply. This feature aligns with Egrag Crypto’s reference to an incoming “supply shock,” suggesting that reduced selling pressure and increased utility could influence liquidity and market perception of the asset. Flare’s expansion of XRP’s utility also positions it more competitively in a market where interoperability and yield opportunities are increasingly valued by participants. While XRP has long maintained relevance in payments and institutional settlement, its limited presence in DeFi has been regarded as a missing component in its ecosystem. With FXRP now live, holders are equipped with tools that could reshape the token’s role within decentralized finance .

The exchange raised $500M in a self-led financing round, the largest so far in its history. Kraken completed the largest funding round in its history, building a $500M facility. The fundraising is part of the IPO plans for 2026, chasing a $15B valuation. As Cryptopolitan reported , Kraken started planning the funding round in the summer of 2025, finally achieving its goal some time in September. The funding round was entirely led by Kraken, which set up the valuation of $15B, without appointing an external round leader. The recent round was completed with the participation of investment and VC firms, along with a direct participation from the exchange’s ICO Arjun Sethi and his fund Tribe Capital. The funding round aims to smooth over the period ahead of the eventual ICO, extending the goals of Kraken for innovation and influence. Kraken expanded on growing demand for crypto infrastructure Kraken, which launched in 2011, was key to growing the crypto infrastructure, with significant penetration for EU markets. The exchange was one of the key fiat ramps for many years, though it remained overshadowed by its bigger competitors. So far, Kraken has raised $122.5M in funding, with three late-stage undisclosed rounds. The recent $500M investment was closed in the past month, but was not announced widely. The exchange has also relied on its earnings, getting a boost from the 2024 bull market and additional product fees. Ahead of the funding round, Kraken published positive results for Q2, with improved performance on all metrics. Kraken achieved $411M in revenues and $80M in earnings for the second quarter, making itself a target for late-stage investments in an already thriving platform. The exchange also became more influential, taking up 68% of the fiat to crypto market, up from a previous level of 43%. Can Kraken thrive in another bear market? Kraken’s fundraising happened during a period of positive performance for the crypto market. Kraken is positioned for both centralized services and DeFi, as it carries 5.8% of staked ETH. Kraken’s IPO bid in 2026 may depend on the overall demand for crypto trading. However, during the 2024 and 2025 market, Kraken joined the trend of well-developed products, despite the relatively lower hype. Besides being a regulated platform with fiat access, Kraken has been quick to adopt and test new trends from crypto bull cycles. Currently, the exchange offers multiple services, including perpetual futures, stock trading, as well as a payment app. Kraken is already well-established with whales and institutional traders. Growth may also come from expanding retail services, including XStocks and other features. The exchange has been repositioning since its reshuffling of leadership, with Sethi currently the main decision person in the CEO role. Kraken’s IPO was expected earlier, but was delayed as the platform changed its CTO, COO, and senior staff. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

L2는 솔라나 가상 머신에서 구동되어 솔라나 수준의 거래 속도와 낮은 수수료를 제공한다. 또한 스테이킹, 밈 코인, 디앱 등 $BTC의 다른 활용 방안도 가능하게 만든다. 네이티브 $HYPER 토큰은 L2 출시 시 흥미로운 혜택들의 관문 역할을 한다. 이러한 혜택에는 거버넌스 권한과 독점 기능에 대한 접근권이 포함된다. 또한 네트워크에서 가스비 지불 수단으로도 활용할 수 있다. 공식 비트코인 하이퍼 사전판매 페이지에서 $HYPER 토큰을 개당 0.012975달러에 구매할 수 있다. 또한 토큰을 스테이킹하여 연 65%의 스테이킹 보상을 받을 수 있다. 자세한 내용은 ‘비트코인 하이퍼 구매 방법’ 가이드에서 확인할 수 있다. 비트코인의 잠재력을 활용할 수 있는 기회가 제공되고 있다. 비트코인 하이퍼 프리세일 참여가 현재 진행 중이다. 2 맥시 도지 ($MAXI) – 도지의 디젠 사촌과 만나다 디젠들에게 도지코인은 반드시 보유해야 할 토큰이며, 이것이 코인마켓캡 상위 10대 암호화폐 목록에서 유일한 밈 코인으로 자리잡고 있는 이유다. 하지만 많은 사람들이 모르는 사실은 도지에게 훨씬 더 흥미진진한 사촌이 있다는 점이다. 바로 맥시 도지($MAXI)다. 너무 오랫동안 친척들로부터 외면받았던 맥시는 이제 최대 수익을 추구하며 모든 것을 최고 수준으로 끌어올리고 있다. 펌프 추격부터 어머니의 인정까지, 맥시는 어떤 일이든 대충 하는 법이 없다. 그래서 그는 좋아하는 에너지 드링크를 들이키고, 차트를 몇 시간씩 바라보며, 잠을 포기하면서까지 상승 캔들을 쫓는다. 거래에 대한 이러한 열정적인 태도는 그에게 많은 팬을 안겨주었고, 이들이 그의 밈코인 $MAXI의 가격 상승을 도왔다. 0.000259달러에 불과한 가격으로 책정된 이 토큰은 1000배 레버리지, 손절매 없는 거래, 그리고 무제한 트레이딩의 꿈을 실현할 수 있는 기회를 제공한다. $MAXI는 장기 보유하기에도 좋은 코인이 될 수 있다. 맥시 도지 가격 예측에 따르면, 해당 토큰은 올해 말 0.0024달러에 도달할 가능성이 있다. 토큰 공급량의 40%가 마케팅에 할당되면서, 맥시는 더 많은 투기꾼들을 끌어들이는 데 필요한 모든 수단을 확보하게 된다는 분석이 나온다. 하지만 서둘러야 한다. 며칠 후 다음 가격 인상이 예정된 가운데 맥시 도지($MAXI)를 구매할 기회가 지금이다. 3 퍼지 판다 ($PANDA) – 전 세계 팬더 보호를 위한 기금 모금 귀엽고 사랑스러운 판다가 지구상에서 멸종될 위기에 처해 있다. 다행히 퍼지 판다($PANDA)가 이러한 상황을 막기 위해 등장했다. 이 팀의 토큰 사전 판매는 두 가지 주요 목표를 가지고 있다. 판다를 보호하고 이들을 가두고 있는 동물원에서 해방시키는 것이다. $PANDA 토큰 구매를 통해 이러한 대의를 지원할 수 있다. 축적될 자금 중 10%는 자체 판다 보존 재단에, 또 다른 10%는 판다 출산 지원 사업에 배정된다. 두 사업 모두 전 세계 판다들이 번영할 수 있는 더 나은 환경을 제공하는 데 기여할 예정이다. 판다와 사전 판매의 시간이 얼마 남지 않았으며, 사전 판매는 10월 18일까지만 진행된다. 다행히 현재 참여할 경우 사전 판매에 락업 기간이 없어 토큰을 즉시 받을 수 있다. 사전 판매 기간 동안 총 11단계의 가격 인상이 예정되어 있다. 이미 3단계가 종료된 상황에서, 할인된 가격으로 $PANDA 토큰을 확보하려면 신속한 행동이 필요한 것으로 보인다. 이 프로젝트에 대한 자세한 내용은 퍼지 판다 백서에서 확인할 수 있다. SHIB가 계속 하락세를 보이고 있음에도 불구하고, 최근 일련의 고래 매수는 시장에서 역대 가장 인기 있는 밈코인 중 하나의 지속적인 매력을 보여주는 증거다. 이는 새로운 밈코인 투자자들을 끌어들이려는 비트코인 하이퍼($HYPER)와 맥시 도지($MAXI) 같은 신흥 프로젝트들에게 긍정적인 신호로 작용한다. 투자에 앞서 개별적인 조사가 필요하며, 본 내용은 투자 권유가 아니다.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 07:19:02

The total outflow for the week now stands at around $480 million, and Friday is likely to see that increase as BTC prices collapse below key support levels. Bitcoin prices fell to a four-week low just below $109,000 in late trading on Thursday. However, it has yet to match the bottom of this correction so far, which was around $107,500 in early September. ETF Interest Cooling BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund to see an inflow yesterday as $78 million entered the product. Its rivals, Fidelity, Bitwise, ARK 21Shares, Franklin, VanEck, and Grayscale all saw outflows from their respective ETFs. The cooling follows a couple of very strong months for Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen total inflows top $57 billion. It’s not all doom and gloom as BlackRock has not seen an outflow day for three weeks, despite the market pullback. Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF, $IBIT , bought: 1,900 Bitcoin this week (Mon-Thur) 7,500 Bitcoin last week 9,100 Bitcoin 2 weeks ago 3,750 Bitcoin 3 weeks ago 2,225 Bitcoin 4 weeks ago — HODL15Capital (@HODL15Capital) September 26, 2025 Spot Ether funds were also in the red with a similar outflow of $251 million on Thursday. The total for the week so far, leaving ETH funds, is $547 million as the asset has tanked by double digits in less than a week. On a brighter note, the Securities and Exchange Commission discussed the tokenization of ETFs in a meeting with issuer VanEck on Thursday. The agenda included discussing the “implications of tokenization of ETFs and the role of the underlying issuer,” reported Nova Dius president Nate Geraci. ETF tokenization could be very bullish for Ethereum, which is the industry standard for bringing real-world assets on-chain.

As we approach the final quarter of 2025, the following key charts provide valuable insights to help crypto traders navigate the evolving market landscape. Bullish seasonality Seasonal trends suggest a bullish Q4 outlook for both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Since 2013, Bitcoin (BTC) has delivered an average return of 85% in the final quarter, according to data from Coinglass, making Q4 historically the strongest period for bulls. November stands out as the most bullish month, with an average gain of 46%, followed by October, which typically sees a 21% increase. Ether (ETH) also tends to perform well in the last three months of the year, although its strongest historical returns have been in the first quarter since inception. BTC's 50-week SMA support Bitcoin's price has dropped by 5% this week, consistent with the bearish technical signals and looks set to extend losses to late August lows near $107,300. If bulls fail to defend that, the focus will shift to the 200-day simple moving average at $104,200. The ongoing price decline, combined with bitcoin's historical pattern of peaking approximately 16 to 18 months after a halving event, may scare bulls. However, such concerns may be premature as long as prices remain above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA). This moving average has consistently acted as a support level, marking the end of corrective price pullbacks during the current bull run that began in early 2023. Traders, therefore, should closely watch the 50-week SMA, which is currently positioned around $98,900, as a key level for broader market direction. XRP/BTC compression XRP, often called the ""U.S. government coin"" by firms like Arca, has surged 32% this year. However, despite this strong rally, the payments-focused cryptocurrency remains confined within a prolonged sideways trading range against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC), showing limited relative strength. The XRP/BTC pair has been confined within a narrow trading range since early 2021, resulting in over four years of low-volatility compression. Recent price action near the upper boundary of this channel suggests that bulls are gradually gaining control. A breakout from such a prolonged consolidation could trigger a powerful rally in XRP relative to BTC, as the accumulated energy from this squeeze is released. Now, let’s turn to charts that call for caution. Breakout in Defiance Daily Target 2x Short MSTR ETF (SMST) The leveraged anti-Strategy ETF (SMST), which seeks to deliver daily investment results that are -200%, or minus 2x, the daily percentage change in bitcoin-holder Strategy's (MSTR) share price, is flashing bullish signals. The ETF’s price climbed to a five-month high of $35.65, forming what appears to be an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, characterized by a prominent trough (the head) flanked by two smaller, roughly equal troughs (the shoulders). This pattern often signals a potential bullish reversal, suggesting the ETF may be gearing up for a significant upward move. In other words, it's flashing a bearish signal for both BTC and Strategy, which is the largest publicly listed BTC holder with a coin stash of 639,835 BTC. Dollar Index's double bottom Last week, I discussed the dollar's post-Fed rate cut resilience as a potential headwind for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The dollar index has since gained ground, establishing a double bottom at around 96.30. It's a sign that bulls have successfully established the path of least resistance on the higher side. A continued move beyond 100.26, the high of the interim recovery between the twin bottoms around 96.30, would confirm the so-called double bottom breakout, opening the door for a move to 104.00. Watch out for the pattern failure below 96.00, as that could lead to increased risk-taking in financial markets. NVDA topping? Nvidia (NVDA), the world's largest listed company by market value, and a bellwether for risk assets, continues to flirt with the upper end of the broadening channel identified by June 2024 and November 2024 highs and lows hit in August 2024 and April 2025. The rally has stalled at the upper trendline since late July in a sign of bullish exhaustion. Should it decline from here, it could signal the onset of a risk-off period in global markets, including cryptocurrencies.",Markets|Bitcoin|Nvidia|Strategy|XRP|Dollar index|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-26 07:25:27

Although BTC remains the investors’ vehicle of choice for big-ticket opportunities, smaller-price coins are increasingly becoming popular for their potential upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in presale at $0.035, is one such token. Built on a DeFi lending-and-borrowing platform, Mutuum Finance offers real-world utility and scalability. With lower market price than BTC, it can deliver up to 40x upside, and thus is a high-potential vehicle for investors seeking returns outside the mainstream cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Technical Levels Suggest Short-Term Cautiousness Bitcoin (BTC) has short-term resistance after falling below $115,000, with the 50-EMA of $114,300 and 200-EMA of $114,100 now used as resistance levels. If BTC fails to hold $112,000, support levels at $110,850, $108,750, and possibly $107,250 could be broken. A bounce over $113,450 can lead to $114,750–$116,150, and even a retest of $120,000. Short-term defensive sentiment apart, the broader uptrend of increasing highs since summer remains intact, and rising institutional inflows with improved macro liquidity can drive BTC to $120,000, and the current correction can be a long-term buying opportunity. Smaller-cap assets such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also attracting interest from those seeking greater upside relative to larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as BTC. Mutuum Finance Presale Milestone Mutuum Finance has reached a new milestone in presale, having attracted more than 16,570 investors and more than $16.3 million so far. It is in Phase 6, 50% sold out, with tokens being sold at $0.035. The project has included an early bird $100,000 giveaway , with 10 rewards of $10,000 MUTM. Mutuum Finance, staying true to its mission of innovation, will launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Contrary to depegging algorithmic stablecoins that are more likely to depeg during bear markets, the stablecoin will be non-algorithmic and overcollateralized in hope of staying stable even during difficult times. The project uses untapped collateral reserves to offer secured and secure long-term worth, positioning the stablecoin as a safe vault and sound store of value. This makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the safest and most innovative projects in today’s DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance intends to extend the limits of decentralized finance. The platform uses Chainlink oracles for lending, trading, and settlement of USD-denominated and other tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. The platform also offers additional defensive functionalities in the form of fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages to offer solid, accurate pricing data in an extremely volatile market. Bitcoin Leads the Market as MUTM Nears Big Move Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a high-growth DeFi play in tandem with Bitcoin (BTC), which has sights set on $120,000 within the next bull cycle. Stage 6 presale tokens are priced at $0.035, and Phase 6 is already 50% sold out, having achieved 16,570+ investors and grossed $16.3M. Early investors also stand to win a $100,000 giveaway. The platform supports a USD-backed overcollateralized stablecoin, a two-way lending protocol, and Chainlink-based oracle infrastructure, with security, scalability, and accurate pricing. MUTM offers investors high-growth DeFi investment of up to 40x returns. Purchase tokens today before Phase 7 increases the price to $0.04.

Accordingly, token deposits and withdrawals on the Kusama network will be suspended at 10:00 AM on October 7, 2025. The network will transition to Asset Hub Kusama at 8:00 AM on the same day. Similarly, deposits and withdrawals on the Polkadot network will be suspended starting at 10:00 AM on November 4, 2025. Polkadot's transition to Asset Hub Polkadot will begin at 8:00 AM on the same day. Binance stated that users will not need to perform any technical steps during this process; all requirements will be met automatically by the exchange. It also emphasized that token trading will not be affected by these transitions, and users can continue trading without interruption. Once the migrations are complete and the stability of the networks is confirmed, deposits and withdrawals for the relevant tokens will be reopened. Binance stated that no additional announcements will be made at this time and urged users to remain vigilant. This development is critical to the long-term growth strategies of the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems as they transition to a more secure and scalable infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

Besonders der Bereich um 112.000 US-Dollar gilt nun als Schlüsselmarke. Solange dieser nicht zurückerobert wird, bleiben die Bewegungen nur als technische Gegenreaktionen einzuordnen. Trader sprechen in diesem Zusammenhang oft von Backtests, also kurzen Anstiegen, die keine echte Trendwende markieren, sondern lediglich alte Supportzonen von unten bestätigen. 112.000 US-Dollar Marke bleit wichtig, Quelle: https://coinmarketcap.com Die Lage zeigt damit ein eher negatives Bild. Sollte Bitcoin das letzte Tief bei 107.400 US-Dollar unterschreiten, könnten zahlreiche Stopps ausgelöst werden. Damit würde der Weg in Richtung 103.000 bis 104.500 US-Dollar frei. Erst dort verläuft eine nächste technische Unterstützung, die schon in der Vergangenheit als Halt für größere Bewegungen gedient hatte. Ohne eine klare Stabilisierung droht also eine weitere Abwärtsbewegung. Inflationssorgen belasten den Markt Auch die Fundamentaldaten liefern derzeit wenig Entlastung. Jerome Powell hatte zu Wochenbeginn erneut die Risiken rund um die Inflation hervorgehoben. Genau diese Sorgen wurden durch die schwächeren PCE-Daten bestätigt. Statt die Märkte zu beruhigen, schüren die Zahlen neue Unsicherheit. Zunächst reagierte der Markt mit einem kurzen Anstieg, ausgelöst durch solide BIP-Daten aus den USA. Doch schon wenig später übernahmen wieder die Verkäufer das Kommando. Die Reaktion zeigt deutlich, dass Trader aktuell stark auf makroökonomische Faktoren achten. Positive Impulse aus dem Kryptosektor selbst fehlen. Institutionelle Zuflüsse in Spot ETFs konnten zwar kurzfristig stabilisieren, reichen aber nicht aus, um eine nachhaltige Rallye auszulösen. Die Stimmung bleibt deshalb vorsichtig und Long Positionen sind in der momentanen Situation hochriskant. ETFs zeigen auch wieder vermehrt Verkaufsdruck, Quelle: https://farside.co.uk/btc/ Für eine echte Trendwende wäre eine längere Phase der Seitwärtsbewegung notwendig. Erst danach könnte ein klarer Ausbruch nach oben eine neue bullische Struktur etablieren. Ein entscheidendes Signal wäre ein nachhaltiger Sprung über 114.000 US-Dollar. Bis dahin dominiert jedoch das Risiko weiterer Abverkäufe. Charttechnische Schlüsselzonen Technisch betrachtet bleibt die Unterkante des Bullmarket Support Bands ein entscheidender Faktor. Schon mehrfach hatte diese Zone in vergangenen Zyklen als wichtige Wendepunkte gezeigt. Der aktuelle Bruch deutet auf eine mögliche Fortsetzung der Korrektur hin. Experten haben ihre kurzfristigen Ziele klar definiert. 107.000 US-Dollar als erste wichtige Marke, gefolgt vom Bereich um 103.000 bis 104.500 US-Dollar. Sollte es zu einem Rebound kommen, liegt der nächste Widerstand direkt oberhalb der 112.000 US-Dollar. Doch selbst ein Anstieg in diese Zone wäre zunächst nur eine Erholung innerhalb des Abwärtstrends. Erst eine Akkumulation mit höherem Tief und einem anschließenden Ausbruch könnte eine neue Aufwärtsphase einleiten. Kurzfristig orientierte Trader bleiben daher eher auf der Short Seite aktiv. Long Setups wären aktuell reine Spekulation, außer bei n euen Projekten wie Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Gerade solche Memecoins haben schon oft gezeigt, dass sie schon nach ihrem Start schnell im Wert steigen können. Bitcoin Hyper als mögliche Alternative Das Projekt verfolgt einen spannenden Ansatz. Die Sicherheit und Marktstellung von Bitcoin werden mit der Geschwindigkeit und Flexibilität einer Layer zwei Lösung kombiniert. Anwendungen, die bislang kaum auf der Bitcoin Blockchain möglich waren, könnten so direkt umgesetzt werden. Dazu zählen etwa DeFi Protokolle, Gaming oder NFTs. Der Presale von Bitcoin Hyper läuft aktuell und hat bereits mehrere Millionen US-Dollar eingesammelt. Das Projekt spricht gezielt Investoren an, die trotz unsicherem Marktumfeld nach Chancen mit hohem Potenzial suchen. Sollte die erwartete Altcoin Saison im Oktober starten, könnte Bitcoin Hyper genau im richtigen Moment an den Markt kommen. Ein zusätzlicher Reiz liegt in der deflationären Token Ökonomie. Mit jeder Nutzung im Netzwerk wird ein Teil der Token dauerhaft aus dem Umlauf genommen. Dadurch könnte der Wert langfristig unterstützt werden. Anleger sehen darin eine Möglichkeit, nicht nur an der Entwicklung der Bitcoin Blockchain teilzuhaben, sondern auch vom Wachstum neuer Anwendungsfälle zu profitieren. Systemschritte in der Layer 2 Architektur, Quelle: https://bitcoinhyper.com/de Damit ergibt sich ein spannender Kontrast. Während Bitcoin selbst aktuell um entscheidende Supports kämpft, eröffnet Bitcoin Hyper neue Perspektiven, risikoreich aber möglicherweise auch höchst ertragreich. Sollte das Projekt seine Roadmap einhalten, könnte es sich als einer der Gewinner einer kommenden Altcoin Phase herausstellen. Hier Bitcoin Hyper im Vorverkauf sichern.

Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have contacted these companies after spotting sudden spikes in stock prices and trading activity just days before their public crypto announcements. According to the Wall Street Journal, regulators saw a pattern: big trades, wild price jumps, and then—surprise—a company would come out and say they’re going all in on crypto. The SEC and FINRA are now digging to find out who knew what, and when. In those contacts, the SEC reportedly warned companies about breaking Regulation Fair Disclosure, or Reg FD, which bans companies from leaking important, non-public news to people who might try to trade on it. Regulators flag price jumps and leaked crypto deals The Finra letters didn’t just say hello. According to legal experts, these types of letters usually kick off serious investigations. “When those go out, it really stirs the pot,” said David Chase, a former SEC enforcement lawyer who now defends clients in these cases. “It’s typically the first step in an investigation. Whether it goes full, full length, it’s anybody’s guess.” Right now, it’s unclear if any actual enforcement actions are coming, or if any specific company or investor is already being targeted. But these letters alone are enough to make executives nervous. The situation comes at a time when the SEC is trying to shift its tone with the crypto industry. In a recent speech, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins called out the old tactics, accusing the agency of having “weaponized” its enforcement division in the past to crack down on the industry. He promised the SEC will now focus on setting “clear, predictable rules.” While that speech may have sounded like a peace offering, these new probes suggest the SEC isn’t putting its badge down anytime soon. Companies rushed into crypto with $102B and shaky NDAs The crypto-treasury trend exploded this year. According to Architect Partners, a firm that tracks the industry, 212 companies have announced plans to raise around $102 billion to buy bitcoin and other tokens. The model they’re copying? Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy. They raise funds by selling stock or taking on debt, then use the cash to load up on crypto. Before going public with their strategy, these companies usually talk to a few handpicked investors to see who’s interested in joining the deal. But there’s a catch. Those investors are expected to keep quiet by signing nondisclosure agreements. Problem is, those NDAs aren’t always airtight. Several of the companies saw their stock prices shoot up before they made any announcements. That’s what triggered the SEC and FINRA attention. If someone leaked, and people traded on that info, it smells like insider trading. And that leak doesn’t just break rules, it can wreck the deal. Justin Platt, a partner at law firm Goodwin, said, “If the stock price is highly volatile in the days leading up to pricing a transaction, that could actually make it very difficult to agree on a price for the transaction and put it at risk of execution.” So now, what started as a rush into crypto could end up as a lesson in how not to fumble your treasury strategy while everyone’s watching.

LFGY's share price has dropped 30.4% since inception, but total return including distributions is up 9.8% over the same period. While LFGY's payouts have remained steady so far, they may decline if market indices or fund assets experience sharp or prolonged downturns. Distributions are often a return of capital, offering tax efficiency, but investors must monitor payout composition for potential tax consequences. Overview YieldMax Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF ( LFGY ) is one of the high-yielding weekly-paying ETFs available to investors. There is a growing popularity amongst these weekly paying ETFs, and LFGY looks to service this demand by harnessing the volatility of its holdings to reward investors with a massive dividend yield. LFGY is still relatively new and has an inception dating back to January of 2025. The fund has a very reasonable expense ratio of 0.99%, considering the large yield that is paid out to investors. Looking at the performance since the fund's inception at the start of the year, we can see how LFGY's share price has fallen by 30.4%. However, distributions are so large that when including them as part of the fund's return, the total return jumps up to 9.8% over the same period. The whole appeal of LFGY is the large annual distribution rate of approximately 72.5%. Additionally, the fund pays out these distributions on a weekly basis, which makes it an enticing choice for the income-seeking investors that are okay with elevated levels of risk. However, new payouts are declared every single week, so the listed yield may be different based on when you read this article. Data by YCharts Similar to other YieldMax ETFs, LFGY utilizes options to generate the income needed to support this large yield. Since we're talking about a yield this large, I believe that patient investors will be able to substantially reduce their overall risk. Although I love the higher yield that this option ETF can provide, there are some vulnerabilities and risks that investors should be aware of. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying fund strategy that LFGY utilizes to generate its earnings. Fund Strategy Unlike many of the other YieldMax ETFs I have covered in the past, LFGY differentiates itself by operating under a different strategy. My favorite YieldMax fund, is the YieldMax Universe Fund of Option Income ETFs ( YMAX ), because it essentially pools together all of the different funds into one product. However, the underlying positions within YMAX operate a synthetic option strategy, which means that the funds within, don't actually own any common shares of the stocks they are writing options against. This can increase the overall risk of the ETF as the price is likely to be less stable over time. LFGY is unique because it is one of the few high-yield option ETFs that actually hold common shares of the equities they are writing options against. This means that the fund operates in a similar capacity to the widely popular YieldMax Ultra Option Income Strategy ETF ( ULTY ), which I recently issued a buy rating on. The primary difference between LFGY and ULTY is the underlying selection of holdings. LFGY specifically aims to generate option income from a portfolio of companies that are exposed to the crypto markets in some capacity. Looking at the holdings below, we can see that iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is the largest position at 8.98% of assets. This is followed by other notable names such as Coinbase Global ( COIN ), Hut 8 Corp ( HUT ), Robinhood Markets ( HOOD ), Strategy ( MSTR ), and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) just to name a few. Despite LFGY actually holding common shares of these stocks, I suggest that investors limit their expectations around the ETF's ability to provide a meaningful level of capital appreciation over time. LFGY is best utilized for income generation above anything else. YieldMax It makes sense for LFGY to focus on these crypto-related companies because the strategy needs volatility to generate income. The higher the implied volatility of a holding, the higher the option premiums that can be collected. Although I consider these riskier positions from a growth standpoint, investors are being rewarded with high levels of income for this risk. Although I am bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), I am not as bullish on these speculative companies that utilize Bitcoin. To limit this downside risk, LFGY sells collars and put spreads. This basically means that the fund now pairs the traditional call writing with also buying puts or structured put spreads to act as insurance against the underlying stocks. This helps protect against price drops below a certain strike price. While it can soften the impact of declines, it will not stop them completely. The tradeoff of option writing is that upside movement is sacrificed to the selected strike price. Since LFGY also includes some downside protection with the collars and put spreads, the overall net yield is slightly reduced in exchange. Performance & Risks Despite LFGY holding shares of the stocks it is writing options against, investors should not expect the performance to track its underlying positions. Just as an example, I pulled in the performance of LFGY, including all distributions, against the performance of its top positions. As we can see below, LFGY underperforms nearly all of the listed positions, with the exception of MSTR. Therefore, investors need to understand that a high yield doesn't automatically translate to a high return. If you are bullish on any of the underlying positions, you would be better off buying those individual positions instead of LFGY. Data by YCharts Therefore, LFGY presents the risk of underperformance over a longer time frame. The large distributions are likely to be offset by the share price deteriorating over time. Since the use of options limits the level of capital appreciation that can be experienced, LFGY will have trouble recovering its share price over time. Even if markets experience a strong rally, YieldMax funds aren't typically known for their ability to participate in these rallies. Even if they do, the capital appreciation is typically short-lived. Just to provide some further insights into its performance, I believe that a comparison against ULTY and YMAX would be appropriate. ULTY operates a similar strategy but with a different set of holdings. YMAX operates as a 'fund of funds' but is still one of the most diversified choices amongst the YieldMax funds. However, I believe that it would only be fair to measure the performance of these funds starting in April 2025, which is when ULTY implemented its strategy change. Looking at the performance comparison below, we can see that LFGY has outperformed both ULTY and YMAX since April. Data by YCharts Since LFGY is focused on crypto businesses, the fund is likely to share some of the sensitivity to shifts in the price of Bitcoin. Since the fund's operating history is so limited, we haven't been able to experience how closely linked LFGY is to Bitcoin. However, I remain cautious about a significant pullback in the price of Bitcoin and how it will negatively impact LFGY's share price and the ability to sustain its current payouts. I believe that the correlation may not be as clear right now because Bitcoin has continued to hover near its highs. Data by YCharts Distribution Utility According to the latest declared weekly distribution of $0.512 per share, the estimated annual yield sits above 72% at this time. One of the biggest issues I've had with many of the YieldMax funds is that their payouts tend to trend downward over time, especially after their share price has experienced some mild deterioration. However, LFGY differentiates itself by providing shareholders with a very steady range of payouts since the fund's inception. The fund launched shortly before the market's rapid decline back in March, which is why we can see payouts slightly declining at the start of the graph below. Seeking Alpha Admittedly, this payout stability can change at any moment, so I would still advise caution. The payouts can shift based on the fund's underlying success with its option strategy or just based on the overall momentum of the market or its holdings. I believe that either a sharp or prolonged period of decline in market indices will result in LFGY's payouts being reduced over time. As the fund's net assets decrease, so will the payouts. This is a trend that has been observed throughout many different YieldMax funds. Although LFGY holds common shares of the underlying equities that it writes options against, I still believe that the payouts can decline. Despite these risks, investors like myself will always be interested in a fund that offers a distribution rate as high as this. In theory, this large yield provides investors with the possibility of reaching house money status, which is the point where your initially invested capital has been fully repaid through distributions alone. Just to demonstrate this concept, we can use some basic napkin math. Assume that we have $10,000 invested at a 72.5% distribution rate. $10,000 x 72.5% = an estimated annual income of ~$7,250. Therefore, investors will be able to eventually collect their initial capital back in a little over a year. The unfortunate part is that it requires a longer holding period to reach this point. Since many of the underlying holdings are extremely volatile and have some sort of indirect exposure to the crypto markets, there's always a chance that LFGY is impacted by a pullback in these riskier assets. On a more positive note, LFGY typically pays out these large distributions using return of capital . Return of capital distributions aren't considered income and, therefore, aren't taxed as such. Instead, a return of capital distribution lowers an investor's cost basis, and this allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale. So it is possible to hold a position in LFGY long enough for your cost basis to reach $0 per share. At this point, all of the income received going forward would be classified as long-term capital gains, which are considered to be qualified dividend income and are more tax-efficient. YieldMax Distribution Email However, it's worth noting that the distributions aren't always paid out using return of capital. For instance, this week's payout contained no return of capital, which means that investors will see tax consequences from all of the income received here. Therefore, it's important to meticulously track the weekly distributions and how they are being funded, so that you can properly estimate the tax bill at the end of the year. I would highly suggest going to the YieldMax site and using their contact form to request being added to the distribution list. Takeaway In conclusion, I rate LFGY as a buy at this time due to the high-income potential and the fund's ability to keep payouts consistent since its inception. I like the fact that LFGY actually holds common shares of the equities that it writes options against. This helps reduce the risks related to synthetic options, which many other YieldMax funds utilize. Additionally, LFGY implements strategy collars and put spreads to minimize the downside risk. Despite this, investors should still consider the risks of LFGY's crypto-related portfolio of holdings. As Bitcoin remains near its all-time highs, the fund's payouts and performance have been great. However, this consistency may change if the Bitcoin cycle shifts and there's a large pullback.",YMAX|ULTY|BTC-USD|LFGY,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-26 07:49:10

52283014,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=209965,1758873310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/52283014.jpeg,Hypervault Exploit: $3.6M Crypto Disappears in Shocking Breach,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hypervault-exploit-crypto-loss/,"BitcoinWorld Hypervault Exploit: $3.6M Crypto Disappears in Shocking Breach The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) has been shaken once again by a significant security incident. Recently, a substantial sum exceeding $3.6 million in cryptocurrency was suspiciously withdrawn from Hypervault, a prominent multi-chain DeFi hub. This alarming event, now widely referred to as the Hypervault exploit , has sent ripples through the crypto community, highlighting the persistent vulnerabilities within the digital asset ecosystem. What Exactly Happened with the Hypervault Exploit? Blockchain security firm PeckShield was the first to report the suspicious activity. According to their findings, the considerable sum of cryptocurrency was not merely transferred but systematically moved through several steps designed to obscure its trail. The funds were initially bridged from Hyperliquid to the Ethereum blockchain. Once on Ethereum, the stolen assets were quickly swapped for Ether (ETH). This rapid conversion is a common tactic used by malicious actors to consolidate funds and prepare them for further laundering. The swift execution of these transactions suggests a well-planned operation rather than a random opportunistic attack. The Role of Tornado Cash in This Hypervault Exploit A critical detail in the unfolding Hypervault exploit saga is the subsequent deposit of a significant portion of the stolen funds into Tornado Cash. Specifically, 752 ETH, valued at a considerable amount, was moved into this crypto mixer. Tornado Cash is a privacy-enhancing tool designed to break the on-chain link between source and destination addresses, making it incredibly difficult to trace funds. The use of such a mixer complicates any efforts by law enforcement or blockchain sleuths to recover the stolen assets. It underscores a major challenge in combating crypto crime, as mixers provide a veil of anonymity that can protect perpetrators from identification and prosecution. Why Did Hypervault’s Official X Account Vanish? Adding another layer of suspicion to the incident, Hypervault’s official X (formerly Twitter) account has since been deleted. This action immediately raises red flags within the crypto community. In many past crypto exploits and rug pulls, the sudden disappearance of a project’s social media presence often signals a complete abandonment of the platform by its developers or those responsible. The deletion leaves users and investors without an official channel for communication, updates, or explanations regarding the Hypervault exploit . This lack of transparency only intensifies concerns and speculation about the true nature of the event. Broader Implications for DeFi Security and Hypervault Exploit Prevention This incident serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in the DeFi space, especially for multi-chain platforms. While DeFi promises innovation and financial freedom, it also presents a fertile ground for sophisticated attacks. The challenges faced by Hypervault are not isolated; they reflect systemic vulnerabilities that many projects grapple with. Protecting user assets requires continuous vigilance, rigorous security audits, and proactive threat intelligence. Projects must prioritize robust smart contract security and be prepared for potential breaches. Furthermore, the community needs to demand higher standards of transparency and accountability from platforms they interact with. How Can You Protect Your Assets from Future Crypto Exploits? In light of the recent Hypervault exploit and similar incidents, it is crucial for every crypto investor to adopt a proactive approach to security. Here are some actionable insights to help safeguard your digital assets: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Always research a DeFi platform extensively before committing funds. Look for independent security audits, active community engagement, and clear communication from the development team. Diversify Your Holdings: Avoid putting all your assets into a single platform or project. Spreading your investments can mitigate the impact of a single exploit. Utilize Cold Storage: For significant holdings, consider moving your cryptocurrencies to hardware wallets (cold storage) when not actively using them on DeFi protocols. Stay Informed: Follow reputable blockchain security firms and news outlets for the latest information on vulnerabilities and exploits. Understand Smart Contract Risks: Be aware that even audited smart contracts can have unforeseen vulnerabilities. No system is 100% immune to attacks. The Hypervault exploit is a painful lesson for the DeFi world, underscoring the critical need for enhanced security measures and greater transparency. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, so too do the methods of those seeking to exploit its weaknesses. Users must remain vigilant and prioritize security to navigate these challenging waters successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Hypervault? Hypervault was described as a multi-chain DeFi hub, designed to facilitate various decentralized finance activities across different blockchain networks. How much cryptocurrency was lost in the Hypervault exploit? Over $3.6 million in cryptocurrency was reported to have been suspiciously withdrawn from Hypervault. What is Tornado Cash and why is its use significant in this exploit? Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency mixer that enhances transaction privacy by obscuring the link between sender and receiver addresses. Its use makes tracing the stolen funds significantly more difficult for investigators. What are the immediate red flags associated with this incident? The primary red flags include the suspicious withdrawal of a large sum of funds and the subsequent deletion of Hypervault’s official X (formerly Twitter) account, which typically indicates a lack of transparency or abandonment. What steps can users take to protect themselves from similar crypto exploits? Users should conduct thorough due diligence, diversify their investments, use cold storage for significant assets, stay informed about security news, and understand the inherent risks of DeFi platforms.

The price of $ETH briefly dipped below the $4,000 mark before stabilizing around the same level. At press time, CoinMarketCap data shows Ethereum trading at $4,010, down 2.1% over the past 24 hours with a market cap of $482 billion. Trading volume stands at $17.8 billion, reflecting heightened activity as the market digests new wallet movements. Jeffrey Wilcke Transfers Millions in ETH One wallet is drawing attention. Blockchain data points to Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke as the likely owner. Earlier today, this wallet deposited 1,500 ETH (≈$5.99M) into the exchange Kraken. That comes on top of last week’s activity, where a total of 2,500 ETH (≈$10.3M) was transferred at an average price of $4,124. Despite these outflows, the wallet still holds 2,058 ETH (≈$8.23M). While Wilcke has been relatively quiet in recent years compared to other Ethereum co-founders, movements of this size tend to spark speculation. Some interpret them as profit-taking; others see them as simple liquidity management.

His latest comments focus on Fusaka, an upgrade designed to supercharge Ethereum’s data availability. The centerpiece is PeerDAS, a feature that allows nodes to verify and reconstruct blocks without holding full data. In simple terms, PeerDAS lets the network scale by ensuring data availability without overwhelming individual nodes. “Blob counts will rise conservatively at first. PeerDAS is the key to L2, and eventually L1, scaling,” Buterin wrote. Source: Vitalik on X Fusaka will fix this. But also, safety first is of the utmost importance for Fusaka. The core feature, PeerDAS, is trying to do something pretty unprecedented: have a live blockchain that does not require any single node to download the full data. The way PeerDAS works is that… https://t.co/go6QsqjaFC — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 24, 2025 How PeerDAS Works The concept breaks traditional assumptions. Normally, a blockchain node downloads full data to verify blocks. PeerDAS changes that. Instead, each node requests only a few “chunks”. By verifying these chunks, the node can probabilistically confirm whether more than 50% of the block’s data is available. If that condition is met, the node can use erasure coding to reconstruct the rest. This drastically reduces the storage burden on individual nodes, while keeping the system secure and trustless. Two Key Exceptions In its first release, Fusaka still requires full block data in two cases: 1. Initial broadcasting, when a block is first shared across the network. 2. Reconstruction, if a publisher submits 50% ≤ p Even then, the system doesn’t rely on a trusted actor. As Buterin explained, only one honest node needs to perform this task. Even if 100 others are dishonest, the protocol bypasses them. Different nodes can perform this function for different blocks, keeping the system decentralized. Future Developments As Buterin Exposed Buterin emphasized that this is new and unprecedented tech. Core developers are taking a cautious approach despite years of research. That’s why blob counts, the amount of extra data Ethereum processes, will scale slowly at first. Over time, the limits will rise more aggressively as confidence grows. The roadmap includes cell-level messaging and distributed block building, which would eventually decentralize even the broadcasting and reconstruction tasks. Ultimately, Fusaka is designed as the backbone for L2 scaling today and L1 scaling in the future, once Ethereum raises its gas limit and starts pushing execution data into blobs. The combination of Wilcke’s transfers and Buterin’s scaling roadmap paints a mixed picture for Ethereum. On one hand, large co-founder sell-offs often raise concerns about confidence. On the other hand, the Fusaka upgrade reinforces Ethereum’s commitment to long-term scaling. Investors are watching closely. The $4,000 level has become a key psychological line for ETH traders. Repeated dips below could trigger further selling pressure. But sustained momentum above it could signal resilience, especially with major upgrades on the horizon. Ethereum sits at a critical juncture. Price action reflects both near-term selling pressure and long-term optimism. Jeffrey Wilcke’s multi-million-dollar transfers highlight the scale of liquidity moving through exchanges. Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin’s Fusaka vision outlines a future where Ethereum nodes scale efficiently without centralizing. The market’s verdict is still forming. For now, ETH holds steady near $4,000, a battleground between profit-takers and believers in the next phase of Ethereum’s evolution. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It’s that simple.” Opening his stream amid a rush of bearish sentiment as BTC price dipped to $108,651, Kevin argued the drawdown should not surprise disciplined traders. He framed the current move in the context of months of caution dating back to early August, when he began highlighting weekly bearish divergences across Bitcoin, Ethereum and the total altcoin market (Total2), into what he described as four-plus-year resistance zones. “Everyone thinks these symmetrical triangle patterns after a move higher are continuation patterns,” he said, “but in reality, in the crypto market, very, very rarely do these break out to the upside.” He pointed to a progression of smaller impulse highs since late 2023 and reiterated that despite sharp rallies in select altcoins, the majors failed to clear “any major resistance levels.” Bitcoin Top In Until Proven Otherwise The anchor of Kevin’s case is confluence on higher time frames. On Bitcoin’s weekly chart, he outlined rising price highs against falling momentum—“simple strength and momentum indicators,” not signals by themselves but context that “has been dwindling for a very long time.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Dynamics Shift As Binance Premium Signals Aggressive Longs Total2, he added, registered “a triple top on the weekly” beneath roughly $1.71–$1.74 trillion—“the all-be-all resistance level”—with weekly RSI and MACD rolling over. Stocks of momentum, in his read, are resetting precisely where they should amid historically thin late-summer liquidity. “Q3 is never a good quarter for crypto,” Kevin said. “August, September are terrible months. They always are.” Against that backdrop, he argued that USDT dominance remains the most reliable inter-market compass. “USDT dominance is the greatest chart ever. There is no better chart,” he said, walking through a macro descending triangle with a flat-bottom support near 3.9–3.7% and repeated rallies to a falling trendline that have mapped crypto cycle lows and highs for two years. Each approach to the flat bottom, he noted, has carved a W- or inverse-head-and-shoulders-style base in USDT.D while Bitcoin distributed near local tops; each rejection at the downtrend has coincided with crypto inflections. “You literally don’t need any chart in all of crypto,” he said. “All you need is Bitcoin and USDT dominance and you would have played this cycle absolutely perfectly.” From a tactical standpoint, Kevin flagged a three-month BTC liquidity “heat map” shelf near $106.8K and the 21-week EMA—the bull-market support band—near $109.2K as natural magnets, with the lower weekly Bollinger Band sitting around $101K. He stressed he doesn’t want to see “Bitcoin lose 106.8K” if the cycle remains intact, though a wick into that area to “swipe the liquidity” would be consistent with prior resets. He framed $98K as the line that should not break decisively. “There’s a whole lot of support in that range,” he said. “I’d be pretty shocked if Bitcoin wasn’t able to bounce in there somewhere.” All Eyes On Q4 Seasonality Kevin tied structural signals to an explicit macro checklist, arguing that lasting cycle tops and bottoms align with fundamental catalysts rather than charts alone. He cited 2021’s inflation spike and the onset of the Fed’s hiking cycle as the driver of that cycle’s 55–60% drawdown, the 2017 CME Bitcoin futures launch as a blow-off top catalyst, and the FTX collapse as the final capitulation in 2022 amid weekly bullish divergence. “There’s always a macro-related reason that correlates with the charts,” he said. By contrast, he sees no such cycle-ending macro trigger today: inflation gauges have been “very choppy” but contained; the Fed is widely expected to ease into year-end provided labor softens; and seasonality favors Q4. Related Reading: Bitcoin Days Away From Blowoff Or Cycle Top, Veteran Analyst Warns He underscored the near-term calendar—core PCE, CPI and labor data in the first half of October—as decisive for risk appetite. “Sometime in mid-October… we’ll start to have an idea of where this market is really going to go,” he said. “If we get to mid-October and Bitcoin’s holding key support… and we get good macroeconomic data, we get another rate cut… the probabilities favor that Bitcoin will [go higher]—and then you’re in Q4.” Volatility positioning, he added, argues for a sharp directional move once the reset completes. On the weekly Bollinger Band Width, Kevin said BTC has printed record-low readings three times this cycle—each in Q3—and each episode began with a downside break of 18–29% before surging to fresh highs. “There is a massive move coming for Bitcoin soon. It has not happened yet,” he said, noting spot volumes have declined since November while bands have tightened to historic extremes. A test of the lower weekly band near $101K “is possible,” but not required, in his view; the key is that the broader $107K–$98K corridor functions as a springboard. Kevin was equally explicit about invalidation and upside triggers. He labeled $125K “a major top for now” and said the market needs weekly and monthly closes above that level to confirm trend continuation. On dominance, he highlighted 59.0% and 60.28% as near-term resistance that could fuel a BTC-led phase if reclaimed; otherwise, he expects leadership to rotate back to altcoins once Bitcoin bases and USDT dominance prints a lower high. “Stop looking at the altcoins” until those inter-market signals flip, he advised, emphasizing patience, risk management and taking profits into resistance. His bottom line combines restraint with opportunism. “Hold $107k to 98K,” he repeated. “Go into October. Get through the first couple of weeks of macroeconomic data… Bitcoin will inevitably find a low on the back of that data and then eventually go higher.” But he warned that if macro arrives benign and “Bitcoin is still deteriorating,” traders should be ready to reassess the cycle thesis. Until then, Kevin’s message remains unapologetically unglamorous: respect the seasonal chop, track the inter-market tells, and let the higher-time-frame levels do the talking. “Being right is the best pat on the back you can get,” he said. “Not just saying things that get you a lot of clicks.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,607.

According to the Wall Street Journal , the U.S. chipmaker has reached out to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company about a possible partnership or cash investment. The talks are still private, but people familiar with the situation allegedly say both companies have been going back and forth on what a deal might look like. This push comes right after Bloomberg reported that Intel had also approached Apple, asking if the iPhone maker would consider tossing in some cash. Sources say Intel is offering common stock in exchange. These new developments follow the U.S. government’s decision to buy a 10% stake in Intel, worth $11 billion, using $8.9 billion in CHIPS Act funds. Nvidia and SoftBank throw money into Intel Intel’s scramble for outside help didn’t start with the U.S. government. According to WSJ , the outreach began even before President Trump got involved last month. But once Washington bought in, the pace picked up fast. SoftBank injected $2 billion into Intel back in August. Nvidia followed shortly after, dropping $5 billion to grab a 4% stake. At the center of this storm is Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. He’s been hustling to line up partners as the company tries to recover from years of missed targets and losing ground to rivals. Intel was once the top name in chips, but now it’s trailing behind Nvidia and AMD in the AI arms race. The market doesn’t wait, and neither do competitors. Intel knows this, and that’s why it’s trying to make big moves now. Intel has spent billions trying to build up its contract manufacturing unit, aiming to take on TSMC head-to-head. But the results so far have been weak. Very few outside clients have come onboard, and the business hasn’t posed any real threat to TSMC’s dominance. Back in April, The Information reported that Intel and TSMC were talking about a joint venture, with TSMC possibly buying a 20% stake in a new company. Those discussions didn’t go far, but now they’re back, and more serious this time. Intel mixes reliance on TSMC with efforts to rival it Even though Intel is trying to pull away from TSMC, the two are still tied together in more ways than one. Intel’s next-gen Nova Lake processors are expected to use both its own foundries and some from TSMC. There’s also the co-design project between Intel and Nvidia, any notebook chips that come out of that will likely include some TSMC silicon. That makes things complicated. On one hand, Intel wants other companies to stop using TSMC and start using its upcoming 14A process tech instead. On the other hand, Intel still depends on TSMC to produce important parts of its own chips. So it’s co-dependence. But there’s a chance TSMC could see value in investing. If Intel fails, regulators might start eyeing TSMC more closely for being too dominant. If TSMC helps Intel survive, it looks less like a monopoly and more like a responsible player. “There’s a benefit in being seen as a lifeline,” one source said. The whole situation is starting to look a lot like 1997, when Microsoft handed Apple $150 million just to keep it afloat. History might be repeating; only this time, it’s chips, not computers. And Intel’s been calling everyone who might write a check. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most recognized names, a new contender, Little Pepe , is building momentum with features beyond meme culture. Early projections suggest LILPEPE could deliver gains of up to 7000% from its presale price, putting it firmly in the conversation as the token to watch this year. SHIB Current Price and Technical Outlook Shiba Inu is currently trading at about $0.00001334 . The coin has been holding steady around the 0.00001310 support level. This zone has become a tight battleground between buyers and sellers.On the technical side, SHIB has been showing stability. The relative strength index is balanced, suggesting room for growth exists before overbought conditions appear. Charts reveal a descending channel that could flip bullish if price action breaks above resistance with strong volume. Analysts see SHIB moving toward $0.00001470 and possibly $0.00001550 if the bulls take charge. That would represent a 10% to 20% gain from its current levels. This projection is realistic given the current market conditions, but SHIB faces the challenge of its massive market cap. It to 10x from here would require unprecedented adoption or large-scale token burns. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Current Price While SHIB trades within familiar patterns, Little Pepe is still in its presale phase and racing forward. Stage 12 sold out successfully, and Stage 13 is live at $0.0022. So far, the presale has raised over $25.9 million, with more than 15.9 billion tokens sold out of the 17.25 billion allocated. Early investors who bought in Stage 1 at $0.001 are already up 120%. With 19 stages, the presale has become one of the most closely watched events in the meme coin space this year. Bullish Developments for LILPEPE Momentum has been supported by community incentives like the 777k giveaway , which already has more than 378,000 entries. Alongside this, the Mega Giveaway from Stage 12 to Stage 17 rewards bigger buyers with over 15 ETH in prizes. These campaigns are fueling viral adoption and keeping Little Pepe in the spotlight. From a technical perspective, Little Pepe is designed with long-term growth in mind. It is building on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 made for meme tokens. This offers cheaper and faster transactions while blocking sniper bots, a feature that ensures fairness. On top of that, there are zero taxes on buys and sells, making it more attractive for both whales and retail traders. The project has already undergone a Certik audit, which helps early investors feel confident that it has been thoroughly reviewed. Plans to list on major centralized exchanges will bring more trading options and increased exposure, giving it a strong chance of a successful market debut. Bullish Projection for LILPEPE Analysts believe that Little Pepe can deliver returns of up to 7000% from its current presale price. At 0.0022 dollars, that would put LILPEPE above $0.15 if its roadmap plays out. This projection is based on presale momentum, zero market cap advantage, strong community backing, and upcoming CEX listings. Compared to SHIB, which is already a giant, Little Pepe has much more room to grow. Its early stage means smaller capital can trigger much larger percentage gains. Head to Head: SHIB vs LILPEPE Feature Shiba Inu (SHIB) Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Current Price $0.00001334 $0.0022 (Stage 13 presale) Market Position Mature, large market cap New, zero market cap advantage Technical Setup Testing resistance at $0.00001400 Presale momentum, stages selling out fast Community Strong but established Viral growth with 777k giveaway and Mega Giveaway Utility Shibarium, burns, branding Layer 2 for meme tokens, sniper bot resistance, zero tax Bullish Projection 10% to 20% short-term Up to 7000% in 2025 Conclusion Shiba Inu still commands attention and may continue to produce modest returns if it clears key resistance levels. But when it comes to explosive potential, Little Pepe stands apart. With its presale already raising over $25 million, a Certik audit, and viral campaigns like the 777k giveaway, it has captured the momentum that could turn early supporters into big winners. The projected 7000% gain may sound ambitious, but it is within reach with the right mix of exchange listings, community adoption, and market conditions. For anyone looking at the next cheap crypto to 10x in 2025, Little Pepe is making a strong case.

These companies have landed on the radar of US regulators and could face investigations. According to the Wall Street Journal, the SEC and FINRA contacted cryptocurrency treasury firms about information leaks and unusual transactions ahead of the treasury announcements. US regulators the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) are investigating possible insider trading in the stocks of companies that have adopted cryptocurrency treasury strategies, the WSJ reported. Authorities sent letters to nearly 200 companies that had announced such strategies, expressing concern about spikes in trading volume and stock prices just before they publicly announced their crypto strategies. Accordingly, more than 200 companies that announced they were adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies have come under scrutiny by the SEC and FINRA due to unusual stock price fluctuations prior to the announcement of these announcements. The letters also warned that the information could indicate a violation of the Fair Disclosure Regulation (Reg FD), which prohibits companies from disclosing material, non-public information to individual investors. Industry experts say they see the move as the start of a full-scale regulatory investigation into insider trading. Lawyers say such letters often signal the possibility of further investigations into insider trading. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: The US SEC and FINRA are taking action!

A significant event recently caught the attention of the crypto world: a substantial Bhutanese government BTC transfer . An address widely believed to belong to the government of Bhutan moved 355.5 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $38.78 million, to a new destination. This move, reported by OnchainLense, follows a pattern of continuous Bitcoin sales by the Himalayan kingdom, prompting curiosity about its underlying strategy. What Prompted This Bhutanese Government BTC Transfer? The recent large-scale Bhutanese government BTC transfer is not an isolated incident. Bhutan has quietly been a player in the Bitcoin space for some time, reportedly engaging in Bitcoin mining operations powered by its abundant hydroelectric energy. This transfer, therefore, could signal several potential intentions or operational adjustments. Portfolio Rebalancing: Governments, like institutional investors, often rebalance their digital asset portfolios to manage risk or optimize returns. Operational Needs: Funds might be required for various governmental operations, and liquidating crypto assets could be part of their treasury management. Enhanced Security: Transferring funds to new addresses can be a routine security measure, consolidating holdings or moving them to more secure cold storage solutions. Strategic Sales: Given the previous reports of continuous sales, this could simply be another phase in their long-term monetization strategy for their Bitcoin holdings. Bhutan’s Quiet Foray into Bitcoin and its Implications Bhutan’s involvement with Bitcoin first came to light through investigative reports, revealing its engagement in large-scale mining operations. This quiet yet substantial participation underscores a unique approach to national digital asset management. The recent Bhutanese government BTC transfer highlights a proactive stance in managing these assets. For a small nation, these Bitcoin holdings represent a considerable asset. Their decisions regarding these assets can have various implications: Economic Diversification: Utilizing Bitcoin as an alternative asset class can help diversify national reserves, especially for economies looking beyond traditional investments. Technological Adoption: Active participation in the crypto space, whether through mining or asset management, showcases a forward-thinking approach to emerging technologies. Market Influence: While not a whale on the scale of major institutions, significant government transfers can still be observed by the market, potentially influencing sentiment, especially when continuous sales are reported. Navigating the Challenges of Government Crypto Holdings Holding and managing substantial cryptocurrency reserves comes with its own set of complexities, even for a government. The Bhutanese government BTC transfer process itself requires meticulous planning and execution to ensure security and compliance. Key challenges include: Volatility Management: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can significantly impact the value of holdings, requiring sophisticated risk management strategies. Transparency and Public Scrutiny: While this transfer was tracked on-chain, the overall transparency of government crypto operations can be a subject of public and international interest. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies presents ongoing compliance challenges for any entity, including sovereign states. Understanding these challenges is crucial for appreciating the strategic decisions behind such transfers. The latest Bhutanese government BTC transfer of nearly $39 million to a new address is more than just a transaction; it’s a window into the evolving digital asset strategy of a sovereign nation. Whether for rebalancing, security, or ongoing monetization, Bhutan’s actions demonstrate a pragmatic and continuous engagement with the world of Bitcoin.

Speaking at a conference hosted by Georgetown University's Psaros Center for Financial Markets Policy, the SEC Chairman answered questions about conflicts of interest as President Donald Trump and his family's interest in the cryptocurrency sector continues to raise concerns. During his talk, Atkins was asked by a student about his thoughts on conflicts of interest in cryptocurrencies. Atkins said they will set clear rules regarding cryptocurrency conflicts of interest when asked about the issue. “That is, if there are conflicts of interest or any situation involving a conflict of interest arises, we will try to eliminate them and set clear rules and standards.” While the crypto projects Trump has launched so far have attracted both attention and reaction, the most notable of these have been the WLFI and TRUMP projects. At this point, SEC Chairman Atkins was asked whether the agency would be overseeing WLFI. In response, Atkins said, “The SEC is a law enforcement agency and has a job to do. I cannot comment on or discuss specific companies or products. However, we will initiate investigations if necessary.” *This is not investment advice.

She forecasted that Bitcoin would exceed $1,000,000 in the next five years, with a target of $1.5 million by 2032. The rising institutional adoption by corporate treasuries, ETFs, and global asset managers supports this forecast. Her “bull case” forecast sets the stage for the entire crypto market. As Bitcoin keeps rising, more investors are turning their attention to assets like Ethereum, Solana, and new projects such as Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Each of these tokens is strengthening its positive outlook in the market, and their progress is connected to the same exciting macro story of increasing crypto adoption. Ethereum: Nearing All-Time Highs with Strong Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is still showing good performance alongside Bitcoin’s long-term growth. The token is currently trading at $4,610.08 , with a 2.44% gain over the last seven days. Over the past month, the price of ETH has ranged from $4,205.78 to $4,953.73. Notably, Ethereum is just 6.98% off from its all-time high of $4,953.73, which was achieved on August 24, 2025. Their near-record levels signify ongoing investor confidence. Analysts highlight a key support level of $4,450 and a resistance level of $4,750. Breaking above $4,750 may signal a path to new highs for ETH, possibly aiming for $5,200 or beyond. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s steady resilience keeps confirming its status as the second-largest cryptocurrency, with institutional interest also driving up Bitcoin. Solana: Recovery in Progress with Key Resistance Ahead Solana (SOL) is also displaying a bullish reaction to the crypto market-wide momentum that BTC triggers. SOL is currently trading at $247.73 , up 6.4% in the past week. Over the past 30 days, it has traded between $177.47 and $249.12. Although it’s still down 15.98% from its all-time high of $294.33 in January 2025, Solana is steadily recovering. The key support level is seen at $235 – $240, and the near-term resistance level is at $250. A prolonged bullish move might see Solana reach $270 and eventually retest its previous high. With the rise of Bitcoin and its impact on the general interest in digital assets, Solana can benefit as a high-performance blockchain focused on speed and scalability, placing it as a top competitor for both developers and investors. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Layer-2 Meme Coin with Real Utility As more institutions and sovereign wealth funds continue to allocate a portion of their portfolios to cryptocurrency, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is gaining attention for its unique blend of meme coin branding and actual blockchain infrastructure. Unlike typical meme tokens, it has its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 chain, which enables it to operate quickly and cost-effectively. It also provides zero-tax trading and minimal gas fees. LILPEPE offers multiple utilities: Staking for rewards. NFT interoperability with low-fee trading. DAO Governance to provide holders with voting rights. Pepe’s Pump Pad, an anti-bot-protected new meme project launchpad. The LILPEPE presale is in stage 13, with tokens at $0.0022. So far, the project has raised over $26 million in funds out of its $28.77 million goal; that is, 15.99 billion of the 17.25 billion tokens have been sold. Only 1.26 billion tokens are left before the price goes up to $0.0023 in Stage 14. The Stage 1 investors have already gained 120%, proving how the stage-based reward system works. The presale also includes big giveaways. For a minimum contribution of $100, one could qualify for a giveaway that will reward 10 winners with $77,000 worth of tokens each out of a total of $777,000. In addition, the Mega Giveaway, which is running from stages 12-17, provides over 15 ETH of rewards to large and random purchasers. https://twitter.com/littlepepetoken/status/1963648061063999860 Tokenomics is also reinforcing sustainability with a fixed total supply of 100 billion tokens, which is distributed as presale (26.5%), reserves (30%), stake rewards (13.5%), liquidity (10%), marketing (10%), and CEX/DEX listings (10%). Additionally, there is no team allocation, which makes the project community-driven and eliminates the risk of insider sell-offs. Little Pepe is preparing for exchange listings on Uniswap and is targeting inclusion in leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The team is concurrently emphasizing community development, viral marketing initiatives, and the addition of utility features to position itself as more than merely a meme coin. Its Layer-2 blockchain and ecosystem utilities give it a competitive edge over meme tokens like SHIB and DOGE, which lack real utility.

Trading at $0.035 during Phase 6 of the presale, MUTM presents an opportunity for early investors to secure exposure before the next phase raises the price by 15% to $0.040. With crypto prices still fluctuating and the crypto fear and greed index showing caution, large investors are increasingly focused on assets like MUTM that combine strong fundamentals with significant growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Capital efficiency and risk-managed lending models Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with dual lending structures tailored for different market segments. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools handle stablecoins and major assets, providing predictable liquidity and returns, while Peer-to-Peer (P2P) pools accommodate higher-risk tokens, ensuring that exposure to volatile coins does not threaten core liquidity. Borrowing mechanics are designed with precision: stable interest rates with initial rate locks, higher starting rates for certain assets, and rebalancing mechanisms maintain predictable borrowing costs. Overcollateralization and automatic liquidation safeguards protect both lenders and borrowers. Deposit and borrow caps, restricted collateralization for riskier assets, and enhanced collateral efficiency for correlated assets create a layered approach to risk control. Loan-to-value ratios and liquidation thresholds are calibrated to maximize capital efficiency while minimizing the chance of losses, and reserve factors ensure the protocol maintains sufficient liquidity buffers. Collectively, these features make MUTM a platform that balances high opportunity with measured risk, making it especially appealing to whale investors seeking structured exposure in crypto investing. Presale momentum, stablecoin innovation, and ROI potential Phase 6 of the MUTM presale has generated approximately $16.3 million, with over 50% of the 170 million token allocation sold and more than 16,600 holders. The total supply of 4 billion MUTM provides ample room for growth, and early investors are already seeing substantial returns. For instance, a Phase 1 participant who purchased at $0.01 has now valued a 3.5x gain at $0.035, and with listing projections at $0.06, their ROI could reach 5.7x in value. Even Phase 6 buyers are positioned to benefit from this projected upside, making the current entry point attractive for whales looking for meaningful returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a decentralized stablecoin, minted against approved collateral such as ETH or BTC and burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. Governance-controlled interest rates will adjust dynamically to maintain the $1 peg, and arbitrage incentives will help stabilize the market. mtToken staking and planned open-market MUTM buybacks will redistribute platform revenue to stakers, creating additional value for users. Liquidity management will rely on Chainlink oracles, supplemented with fallback and aggregated feeds as well as on-chain DEX metrics, ensuring precise price discovery for safe lending operations. Roadmap and security support whale strategy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured to progress across four phases. Phase 1 includes the presale, marketing campaigns, a giveaway, CertiK audit, tracking platform listing, and AI helpdesk, with educational content and compliance team formation pending. Phase 2 will focus on smart contract and DApp development, back-end infrastructure, advanced features, code reviews, risk parameters, and analytics. Phase 3 includes a beta version on testnet, functional demo launch, exchange listing preparation, final security audits, regulatory alignment, and presale conclusion. Phase 4 will deliver the live platform, token listings, MUTM claim activation, bug bounty program, institutional partnerships, multi-chain expansion, platform enhancements, and talent acquisition. Security and incentives provide further confidence for large investors. CertiK has assigned MUTM Token Scan and Skynet scores of 90.00 and 79.00, respectively. The $50,000 bug bounty program will reward critical issues up to $2,000, major up to $1,000, medium $500, and low $200. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway distributes $10,000 in MUTM tokens to ten winners, enhancing community engagement and support. For whales and high-net-worth investors, MUTM represents a unique opportunity in crypto investing. With robust lending models, stablecoin innovation, oracle-backed liquidity management, and structured risk controls, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned for substantial growth by 2026. The combination of presale discounts, staking rewards, and buyback-driven token appreciation provides a clear path to potentially 40x gains, solidifying MUTM as a penny token that commands attention among serious investors seeking both security and outsized returns.

Analysts track triangle compression and wave corrections, showing pressure building for XRP’s next major move. Liquidity pools below $3 raise the risk of a shakeout, even as ETF approval boosts attention. XRP Price Under Pressure Ripple’s XRP is trading at around $2.76 with a daily trading volume of $8.66 billion. The token has fallen 3% in the last 24 hours and 9% over the past week. Traders are closely watching the current setup as XRP hovers near levels that could decide its next direction. Crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO framed the situation as two outcomes. “ Are we going to pump down to $3.20 or a crash up to $2.20? ” they asked . Their chart shows XRP consolidating inside a triangle, where resistance and support are compressing before a breakout. The asset is testing resistance in the $2.65 – $2.70 range. A close above this band could clear the path toward the $3.20 level. If buyers fail to push higher, the price could face renewed pressure from sellers around this zone. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X On the downside, support remains at the ascending trendline that has held since earlier this year. A breakdown could send XRP toward $2.20, a level where demand previously appeared. The broader chart shows ongoing consolidation, with momentum building toward a decisive move. Analyst Views on Market Structure Analyst CoinsKid described the move as part of a wave cycle. “I think XRP is in a complex wave 4 correction after an explosive 5-wave move up from the June low,” they said. They noted that wave 2 was a zig-zag, while wave 4 is showing a more complex shape. The analyst pointed to a descending triangle pattern forming on the chart, with three lower highs compressing the price into support. While many triangles break down, he advised patience until expansion is confirmed. CoinsKid also stressed that “ monumental support for XRP sits at the $1.90 June 22nd, 2025, low. If this support is lost, it changes the game completely .” Liquidity and Market Conditions Liquidity data adds another layer to the current picture.

Larger players may drive the market down to trigger liquidations before building positions again. At the same time, broader sentiment has been mixed. The SEC approval of the first U.S. XRP ETF provided a boost, but Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s recent warnings on valuations and higher Treasury yields have weighed on risk markets, including crypto.

The PCE is the Fed’s true measure of inflation and could be critical in helping the apex bank decide whether to cut the interest rate in its next FOMC meeting. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index is expected to rise 0.2% MoM and 2.9% YoY in August. Meanwhile, headline annual PCE inflation is expected to increase to 2.7%. There could be a lot of volatility later today as Fed officials consider this inflation data when deciding on the next policy move.

Bitcoin bulls look to hold the $107k support The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and inefficient as Bitcoin has been underperforming in recent days. The bearish performance comes as BTC failed to find support around the daily level of $116,000 last week, losing 3% of its value within four days. This saw BTC close below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average at $113,490 on Monday before continuing its bearish momentum on Thursday after slightly recovering on Wednesday. BTC/USD 4H Chart At press time, BTC is trading at around $109,600 and could experience further volatility in the near term. If the correction continues, BTC could decline towards the next major support level at $107,245. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 37 shows that Bitcoin is bearish and could enter the oversold region if the trend continues. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bearish crossover earlier this week, indicating that the sellers are currently in control.

Whales are quietly accumulating the token at the current presale price of $0.035, recognizing its combination of utility, robust protocol design, and multi-year ROI potential. Phase 6 is already 50% sold, generating approximately $16.3 million with over 16,600 holders, and Phase 7 is projected to increase to $0.040, a 15% rise. For investors looking for crypto coins with strong fundamentals, MUTM offers a unique opportunity to participate in a utility-driven DeFi platform with a structured roadmap and incentives. Stablecoin innovation and market infrastructure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer two complementary lending models designed to cater to different types of investors and risk profiles. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to pool assets such as stablecoins like USDT, USDC, DAI, USDD, and well-known cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC, SOL, ADA, XRP, and LINK into audited smart contracts. These pooled assets provide liquidity for borrowers, who post overcollateralized collateral to secure loans. Depositors receive mtTokens representing both their principal and accrued interest, which can also be used as collateral for borrowing other assets. For higher-risk and less liquid tokens, such as DOGE, FLOKI, or PEPE, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will provide a separate lending environment. Lenders and borrowers negotiate terms directly, including interest rates, loan durations, and partial fills. At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its decentralized stablecoin, engineered to maintain a $1 peg consistently. The stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against approved collateral, such as ETH or BTC, and will be burned when loans are repaid or liquidated. Only authorized users or smart contracts, called issuers, will be permitted to mint, with defined limits to ensure controlled exposure and risk mitigation. Borrow interest rates will be governed by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol to stabilize the stablecoin’s value: rates will decrease if the price exceeds $1 and rise if it falls below $1. Arbitrage activity will further ensure price stability, as users will buy or sell the stablecoin to capture profit, automatically helping the price return to $1. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on a sophisticated price discovery system to ensure fair valuations for supported assets. The protocol is designed to integrate Chainlink oracles, capable of providing USD and native asset prices, and will include fallback oracles to maintain uninterrupted feeds if the primary source experiences issues. Aggregated feeds and on-chain DEX metrics, including time-weighted average price calculations, will provide additional reference points to enhance accuracy, supporting overcollateralized lending and safe liquidations. Borrowing interest rates are planned to dynamically adjust based on utilization rates to balance liquidity efficiently. When capital is abundant, rates will remain comparatively low to encourage borrowing, putting idle assets to productive use. Conversely, when capital is scarce, interest rates will rise, prompting loan repayments and attracting additional deposits. This mechanism ensures sustainable liquidity management and safeguards protocol solvency. Roadmap and platform development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will follow a four-phase roadmap designed to build, finalize, and deliver a fully operational DeFi ecosystem. Phase 1, largely completed, included the initiation of the presale, marketing campaigns, the giveaway, listing on tracking platforms, an external audit, and an AI-powered helpdesk. Educational content and the legal/compliance team remain pending. Phase 2 will focus on developing core smart contracts, front-end and back-end DApp infrastructure, advanced features, and the implementation of internal and external code reviews, risk parameters, and analytics tools. Phase 3 will see finalization through beta testing on testnet, launch of a functional demo, preparation for exchange listings, completion of core contracts and infrastructure, final security checks, extensive audits, regulatory alignment, and presale conclusion. Phase 4 will deliver the live platform, token listings on exchanges, activation of MUTM claims, bug bounty implementation, institutional partnerships, multi-chain expansion, platform enhancements, and talent acquisition. Incentives, security, and community engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is backed by a strong security and incentives framework. The CertiK audit awarded Token Scan 90 and Skynet 79, reflecting a high standard of code integrity and safety. The $50,000 USDT bug bounty program rewards participants for uncovering vulnerabilities, with payouts structured by severity: Critical up to $2,000, Major up to $1,000, Medium up to $500, and Low up to $200. To encourage early adoption and community participation, the $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Social traction is already strong, with over 12,000 followers on Twitter, highlighting active and growing interest in the project. Users will also be able to stake mtTokens in certain smart contracts to get MUTM incentives. The platform wants to do open market buybacks, using the money it makes to acquire MUTM and give it to stakers. This will make the value of the tokens even higher for long-term participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a great investment since it has a stablecoin, a strong oracle infrastructure, staking rewards, and impending roadmap milestones. It balances utility, market stability, and a lot of upside potential. Phase 6 is almost sold out, and Phase 7 is about to go up in price by 15% to $0.040. This means that investors only have a little time to buy MUTM at a lower price. If you’re thinking about investing in cryptocurrencies during times of market volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a safe, useful, and well-planned DeFi token that is likely to increase over time.

While ADA and XRP remain established names in the market, their potential upside is projected to be steady rather than explosive. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi-focused token currently in presale at $0.035, is emerging as the standout investment with utility-driven mechanisms and early-stage pricing that could deliver extraordinary returns. Analysts’ crypto predictions suggest that while ADA and XRP may see moderate gains, MUTM’s combination of dual lending mechanics, Layer-2 efficiency, and presale momentum positions it for massive growth in the months ahead. Cardano (ADA): Steady performance amid consolidation Cardano (ADA) has built a strong foundation through its focus on blockchain security, staking rewards, and sustainable smart contract capabilities. Its recent price movements reflect consolidation near its historical highs, with limited volatility compared to smaller altcoins. While short-term gains are projected, the utility of ADA for aggressive retail crypto investing remains constrained. Its core functionality as a proof-of-stake network provides long-term stability, but it lacks the dynamic revenue-generating mechanisms found in emerging DeFi projects. Analysts predict ADA may reach approximately 100% growth in the near term, making it a reliable yet moderate performer within the broader crypto market. XRP: Recovery potential with limited aggressive growth XRP continues to serve as a leading crypto coin for cross-border payments and banking integrations. Its historical highs and recent price trends indicate gradual recovery potential, but regulatory uncertainties have slowed its ability to deliver rapid gains. Short-term forecasts suggest XRP could see around 200% appreciation, but this growth is largely tied to adoption in financial institutions rather than retail-driven demand. While XRP remains attractive for stability-focused crypto investing, it lacks the early-stage utility and structured revenue mechanisms that provide explosive upside potential in new DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi gem with 1,600% potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention as a next-generation DeFi platform with dual lending mechanics designed to appeal to a broad range of investors. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending allows users to pledge major crypto assets such as ETH, BTC, SOL, AVAX, LINK, ADA, MATIC, or BNB and borrow up to 75% of the collateral in stablecoins. This ensures predictable returns while maintaining overcollateralization for safety. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system caters to higher-risk tokens like PEPE, FLOKI, DOGE, SHIB, and TRUMP, allowing lenders and borrowers to negotiate flexible rates. Layer-2 integration reduces costs and increases transaction speed, enabling high-frequency participation and larger deposits. The upcoming beta launch will allow early users to experience the full platform, establishing confidence and accelerating adoption before the mainnet release. Phase 6 of MUTM’s presale has raised $16.3 million, with 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold at the current price of $0.035. The next phase will see a 15% increase in price, creating urgency for early acquisition. Early investors demonstrate the potential of MUTM’s growth: a $2,000 ETH allocation swapped to MUTM during Phase 1 now reflects approximately $7,000 in value gains at the current presale price. Post-listing projections suggest the price could reach $0.06, providing 2–3x upside due to beta adoption and Layer-2 scalability driving higher platform activity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also integrates engagement and reward features to retain participants. The dashboard enables users to track holdings and ROI, while the Top 50 leaderboard offers bonus MUTM tokens to top investors. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway further stimulates participation and community activity. Final words Demand for MUTM is strengthened by multiple factors. The buy-and-distribute mechanism channels revenue from lending and borrowing back into open-market repurchases, generating demand and supporting token value. Stablecoin minting ensures predictable borrowing and fee generation, while treasury revenue from liquidation penalties and reserve factors provides long-term economic backing. Expected listings on major exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and KuCoin, will increase visibility and liquidity, expanding access to a broader audience and amplifying token demand. With analysts projecting a 1,600% potential gain, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outpaces both ADA and XRP for aggressive retail crypto investing. Its dual lending system, Layer-2 efficiency, presale momentum, and structured revenue streams combine to create a high-utility, high-upside investment. Retail and institutional participants who secure early presale tokens will be positioned to benefit from a DeFi platform capable of delivering extraordinary returns, establishing MUTM as a top contender in the next wave of crypto market growth.

The DEX, launched by former FTX executives, is now growing its trading volumes. On Solana, perpetual DEXs activity mostly relied on the Jupiter and Drift protocols. However, a new star is emerging, one that may be linked to the bankrupt FTX centralized exchange. Pacifica has been making the rounds on social media a few months after launching. The perpetual futures DEX uses the Solana stack, and has been gaining on the general hype around Hyperliquid and Aster. But what pushed Pacifica to the forefront was a recent post from Sam Bankman-Fried’s X account. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, the SBF account posted a short message, sending the FTT token on another rally. The reawakened profile also pointed attention to former FTX and Alameda Research alumni, who walked free and are now at the helm of their own projects. Solana DEX gain support from former FTX, Alameda hires Just days before Pacifica gained attention, Armani Ferrente, an early Alameda Research hire, defended on-chain perpetual DEXs for being safer than the FTX centralized model. Ferrente is already promoting his own Backpack exchange, achieving over $10B in weekly volumes. On-chain and transparent trading is seen as a clear defense against the non-transparent asset movements between FTX and Alameda Research. However, there is still an ongoing discussion if a DEX can have some control of user funds for the sake of trading. At this stage, Pacifica also emerged as a safer version, offering an advanced trading venue without the risk of FTX. The bankruptcy has not stopped influencers from taking up Pacifica and even promoting it for its connection to FTX. Pacifica boasts of connection to FTX The Pacifica perpetual futures DEX is still a relatively small newcomer to the recent perp DEX hype. The exchange only accrued $16.6M in value locked in the first 10 days of activity. Influencers are already on the task, with some of them focusing on the link to FTX. Pacifica has been launched by Constance Wang , former COO at FTX until November 2022. The Pacifica perp DEX claims to have gathered 10K users, with another 6K flowing in for the past week. 1/ gm As of now, Pacifica has now reached: $8,000,000,000+ Total Volume 💹💹 (up 50% since last week) 10,000+ Active Users 🐳🐳🐳 (+6,000 since last week) 600m+ 24h volume 📈 https://t.co/wt4vESPDDc https://t.co/4RDJnAbkJF We don’t stop. 💪 — Pacifica (@pacifica_fi) September 26, 2025 The DEX reports over $34M in open interest, and posts daily records in deposits and new users. For now, the market has around 4,120 daily active users, a far cry from the success of FTX or even smaller perpetual DEXs. Pacifica reports record inflows of users and deposits, as it rides the general perp DEX hype. | Source: Dune Analytics . Some of the influencers are leaning into the rumor that Pacifica will also gain input from Google talent and other former FTX employees, including input from Bankman-Fried. In the short term, Pacifica is attractive for its early-stage point farming season. The DEX arrived relatively late, and is currently in Season 1, while other markets are already well into their second stage. The opportunity for airdrops is driving traffic to all markets, and all new perp DEXs are yet to prove the current hype is sustainable.

The bearish performance erased over $18B in value as a result of heavy selling, much of which took place yesterday. A failure to maintain the $2.75 support level could cause a crash to $2.70, further fueling the bear sentiment. The dire performance comes despite the recent inclusion of XRP , alongside Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Stellar, in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, the ‘first multi-asset spot crypto ETP in the United States.’ However, this bearish sentiment may be misplaced and a strong correction may arrive this coming October, which could set $XRP on track to a new ATH. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) also stands to gain a lot during the coming bull market, as the $2.5M presale is already turning heads. Why $XRP is Bullish for Q4 2025 The case for an $XRP bull in October and, more broadly, for the entire Q4, rests on several strong points. The first is Ripple’s stablecoin, $RLUSD, launched globally in December 2024 , backed 1:1 by traditional assets like the US dollar and governmental bonds. The asset comes with extensive utility, including allowing for instant settlement for cross-border payments and creating a bridge between TradFi currencies and the crypto ecosystem. Next we have Ripple applying for banking status back in July 2025, with CEO Brad Garlinghouse stating in an X post : ‘If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market.’ – Brad Garlinghouse, CEO, Ripple Combined with the multiple $XRP ETFs , currently awaiting approval from the SEC, this imbues the asset with legitimacy and long-term utility, which goes against the current bear trend. This explains why prominent figures in the crypto space – among them Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management – say that people underestimate the investor demand for spot $XRP ETFs. But given all this bullish context, why the drop? The answer is simple: because Bitcoin dropped. Bitcoin itself has been on a downward spiral over the past seven days, dropping around 7% from $117K to a new three-week low of $108,776 . As expected, Bitcoin’s performance impacted the whole market, kickstarting mass sales, which further fueled the bearish sentiment. Things are set to change in October, as the next FOMC meeting draws close, promising to spoil us with another rate cut after the one on September 17 . The coming bull wave should push $XRP to a new ATH and bring more attention to projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which look set to take the meme coin market by storm. How Maxi Doge Turns Risk-Driven Investments Mainstream Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is not your typical Shiba Inu meme coin. This doggo – who happens to be the pumped-up, gym-bro cousin of $DOGE – takes crypto investing to new heights under the mantra of ‘Retire at 22,’ which is enough to fuel armies of degen traders. Maxi Doge is more than a meme; it’s a movement – one fueled by gallons of Red Bull and Maxitren 9000, and a complete lack of self-preservation. Maxi only trades at 1000x leverage, obsesses over green candles, and doubles down with every dip. It is the dream ecosystem for degen traders who take the ‘no pain, no gain’ philosophy literally. Based on Maxi Doge’s presale performance, charisma, and unhinged attitude, we expect this doggo to rival Dogecoin in terms of influence and market impact – making $MAXI one of the best crypto presales of 2025. The presale has already raised $2.5M+ so far and offers $MAXI at the current price of $0.000259. Not only do you have the option to stake your tokens for 133% APY, but holding $MAXI also gives you access to a growing community that could turn Maxi Doge into the next Dogecoin. Ready to join the $MAXI hype? Head to the official Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale website and buy your stack today. This isn’t financial advice. Be sure to always do your own research before investing.

According to market analyst Xaif Crypto, XRP surged to the top spot with a staggering $330 million in trading volume, outperforming Ethereum at $258 million and Bitcoin’s $137 million by a significant margin. XRP’s surge underscores its rising influence in Asia’s crypto scene. Outpacing global attention on Bitcoin and Ethereum, its strong performance in South Korea signals robust regional adoption. This development can be attributed to XRP’s fast transactions, low fees, and strategic financial partnerships, giving it a clear edge over larger-cap rivals. Therefore, Xaif Crypto highlights XRP’s Korean dominance as a key global signal. Leading trading volume on Upbit suggests rising liquidity and momentum, likely drawing international traders’ attention and foreshadowing potential price action. Meanwhile, long-term XRP holders continue to stand tall despite the present bearish outlook. XRP Eyes Reversal as Key Support Holds Amid Descending Triangle Pressure XRP finds itself at a critical juncture, navigating a massive descending triangle that has been shaping price action for weeks. According to market expert Lingrid, the cryptocurrency’s near-term direction hinges on the $2.70–$2.80 support zone. Holding this level could pave the way for a bullish reversal toward $3.18, while a clean break below would confirm deeper weakness and extend the downtrend. The descending triangle pattern has kept traders on edge, with XRP repeatedly bouncing between resistance near $3.20 and support around $2.70. Recent price action underscores the struggle between buyers and sellers. The latest rejection from the upper boundary forced a breakout attempt, only for sellers to quickly reassert control and drag the price lower, reinforcing the market’s bearish undertone with XRP’s price currently trading at $2.76. Notably, technical indicators reveal a tug-of-war as XRP trades within a narrowing range, signaling low volatility ahead of a potential breakout. Holding $2.70–$2.80 could tip momentum to buyers, paving the way for a rally toward the psychological price of $3. Conversely, failure to defend the $2.70–$2.80 zone could trigger a sharper decline. Descending triangle breakdowns typically accelerate selling pressure, as traders rush to exit positions, potentially exposing XRP to lower support levels and extending the bearish phase. Conclusion XRP’s $330M surge on Upbit isn’t just a headline, it marks a milestone in South Korea, outpacing Ethereum and Bitcoin. This dominance highlights XRP’s rising adoption, strategic relevance, and growing influence on broader crypto markets. On the other hand, XRP is locked in a pivotal technical setup. As long as $2.70–$2.80 holds, the outlook favors a potential bounce toward $3.18. However, a decisive breakdown would confirm further weakness and possibly extend the bearish trajectory.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|ASIA|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-26 09:20:12

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a prime candidate, offering a structured DeFi platform designed for predictable returns and high utility. While memecoins like DOGE attract speculative attention, crypto predictions increasingly highlight DeFi protocols with scalable lending models and robust risk management as the next drivers of market interest. Retail traders are turning to MUTM for exposure to a token with a clear path toward $1, backed by a combination of presale momentum, protocol design, and investor incentives. Dogecoin (DOGE) hints at reversal on charts Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing early signs of a potential reversal on technical charts, trading at ~$0.2407 as of September 24, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $3.02 billion. On the weekly chart, a double-bottom pattern has formed around $0.142 support, a classic bullish reversal indicator that held firm in April and June 2025, signaling the end of a 47% YTD drop and possible upward momentum. The four-hour chart reveals a symmetrical triangle nearing completion, with a breakout above $0.243 potentially targeting $0.286–$0.315 (up 18–31%), while the 50-day moving average above price acts as resistance. RSI at 57.83 indicates neutral conditions, with declining volatility suggesting an imminent move. Whale accumulation of over 1 billion DOGE ($266 million) and REX-Osprey’s DOGE ETF launch on September 18 (ticker DOJE, 1.5% fee) bolster sentiment, raising approval odds for similar products to 75% by 2026. Social media buzz highlights the pattern’s historical precedent for explosive rallies, though U.S. tariffs pose risks. Analysts forecast $0.28–$0.35 by year-end if $0.29 clears, but a drop below $0.23 risks $0.21. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending, stable yields, and presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with dual lending mechanics that address both risk-averse and high-risk participants. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools allow stablecoins and bluechip tokens to generate predictable returns, while Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending accommodates more volatile tokens under structured collateral frameworks. Borrowers benefit from a stable-rate model with an initial rate lock, calibrated higher starting rates, and dynamic rebalancing to ensure predictability. Overcollateralization, liquidation triggers, and reserve factors provide additional security for lenders, creating a system where participants can engage confidently in crypto investing while maintaining exposure to high-growth opportunities. Phase 6 of MUTM’s presale has raised $16.3 million, with 50% of the 170 million token allocation already sold. The current token price of $0.035 positions early participants to capitalize on potential appreciation before the next phase increases the price by 15% to $0.040. This presale traction emphasizes the growing retail demand for MUTM, highlighting it as a token poised to outperform more volatile crypto coins in the upcoming altseason. Historical presale data shows that early buyers achieve substantial returns compared to later entrants, creating a strong sense of FOMO for participants who recognize MUTM’s upside potential. Mechanisms driving future price and demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has multiple mechanisms designed to drive ongoing demand and increase the utility of MUTM. The platform’s buy-and-distribute strategy ensures that revenue from borrowing and lending activities will repurchase MUTM tokens on open markets, with rewards distributed to mtToken stakers. This continuous buy pressure creates demand and incentivizes users to remain engaged while supporting upward price movement. The upcoming beta launch allows investors to test platform features, including lending, borrowing, and stablecoin minting, before the full release. This hands-on exposure is expected to drive adoption and borrowing volume, while the Layer-2 integration significantly reduces transaction costs and improves speed, attracting both high-frequency users and larger deposits. Expected exchange listings on major platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, MEXC, Kraken, and Coinbase will expand visibility and liquidity, further enhancing mass adoption and realizing the token’s full utility. Supporting features like a dashboard for ROI tracking and a Top 50 leaderboard offering bonus MUTM encourage active participation and retention. These tools allow users to monitor performance, compare returns, and engage with the protocol’s community, strengthening the overall ecosystem. Stablecoin adoption within the platform, coupled with treasury mechanisms such as liquidation penalties and the reserve factor, creates predictable revenue streams that underpin long-term protocol health and indirectly drive MUTM demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a good position to give retail investors a DeFi option with a clear route to $1 because of its presale momentum, structured lending mechanics, staking incentives, and Layer-2 efficiency. MUTM is better than unstable memecoins like DOGE because it has practical uses, measurable risk controls, and several ways to grow. Investors who get in on the presale early can get a token at a lower price. This token balances security, usability, and high potential profits in the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: xAI has sued OpenAI, alleging it poached key staff to access confidential tech behind its Grok chatbot. The lawsuit names former engineer Xuechen Li, who is already under a court order restricting AI-related work at OpenAI. The case escalates the ongoing feud between Musk and OpenAI amid fierce competition for top AI talent and IP. Filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California , the complaint alleges that OpenAI engaged in a “coordinated, unfair, and unlawful campaign” to recruit key xAI personnel with the aim of accessing sensitive data related to its Grok chatbot. The legal action claims OpenAI targeted individuals with direct knowledge of xAI’s source code, infrastructure, and business plans, including former engineer Jimmy Fraiture and a senior finance executive. Ex-xAI Engineer Xuechen Li Named in Trade Secret Lawsuit The lawsuit also names ex-employee Xuechen Li, who is facing a separate lawsuit for alleged trade secret theft. A court order issued earlier this month temporarily barred Li from working on AI technologies at OpenAI. Musk’s team argues that OpenAI induced these individuals to breach confidentiality agreements in violation of employment obligations. OpenAI has denied the allegations, stating, “We have no tolerance for any breaches of confidentiality, nor any interest in trade secrets from other labs.” It also described Musk’s actions as “ongoing harassment.” xAI, however, claims it uncovered the poaching scheme during its internal investigation into Li’s alleged misconduct. An email exchange included in the filing features a blunt response from a former xAI executive to a legal warning: “suck my dick.” Elon Musk's xAI is suing OpenAI for allegedly stealing trade secrets by poaching employees. When Musk's lawyer confronted a former ""senior finance executive,"" who xAI alleges stole its ""secret sauce"" of rapid data center deployment for OpenAI, here's how he responded: pic.twitter.com/93b1tjUUqx — Theo Wayt (@theo_wayt) September 25, 2025 This marks the latest escalation in the long-running feud between Musk and OpenAI, a company he co-founded in 2015 but left in 2018 after failing to take control. Musk has repeatedly accused OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of abandoning the group’s original nonprofit mission in favor of commercial gain through partnerships with firms like Microsoft. The case adds another layer to the intensifying race for AI dominance, where tech giants are competing aggressively to secure top talent and IP. Elon Musk Sells X to xAI in $80B Deal In March, Elon Musk transferred ownership of his social media platform X to his AI startup xAI in an all-stock deal announced on March 28, valuing xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, including $12 billion in debt. The move coincided with a judge rejecting Musk’s attempt to dismiss a class-action lawsuit accusing him of misleading shareholders during his original Twitter acquisition. Critics argue the transaction raises the legal stakes for Musk and his companies, suggesting xAI could now be entangled in existing litigation. Some, like Cinneamhain Ventures’ Adam Cochran, accuse Musk of inflating xAI’s valuation to offload X while masking investor losses, even hinting that the deal may be a way to transfer user data between entities. https://t.co/YTPB8EAAPT — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 29, 2025 Despite concerns, Musk insists the merger will enhance synergies between X’s platform and xAI’s technology, particularly the Grok chatbot, which he claims surpasses early versions of ChatGPT. Supporters say Grok could position xAI as a serious competitor in the AI race, though skepticism around the $80B valuation remains.

Investors seeking sustainable crypto investment are increasingly eyeing MUTM, driven by its strong presale momentum and advanced DeFi features. Phase 6 of the presale is nearly 50% sold, and the price is projected to rise to $0.040 in the coming days, making it the final opportunity for investors to acquire tokens at discounted rates and participate in the anticipated growth. Dual lending models and stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate through two distinct lending frameworks designed to maximize both liquidity and safety. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows lenders to pool stablecoins and major cryptocurrencies, while borrowers provide overcollateralized assets. Depositors will receive mtTokens representing their share of the pool, earning interest that can be reinvested or used as collateral for further loans. In parallel, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will focus on riskier tokens, isolating these assets to prevent liquidity issues in the main P2C pools. Lenders and borrowers in P2P will negotiate rates and durations directly, providing higher yield opportunities while maintaining overall market stability. A key innovation within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its decentralized stablecoin. The stablecoin will always aim to maintain a $1 peg and will only be minted when users borrow against approved collateral, such as ETH or BTC. Tokens will be burned automatically upon repayment or liquidation of the associated loans. Borrow interest rates will be actively managed by Mutuum governance to preserve the peg: rates will decrease when the stablecoin trades above $1 and increase when it falls below $1. Arbitrage mechanisms will further stabilize pricing, allowing users to buy or sell the stablecoin for profit, which naturally pushes the price back toward $1. All loans will remain overcollateralized, with automatic liquidations ensuring the system’s integrity even during periods of high volatility. Price discovery for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on a robust oracle infrastructure. Chainlink feeds will provide reliable USD and native asset prices, supplemented by fallback oracles in case of latency or downtime. Aggregated feeds combining multiple data sources will reduce dependency on any single provider, and decentralized exchange metrics like time-weighted average prices (TWAP) will serve as an additional reference point, ensuring accurate valuations and safe liquidation thresholds. Presale progress, investment potential, and roadmap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens. Phase 6 of the presale has raised approximately $16.3 million and is now nearly half sold, with more than 16,600 holders participating. For context, investors who purchased during Phase 3 at $0.02 will see the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, achieving a 1.75x value gain. Expected listing targets are set at $0.06, offering a projected 3x ROI on paper. The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outlines a structured approach to long-term growth. Phase 1 included presale initiation, marketing campaigns, $100K giveaway , external audit, listings on tracking platforms, and an AI-powered helpdesk, with educational content and compliance team formation pending. Phase 2 will focus on developing core smart contracts, DApp front-end and back-end, advanced features, analytics tools, and internal/external code reviews. Phase 3 will finalize the platform through bug reporting systems, beta testing, demo launch, exchange preparation, regulatory alignment, and presale conclusion. Phase 4 will deliver the live platform, token listings, MUTM claim activation, bug bounty program, multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and platform enhancements. Security, community, and incentives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is strengthened by a CertiK audit that included both manual review and static analysis, earning high scores of Token Scan 90 and Skynet 79. The $50,000 USDT bug bounty program will reward users for discovering vulnerabilities, with tiers set at Critical up to $2,000, Major $1,000, Medium $500, and Low $200. Additionally, a giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. With a growing community of over 12,000 Twitter followers, these security and incentive measures reinforce investor confidence and engagement. As traders move money away from assets like DOGE that aren’t very useful, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a cryptocurrency with a lot of value and a high return on investment. MUTM is the greatest choice for serious crypto investors because of its two loan methods, stablecoin innovation, strong oracle infrastructure, and well-planned roadmap. Phase 6 is almost sold out, and the price will shortly go up to $0.040. This is investors’ last chance to buy tokens at a lower price and take advantage of the platform’s long-term growth and stability.

On Thursday, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sent an urgent directive, telling agencies to secure Cisco firewall devices and look for any signs of compromise. Chris Butera, acting deputy executive assistant director for CISA’s cybersecurity division, has even asked other government bodies and private companies to take similar precautions, noting that the threat is widespread. According to a US official, about 10 organizations worldwide have been breached, although that number could increase. The official said there were still “a lot of unknowns” about the campaign. Another US official called the campaign “very sophisticated” and noted the hackers’ malware as highly intricate. “CISA is deeply concerned about this activity,” the second official said. “If agencies don’t get on this right away, it could be bad for them.” Two critical flaws (CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20363) and one medium (CVE-2025-20362) — affected Cisco’s Adaptive Security Appliance and Firepower Threat Defense devices that utilize ASA software. Cisco calls the attackers’ methods complex and sophisticated The group, which Cisco calls ArcaneDoor, has reportedly been conducting spying operations since last year. According to CISA, their attacks could hurt critical infrastructure in the US. Nonetheless, Washington is bracing for a busy few days as teams work to detect the hackers and secure vulnerable devices before more damage occurs. Agencies must update and submit reports by Friday. Cisco told reporters it collaborated with multiple agencies in May to investigate the hacks and later uncovered three additional vulnerabilities exploited by the attackers. It said the hackers used these flaws to install malware, run commands, and potentially steal data. The company has also advised customers to patch their systems immediately. The UK government had also issued its own warning Thursday, describing the hackers’ malware as a “major step forward” from their earlier tools. Per Cisco’s analysis, the hackers exploited several zero-day flaws and used stealth tactics like turning off logging, hijacking commands, and crashing devices to avoid detection. The company even describes the tactics as complex and sophisticated. The compromised devices included certain models from Cisco’s ASA 5500-X Series, which serve as firewalls to shield corporate networks from attacks. Analysts believe a China-linked group was involved in the attack So far, authorities have not named any suspects for the attack, but researchers believe the hackers are linked to China and have been targeting Cisco vulnerabilities for an extended period. Butera claimed that their directive will help map out the complete extent of the compromise affecting federal networks. Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 also told CNN they believe the campaign is China-linked and noted that more groups may soon target the same weaknesses now that the vulnerabilities and fixes are public. Sam Rubin, a senior vice president at Unit 42, iterated, “As we have seen before, now that patches are available, we can expect attacks to escalate as cybercriminal groups quickly figure out how to take advantage of these vulnerabilities.” Palo Alto has been monitoring hackers worldwide, and according to them, the group has been changing tactics and leaning towards more US entities. This disclosure comes just days after Mandiant, part of Google, said a separate group of suspected Chinese hackers infiltrated US software developers and law firms in an espionage campaign tied to the US-China trade dispute. The firm said full remediation may take months.

While SOL has the entrenched ecosystem that will provide some comfort, attention is also being shifted towards low-priced, high-upside projects. Among such tokens is Mutuum Finance (MUTM),3 currently priced at a mere $0.035 in presale stage 6. Stage 6 itself is 50% sold out already. More than $16.3 million has been raised by the project, and more than 16,570 investors have been drawn in. Having a ready-made borrowing-and-lending DeFi protocol for use in real-world applications, Mutuum Finance is becoming a prospect for an outsized return project that is drawing investor interest over SOL’s gradual hikes. Solana Technical Outlook: Short-Term Bullish Bias Indicators Imply Potential Shift Towards $250 Solana (SOL) is showing cautiously optimistic indications on its 4-hour chart, as its Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 34 points out that it is near oversold levels, which in the past has been a precursor for solid bounces. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) signals short-term bear dominance, but diminishing histogram bars are a sign that bearish momentum is losing steam. Support in the most critical area of $212 is close to the 50-day EMA, with breaking $225 possibly signaling the path to $240 and psychological $250 levels. Technical charts like Ichimoku Cloud and Bollinger Bands are indicating a keen price reversal in the near future, with analysts noting short-term 60/40 bullish bias and that SOL can ride Ethereum’s weekly advance to $250-$260, with volume supporting the breakout. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring high in the sixth presale round with a new record of investor demand and milestone achievements. Having over 16,570 registered investors and over $16.3 million raised, the project is setting all records, clear signs of increased trust in its vision and future prospects. Being at a stage where one gets to enjoy ginormous long-term profits is as certain as rock with the ecosystem expanding. As a gesture of gratitude to early backers, the project has launched a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 backers will be awarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. Mutuum Finance will aim to be one of the most promising ETH-based DeFi projects to watch out for in 2025 as it follows its growth aim. Benchmark for Security Features For the protection of the platform, Mutuum Finance partnered with CertiK to create an official bug bounty program with a minimum guaranteed award pool value of $50,000. Four grading tiers will be offered to compensate for found vulnerabilities launched: critical, major, minor, and low. This will give end-to-end security and protection. Apart from that, Mutuum Finance has also collaborated with the developers and researchers of their new security technologies in order to release it publicly on their website. Its accessibility also leverages investor trust and proof of the project’s commitment towards ensuring their ecosystem is secure. Mutuum Finance stability is loan-to-value and liquidation value based on volatility base dynamically calculated collateral. It also has a reserve multiplier system of 10% buffer to the best as high as 35% for risky collateral. It is highly accurate mechanism with no loss of transparency, hence stable but sound platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving to be a high-growth DeFi coin with Solana (SOL) testing resistance levels of $210–$250. Stage 6 presale tokens cost $0.035 and 50% has already been sold, bringing in over $16.3 million from 16,570+ investors. Early adopters enjoy a $100,000 giveaway, robust CertiK-backed bug bounty, and a twin lending protocol with dynamic Loan-to-Value and liquidation protection. While SOL confronts technical resistance, MUTM presents early-stage investors with an opportunity for the potential for outsized long-term gains in a secure, scalable DeFi setting.

Will BNB reach $1000? BNB price has already touched $1000 in 2025 and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-26 09:40:00

The figure was thrown out Thursday by Vice President JD Vance as Trump continues pushing a plan for American investors to take over the U.S. arm of the app from Chinese parent ByteDance, as Cryptopolitan reported . The number is way below earlier valuations, which had TikTok priced closer to $40 billion. The expected buyers (Oracle and Silver Lake Management) aren’t likely to argue with the lowball offer. ByteDance and its current investors, though, are seeing red. Vance made it clear the final price will be up to the buyers, but the public estimate already set the tone. Ashwin Binwani, founder of Alpha Binwani Capital, said the suggested deal “could be the most undervalued tech acquisition of the decade.” He argued the number doesn’t come close to matching TikTok’s real value. “By every major financial metric and peer comparison,” Ashwin said , “this price tag looks dramatically misaligned with reality.” Analysts compare TikTok valuation to oil and cereal TikTok pulls in over $10 billion a year just from the U.S. market. That part of the business alone has 170 million active users, the app’s largest audience worldwide. And yet the $14 billion price implies a price-to-sales ratio of 1.4 times, a number you’d expect from legacy corporations like ExxonMobil or General Mills, not a social media company dominating the short-form video space. Meta, which owns Instagram, trades at 10x revenue. Alphabet, which owns YouTube, is around 8x. Despite how difficult it’s always been to value TikTok, partly because no one outside the company fully understands its recommendation algorithm, most analysts still agree that it’s worth way more. The app has not only dominated the attention economy, it’s also forced competitors to launch copycats like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. But Trump’s administration doesn’t seem concerned with tech value. The focus is national security. That’s why the sale is structured to spin off TikTok U.S. into a new joint venture, one where ByteDance will own less than 20%. The deal must close within 120 days. Trump claimed China’s President Xi Jinping gave the green light, but so far, Beijing hasn’t publicly confirmed anything. That’s left everyone guessing. Ownership and leadership still totally unclear The next big issue is who’s actually going to run the platform. Oracle builds infrastructure, not social apps. Silver Lake funds tech, it doesn’t operate it. Neither one knows what to do with 170 million users scrolling through videos 24/7. Alvin Foo, venture partner at Zero2Launch, summed it up clearly: “It’s like you’re putting a gun to ByteDance and saying ‘sell or you stop.’” Alvin added, “Right now, it’s really Trump making the call, without listening or discussing with the Chinese government on whether the sale will go through.” If the deal goes ahead, no one knows if ByteDance will license its algorithm or pull it entirely. There’s no clarity on who controls the tech, the data, or the future of the app’s performance. Without the algorithm, TikTok isn’t TikTok. The app’s entire identity, and its success, is built around content delivery. Removing ByteDance but keeping the app intact may sound clean on paper, but the reality looks messy. And yet, this sale is being forced to happen in just four months. The clock’s already ticking. Get seen where it counts.

It combines the DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) and OSN (Ozak Stream Network) to provide scalable, secure, and real-time data solutions. Ozak AI, with its current presale and growing partnerships, is staking a claim as one of the leading competitors of the altcoins under the $1 price bracket. Ozak AI Presale Growth and ROI Potential The Ozak AI presale has passed several levels with a progressive rise in price. At Stage 1, the OZ token was priced at $0.001. Stage 2 rose to $0.002, and Stage 3 shifted to $0.003. The current stage is of inexpensive price, which is estimated at $0.012, and the following stage is planned to be $0.014. A presale target price of one dollar is equivalent to a 200x presale return in the first stage. To date, some 920,085,937.27 $OZ has been sold by Ozak AI, bringing up $3,441,050.60. The total amount of tokens to be supplied is 10 billion, and 3 billion will be given during the presale , 3 billion to the community and ecosystem, 2 billion to reserves, 1 billion to liquidity, and 1 billion to the team and advisors. This open allocation assists in sustainable development. The ROI math shows a clear possibility. From $0.001 to $0.012, investors in Stage 1 have already seen a 1100% increase. Upon reaching the $1 target, Stage 1 investors would achieve 200x returns, while current participants at $0.012 could secure over 80x returns. Ozak AI Features and Partnerships Ozak AI incorporates DePIN to provide fault-tolerant, decentralized, and real-time infrastructure. Its OSN system retrieves tamper-free and precise data across various networks, which fortifies applications such as predictive analytics, Internet of Things integration, and financial modeling. The Ozak Prediction Agent builds on these features by automatically interpreting proprietary and external data in order to aid decision-making. New alliances make it stronger in terms of its ecosystem. The partnership with Pyth Network incorporates real-time financial feeds of blockchains. Ozak AI makes trading solutions and provides access to liquidity on a larger scale with the help of Dex3 . Other integrations with SINT , Hive Intel , and Weblume present cross-chain capabilities, agent upgrades, multi-chain data access, and no-code Web3 integration. Staking and rewarding of token holders is also introduced by the introduction of the Ozak AI Rewards Hub. Such collaborations and technology integrations emphasize the practical applications of Ozak AI beyond speculation. As part of its roadmap, cross-chain compatible and expanding into enterprise-grade analytics and decentralized applications. Market Comparison with Solana and XRP At the time of reporting, Solana trades at $202.38 with a daily trading volume of $8.06 billion. It has declined 2.95% in 24 hours and 16.31% in the past week. With a circulating supply of 540 million SOL, its market cap stands at $111.23 billion. XRP is priced at $2.85 with a 24-hour volume of $6.48 billion. It has dropped 0.98% in 24 hours and 7.36% in the past week. It has 60 billion XRP in circulation, which makes it have a market cap of $170.19 billion. Although Solana and XRP are solid and liquid assets, their current valuation restricts possible ROI in comparison to Ozak AI . At the presale stages, the investors in Ozak AI can realize a greater upside owing to its low entry price and future listings.

Exchange outflows and rising on-chain activity signal strategic accumulation by large BTC holders. Short-term holders near loss; key support levels tested as traders watch for a reversal. Whales Accumulate as Bitcoin Price Falls Over the past seven days, wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have added around 30,000 bitcoins, according to data shared by analyst Ali Martinez. Holdings by this group increased from roughly 4.97 million BTC to more than 5.04 million BTC, now sitting at their highest level in recent months. 30,000 Bitcoin $BTC bought by whales in the past week! pic.twitter.com/pdJsr5IOvX — Ali (@ali_charts) September 25, 2025 Meanwhile, this activity came during a week when Bitcoin’s price dropped from around $117,000 to $109,000. While retail sentiment showed uncertainty, larger holders continued buying. The move suggests that these mid-sized wallets are building positions while prices remain under pressure. On-Chain and Exchange Data Support Accumulation Blockchain data between September 19 and 26 shows that total Bitcoin transferred on-chain rose from about 440,000 to over 770,000 BTC. This increase in transfer volume took place as the asset declined. Movement at this scale often reflects repositioning by larger participants, especially when the price and transfer activity move in opposite directions. Source: CryptoQuant At the same time, exchange netflows were mostly negative from August 26 through September 26. Multiple days saw withdrawals exceeding 10,000 BTC, including August 28, September 1, 15, 21, and 23. When Bitcoin is withdrawn from exchanges in large amounts, it often suggests holders are choosing to store assets in wallets rather than preparing to sell. This trend aligns with the accumulation seen in mid-sized wallets. Source: CryptoQuant Short-Term Holders Near Loss Territory Data from Checkonchain shows short-term holders are now close to breakeven levels. These wallets, which typically represent recent buyers, tend to react quickly to price changes. Each time this group entered net loss territory in 2025, Bitcoin found a local low soon after. Analyst Cas Abbé said, Short-term Bitcoin holders are reaching their break-even levels. If their holdings go into loss, that would be a nice bottom formation. I think $BTC could revisit September lows, before a reversal and a new ATH. pic.twitter.com/FcIJidqVvI — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) September 25, 2025 He added that Bitcoin might revisit the September low near $107,000 before making a move higher. The chart pattern appears consistent with previous cycles this year. Bitcoin Tests 21-Week EMA as Support Bitcoin is currently sitting at the 21-week EMA, a trend-based level watched closely by traders. Analyst Rekt Capital shared a chart showing BTC retesting this support zone near $109,572. Earlier this year, the same level marked a turnaround point in April. Source: Rekt Capital/X Below this area, there is a support range between $104,000 and $100,000. If that fails, the 200-week EMA near $93,395 could come into play.

52286963,590316,1758880051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52286963.jpeg,BTC Drops to $109K Amid ETF Slowdown; Bitcoin Hyper Whales Invest $117K in Two Days,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-whales-rally-as-bitcoin-falls/,"After soaring past $117K earlier this month, $BTC has slipped into a cooling phase at $109K. The reasons? HODLers are turning cautious and cashing out, not helped by a recent slowdown in ETF purchases. But it’s not all bad news. According to Glassnode data , the current cooldown appears more like a healthy pause than the end of the cycle. If support holds and ETF demand picks up, $BTC might even come back stronger. Suppose that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ’s utility will become all the more necessary. The reason is that its upcoming Layer-2 (L2) network will make the Bitcoin network faster and cheaper for $BTC transactions during heightened demand. It’s no wonder that there’s already growing confidence in that vision. Over the past days, large whales have invested $17.3K , $87.1K , and $12.7K into the project, pushing the $HYPER presale past $18.3M+ to support the L2’s development. Long-Term Investors Cash Out 3.4M $BTC Glassnode found that long-term holders have realized 3.4M $BTC in profits, more than any past cycle. While it doesn’t signal the end, new demand is necessary for Bitcoin to maintain a competitive edge. HODLers and institutional buyers are shaping the cycle by scooping up $BTC through US Spot ETFs and digital asset trusts. In turn, they help drive demand that keeps the crypto leader rallying.ETF inflows are what have kept HOLDERs from selling up historically, but the balance is fragile. During the time of a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting discussing interest rates, long-term holders began selling around 112,000 $BTC per month. Around the same time frame, ETF buying nosedived from around 2.6K $BTC a day to almost nothing. But here’s where $BTC’s future trajectory starts to look more promising. Despite these pullbacks, the drawdown for $BTC’s $124K ATH is just 12%. It’s also worth noting that capital inflows have been substantial. Over $678B has flowed into Bitcoin since November 2022, almost 1.8x more than in the previous cycle. Suppose ETF buying also picks up, $BTC might be positioned not only to recover but also to reach greater highs. If a new bull run starts to form, the launch of Bitcoin Hyper this quarter will be even more highly anticipated. To support the next wave of $BTC adoption, the L2 is designed to provide the scalability, speed, and low fees essential for meeting rising demand. Bitcoin Hyper Addresses Bitcoin’s Biggest Barriers Bitcoin Hyper is on a mission to address the Bitcoin network’s most well-known pain points.Take its transaction speed, for instance. Currently, Bitcoin can process only 5.96 transactions per second (tps) , which is 67.56% lower than Ethereum’s 18.39 tps. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s current average gas fees of $0.845 are slightly lower than Ethereum’s $1.08. Nevertheless, both networks lag far behind speedier networks like Solana, where fees rarely exceed $0.05 . Bitcoin Hyper is built to introduce Solana-level throughput to Bitcoin. By leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it’ll be able to support thousands of tps without hefty costs. To top it off, the L2 will feature a Canonical Bridge, allowing you to quickly and easily move $BTC into the Hyper ecosystem. The bridge will also enable you to access a range of new opportunities, spanning DeFi and dApps to launchpads and NFT marketplaces. The outcome? Bitcoin will be more useful than ever. $HYPER Supports L2 Developments & 64% Staking Rewards $HYPER is the backbone of the entire Hyper ecosystem. Its presale success hinges on the L2’s success – 30% of its total token supply funds its developments, after all. But beyond helping propel the network to rosier pursuits, $HYPER comes with other holder benefits, including governance rights, lower gas fees, and the opportunity to earn a 64% staking APY. (Note: this rate will decrease as more investors clock on.) You can get involved by purchasing $HYPER on presale for just $0.012975. Our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction anticipates the coin to reach $0.32 this year, following the L2’s official launch. Now might be an opportune time to join for possible gains of 2,367% if that target is hit. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale . This isn’t investment advice.

The bears took over on September 25, cutting short bitcoin’s rally to $114,000. The asset fell below $109,000 for the first time in weeks as its trajectory was reversed. Amid the plunge, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has fallen to its lowest level in five months, signaling fear among investors. This raises the question of whether current market conditions present a buying opportunity or a warning sign that more pain is to come. Bitcoin Investors in Fear Analysts attributed bitcoin’s latest decline to recent remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He revealed that the Federal Reserve is in a difficult position due to a weakening labor market and rising inflation. He signaled caution on future rate cuts, highlighting troubling signs in the U.S. economy and the risks of easing too aggressively. Following the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where rates were cut, Powell’s latest remarks cast uncertainty on future macroeconomic policy. Investors are uncertain whether upcoming FOMC meetings, scheduled for October and December, will result in rate cuts. Such levels of uncertainty usually trigger volatility in risk assets, of which BTC is one. As reflected in the Fear and Greed Index, this BTC decline was met with fearful sentiment from investors. Market participants are worried whether this could be the onset of a long and deep corrective phase or just a shakeout preceding a massive rally. Buying Opportunity? The index measures investor sentiment by analyzing several factors, including market volatility, social media trends, and Bitcoin momentum. When investors get fearful, the index hovers close to 0, and when they are greedy, the figure rises to 100. A neutral market sentiment keeps the index around 50. At the time of writing, the index was at 28, signaling fear among investors. It has the potential to decline further before recovering; however, it is expected to rise to the neutral and possibly greed levels as BTC rallies again. Market experts insist that the bull market is not over, so this plunge is likely a buying opportunity. Moreover, declines in the Fear and Greed Index to the fear zone have been historically followed by price recoveries and rallies to the greed zone.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be presented as a utility-first DeFi project at the center of that debate, focused on lending, borrowing and reliable token economics rather than pure hype. As crypto charts show mixed momentum and traders weigh safety versus upside, attention will shift to tokens that will provide real use cases and steady on-chain activity heading into a year-end rally. Presale Momentum and P2C Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be selling tokens in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035, with around $16.3 million raised so far and more than 16,600 holders participating. Half of the 170 million allocation for this phase will already be sold by the time Phase 6 finishes, and the next phase price will step up to $0.040 — a 15% increase. This presale momentum will attract investors who prefer early-stage access to utility-driven projects. At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s offering will be Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools where depositors will supply assets like USDT into audited smart contracts and receive mtTokens representing their share plus accrued interest. A clear example: a depositor who will put $15,000 USDT into the USDT pool will receive mtUSDT at a 1:1 ratio and, assuming a 15% average APY based on pool utilization, will earn $2,250 in passive income over a 12-month period. Borrowers will have predictable options as well. A user depositing $1,000 worth of ETH as collateral will be able to borrow up to 75% of that value — $750 — enabling liquidity access without selling their ETH exposure. This model will answer the frequent investor question is crypto a good investment by offering a pathway to yield and utility rather than pure speculation. With presale pricing still accessible, MUTM will present a different risk-reward profile than tokens that rely solely on narrative. Risk Isolation, P2P Lending and Liquidation Mechanics Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also separate riskier tokens into a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market. Assets such as PEPE and DOGE will be isolated from core liquidity pools so lenders and borrowers can negotiate terms directly without exposing the main capital base to volatile swings. This design will protect primary pools and preserve capital efficiency for bluechip and stablecoin depositors while offering higher returns for those accepting greater risk. Collateral rules will be conservative and clearly tiered. Lower-volatility assets like ETH will support higher Loan-to-Value ratios — up to 75% — with liquidation thresholds set to provide meaningful headroom. More volatile or speculative tokens will be assigned much lower LTVs, generally in the 35 to 40% range, and will face stricter liquidation triggers closer to 65%. When collateral values fall below required thresholds, automated liquidation will occur and liquidators will repurchase outstanding debt at a discount, restoring protocol health quickly and preventing a wider systemic failure. This approach is built to withstand negative market shocks and headlines about a crypto crash while keeping the pools solvent. A concrete investor story will highlight the presale upside: a Bitcoin holder who will have swapped $10,000 into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 at $0.01 will see that position valued at $35,000 at the Phase 6 price of $0.035 — a 250% increase on paper. By the time of a public listing at $0.06, that same holding will be valued at $60,000, a 500% return. Analysts will project an 8x to 10x move after listing, pointing to two main demand levers: a beta launch that will onboard users to the lending and borrowing flows, and expected listings on major exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin and Coinbase that will expose MUTM to a much larger investor base. Conclusion: A Defensive Yet Growth-Oriented Pick In a cooling market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be framed as a defensive yet growth-oriented pick because it will combine yield-bearing deposit products, tiered risk controls and a separate venue for speculative lending. The presale structure and planned progression toward broader exchange distribution will make MUTM attractive to investors who are re-evaluating their allocations amid volatile sentiment. For traders and long-term holders who are seeking an entry that blends utility with upside ahead of a potential year-end rally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a compelling alternative to simply chasing short-term momentum. With Phase 6 already half sold and Phase 7 priced 15% higher, the current window at $0.035 will stand out as a final discounted opportunity before the next step up.

52287378,589888,1758880832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52287378.jpeg,Leaked Chats Rock Bitcoin: Hard Fork Proposal Threatens Immutability,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hard-fork-plan-threatens-core-principle/,"A fresh leak published late Thursday has ignited the most charged governance dispute in Bitcoin since the SegWit2x era. In a report by The Rage, journalist L0la L33tz published messages attributed to Bitcoin Knots maintainer Luke Dashjr that outline a hard fork concept introducing a trusted multisignature “committee” empowered to retroactively alter data on the blockchain in order to remove illicit content, with the removals cryptographically attested by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Hard Fork Puts Bitcoin Immutability At Risk “Text messages shared with The Rage show that the Knots maintainer is considering a hardfork to implement a trusted multisig committee that can retrospectively alter the blockchain to remove illicit content,” the article states. It was updated on September 25, 2025. L33tz summarized the stakes starkly in her accompanying X thread : “This phrase has been greatly inflated over the years, but what Luke is proposing here is an attack on Bitcoin.” She added that a hard fork “that would implement a trusted committee with the power to retroactively alter the blockchain goes too far,” arguing that such a design “would turn Bitcoin into a permissioned network.” The published chat excerpts show Dashjr exploring a buried-state modification technique intended to deal with the risk that child sexual abuse material (CSAM) might be mined into a block. “I’m trying to come up with mitigation strategies for the risk CSAM gets mined — so my thought is after a block is identified as having CSAM, flag that one tx and use a ZKP for it,” one message reads, followed by: “Technically a hardfork, but since it’s buried, should be safe,” and “Probably would have a multisig sign-off on each ZKP.” The leak lands amid a year-long policy schism over inscriptions/ordinals, “spam” filtering, and the growing influence of Bitcoin Knots, a distribution maintained by Dashjr that ships stricter default policies for what a node relays or mines. Although debates about content filtering predate 2025, the notion of an explicit on-chain remediation mechanism ratified by a committee has provoked unusually sharp pushback from prominent industry figures. Reactions From X BitMEX Research called the idea “more and more like an attack on Bitcoin’s key censorship resistance characteristics.” Blockstream CEO Adam Back reacted: “Ugh. far worse than i could’ve imagined. Skipped past slippery slope arguments, @lukedashjr / knots plan is to jump straight to the censorship tech that myself and @csuwildcat were specifically warning about with legal citations from prior internet cases.” Abra founder Bill Barhydt warned that “Bitcoin War 2 seems imminent,” adding: “If hard fork rumors are true, I fear my maxi friends have bought into a narrative that could lead to a bait-and-switch by a small faction (e.g., one rogue developer)… Bottom line: Censoring the mempool is a bad idea. Let fee markets do their job.” JAN3’s Samson Mow urged restraint and a long time-horizon for protocol changes: “There exists a third faction that isn’t Core or Knots. We simply want Bitcoin to be secure, unchanging, and conservative. We believe development should be framed on a centuries-long timescale, with any proposed change approached with utmost care and caution. Primum non nocere.” In a separate message he reassured users: “There’s no need to pick a side… You are the network.” Will JPEGs Burn Bitcoin To The Ground? L33tz’s article also asserts that attorneys are preparing public letters advocating for sanctions targeting illicit content on Bitcoin and that Dashjr has been involved “behind the scenes,” though, according to the article, “feels [it is] better to stay out of [it] publicly on advice of counsel.” The piece argues that formalizing any committee with authority to rewrite history would “effectively erase Bitcoin’s censorship resistance ” and could expose node operators to liability if they decline to implement removals—concerns that touch the core of Bitcoin’s immutability ethos. If implemented, a buried-state rollback ratified by a trusted sign-off—even one paired with ZKPs—would mark a decisive departure from Bitcoin’s consensus model, where reorgs are emergent, permissionless, and economically disincentivized beyond shallow depth. The leaked concept suggests memorializing a special-case pathway to excise data post-confirmation, which critics fear could become a vector for compelled takedowns, politicized censorship, or regulatory capture over time. That risk profile is precisely why some are labeling the proposal an attack on Bitcoin’s “key censorship resistance characteristics.” As of publication, Dashjr has not posted a public technical specification or BIP for the mechanism described in the leaked messages, and no activation pathway has been formally proposed. But the reaction has been immediate and polarizing. “No matter what side you stand on in this debate… proposing the implementation of such a decree in the form of a hardfork that would implement a trusted committee with the power to retroactively alter the blockchain goes too far,” L33tz wrote, concluding: “Burning Bitcoin to the ground over JPEGs is not worth it.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,247.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 10:00:32

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis A fresh wave of Trump tariffs has admittedly hurt Bitcoin, with the token closing nearly 4% down in yesterday’s trading and now struggling to find support at the $110K level. Most notably, Bitcoin closed well below the 100 EMA yesterday – its second time doing so in just one month. The last time, in late August, it managed to climb back above, but given this second break, there’s a higher likelihood we could see the digital gold trade lower and reach for the 200 EMA on the daily chart. On the weekly chart, however, things look brighter. Even after the recent fall, Bitcoin remains within the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone – often called the golden pocket – where rebounds during bull runs typically occur, and this seems to be the case here as well. All in all, while the long-term outlook remains bullish, with Bitcoin holding firmly above long-period EMAs on the weekly and monthly charts, some turbulence can be expected in the coming weeks as the token battles macroeconomic pressure and regains momentum after what has already been a lengthy bull cycle. Bitcoin Slips Under $109K as Buyers Pile In – Bitcoin Hyper Soars as a Top Crypto Pick September 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin fell to a two-week low of $108,865 on September 25, intensifying selling pressure during the Asian trading session. Data shows a liquidation cluster between $111K and $107K , raising the risk of further decline if leveraged longs are liquidated. Institutional-sized futures selling continues to outweigh retail spot buying, keeping volatility high. Still, spot metrics reveal that buyers stepped in at the dips: the bid/ask ratio flipped back toward bulls as the price slipped from $111,200 to $110,553 , confirmed by a surge in cumulative volume delta (CVD). While spot demand remains smaller than futures-driven flows, this is the first bullish tilt since September 5–7, just before Bitcoin’s rally from $107,500 to $118,200. Overall, downside risks remain, but dip buyers are cautiously re-entering the market. With buyers active, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is seizing the momentum, with its presale already raising $18.2M. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper here . Bitcoin Dips Below $109K as $22B in $BTC Options Expire Today, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper’s $18M Presale September 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin dipped to $108,859 yesterday , following an increase in bear activity linked to today’s $22B Bitcoin options reaching their expiration date. This is Bitcoin’s lowest point over the last three weeks, with $275M in bull liquidations. Bears felt emboldened and targeted a $95,000-$110,000 price range by 8:00 AM UTC. Bulls failing to reclaim the $110,000 level by then would translate into a $1B advantage for sell options. Part of Bitcoin’s contraction links to concerns of a potential US government shutdown, triggered by Trump’s mass firings in the federal sphere, according to a memo . Despite Bitcoin’s bearish performance, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) holds strong after raising over $18.2M in presale so far. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is right here.

BTCI's strategy balances high monthly income (25.8% TTM) from Bitcoin volatility with better NAV protection compared to higher-yielding peers YBTC and YBIT. While BTCI limits upside during Bitcoin rallies, it delivers superior total returns (56%) and cushions against NAV erosion, though downside risks remain in case Bitcoin drops acutely. BTCI is a compelling choice for investors seeking income from crypto exposure, especially as interest rates decline and regulatory clarity improves. As shown in the orange chart below, it's impressive how quickly the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) has grown, crossing $700 million in AUM (assets under management) since its October 2024 launch. This steady growth in assets contrasts sharply with the highly volatile price action, but it has nonetheless delivered a net upside of around 19% since its inception. Data by YCharts Now, investor sustained interest in the fund is likely due to its unique strategy of generating high monthly income (26% TTM) from Bitcoin's volatility while better protecting against NAV erosion when compared with two peers, as this thesis aims to show. Also, while highlighting the risks, I will make the case for an investment based on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path and its diversifier potential for crypto exposure in a volatile market. First, I provide a quick overview of the fund's key details, emphasizing the income factor. BTCI Generates Income, but its Yield is not the Highest As an actively managed fund charging 0.98% , it generates income by writing (selling) call options on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Futures ETFs. In this way, the fund collects premiums, which form the basis for its high monthly distributions. Moreover, as shown below, dividends have been paid regularly, but, unlike some income funds which investors may be familiar with, the amount has varied depending on market conditions. Still, BTCI's core strategy to use Bitcoin's well-known volatility to generate income has worked since its dividend exceeds the median for all ETFs by a whopping 848% . seekingalpha.com Looking further, the alternative investment industry has seen the emergence of other such ETFs last year, with one of these being the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ), which pays much better yields of 43.8% every week, as shown in the comparison table below . There is also the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ), which pays an appetizing 53.8% monthly. seekingalpha.com Now, each of these income-oriented ETFs has its own strategies to generate income, and their outcomes (yield) also depend on specific volatility conditions to work best, but this comparison shows that for those prioritizing yields, BTCI does not come first. Still, the AUM comparison shows that more money has flowed towards the NEOS fund, at least three and five times YBTC and YBIT, respectively, despite it being incepted much later. Therefore, the reason for BTCI's appeal cannot be just the yields. BTCI Provides Better NAV Protection Diving deeper into the comparison, one notices that the NEOS strategy has fared better in terms of price performance (or NAV performance since we are comparing ETFs), both during the short and long terms, as shown below . Interestingly, these periods comprise both crypto appreciations or depreciations, and show BTCI has performed better during different market conditions. Comparison with peers (seekingalpha.com) Without going into the details for the other two funds, and considering its above-25% yield, this means that NEOS's data-driven strategy to maintain exposure to Bitcoin futures, as pictured below , has worked best when it comes to balancing yields with price protection. neosfunds.com Now, some will argue that an eleven-month period is too short to assess the price performance, but as shown in the chart below, market conditions have varied extremely, with Bitcoin making new highs (after gaining more than 50% from April to July) or suffering extreme volatility (dropping by about 30% from January to July). Data by YCharts I further support the fact that BTCI offers the best yield to NAV protection balance using total returns, which is the price appreciation plus the dividends if reinvested. Thus, as shown below, NEOS has demonstrated the best total returns (56.3%), followed by Roundhill (52.8%), with YieldMax coming in a distant third. Data by YCharts Now, to be fair to YieldMax, as its very name suggests, it aims to maximize the yield, but for those who are mindful of NAV erosion, this represents a risk better avoided for an already volatile asset class. Talking risks, the next step is to show that, despite its superior total returns, NEOS is not immune to severe drawdowns. The Risks Involved with BTCI's Strategy In this respect, the chart below shows that while BTCI shadows (tracks) BTC, it does not exactly replicate crypto's price movements. Analyzing an upside scenario, NEOS caps the fund's upside potential during sharp Bitcoin price rallies. Hence, when Bitcoin's futures price rises significantly, the fund may not capture all of those gains because of the options strategy. Data by YCharts Looking into the modus operandi, NEOS utilizes a “ synthetic covered call strategy ” for exposure to the Bitcoin Futures ETF, which also limits its participation in the rise of the crypto beyond a certain point. In other words, if Bitcoin surges sharply, the call options get exercised, denying BTCI the ability to fully participate in its underlying asset's appreciation. This can be frustrating for growth investors wanting maximum gains out of Bitcoin's rallies, as provided by spot ETFs. Analyzing a downside scenario, the premiums collected by writing call options act like a buffer to partially offset (soften) the downside when Bitcoin drops. However, this only happens during mild volatility, not during sharp price drops. Thus, as shown by the blue chart above closely shadowing the orange one during the January to April period, both BTC and BTCI lost around 40% showing that the option strategy was not that effective in cushioning against volatility when the underlying asset's drawdown is severe. Taking into consideration the above risks, BTCI is good for high-income seekers who are also prepared to sacrifice part of the upside. Moreover, taking into consideration the fund's vulnerability to severe drawdowns since its price performance is tied to Bitcoin, it is important to assess how the latter is performing. Bitcoin Volatility May Continue, and BTCI is a Good Diversifier As seen by the price action during the last five days, when it lost more than 3% , crypto's value can change very quickly and by a large percentage, which makes it risky to invest in, especially for those who cannot stomach risks. Thus, after reaching a high of $123K on August 12, investor appetite for BTC appears to have cooled off despite the Federal Reserve cutting rates by 25 basis points, notably the first dovish action this year. Now, Bitcoin’s price normally moves inversely to interest rates, meaning when rates go down, Bitcoin tends to rise as this increases liquidity in the monetary system. Thus, in the immediate aftermath of the rate cut on September 17, the price did appreciate to $117K, but the move was temporary, and subsequently, it traded at about $113.5K and at the time of writing, it was at approximately $110K. This drop coincided with the U.S. GDP for the second quarter growing stronger than was expected, meaning the Fed may not need to stimulate economic growth by lowering rates. Hence, in case rates stay at this level for longer, risk assets, including stocks and crypto, may not get sufficient of a boost. Another factor that raised the volatility level was the at least $22 billion in crypto options set to expire by the end of this week. In these circumstances, BTC price action is likely to fluctuate, especially in the case of inflation becoming sticky, forcing the Fed to remain restrictive. However, at the same time, the current U.S Administration, seen as pro-Bitcoin, aims to make America the "" crypto capital of the world"". Concrete measures include encouraging digital asset adoption and reducing regulatory uncertainty, hence making it easier to launch new crypto products. At the same time, institutional adoption is on the rise . Therefore, these factors can provide support to Bitcoin and avoid severe drawdowns, which could be detrimental to BTCI's NAV. BTCI is also Appropriate as a Bitcoin Diversifier In these conditions, I have a hold position on BTCI, which is also due to momentum indicators . With BTC's value situated below the 10-day, 50-day, and 100-day moving averages, the downside pressure could continue. However, with the RSI at 43, not oversold ( 70), this implies weakness, but not necessarily a sharp selloff. Also, the price could slide further from around $57 to the $47-$48 support level, constituting an opportunity to buy. So, the technicals could point to a downside drift, not a sharp drawdown, which is actually favorable for BTCI’s option-led income generation. In this scenario, the dividends generated lead to better total returns, thereby lessening the gap with BTC. For investors, the chart below shows how the gap between BTCI and BTC has narrowed to around 9% compared to 45% when only price returns are considered (above chart). www.ycharts.com In conclusion, this thesis has shown that for those wanting income while being mindful of NAV erosion, BTCI's strategy provides the best balance between yields and price performance, or NAV depreciation in this particular case. Moreover, given the volatility risks associated with this asset class, it may be better for those who already hold Bitcoin through an ETF and are contemplating putting more money into cryptos to diversify their exposure using the NEOS option strategy. To this end, compared to pure growth available through spot ETFs, BTCI presents a strong case involving generating income from volatility, making it suitable as a complementary holding in a crypto portfolio. In this connection, I calculated that BTCI's asset flow has accelerated by 600% (from around $100 million to $700 million in the introductory chart), just after Bitcoin’s dip. By comparison, the cumulative inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, while still positive, have experienced greater daily variability during this time period. Also, periods of outflows have started to emerge, like in August, coinciding with spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs seeing heightened investor interest. Well, this could be transitory and but income is a key factor that supports BTCI. It's above 25% source of yield, which already dwarfs those of classical equity and bond funds, will become even more attractive as interest rates on savings and cash equivalents decline in case the Fed carries out two further cuts by the end of this year, as expected.",YBTC|YBIT|BTCI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-26 10:03:43

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) also took a blow, recording over $253 million in outflows on Thursday, September 25, bringing the total number for the week to roughly $480 million, a figure expected to rise further if prices slide below key support levels. As things stand, resistance lower than $112,000 ‘isn’t great’ for the cryptocurrency , warned leading crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe in a social media post on Friday morning. Looking at the data from the past quarter, van de Poppe predicted that a failure to break out could see the world’s largest crypto sink toward the $107,000 level, a zone he thinks is ‘the first area for a potential bottom on BTC.’ “Basically, beneath the resistance at $112K isn’t great for Bitcoin. That’s why I think we’ll sweep the lows at $107K and see what we’re going to get from there. That’s the first area for a potential bottom on BTC ,” wrote the analyst on X. BTC analysis. Source: @CryptoMichNL A pivotal moment for Bitcoin? Data from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index showed a reading of as low as 28/100 on Friday, its lowest level since April 11, according to CoinMarketCap . The ratio fell 16 points in a single day, showing how quickly sentiment can shift in periods of heightened volatility. This was due to the broader cryptocurrency market having shed more than $150 billion in value in just 24 hours, with total capitalization plunging from $3.90 trillion to $3.75 trillion at press time. BTC bore the heaviest losses, erasing more than $20 billion. However, observing the signs of a potential bull trap , analyst Michael Pizzino noted in a YouTube video on Friday morning that while fear levels have indeed intensified, BTC trades significantly above past cycle lows. This, Pizzino argued, implies the run is potentially not yet over and that we might be witnessing ‘the turning point Bitcoin and crypto have been waiting for,’ as he dubbed it on X. MORE fear and a HIGHER price. Could this be the turning point Bitcoin and Crypto has been waiting for? The analysis looks good, but it has not been confirmed.

The consortium has created a new Netherlands-based company to issue the token. The central European banks forming the consortium include UniCredit (Italy), ING (Netherlands), DekaBank (Germany), Banca Sella (Italy), KBC Group (Belgium), Danske Bank (Denmark), SEB (Sweden), CaixaBank (Spain), and Raiffeisen Bank International (Austria). The goal is to challenge dollar dominance in stablecoins. The current stablecoin market is almost entirely dominated by the US dollar via $USDT ($173B market cap) and $USDC ($74B). Thus, most global crypto and digital payments rely on USD rather than EUR. Another possible reason could be Europe’s intention to attain strategic autonomy. Europe stepping in with its own stablecoin is seen as an effort to create an alternative to $USDT and $USDC, while also regaining control over digital payments and settlements. As Europe takes a bold step towards launching its own stablecoin, investors’ interest in crypto projects and utility-driven tokens with real momentum is rising. One standout is Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , a token backing a mobile-first crypto wallet. It’s currently in presale, having raised over $16.1M to date. Europe’s Big Push for Regulated Euro Stablecoins and Digital Sovereignty With the EU’s MiCA regulation offering a clear framework for stablecoin issuance, Europe has a safer backdrop to launch euro-backed stablecoins. This context already makes for an optimistic outlook. In light of the news, several European leaders and officials also voiced their positive opinions on a Euro stablecoin: Floris Lugt, ING’s digital assets lead, noted that stablecoins can speed up cross-border payments and cross-currency settlements. A recent ING press release covering Lugt’s statement went on to further explain how stablecoins can automate business transactions and improve supply chain payments. Similarly, ECB Governing Council member Joachim Nagel called the digital euro an essential milestone for EU financial sovereignty. Francois Villeroy de Galhau , Governor of the Bank of France, warned that if Europe falls behind the US stablecoin’s growth, the continent risks being dominated by private, dollar-backed stablecoins in the future. The EU’s bold new move is welcomed by retail and institutional investors worldwide considering the potential growth of the stablecoin market, with analysts estimating stablecoins potentially handling $100T–$200T in annual payments by 2030 . The growth of stablecoins may not only benefit banks but also boost demand for secure stablecoin wallets and related utility tokens, such as Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which is already undergoing a booming presale. Its wallet app already powers onramping, secure storage, transfers, and swaps for stablecoins and other tokens across top blockchains. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Utility Crypto with a Secure, Multi-Chain Wallet and DeFi Features Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of Best Wallet, a top-notch multi-chain asset storage offering seamless access to crypto onramping, DeFi platforms, and integrated decentralized swaps.

Learn more about Best Wallet Token with our guide. Then, we have Best Wallet , which is on a mission to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market by the end of 2026. As with any scaling crypto storage ecosystem, Best Wallet has built its own token to keep users engaged, fund growth, and build community ownership. The Best Wallet ecosystem itself stands out as a highly promising platform thanks to its comprehensive roadmap. It includes upcoming features such as the staking aggregator we mentioned, plus a crypto debit card, integrated market analytics, and derivatives trading. By the end of stage 4, this app will be an all-in-one crypto solution for retail traders. Backed by this vision, the $BEST token provides investors with direct exposure to the ecosystem’s growth. For early investors, it offers the added advantage of securing tokens at a lower price, positioning them to benefit most as the Best Wallet expands into multi-chain finance. $BEST Token Presale Is Booming, Attracting Whale Buyers $BEST’s presale has gained strong momentum, already raising $16.1M. Whales are now circling in, staking their bags with $BEST worth $70.2K and $50.9K , a clear reflection of the project’s strong upside potential. With the token currently priced at $0.025695 and our $BEST price prediction forecasting 98% growth in 2026, this could make a good long-term play for investors who seek to diversify. If our expert $BEST predictions come to fruition, a $500 investment in $BEST today could grow to around $685 by the end of 2025 (at $0.035215) and nearly $994 by 2026 (at $0.05106175) in price appreciation. New adopters can also lock in dynamic staking rewards (currently 82% APY). But rewards will naturally taper as more participants join, making the earliest investors the biggest winners. With staking at 82% APY and considering the most bullish forecasts, your $500 investment today could swell to roughly ~$1,808 after one year ($814.76 of that coming from staking rewards alone). This is assuming the APY and prediction hold. With the subsequent presale price rise set for tomorrow, now is the chance to secure $BEST at lower-tier prices. Visit the $BEST token presale now.

52290065,590440,1758885624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52290065.jpeg,"Stablecoins to Hit $4 Trillion by 2030, Says Citi Report: Best Time to Try Best Wallet",https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-4-trillion-by-2030-best-time-to-try-best-wallet/,"Stablecoins are rapidly becoming one of the dominant use cases linking crypto and tradfi. Recent forecasts, institutional moves, and regulatory efforts suggest the sector is reaching an inflection point. And now, at least one analysis believes the stablecoin market cap alone could reach $4 trillion by 2030. That’s twice the current size of the entire crypto economy in stablecoins alone. Forecasting a Stablecoin Boom That projection originates from Citi, whose analysts now estimate a base case of $1.9 trillion in stablecoin issuance by 2030, up from earlier forecasts. In a bullish scenario, the bank predicts issuance reaching $4 trillion. If stablecoins were to be integrated everywhere, the analysts suggest they could support as much as $100T of annual transaction volume, a scale dwarfing today’s markets. Citi tempers its optimism with caution. Many firms remain hesitant to adopt stablecoins in core operations, treating them as experimental tools rather than foundational infrastructure. In many domestic markets, conventional payment systems already operate at low cost and in near real time. Still, as l egislation finally catches up , stablecoin utility has steadily grown. The biggest real opportunity is in cross-border settlement, where inefficiencies still exist. Even so, Citi highlights that tokenized bank deposits may surpass stablecoins in usage by 2030. Bank tokens are tokenized deposits, deposit tokens, and other bank-issued tokenized assets. They provide the trust, familiarity, and regulatory safeguards of bank money, and many corporations prefer them over stablecoins. The final takeaway from the report highlights just how big the market could be. Still, just how much growth remains – even in a bullish case of $100T in payments annually, stablecoins would be a small percentage of the $5T-$10T leading banks send and receive daily. The current stablecoin market grew from around $200B in early 2025 to nearly $280B, despite experiencing significant market swings. Governments and regulators are actively discussing how to regulate the issuance, backing, and redemption of these asset instruments. Beyond market risk, stablecoins carry macro and geopolitical stakes. If dollar-pegged stablecoins maintain dominance, capital flows and payments globally may increasingly favor U.S. influence. The more stablecoins proliferate, the more issuers will likely hold U.S. Treasuries as reserve backing. This creates a strategic vulnerability for Europe: a foreign digital currency could undermine domestic monetary control. Europe’s Move: Consortium for a Euro-Backed Stablecoin In response, nine European banks — including UniCredit, ING, CaixaBank, SEB, and Raiffeisen — have teamed up to launch a euro-denominated stablecoin, aiming for a debut in late 2026. Incorporated in the Netherlands, the initiative will operate under a regulated license framework, with room for additional participants. The goal is more than technological innovation; it is part of a broader strategy for European payment sovereignty in the midst of concerns over a growing US stablecoin lead. The stablecoin project aligns with the enforcement of the EU’s MiCA regulation and complements efforts by the European Central Bank to push forward a digital euro. There’s a bit of urgency to the project – the dominance of U.S. dollar tokens could erode monetary control and expose Europe to external leverage. U.S. stablecoin incumbents like Tether ($USDT) and Circle ($USDC) already command massive network effects and liquidity. For the European project to succeed, it must overcome regulatory barriers, build trust, and provide liquidity – and fast. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Best Non-Custodial Wallet for Stablecoins and Crypto Presales Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the latest offering in a growing, powerful Best Wallet ecosystem.

However, some warn of risks of a more severe crash, potentially as low as $2.20. ADA has slipped by double digits in the past week, but some of its hard-core fans still think the rise to a new all-time high is on the horizon. While ETH tumbled below $4,000, important factors, such as shrinking exchange balances, suggest the bulls might be back soon. What Now for XRP? The substantial correction in the crypto market intensified over the past 24 hours, and Ripple’s XRP was among the worst-affected leading digital assets. Its price is down 10% on a weekly scale, currently trading at around $2.73 (per CoinGecko’s data). Earlier this week, Ali Martinez claimed that XRP has successfully defended the $2.71 support, which may open the door to a rebound to $3.60. Other analysts, though, believe the asset remains at a crossroads. Recently, X user EGRAG CRYPTO argued that the token is testing resistance in the $2.65–$2.70 range. They claimed that a breakout to the upside could result in a rally to $3.20, while the opposite scenario might lead to a crash to $2.20. Meanwhile, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped to oversold levels of around 30, meaning that a rebound is the more likely outcome. The technical analysis tool tracks the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes and is often used by traders to identify potential reversal points. Readings below 30 are typically viewed as bullish territory, whereas those above 70 could be interpreted as precursors of a pullback. XRP RSI, Source: CryptoWaves What About ADA? Cardano’s native token has experienced a more substantial decline than XRP, dumping by 16% over the past week to its current price of $0.76. Not long ago, Martinez highlighted $0.80 as a critical level that ADA must hold to have chances for a revival to $0.95. Now that it has been breached , the prospect of a resurgence looks uncertain. Despite the negative performance as of late, some proponents of the asset remain optimistic that the token is headed for new peaks. X user Sssebi predicted a new all-time high around Christmas this year and an eventual price explosion to $10. Is It ‘Game Over’ for ETH? The second-largest cryptocurrency slipped well below $4,000 in the past several hours, and some might speculate that its bull run is over. As CryptoPotato reported , though , three important factors signal that the bears could soon capitulate. Those include the declining amount of tokens stored at crypto exchanges (which reduces the immediate selling pressure), the RSI, which plunged to a five-month low of 15, and the accumulation of the whales. X user Ted noted that ETH has bounced back from its local bottom. However, he outlined $4,060 as a major support level that needs to be reclaimed so a rally can occur. “Otherwise, the chances of a dump towards $3,600 will go up,” he suggested.

Although ETH remains at the center of the DeFi market, its short-term price behavior remains hostage to market sentiment and overall direction of cryptocurrency. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token built on ETH now available for presale at $0.035, is also gaining steam with its lending-and-borrowing process. Having real-world applications and having a lower market price, Mutuum Finance is offering investors the promise of much higher returns, and it is something that should be watched as the market looks for more than tokens like Ethereum. Ethereum Near-Term Outlook: Short-Term Bear Pressure Below $3,560 Ethereum (ETH) is under short-term bear pressure after it fell from a symmetrical triangle formation, which typically signifies continuation of the trend in the same direction but sometimes also takes the shape of a flip. Traders like Michaël van de Poppe note that ETH could test support at levels of $3,550–$3,750, where $3,685 is an important technical level for the 20-week EMA. Triangle’s measured decline is showing $3,560, which indicates a potential 15% decline from here if there’s fresh selling pressure ahead of October. Presale Profits and Liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale successfully went live and is now at Stage 6, and tokens are available for purchase at $0.035. The project has already gained more than 16,570 investors and more than $16.3 million worth of invested capital. These are just the level of market demand MUTM has and global hype of going live. Mutuum Finance protocol hedges liquidity and volatility in real time. It will short illiquid positions opportunistically, never shorting too little on liquidation levels. Risk sizes are hedged too into stablecoins and ETH positions, and LTV ratios are collateralized using less volatile collateral. A reserve factor, proportionally allocated by asset classes, is also helping protocol security and reserve management optimization. Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to collateralize, lend, exchange, and USD-denominated token and asset settlement like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are utilized by the platform. Multi-layered infrastructure provides extremely accurate price data for high-pressure market scenarios. Early Adopter Rewards to the Community As an expression of appreciation to its first investors, Mutuum Finance has devised a $100,000 giveaway offer. Ten individuals will receive $10,000 each in the form of MUTM tokens, and that will be presale community support. Market volatility is one of the factors that must be controlled within Mutuum Finance’s collateral management framework. Asset stability is applied in arriving at LTV ratios and liquidation points, risk classes being separated into higher and lower classes. Reserve multipliers are thus used, commencing at 10% for risk-free assets and going up to 35% for risk tokens. Protection buffer room is offered while not compromising diversification in the portfolio. Mutuum Finance is creating an active capital-backed, passive borrowing and lending protocol. It will enable lending against securitized collateral and be backed by two simple mechanisms: a stability algorithm and an interest rate optimisation algorithm. They will create efficiency, resiliency, and long-term sustainable use of capital within the network as a whole. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing solid momentum as Ethereum (ETH) sees short-term bear pressure at under $3,500. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, with over 16,570 investors and $16.3M in funds raised, illustrating growing interest. MUTM brings utility in the market by offering a lending-and-borrowing protocol with dynamic risk adjustment, Chainlink oracles integration, and perpetual hedging of liquidity. With a $100,000 community giveaway behind it, it gives investors the chance for a good reward as ETH weakens. Join Stage 6 today and get tokens before the next price surge.

CEO Lei Jun said YU7 deliveries began on July 6 and quickly surpassed 40,000, though the figure still falls short of customer expectations. He acknowledged a “large gap” between orders and deliveries and pledged to accelerate output to close it. The YU7 industry benchmark record on the day of its debut was immediately established, with 289,000 orders locked in within the first hour. Additionally, more than 240,000 firmed-up orders were received within 18 hours. Even though most were deposit-backed reservations, the spike indicates a strong consumer interest in Xiaomi’s new EV. Xiaomi is pressing factories to do more to meet demand Xiaomi is working to boost production of the YU7 after a massive influx of orders strained its factories. The SUV has quickly become one of China’s most sought-after new cars, and meeting customer demand is now the company’s biggest challenge . The company shipped 16,548 YU7s in August, almost triple that of July. This includes sales of its first model, the SU7 sedan, and monthly total deliveries once more, which surpassed 30,000. That performance puts Xiaomi among the fastest-growing EV makers in the country, where veterans like BYD, Nio, and Tesla dominate. New YU7 buyers still face a long wait, but things look better. The delivery window now stands at 45–48 weeks. As of last month, it came in at 56–59 weeks. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, Xiaomi is scaling up production . They estimate that the company’s weekly run rate for production could soon hit 10,000 units — an important milestone in competing against larger rivals. Part of the problem is that the YU7 is such a complex machine. Unlike the SU7 sedan, it took 230 days before rolling off the first batch of 100,000 units. YU7 is a relatively large SUV with more parts demanding longer assembly. Nevertheless, Xiaomi has picked up speed, which indicates the company’s ability to learn rapidly from a grueling first effort. Industry watchers say that this rapid scale-up will prove critical. China’s EV market is hypercompetitive, with Tesla cutting prices to hold on to share and BYD expanding aggressively at home and abroad. The YU7’s fate beyond headlines could rest on Xiaomi’s ability to keep its production lines humming and delivery systems running without too many delays or disappointed customers. Behind the scenes, Xiaomi is in close contact with suppliers to lock down steady supplies of batteries, semiconductors, and other key components. It is also investing in automation and more production lines to alleviate bottlenecks. Xiaomi doubles down on its EV ambitions Xiaomi is doubling down on electric vehicles to diversify its business and challenge established players in the sector, after being best known for smartphones and consumer gadgets. In terms of size and price, the YU7 is squarely aimed at Tesla’s Model Y, which gets a similar range from a more expensive base price — around 253,500 yuan ($34,900). Aggressive pricing enabled Xiaomi to capture the imagination of price-conscious Chinese customers. Analysts say the SUV could turn into a hit if production bottlenecks subside. However, the company is facing glaring challenges. Xiaomi’s fledgling car division is expected to scale up production without sacrificing quality. Supply chains for batteries and chips also feel the pinch of broader industry shortages. Investors are watching closely to see if the company can keep up without costly delays. For Lei Jun, the goal is clear. He has pledged to ramp up production, reiterating that Xiaomi needs to convert overwhelming demand into reliable, on-time shipments. Whether the YU7 can gain local traction may determine the company’s standing in China’s brutally competitive EV race. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This decline is driving some investors to panic sell, while others, seeing the decline as an opportunity, are buying at a lower price. At this point, whales are frantically buying Ethereum (ETH). According to Lookonchain's post, despite the sharp decline in the ETH price, whales are taking advantage of this opportunity and buying ETH at a lower price. Accordingly, Lookonchain first said that 15 wallets purchased 406,117 ETH worth $1.6 billion from Kraken, GalaxyDigital, BitGo, and FalconX in the last two days. An OTC whale also purchased 60,333 ETH worth $238.7 million at an average price of approximately $4,230 over the last seven days. This whale has a loss of over $16 million. While whales are buying nearly $2 billion, taking advantage of the drop in ETH, other whales are also buying XPL. According to Lookonchain's post, one whale sold HYPE and bought $7.9 million worth of XPL, while two whales bought $12.2 million worth of XPL. “Whales are buying XPL. 0x8393 sold 249,999 HYPE (worth $10.5 million) and bought 7.92 million XPL. 0xcc07 deposited 6.27M USDC into Hyperliquid and bought 5.28M XPL at $1.19. 0xF555 deposited 6M USDC into Hyperliquid and bought 5.7M XPL at $1.05.” *This is not investment advice.

The massive outflow coincided with a dramatic collapse in trading activity, as daily volumes crashed from KRW 17.1 trillion in December 2024 to just KRW 3.2 trillion by June. Source: BOK Active Withdrawal Despite Bitcoin Price Gains The decline occurred despite Bitcoin’s price appreciation during the same period, indicating retail investors were actively withdrawing from crypto markets rather than experiencing passive losses. Exchange deposits fell from KRW 10.7 trillion to KRW 6.2 trillion, confirming widespread fund outflows. Korean retail investors shifted focus from crypto to domestic equities, which outperformed overseas markets amid a strengthening won currency. The pivot was particularly pronounced in U.S. tech stocks, with monthly purchases dropping from $1.68 billion between January and April to just $260 million by July. However, South Korean authorities are simultaneously accelerating pro-crypto policies, with President Lee Jae-myung designating digital asset ecosystem development as a “key national task.” The Democratic Party also launched a crypto policy task force this month, promising legislation before the end of the year to foster industry growth. Mass Exodus From Crypto to Traditional Assets The Bank of Korea attributed the decline in the crypto market partly to Korean investors’ strategic pivot toward domestic equities during a period of relative outperformance. Local stock markets provided attractive alternatives as global uncertainty around U.S. tariff policies created volatility in overseas investments. Korean retail investors demonstrated particular disillusionment with Tesla, selling a net $657 million in August alone as the electric vehicle maker lost its compelling narrative. Instead, crypto-related stocks, such as Bitmine Immersion Technologies, attracted $253 million in net inflows. Daily trading volumes on domestic crypto exchanges experienced an unprecedented decline of over 80% from their peak levels. The decline affected stablecoin trading growth, which had been expanding steadily before slowing during the withdrawal period. Despite the domestic downturn, global crypto markets reached a total capitalization of $4.2 trillion by September, representing 3.2% of the worldwide stock market value. Source: CoinGecko Institutional adoption and legislative progress, including the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act , supported the growth of the international crypto market. Korean crypto investors maintained significant positions despite the outflows, with over 10,000 residents holding assets exceeding 1 billion won ($750,000). The nation’s 10.86 million active trading accounts represent roughly 20% of the total population. Source: YNA In fact, survey data revealed that 51% of South Koreans aged 20-59 have experience with crypto trading, with 27% currently holding digital assets, averaging 13 million won ($9,547) per investor. Early adopters typically began with Bitcoin before diversifying into altcoins and stablecoins, with 60% starting during the 2020 bull run. Government Pushes Pro-Crypto Agenda Despite Market Decline President Lee Jae-myung’s administration has launched comprehensive crypto-friendly reforms , reclassifying trading firms as “ venture companies ” to grant them access to tax incentives and state-backed financing that was previously denied since 2018. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups proposed amendments to include Virtual Asset Service Providers under the category of venture companies. Financial regulators lifted restrictions on institutional crypto investments while preparing approval frameworks for Korea’s first spot crypto ETFs . South Korea is moving to reclassify crypto firms as “venture companies,” which would grant access to government subsidies. #SouthKorea #Crypto https://t.co/FucfcydMDq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 9, 2025 The Financial Services Commission also presented implementation measures scheduled for late 2025 , alongside regulatory frameworks for won-based stablecoins. Major banks established dedicated crypto teams in anticipation of legislative approval. Woori Bank launched a nine-member Digital Asset Team, while Kookmin Bank created a Digital Asset Response Council covering KB Financial Group affiliates. Similarly, Shinhan Bank formed a 20-employee crypto task force as institutions prepare rapid market entry strategies. Local governments simultaneously intensified crypto tax collection efforts. According to a recent Cryptonews report, Cheongju City has seized tokens from 203 residents since 2021 for unpaid taxes and has opened its own trading account to directly liquidate confiscated assets. The city collected 1.5 billion won ($1.1 million) from 161 tax evaders through crypto seizures. The Democratic Party’s crypto policy task force pledged to streamline regulations away from operator restrictions toward industry fostering. Task force leaders plan consultations with regulators, the Bank of Korea, and private sector experts to develop comprehensive digital asset legislation.

Traders and investors are watching closely, as this could lead to big price swings. Will the market react with a strong surge upwards or face a sharp drop? The answer may shape the next big move for Bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin hovers near 115k after a shaky week. Price fell 3.87% in 7 days but still shows a 1.62% uptick over the month. Zoom out six months and the chart flashes a solid 32.61% climb. RSI at 37.97 and a 14.66 stochastic flag an oversold market begging for direction. The coin trades between 113,838 and 117,373. Nearest support sits at 112,353, then 108,818. Resistance lines stand at 119,422 and 122,957. The 10 day average is 112,218 while the 100 day comes in at 113,360. MACD remains negative at -314.17. A push above 119,422 could unlock about 4% upside and invite 122,957 soon after. Breaking that cap would mark a new six month high. Drop below 112,353 may shave 3%, and 108,818 sits almost 6% lower. Given the oversold signals and the wider 32.61% rise, a rebound looks more likely than a deep slide. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.0055 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Conclusion BTC expiry may fuel 2025 bull run. First All-Sport Memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) fuses sports fandom with meme hype, aiming PEPE-like gains and rewards through a GameFi roadmap toward icon status.

The study points to increasingly organized methods of laundering stolen funds using practices that resemble professional financial operations. Elliptic’s investigators found that scammers often pool victims' deposits into self-hosted wallets used only to consolidate and move funds. From there, the money flows through chains of transactions designed to obscure its origin, sometimes passing through cross-chain bridges or payment processing services that offer a veneer of legitimacy. A common tactic involves using mule accounts at regulated crypto platforms. These accounts frequently share suspicious markers such as identical residential addresses, repeated IP logins, and patterns of transfers between accounts. Photos submitted for compliance checks sometimes show operators working out of call centers or warehouses in Southeast Asian countries where pig-butchering operations are known to originate. The report underscores that, unlike cash-based crime, blockchain leaves behind visible transaction trails. This transparency gives regulators and platforms new tools to spot suspicious activity even as scammers refine their methods. Elliptic also warns that pig butchering is only one piece of a broader picture. The report also detailed how individuals facing official sanctions are increasingly turning to stablecoins for cross-border transactions.",Finance|Elliptic|Crime|Money Laundering|Pig Butchering|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-26 11:40:15

Powell’s tone read “not in a sprint to ease,” and the dot plot implies room for more cuts this year, but not a flood. Long-end yields popped after the decision, a classic “hawkish cut” tell. Watch the 10-year as your macro risk gauge. U.S. equities ripped to fresh records; crypto bounced, then stalled. This is not the decoupling we wanted — yet. For crypto, momentum is mixed: majors failed to push through key mid-range levels; breadth in alts is trying (compression + bullish EMA crosses) but needs follow-through. Markets on Edge: Fed Rate Cut and the Crypto Reaction https://t.co/1IWKYIFHqP — Kraken (@krakenfx) September 19, 2025 Macro in one chart (and why it matters) The decision: –25 bps to a 4.00%–4.25% target range. Futures had it largely priced; the upside surprise (50 bps or ultra-dovish guidance) didn’t arrive. Powell emphasized caution and data-dependence. Markets now lean toward two additional 25 bps cuts in 2025, but participants are split — classic recipe for chop. The tell: 10-year Treasury up, curve steepening. The 10-year yield rising likely signals that the market still has concerns about longer term inflation, which could be a headwind for risk assets. Keep that 10-year quote on your layout. Meanwhile, stocks at highs (S&P 500, Nasdaq; small caps ripping) underscore that liquidity hopes remain alive — even if bonds are pushing back. What we’re seeing on the crypto charts Bitcoin (trend-following lens) Mid-range rejection: The level we flagged on prior streams rejected cleanly; no sustained momentum post-FOMC. Next spot to watch: Confluence of the 4h EMAs + prior swing-low cluster. First “reaction zone” for a constructive retest. Failure there opens a deeper sweep into range-low territory. Ethereum (momentum check) ETH attempted a push around the FOMC window, but failed to push above the weekly open. Market structure isn’t broken, just indecisive. We want either a swift reclaim above the cluster or a tagged retest lower with buyers stepping in. Market breadth: TOTAL3 & “Others” TOTAL3 (crypto market cap ex-BTC & ETH) is boxed between prior ATH bands. Above = risk-on for alts; below = risk-off. While you can’t trade it directly, it’s a vibe check: it confirms whether alt strength is there or not. “ Others ” shows a similar picture: breakouts met the first big supply shelf and faded. Not a breakdown (yet) but it’s a battlefield. Translation: The risk-reward favors patience until we get confirmation (break and hold) or a deeper retest (flush into demand). Setups we walked through We focus on structure + EMAs with simple, falsifiable plans. No leverage needed for these ideas; spot lets you survive volatility. DOGE (strength → hesitation): Strong trend signal from bullish EMA crosses, but price is fighting to hold above prior swing-highs. Either flip/hold that shelf for continuation, or wait for the cleaner dip into the next demand box. “I just got here” pattern (newer listings): Weeks of slow bleed → base → reclaim EMAs/Fibs → ride to logical targets. We showcased it using PUMP historically, then mapped EIGEN as today’s analogue: prolonged bleed, basing, EMAs turning up, constructive reclaim. For risk: keep stops below the impulse that kicked off the reclaim, and don’t force leverage. Compression breakouts (alt bucket): A handful of alts show volatility contraction near monthly opens with fresh bullish EMA crosses. First steps are in; sustainability is the question. If the weekend resolves higher, breakout-continuation trades activate; if not, retest-buys lower down often offer better asymmetry. let's discuss the dipperino; – levels $BTC $ETH $SOL – now what? – our fresh entries (this AM) $ENA $EIGEN pic.twitter.com/QrPrE2qYQk — Dentoshi (@Dentoshi) September 22, 2025 Playbook for the next 1–2 weeks Respect the 10-year. Rising long yields post-cut = “hawkish cut” conditions. If the 10-year cools, risk appetite improves; if it climbs, be selective. Majors first. BTC reclaiming the mid-range with momentum is your green light for broader beta. If BTC drifts into the EMA/demand cluster and reacts well, alts get room to run. Breadth confirmation. Want TOTAL3/“Others” to break and hold above supply bands. Otherwise, avoid chasing and look for fade → retest → reclaim structures. Two entry archetypes only: Breakout-strength: Fresh highs and higher-low support on low timeframes – but only if the market looks good as a whole. Retest-logic: Flush into pre-mapped demand with EMAs rising underneath (your “plunge protection”). Risk management: Position size so that your invalidation (below impulse or key EMA structure) equals a known % of portfolio risk. No hero leverage in a macro-heavy week. Why this felt like a “hawkish cut” Expected size (25 bps) → no upside surprise. Powell’s tone: “not in a rush to ease” → markets re-priced path-of-cuts lower. Dot plot: bias to cut again this year, but the committee is split. Bonds: long rates up; steepening curve. These are classic “hawkish cut” breadcrumbs — and they map cleanly to the crypto hesitation we saw.

The financial pyramid scheme has been active for several years in Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe, offering victims high returns on investments in various crypto projects. Kazakhstan brings down massive crypto pyramid Amir Capital, an entity posing as an international investment fund, is under investigation in Kazakhstan for allegedly running a crypto Ponzi scheme. The company actively solicited funds from citizens of Kazakhstan and several other former Soviet states, including Kyrgyzstan, Belarus and Russia, the Central Asian nation’s Financial Monitoring Agency announced. It offered potential victims 5-10% income from cryptocurrency trading, mining and investments in different projects, the agency detailed in a press release on Thursday. Investors were required to register on the platform’s website and create personal accounts. They were asked to deposit amounts in several cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the stablecoin Tether (USDT). Authorities seek seizure of $10 million in digital assets Part of the funds received were then redistributed among previously recruited participants in the pyramid-style structure, with interest paid using money deposited by newer members. Amir Capital restricted withdrawals at the end of 2021. Its managers attributed this to technical issues they promised to solve, but access to customer balances was never restored. Investigators said they have obtained a court order for the seizure of crypto assets valued at more than $10 million, as well as a land plot in the Almaty region. More than 40 people are believed to have been involved in the criminal scheme, according to officials from the local department of the Anti-Monopoly Service (AFM) in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, who are leading the ongoing investigation. One of the Ponzi scheme’s alleged organizers, a female suspect whose identity was not revealed in the announcement , has been arrested and remanded in custody for two months. Kazakhstan’s opening to crypto comes with challenges The emergence of crypto-related criminal organizations, such as the recently busted large pyramid scheme, seems to be a side effect of Kazakhstan’s rapid rise to prominence in the crypto space over the past few years. The Central Asian nation became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining in the wake of China’s decision to enforce a ban on crypto-related activities, including the minting and trading of digital coins in 2021. That same year, Kazakhstan’s power grid was literary overwhelmed by the influx of miners, attracted by its low electricity rates, and the country faced energy shortages until authorities addressed the issue through restrictions and pricing. At the same time, the government in Astana took steps to tap into the industry’s profits, legalizing and regulating the market, including by offering mining firms options to trade their coins on authorized domestic platforms. It now plans to expand the licensing regime to add more exchanges. In early June, the National Bank of Kazakhstan gave the go-ahead on a project to issue crypto payment cards, and a local bank started testing the first offering in early September. In August, a Kazakhstan-based exchange announced the listing of the country’s, and the region’s, first Bitcoin ETF. Criminals have also been exploiting Kazakhstan’s opening to crypto assets. In August, financial and law enforcement authorities revealed they had unraveled a scheme to mine cryptocurrency on illegally supplied electricity that cost the state over $16 million.

Bitcoin ETFs posted $258.4 million in outflows which brings its weekly outflows to breach $484 million. The exodus comes as BTC dropped below $109,000. This turns out to be its weakest level in nearly a month. Data shows that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out as the only fund to attract inflows. It pulled in $79 million while its rivals, including Fidelity, Bitwise, ARK 21Shares, Franklin, VanEck, and Grayscale, all bled assets. Despite dealing with pullbacks, Bitcoin ETFs remain in net-positive territory with more than $57 billion in cumulative inflows since launch. Fidelity’s FBTC saw withdrawals of $114.8 million, Bitwise posted $80.52 million of outflows, and Ark’s ARKB recorded $63 million of sell-offs. Ether ETFs bleed $251M in a day Spot Ether ETFs were hit even harder with $251 million exiting on Thursday alone. Its weekly outflows now total $547 million with ETH sliding 8% on the day to trade near $3,900. Ethereum is down by 21% from last month’s highs. The sell-off wiped out more than $140 billion in crypto market value since the start of the week and triggered more than $1.1 billion in leveraged position liquidations, according to SoSoValue. Ether long bets made up the largest share of losses. Ethereum linked ETFs’ daily outflow data, Source: SoSoValue . Still, some analysts framed the correction as routine. “A $15,000 pullback in Bitcoin is just 12% from all-time highs. ETH is only down about 10% from peak,” one market observer noted. “Whatever you spot buy today will look glorious in six months.” ETF pipeline grows even as Bitcoin slumps Even as funds bled, ETF product development accelerated. The SEC this week approved the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF under new generic listing standards, while REX-Osprey launched the first Ether staking ETF. Cryptopolitan reported that Bitwise filed for a Hyperliquid (HYPE) ETF, and BlackRock registered the name “iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF,” a covered-call strategy designed to generate yield on BTC exposure. “It shows they’re doubling down on BTC and ETH while steering clear of other coins, at least for now,” said Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. In parallel, Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke moved $6 million worth of ETH to Kraken, according to Lookonchain. The transfer followed a $9.2 million deposit in August and rekindled speculation about further sales after Wilcke reposted a comment suggesting he may offload more. The latest downturn leaves Bitcoin at risk of revisiting the $107,000 zone, which analysts say is a key liquidity cluster for leveraged positions. Whether buyers once again step in at those levels could determine if the current drawdown is just a shakeout or the start of a deeper retracement. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The incident reportedly unfolded on Thursday, which prompted a response from the platform assuring customers that all affected traders would be reimbursed. In a post on X early Friday, the Aster team said compensation had been distributed in full. Users who suffered losses during the disruption received their reimbursement directly in USDT credited to their exchange accounts. “We appreciate your patience and understanding throughout this process,” Aster wrote . “For any further questions, please submit a ticket via our Discord.” Misconfigured index hiked XRP trade prices and caused liquidations Earlier in the week, several community reports and blockchain analysts had identified a technical misstep that caused the price movements in XPL perpetual trades. According to an on-chain researcher going by the pseudonym Guthix on X, the index price for the XPL pair had been hard-coded at $1, while the mark price was capped around $1.22. When that cap was lifted without adjusting the index, the trading price on Aster spiked to nearly $4. Other exchanges trading XPL continued to show stable values close to $1.3, almost 3x less than values seen on the perpetual decentralized exchange. The sudden jump triggered a wick that temporarily froze Aster’s trading chart before prices returned to more realistic levels. Several traders, however, were liquidated during the chaos, with numbers reportedly clocking about $32 million in long bets. At the time of the disruption, Aster sent a notice on X that it had identified the irregular activity in the trading pair. “We are aware of abnormal price movements on the XPL perpetual trading pair. Rest assured, all user funds are SAFU. We are conducting a full review and will compensate any affected users for losses,” the platform wrote. The issue on the XPL perpetual trading pair has been fully resolved. All users liquidated during this period will have their liquidation losses calculated and reimbursed directly to their wallets in USDT within the upcoming hours. Further updates will be shared shortly. We… — Aster (@Aster_DEX) September 25, 2025 At around 10:40 PM UTC Thursday, Aster announced that the problem had been solved and all losses from liquidations were to be calculated before the reimbursement commenced. About four hours later, the DEX team said most of the users had been compensated. A second update from the team early Friday morning confirmed that compensation went beyond losses from liquidation. “Update on XPL perp incident: Another round of compensation including trading fees and liquidation fees has now been fully distributed,” Aster wrote, confirming users recovered the full amount lost during the disruption. Aster volume growth continues amid technical setback Even during the XPL perpetual trade incident that troubled Aster, the exchange generated $16.3 million in daily trading fees over the last 24 hours, according to a Dune Analytics dashboard . The fee was more than triple Hyperliquid’s $4.9 million. DEX Marketshare Fees Aster and Hyperliquid chart.

In terms of trading volume, Aster has more than tripled Hyperliquid in the last 24 hours, recording $35.87 billion, while the latter garnered $10.09 billion. The Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao-backed DEX has been a driving force in perpetual trading volumes across decentralized exchanges for the whole of this week. DefiLlama data shows the platform reached an all-time high of $70 billion in trading volumes on Thursday. Open interest on Aster’s native ASTER token has surged as well.

The company's revenue is still entirely derived from mining Bitcoin, but Cipher is preparing for leasing agreements with HPC tenants. Despite trading at multiples that are on par with companies that have already established HPC revenue sources, no such agreement exists for Cipher. I'd be very careful if I were holding CIFR shares at this juncture. I wouldn't personally be overexposed. When I last covered Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) for Seeking Alpha in March, the stock was trading under $4 per share. At that time, the company was running out of cash and looked to be battling problematic economics from mining Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) after losing money during both 2023 and 2024. Naturally, the stock is up over 250% since my 'hold' call during the first quarter of 2025: Data by YCharts While CIFR stock did actually go down by 46% in the month following that 'hold' call, it's quite clear at this point that the bulls are completely in control of this ticker. And to be sure, most of this monster rally in CIFR has happened over the last six weeks or so. In this update, we'll look at the company's latest quarter of performance to see if fundamentals are driving this move or if it's more likely being driven by pure speculative froth. Q2-25 Earnings During the quarter ended 2025, Cipher Mining reported $43.6 million in top line revenue - all of it from mining Bitcoin. This was down sequentially from $49 million in the first quarter, but up 18.4% year over year: Data by YCharts Between April and June, Cipher mined roughly 500 BTC. The company has been quickly scaling exahash capacity over the last two months with 23 EH/s at the end of August. Cipher Monthly Production (Cipher Mining, Author's Chart) Despite nearly doubling mining capacity in Q2-25 relative to Q2-24, Cipher's raw BTC mined in the last quarter was essentially the same as it was in the two post-halving months from Q2-24. Overall, total mined BTC in the quarter was down year over year. Factoring in the increasing expenses the company is enduring quarter after quarter, Cipher's net income in Q2-25 was negative by nearly $46 million: Data by YCharts A very large part of this is the $44 million in amortization and depreciation during the quarter; which actually exceeded top line revenue during the period. COGS only grew by a modest 1.4% year over year, and gross profit surged by over 100%. At 20.8% of revenue in Q2, Cipher's SG&A expense isn't nearly as egregious as some of its Bitcoin mining-turned HPC peers. But there is no question that the company is still spending a lot of money on both network hashrate growth and on its HPC ambitions. Q2-25 was the fourth quarter out of the last five with negative operating income. Valuation At just under a $5.6 billion valuation, CIFR shares are trading at more than 31x trailing sales and more than 20x forward sales: Seeking Alpha In the past, one of the metrics that I've liked to look at when valuing a Bitcoin mining company is the price-to-annualized sales over a three-month average BTC-mined metric. This still works for CIFR because despite the plans for HPC revenue in the future, the company is still generating revenue entirely from mining. Over the last three months, Cipher is averaging 203 BTC in monthly production. So if we build a forward sales multiple based on that level of production, this is how the P/S table breaks out by price per coin: BTC Based FWD Sales Table CIFR Market Capitalization $5,560,000,000 3 Month Avg Production (June-August) 203 FWD P/S At $100k BTC 22.82 FWD P/S At $150k BTC 15.22 FWD P/S At $200k BTC 11.41 Source: Analyst's calculation Even at a $150k BTC price, CIFR stock is trading at 15x forward sales. This is an aggressive valuation in my view. Especially considering BTC is actually far closer to $100k than $150k per coin at this point in time. At the lower end price, CIFR is trading at 23x forward sales. HPC Deal Hype Despite being the only way Cipher currently generates revenue, I would argue the stock is not being valued based on its Bitcoin mining footprint. Compared with mining peers, the chart below shows the P/S multiples for CIFR, MARA Holdings ( MARA ), IREN Limited ( IREN ), and TeraWulf ( WULF ): Data by YCharts MARA is the one that I believe the market views as a Bitcoin mining stock in the more traditional sense. The other three are viewed as HPC/AI companies, and to no surprise, those three trade at significant P/S multiples over MARA, with CIFR actually being valued higher than IREN. We already saw a little over a month ago that Bitcoin miners that have pivoted to prioritizing HPC services can generate interest from important AI-related companies. Back in August, TeraWulf announced backing from Google (GOOGL) ( GOOG ) less than 24 hours after I called the company a 'sell.' That stock has subsequently doubled. These things happen. The point I'm ultimately trying to illustrate here is CIFR is now trading at the same multiple as WULF even though it lacks the financial backing that has propelled those shares higher. In conjunction with Q2 earnings, Cipher CEO Tyler Page was quoted with the following: In the long run, we expect this site to be fully leased by HPC tenants. By taking this approach to building infrastructure today, we will be prepared to sign tenants when they are ready, while also preserving our flexibility to use the space for bitcoin mining in the near term, if preferred. While there is definitely sentiment on platforms like X that shareholders believe an HPC deal is coming. At least so far, Cipher has yet to land a lease agreement. Summary While I certainly have no interest in getting TeraWulf'ed again - which is to say calling the stock a 'sell' only to immediately eat my words - I would be pretty cautious if I were holding CIFR stock at this point. The company's actual revenue breakout is reminiscent of a Bitcoin mining pure play, but its valuation is on par with companies that are already generating revenue from HPC/data center services. This is despite the fact that there is no tenant or lease agreement yet. To be sure, that could certainly change. But why pay today for a deal that might not actually happen?",BTC-USD|CIFR,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-26 12:00:00

Foreigners are buying U.S. stocks like it’s the last bus out of town. According to the Federal Reserve, foreign ownership of U.S. stocks just hit nearly 32% of all U.S. assets held by non-residents, blowing past a record that had held since 1968. This spike came in the second quarter of 2025, right in the middle of Trump’s loudest economic rants and protectionist policies. While global demand for U.S. goods has dropped and fewer people are flying into the States, the stock market is the one place foreigners aren’t backing away from. They’ve actually sped up. Tech is part of the reason, everyone’s trying to grab a piece of the AI boom that’s fattened share prices of giants like Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft. But while money has been pouring into stocks, the dollar’s been sinking, which could be a sign that some investors are hedging their bets. Foreign buyers flood U.S. stocks while skipping the products Rob Anderson, who tracks sectors at Ned Davis Research, said the trade war may have scared off foreign buyers of U.S. products, but it did nothing to cool their appetite for stocks. “While tariffs have led many foreign consumers to boycott US products, US equities remained in high demand,” Rob said. Canadians in particular are still putting cash into U.S. stocks even though they’re avoiding American-made goods. In just three months ending June 30, foreigners pushed $290.7 billion into the U.S. stock market. And that was just the beginning. Elyas Galou, global investment director at Bank of America, said that by July, foreign holdings of U.S. equities were already on pace to jump by $2.8 trillion this year. That kind of growth is unheard of. By the time the data came in, total foreign ownership had ballooned to $18 trillion, which is 30% of the entire $60 trillion U.S. equity market, the highest level since records began in 1945. Elyas said, “International investors are still buying US equities at a very strong pace.” These holdings have climbed not just in dollar value, but in total market share — showing this isn’t just a side bet. This is serious buying. And yet, 2025 hasn’t exactly been a great year for U.S. indexes. On a pure return basis, the S&P 500 has underperformed major indices in Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China, and Japan, both in local currencies and in dollar terms. The MSCI World Index is up 15% this year and might outdo the S&P for the first time since 2017. If you strip the U.S. out completely, the MSCI All-Country World Index has done even better — 22% up, compared to 13% on the S&P 500. Tech obsession and Fed rate cut push investment frenzy Sam Stovall, chief strategist at CFRA, said he was surprised. “Why would they come here if their own markets are hitting record highs?” he asked. The answer, he figures, is the AI wave. Foreigners aren’t buying broadly — they’re targeting big U.S. tech names. “The tech sector has scored 26 new all time highs this year,” Sam said. That bet started paying off fast. Since bottoming on April 8, U.S. stocks have roared back. What pushed them higher? The Federal Reserve made its first rate cut in over a year, which sent prices climbing again. Elyas pointed to EPFR fund flow data, saying international investors kept pumping money into U.S. equity funds at the fastest pace since March — and they didn’t stop through the third quarter. Brian Jacobsen, economist at Annex Wealth Management, thinks a lot of this has nothing to do with politics. He said many foreigners just don’t want to hold Treasuries anymore, but they still want U.S. exposure. “A lot of foreign holders of US assets who don’t want to hold Treasuries realize that their complaints are against the government and not against companies,” Brian said.

Dubai and Abu Dhabi now host exchanges, VC firms, and sovereign-backed initiatives that position the region as a magnet for startups. Visibility in this region is not limited to hype. Firms expanding in MENA should care about navigating regulation, speaking to multilingual audiences, and building credibility in cautious markets. Why PR in MENA Is Different Expanding in the Middle East & North Africa requires a different communications playbook: Regulatory awareness: Dubai’s VARA and Abu Dhabi’s ADGM provide clarity, but rules vary widely across MENA. Messaging must highlight compliance, not speculation. Language duality: English dominates business media, but Arabic remains essential for mass adoption. PR must bridge both. Credibility over hype: Investors and regulators value education and transparency over buzzwords. Hybrid media ecosystems: Mainstream outlets (Gulf News, The National), global crypto publications, and Arabic KOLs on X and Telegram all matter. Cultural nuance: Campaigns must respect religious and business norms, aligning with the region’s values around ethics and sustainability. With that in mind, here’s a look at the five firms making a mark in 2025, based on their track record, adaptability, and regional presence. Best Crypto PR Agencies in MENA Agency Distinction Best For Outset PR Data-driven, boutique, proven in MENA Projects needing measurable ROI + localization FINPR Dubai-based, guaranteed placements Startups needing fast visibility PRLab Storytelling, sustainable brand positioning Firms wanting long-term credibility GuerrillaBuzz Guerrilla stunts + SEO authority Teams needing bold differentiation Luna PR Dubai ecosystem connections Brands seeking prestige and high-profile presence 1. Outset PR — Data-Driven Campaigns With MENA Traction While many agencies in Europe and the US claim global reach, Outset PR has demonstrated it with on-the-ground results in the Middle East. Founded by crypto PR strategist Mike Ermolaev , the agency runs like a workshop powered by data, tailoring each campaign for market fit and measurable ROI. Key advantages of Outset PR: Uses analytics (discoverability, domain authority, conversion potential) to select media, rather than relying on generic lists. Blends global PR credibility with local adaptation — including Arabic content localization. Acts as a boutique partner, offering editorial polish and strategy rather than one-size-fits-all packages. MENA case study: XPANCEO (UAE)XPANCEO, a deep tech firm headquartered in Dubai, needed English proofreading for complex content and Arabic localization for investor and internal comms. Outset PR deployed subject-matter experts, localized decks and press releases, and adapted narratives for cultural fit. The result: stronger media presence globally, clearer positioning in MENA, and more accessible storytelling for investors and journalists alike. Verdict: Outset PR earns the top spot for combining performance analytics with cultural and linguistic fluency, making it one of the few agencies equally strong in Europe and MENA. 2. FINPR — Dubai’s Visibility Engine Based in Dubai, FINPR is one of the most recognizable names in crypto PR in the region. Known for its guaranteed placements across 300+ outlets, it appeals to startups and exchanges seeking rapid visibility. Strengths: Affordable packages, speed of execution, access to crypto influencers. Limitations: Less boutique than Outset; stronger on scale than on nuance. Best for: Teams launching tokens, presales, or NFT projects who need fast, wide exposure in MENA and beyond. 3. PRLab — Narrative Builders With Regional Reach Amsterdam-based PRLab has grown its MENA footprint, bringing a storytelling-first approach to the region. They specialize in helping projects find and articulate their narrative, avoiding hype while making complex blockchain stories resonate. Strengths: Strong for DeFi and Layer 1 projects that need investor clarity. Able to balance global positioning with localized MENA execution. Best for: Companies aiming for long-term branding and consistency across regions. 4. GuerrillaBuzz — Bold Tactics, SEO Muscle GuerrillaBuzz , operating out of Israel but active in MENA, is known for unconventional campaigns paired with crypto SEO authority. Their approach often blends attention-grabbing stunts with long-term search visibility strategies. Strengths: Ability to help projects dominate organic search terms in English and Arabic. Good at differentiating brands in crowded markets. Best for: Teams wanting creative buzz plus sustainable online discoverability. 5. Luna PR — Dubai’s High-Profile Player Luna PR , headquartered in Dubai, leans into its ecosystem connections. They are a familiar presence at conferences and events across the UAE and often work with high-profile partners. Strengths: Prestige campaigns, strong regional visibility, event-driven amplification. Best for: Established projects or ambitious startups seeking recognition within Dubai’s Web3 ecosystem. Final Take In MENA, crypto PR is a smart combination of volume and precision. The top agencies here combine compliance awareness, bilingual storytelling, and global-local balance. Outset PR takes the lead for blending measurable analytics with localization, as shown in its XPANCEO case. FINPR remains a go-to for startups needing wide coverage at speed. PRLab excels at shaping investor-ready narratives across borders. GuerrillaBuzz offers creative edge with SEO staying power. Luna PR provides prestige and access to Dubai’s influential Web3 ecosystem. For crypto founders, the choice depends on whether you prioritize ROI, reach, storytelling, creativity, or prestige. In MENA, PR is the bridge to trust and traction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. Why is PR important for crypto projects in MENA?The MENA region, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has become a global hub for Web3 innovation. PR is vital here because it helps projects build credibility with regulators, investors, and communities. Unlike hype-driven campaigns, MENA PR must emphasize compliance, localization, and long-term trust. 2. What makes crypto PR in MENA different from Europe or the US? The UAE offers clear frameworks (VARA, ADGM), while other MENA countries vary. The language also matters: Arabic is essential for mass adoption; English dominates the business press. Campaigns must bridge global crypto outlets with regional media and Arabic-speaking influencers. 3. Why is Outset PR ranked #1 in 2025?Outset PR stands out for data-driven strategies, editorial rigor, and proven localization in MENA. Its work with XPANCEO in Dubai shows its ability to deliver verifiable results and cultural alignment. 4. Which PR agency is best for startups with limited budgets in MENA? FINPR offers guaranteed placements and cost-efficient packages, making it ideal for smaller projects. Outset PR also works well for startups that want measurable ROI from day one. 5. Do I need Arabic content for crypto PR in MENA?Yes. While English is widely used in Dubai’s business environment, Arabic localization builds trust and reach with retail audiences, regulators, and regional investors. High-performing campaigns balance Arabic + English messaging. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Following a volatile summer and renewed institutional interest, the token finds itself at a pivotal point. Investors are weighing the possibility of a powerful breakout against the risk of a sharp pullback. Into this atmosphere of uncertainty steps well-known analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, whose latest comments on X have sharpened the debate over XRP’s immediate future. Current Market Landscape As of report time, XRP trades at $2.82, reflecting a period of tight consolidation after recent price swings. High trading volumes indicate active buying and selling. Key technical levels are clear: support lies between $2.70 and $2.80, while resistance sits around $3.10 to $3.20. Holding above support keeps the bullish case intact, but a break below it could open the door to deeper losses. A decisive move through the $3.20 ceiling , backed by strong volume, would signal a new upward leg. #XRP : What's Next? : Are we going to pump down to $3.20 or a crash up to $2.20? I’d love to hear your thoughts! Share your thoughts and current sentiment in the comments below. What do you think the future holds for XRP? Let’s discuss! pic.twitter.com/QhVUWO6LkD — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 26, 2025 EGRAG CRYPTO’s Crucial Question EGRAG CRYPTO has distilled the market’s tension into a striking challenge: will XRP “pump down to $3.20 or crash up to $2.20?” The playful phrasing underscores how finely balanced the market is. A slight shift in sentiment or liquidity can cause significant price swings. His question reflects what many traders are asking—whether the current consolidation is a pause before a rally or a setup for a correction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Possible Scenarios For a bullish breakout, XRP must push above the $3.10–$3.20 resistance zone and hold it as support, ideally on rising trading volume. Catalysts could include stronger inflows into altcoins, sustained Bitcoin strength, or increased demand on the XRP Ledger. A move toward $2.20, on the other hand, would likely follow a broad crypto market sell-off, a failure to defend the $2.70 floor, or sudden liquidity withdrawals by major market makers. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index and key moving averages remain neutral, leaving room for either scenario to unfold. Outlook for Holders For investors, risk management is essential. Setting clear stop-loss levels near key supports and scaling into positions only after a confirmed breakout above $3.20 can help limit downside while capturing potential upside. Many analysts view the resolved legal issues as a long-term bullish factor, but near-term moves will depend on market-wide sentiment and liquidity. XRP now stands at a critical juncture. Whether it breaks higher or slips lower, the next decisive move will answer the question EGRAG CRYPTO has put to every holder. Until then, the token remains balanced between opportunity and retreat, keeping traders alert and the wider crypto market watching closely.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $12.67, with a possible maximum trading value of $13.51 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $20.26 and $21.95, with an average price of $21.11. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

Cryptocurrency lost 4.08% of its value. XRP may find support around the $2.57 mark. On September 26, 2025, XRP price analysis reveals a bearish trend as the price continues to trend lower. The coin’s price is currently trading at $2.70 after a heavy depreciation. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 4.08% of its worth in the last 24 hours. This creates an unfavorable environment for long-position traders, as the altcoin is shedding value once again after a bearish tide for a second consecutive day. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirms a downward trend in the market. The XRP/USD price has depreciated to $2.70 in the last 24 hours.

Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. The Bollinger bands are expanding, as the indicator’s arms are far apart, leading to high volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $3.18. Conversely, its lower limit, indicating a crushed support, has moved to $2.74. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 36.17 in the past 24 hours. The descending curve on the RSI graph reflects a rising selling momentum. If the bearish momentum continues to intensify, further downside is possible. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of the XRP coin shows a highly bearish trend in the market, as price levels are falling rapidly. The XRP/USD value recently decreased to $2.70 in the past few hours, moving near the lower limit of the volatility indicator and suggesting intense selling pressure. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart.

Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $2.97, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $2.70, indicating the support. The RSI indicator is trending near the border of the oversold region. Its value has decreased to 31.31 in the last four hours. This decrease is represented by a downward RSI curve.

Ripple price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events, as the price movement is in a downward direction. The coin’s value has decreased to a low of $2.70 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 4.08 percent of its value. Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts also project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum took hold, bringing the price to $2.70 during the day. The RSI decreased to 36.17 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.22 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $21.95 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported on Canary Capital’s updated S-1 for XRP spot ETF with SEC. The ETF will hold XRP directly and trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange if it gets approval. This move is also perceived as a major milestone for XRP, making it to the mainstream in US markets. XRP price prediction September 2025 According to XRP price prediction, in September 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.39. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.40, considering the current XRP sentiment. Period Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) September 2025 $2.40 $2.92 $3.39 XRP price prediction 2025 The XRP price prediction for 2025 suggests that the price could reach a maximum of $5.07 by the end of the year, considering its technological utility and enhancement of cross-border payments. We expect an average trading price of $4.22 and a floor price of $1.60.

The maximum forecasted Ripple price for 2030 is set at $19.14. XRP price prediction 2031 The XRP price prediction for 2031 is a minimum price of $20.26 and an average price of $21.11. The maximum forecast price for 2025 is $21.95, as crypto analysts expect investors to continue buying XRP as crypto assets. XRP price prediction 2025 – 2031.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In September, XRP is trending near the $2.8 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-26 12:10:00

Powell’s tone read “not in a sprint to ease,” and the dot plot implies room for more cuts this year, but not a flood. Long-end yields popped after the decision, a classic “hawkish cut” tell. Watch the 10-year as your macro risk gauge. U.S. equities ripped to fresh records; crypto bounced, then stalled. This is not the decoupling we wanted — yet. For crypto, momentum is mixed: majors failed to push through key mid-range levels; breadth in alts is trying (compression + bullish EMA crosses) but needs follow-through. Markets on Edge: Fed Rate Cut and the Crypto Reaction https://t.co/1IWKYIFHqP — Kraken (@krakenfx) September 19, 2025 The 10-year Treasury macro tell (and why it matters) The decision: –25 bps to a 4.00%–4.25% target range. Futures had it largely priced; the upside surprise (50 bps or ultra-dovish guidance) didn’t arrive. Powell emphasized caution and data-dependence. Markets now lean toward two additional 25 bps cuts in 2025, but participants are split — classic recipe for chop. The tell: 10-year Treasury up, curve steepening. The 10-year yield rising likely signals that the market still has concerns about longer term inflation, which could be a headwind for risk assets. Keep that 10-year quote on your layout. Meanwhile, stocks at highs (S&P 500, Nasdaq; small caps ripping) underscore that liquidity hopes remain alive — even if bonds are pushing back. What we’re seeing on the crypto charts Bitcoin (trend-following lens) Mid-range rejection: The level we flagged on prior streams rejected cleanly; no sustained momentum post-FOMC. Next spot to watch: Confluence of the 4h EMAs + prior swing-low cluster. First “reaction zone” for a constructive retest. Failure there opens a deeper sweep into range-low territory. Ethereum (momentum check) ETH attempted a push around the FOMC window, but failed to push above the weekly open. Market structure isn’t broken, just indecisive. We want either a swift reclaim above the cluster or a tagged retest lower with buyers stepping in. Market breadth: TOTAL3 & “Others” TOTAL3 (crypto market cap ex-BTC & ETH) is boxed between prior ATH bands. Above = risk-on for alts; below = risk-off. While you can’t trade it directly, it’s a vibe check: it confirms whether alt strength is there or not. “ Others ” shows a similar picture: breakouts met the first big supply shelf and faded. Not a breakdown (yet) but it’s a battlefield. Translation: The risk-reward favors patience until we get confirmation (break and hold) or a deeper retest (flush into demand). Setups we walked through We focus on structure + EMAs with simple, falsifiable plans. No leverage needed for these ideas; spot lets you survive volatility. DOGE (strength → hesitation): Strong trend signal from bullish EMA crosses, but price is fighting to hold above prior swing-highs. Either flip/hold that shelf for continuation, or wait for the cleaner dip into the next demand box. “I just got here” pattern (newer listings): Weeks of slow bleed → base → reclaim EMAs/Fibs → ride to logical targets. We showcased it using PUMP historically, then mapped EIGEN as today’s analogue: prolonged bleed, basing, EMAs turning up, constructive reclaim. For risk: keep stops below the impulse that kicked off the reclaim, and don’t force leverage. Compression breakouts (alt bucket): A handful of alts show volatility contraction near monthly opens with fresh bullish EMA crosses. First steps are in; sustainability is the question. If the weekend resolves higher, breakout-continuation trades activate; if not, retest-buys lower down often offer better asymmetry. let's discuss the dipperino; – levels $BTC $ETH $SOL – now what? – our fresh entries (this AM) $ENA $EIGEN pic.twitter.com/QrPrE2qYQk — Dentoshi (@Dentoshi) September 22, 2025 Playbook for the next 1-2 weeks Respect the 10-year. Rising long yields post-cut = “hawkish cut” conditions. If the 10-year cools, risk appetite improves; if it climbs, be selective. Majors first. BTC reclaiming the mid-range with momentum is your green light for broader beta. If BTC drifts into the EMA/demand cluster and reacts well, alts get room to run. Breadth confirmation. Want TOTAL3/“Others” to break and hold above supply bands. Otherwise, avoid chasing and look for fade → retest → reclaim structures. Two entry archetypes only: Breakout-strength: Fresh highs and higher-low support on low timeframes – but only if the market looks good as a whole. Retest-logic: Flush into pre-mapped demand with EMAs rising underneath (your “plunge protection”). Risk management: Position size so that your invalidation (below impulse or key EMA structure) equals a known % of portfolio risk. No hero leverage in a macro-heavy week. Why this felt like a “hawkish cut” Expected size (25 bps) → no upside surprise. Powell’s tone: “not in a rush to ease” → markets re-priced path-of-cuts lower. Dot plot: bias to cut again this year, but the committee is split. Bonds: long rates up; steepening curve. These are classic “hawkish cut” breadcrumbs — and they map cleanly to the crypto hesitation we saw. If you haven’t been following our Friday Trading Spaces livestream (via @krakenfx ) then you’re missing the alpha.

The recent market move has traders on edge, watching closely as the coin hovers near crucial thresholds. Can strong market support prevent a significant decline, or will XRP plunge further? This analysis explores which cryptocurrencies might be poised for growth amid the turmoil. XRP Eyes Recovery with Potential for Growth After Recent Dip Source: tradingview XRP's price currently sits just under $3, following a drop from a higher range. It's hovering between $2.91 and $3.09 but showing signs of potential recovery. The coin recently dipped by over 10% in the last week. The nearest resistance lies at $3.21, and breaking through it could signal further growth. If XRP manages a climb, it could aim for the second resistance at $3.39, representing nearly a 15% increase from its lower range. Looking back six months, XRP has appreciated by over a quarter, indicating resilience. While short-term indicators suggest some caution, the coin has room for upward movement towards its recent highs. Conclusion XRP faces a potential drop to $2 if it fails to maintain support levels. The sharp fall could challenge bulls to defend these key positions. The market's response will determine XRP's ability to rebound or face continued pressure. Keeping an eye on trading activity and market sentiment will be crucial in the coming days. The coin's ability to hold above crucial support levels will be pivotal in assessing its short-term direction. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This decline followed a recent 120% rally that lifted IP token from $5.58 in mid-August, coinciding with co-founder Jason Zhao’s departure , before reaching its peak of $14.99 four days ago. Many attributed the brief rally to the project’s announcement of the Origin Summit, held on September 23, in Seoul during Korea Blockchain Week. HYBE produced BTS. The Black Label produced BLACKPINK.

Major crypto and investment firms, including Grayscale, Polygon, and Animoca Brands, also participated to discuss IP tokenization through Story’s infrastructure.

Instead of relying on traditional copyright frameworks, the platform empowers creators to register, monitor, and monetize their works through a decentralized network. This includes books, films, music, and AI-generated content. The protocol has raised approximately $134.3 million in equity financing across multiple rounds. These include a May 2023 seed round generating $29.3 million, a September 2023 Series A yielding $25 million, and an August 2024 Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z crypto division, contributing $80 million. Despite these investments, the limited value captured by the project has damaged its reputation, with many now viewing it as another unsustainable crypto venture. Technical Analysis: EMA Breakdown Shows Story Protocol’s Path Back to $5 Support Technically, the Story Protocol chart reveals a dramatic parabolic rally from around $6 in early August to nearly $15 in mid-September, representing roughly a 150% gain. The price has since dropped approximately 55% to the current level of $7.237, confirming massive selling after reaching all-time highs. The technical setup presents several warning signs for bulls. The token broke below the ascending trendline that supported the entire August-September rally, confirming the uptrend violation. Source: TradingView Price is currently testing the $7 support level, which matches a previous resistance area from late August. Volume patterns show heavy selling pressure during the recent decline, with red volume bars dominating recent sessions. The token approaches the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire rally, which typically serves as critical support. If this level fails to hold, the next targets align with projected levels at $6.067, $4.751, and ultimately $3.463, representing a complete retracement to pre-rally levels.

Analyst Says ETH Could Fall to These Levels Before Rising!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/alarm-bells-ringing-for-ethereum-analyst-says-eth-could-fall-to-these-levels-before-rising/,"This week has been a bad one for Bitcoin and altcoins. The market, which started the new week with a major decline, experienced a major decline yesterday. BTC fell to $108,000, while Ethereum (ETH) fell to a two-month low of $3,900. While investors expect these declines to be the final ones before the October bullish month known as Uptober, veteran crypto analyst Ted Pillows warned that ETH could fall even further. Sharing his ETH analysis from his account X, the analyst argued that the decline in Ethereum could continue and that it could possibly drop to $3,500 before starting to recover. The analyst, who stated that Ethereum's current movements mirror Bitcoin's 2020 cycle, which saw it drop 25-30% after rising above $20,000, claimed that ETH could also fall another 10-15%. At this point, the analyst said that $3,800 is currently critical in determining Ethereum’s short-term direction. Stating that $3,800 is an important support level, the analyst stated that if the $3,800 level holds, a new rally may begin in Ethereum. On the other hand, if this level is not held, the ETH price may decline towards the $3,500 region. “ETH has lost another key support level. The next support level is around the $3,800 level, which is likely to be retested. If Ethereum holds this level, a rally is possible. Otherwise, ETH will drop to around $3,500 before bottoming.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Alarm Bells Ringing for Ethereum!

While the near-term outlook remains under pressure, the bigger story is unfolding in corporate investment. Google has agreed to backstop $1.4 billion of lease obligations for Fluidstack in exchange for a 5.4% stake in Cipher Mining, a Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin miner. The agreement is part of a $3 billion, 10-year deal under which Cipher will provide 168 megawatts of high-performance computing (HPC) power at its Barber Lake facility in Texas. With room for expansion to 500 MW, the site positions Cipher as a key player in the crossover between Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence. Cipher Mining Signs 168 MW, 10-Year AI Hosting Agreement with Fluidstack In this transaction, Cipher will deliver 168 MW of Critical IT Load to Fluidstack at its Barber Lake site, securing ~$3B in contracted revenue over the initial 10-year term. The agreement also includes two… — Cipher Mining (@CipherInc) September 25, 2025 This marks Google’s second mining-linked investment in just two months, following its 14% stake in TeraWulf in August. Analysts say the move signals Wall Street’s growing appetite for companies that integrate crypto mining with AI-driven infrastructure. Key Deal Highlights: $3B in contract value over 10 years, with potential to rise to $7B. Google to acquire ~24 million Cipher shares (5.4% stake). Barber Lake site: 168 MW initial capacity, expandable to 500 MW. Cipher’s pipeline includes ~2.4 GW of HPC projects. Crypto Miners Shift Into AI Infrastructure Cipher CEO Tyler Page described the deal as “transformative,” highlighting demand for compute power from AI-focused companies. Fluidstack President César Maklary echoed this, saying the partnership ensures the infrastructure needed for frontier AI firms. The deal reflects a broader industry pivot. CleanSpark recently secured $100M to expand its AI infrastructure, while Hive Digital announced a $100M HPC expansion after reporting record quarterly revenue. Data from The Miner Mag shows Bitcoin mining stocks have outperformed Bitcoin itself in recent weeks, largely thanks to investor enthusiasm for AI pivots. Industry analysts argue that miners diversifying into HPC and AI are being rewarded with stronger valuations, as the shift offers more stable revenues compared to volatile Bitcoin mining alone. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook While corporate capital flows are reshaping the industry, Bitcoin’s price action remains under short-term pressure. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin trades below both the 50- and 100-SMA near $113,700, signaling continued bearish control. A descending triangle has formed, with lower highs pressing toward support at $107,300. Candlestick formations reinforce the bearish tone: a shooting star at $116,000 was followed by a “three black crows” sequence. The RSI sits at 31, close to oversold, but without bullish divergence, suggesting momentum still favors sellers. Key support levels: $107,300, $105,200, and $102,800. Resistance levels: $111,100 and $113,700. Trade setup: A short position near $109,500–$110,000 with a stop above $112,500 targets $107,300 initially. For new traders, think of Bitcoin’s chart like a room: resistance near $113K acts as the “ceiling,” while $107K serves as the “floor.” If the floor gives way, lower levels quickly come into focus. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines BTC Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the BTC ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

Assets once dismissed as relics of hype can suddenly command the spotlight, leaving skeptics scrambling to keep up. XRP, long regarded as a token weighed down by legal battles and industry skepticism, is now delivering one of those rare narrative reversals. Recent price action and a resurgence of institutional attention have placed it firmly back on the radar of serious market participants. WallStreetBets Signals a Sentiment Shift The unexpected endorsement came from Jaime Rogozinski, founder of the iconic WallStreetBets community, who remarked on X that XRP’s breakout reflects a moment worth watching. His post captured a broader sentiment shift as retail traders and professional investors reassessed the token. XRP, the token everyone loved to hate, is suddenly outperforming thanks to… *checks notes*… actual network upgrades and regulatory tailwinds. What a time to be alive. — wallstreetbets (@wallstreetbets) September 23, 2025 What was once an easy target for critics is now gaining credibility as fundamentals, rather than drama, drive market interest. Regulatory Tailwinds Powering Momentum Central to this transformation is the conclusion of Ripple’s protracted legal standoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With both sides withdrawing appeals and the appellate court approving those withdrawals, a cloud that hung over XRP for years has lifted. The result is newfound regulatory clarity, enabling banks, fintech firms, and hedge funds to engage with the token without fear of sudden enforcement actions. That shift alone has reopened doors to institutional adoption that were sealed by legal uncertainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Network Upgrades Strengthen Fundamentals At the same time, the XRP Ledger itself is evolving. The launch of the XRPL EVM sidechain has brought Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to the ecosystem, unlocking decentralized finance opportunities and expanding use cases for developers. Other recent upgrades—such as enhancements for batch transactions and compliance-friendly decentralized exchange features—have further positioned the network to meet institutional standards and handle large-scale, real-world financial operations. Market Reaction and Outlook Traders have noticed. Liquidity and trading volumes have climbed, and XRP has outperformed many of its peers in recent sessions. While cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, the current rally is underpinned by tangible progress rather than speculative frenzy. Analysts are focusing on indicators like institutional investment, XRPL app growth, and developer participation to evaluate the trend’s long-term potential. In a space where sentiment can swing overnight, XRP’s resurgence stands out for being anchored in structural change. For Rogozinski, the token’s performance is more than a passing headline—it’s a signal that fundamentals are finally being rewarded. Indeed, for XRP holders and market watchers alike, it truly is a time to be alive. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the DOJ , Raymond Christian Garcia, 23, and Isiah Angelo Garcia, 24, used an AR-15 and a shotgun to terrorize victims in their Grant, Minnesota, home on September 19. A Well-Executed Crypto Heist The violent heist began at 7:45 am when the brothers ambushed the primary victim while taking garbage to the street. They zip-tied the man’s hands, forced him inside, and awakened his wife and adult son at gunpoint before binding them as well. Isiah Garcia forced the father to log into crypto accounts while Raymond held the family hostage for the entire nine-hour ordeal. The brothers frequently called an unknown third party who provided information about the victim’s crypto holdings and transfer procedures. When the accomplice revealed additional funds stored at a family cabin three hours away, Isiah drove the victim there while Raymond continued guarding the wife and son. The victim was forced to transfer all remaining crypto before returning home. Brothers Charged in $8 Million Armed Crypto-Kidnapping Heist https://t.co/1W4sSkMT2Y @FBIMinneapolis @WashingtonCoSO — U.S. Attorney MN (@DMNnews) September 25, 2025 Nine-Hour Terror Campaign Nets Record Crypto Theft The Garcia brothers executed their plan with military-style precision, using zip ties and assault weapons to maintain control over their victims throughout the extended ordeal. Raymond Garcia remained armed with the AR-15 rifle during the entire nine hours, only briefly leaving to hide the weapon before police arrival. Washington County Sheriff’s deputies responded after the son called 911 during a brief moment when Raymond left the house. Officers found the wife and son still zip-tied inside while spotting Raymond fleeing through the back door toward nearby tree lines. Authorities discovered a suitcase containing the disassembled AR-15, ammunition, clothing, and beverages hidden in the woods behind the home. A Wendy’s receipt in the suitcase helped investigators trace Isiah’s rental of a white Chevrolet three days before the kidnapping near Houston. Video surveillance captured Raymond renting a Motel 6 room in Roseville, Minnesota, shortly before the attack. The white Malibu returned to the motel after law enforcement responded, then appeared on Oklahoma cameras the next day before reaching the brothers’ home in Waller, Texas. The elaborate crime forced Mahtomedi Public Schools to cancel their homecoming football game due to ongoing law enforcement activity near campus. Multiple police units had unknowingly passed Isiah and the victim returning from the cabin, with the pair pulling over to allow emergency vehicles to pass. Global Crypto Violence Epidemic Reaches Record Levels The Texas case joins an alarming surge in crypto-related kidnappings worldwide, with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reporting 35 wrench attacks globally in July 2025 , surpassing nearly all previous years. The spike correlates directly with Bitcoin’s rise to over $122,000 in early July. Source: Jameson Lopp GitHub France leads the global crisis with ten crypto kidnappings since January, including the brutal attack on Ledger co-founder David Balland , whose finger was severed by ransom-seeking attackers. Criminal networks are increasingly using sophisticated tactics, disguising themselves as delivery workers by using stolen, branded vans. Recent international incidents include Belgian authorities sentencing three men to 12 years for kidnapping crypto investor Stephane Winkel’s wife, while Australian billionaire Tim Heath narrowly escaped kidnapping in Estonia . US cases span from Florida teenagers forcing a Las Vegas event host to transfer $4 million in the Arizona desert to NYPD officers facing charges in a 17-day Manhattan torture case. India also recently sentenced 14 men to life imprisonment for kidnapping businessman Shailesh Bhatt and forcing him to sell 34 Bitcoins worth $150,000 in 2018. An Indian anti-corruption court has sentenced 14 men to life in prison for the 2018 kidnapping and extortion of a businessman. #India #Crypto https://t.co/6IkTlMFlL4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 31, 2025 The convictions included 11 serving and former police officers, as well as one former legislator. Due to this massive surge in crypto violence, Security firm Infinite Risks International reports a rise in demand for 24/7 protection services from crypto executives, specifically citing fears of kidnapping. The visible nature of on-chain wealth combined with poor custody practices creates what experts describe as “prime hunting grounds for criminals.” Looking forward, the Garcia brothers confessed after their September 22 arrest in Texas, with both facing federal kidnapping charges carrying severe penalties yet to be determined.

The data, released Friday by the Commerce Department, makes it clear the Fed is still heading toward another interest rate cut, likely within the next few months. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index went up 0.3% last month, pushing the overall yearly inflation rate to 2.7%. That’s a small bump from July’s 2.6%, while the core rate, which drops food and energy, barely moved, rising 0.2% monthly and holding at 2.9% for the year. Every number lined up exactly with what Wall Street was expecting, based on the Dow Jones forecast. Fed sticks to rate-cut path despite stubborn inflation Even with inflation still above the Fed’s 2% goal, officials aren’t switching gears. Last week, policymakers signaled they’re expecting two more quarter-point rate cuts by the end of the year. The first one already happened. The Federal Open Market Committee approved it just last week, dropping the federal funds rate to a new target range of 4% to 4.25%. Markets are already pricing in another move for October, but a December cut is still up in the air. As inflation refuses to cool off fully, spending and income data are also showing signs of strength. Personal income jumped 0.4% in August, while consumer spending rose even faster at 0.6%. Both of those beat estimates by 0.1 percentage point, showing that Americans are still throwing cash around—even with higher prices. The data also puts a spotlight back on Donald Trump’s tariffs . Despite earlier fears, they haven’t done much to push up prices. A lot of firms loaded up on goods before the tariffs kicked in, while others just ate the cost. It worked. Consumer prices haven’t spiked the way people thought they would. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials aren’t stressing over the tariffs much. “They’re likely just a one-time bump in prices,” Powell said. But some people at the Fed still aren’t buying that. A few are worried there’s not much space left to keep cutting rates without real risk. Still, the consumer seems fine. Even with tariffs in place, people are spending like normal. Rising incomes are helping. That’s likely giving the Fed some cover to stay on its current course. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

It all started at the end of the previous business week after BTC had jumped to $118,000 on Thursday morning following the Fed’s expected rate cut. However, the asset’s rally ran its course prematurely, and it started to lose value gradually, dropping to $116,000 by Friday. The weekend went as anticipated, little to no action, but then came the familiar Monday drop. Bitcoin went from just over $115,500 to $112,000, wiping out billions of dollars worth of leveraged positions. The bulls tried to halt the freefall, but their best effort took BTC to $114,000 briefly on Tuesday. The bears quickly reemerged and initiated another couple of consecutive leg downs. The culmination took place earlier on Friday when BTC plunged to $108,600. This became its lowest price tag since the start of the month. Perhaps the most evident reason behind this collapse is the latest comments coming from US Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The head of the central bank sent some mixed signals regarding the inflation levels, which were interpreted as a warning sign for riskier assets like crypto. Although BTC has recovered some ground since its local low, it’s still beneath $110,000 as of press time. Its 6.2% weekly decline, though, seems negligible compared to massive double-digit price drops from the likes of ETH, DOGE, SOL, ADA, LINK, AVAX, and especially HYPE, which is down by over 25% following the rise of a new competitor. But more on that later. These price collapses are best highlighted by the total market cap’s plunge, which went from over $4.150 trillion at this time last Friday to under $3.850 trillion as of now.

In the past month, more than 2.8M ETH shifted to accumulation wallets, while exchanges further depleted their reserves. In September, more ETH kept flowing into accumulation addresses, with up to 2.8M added to the balance since late August. The balance on accumulation addresses kept going vertical, reaching close to 28.6M ETH. The past week saw significant additions to the balance of those addresses, with 400K ETH moved in a single day. Accumulation did not stop despite the ETH liquidation cascade, which caused the biggest deleveraging events since the spring of 2021. The day was also marked by another BitMine treasury purchase, adding more than 209K ETH to the reserves. Accumulation addresses may include ETH institutions or funds In the past week, large-scale inflows to accumulation addresses included a day when whales bought up 1.2M ETH. The scale of buying suggests some of the accumulation addresses may belong to institutions, funds, or other strategic accumulators, making a long-term bet on Ethereum. Accumulation addresses also feel limited pressure to sell, as their realized price so far is below the current market price. The accumulation wallets are also known as no-sell addresses, with most dedicated to long-term holding. The reserves of Coinbase Advanced were depleted in the past three months, as institutions and funds accumulated ETH. | Source: Cryptoquant Ethereum exchange reserves are still trending downward, at around 16.5M ETH. Spot exchanges only have 7.24M ETH in their known wallets. Coinbase Advanced is down to 3.2M ETH, after multiple outflows in the past month. The outflows from Coinbase Advanced moved into self-custodied wallets, cold storage, or self-controlled staking. However, the low reserves on exchanges still allow for sudden inflows and selling pressure from whales or market-makers at the last moment. Currently, despite the accumulation and low reserves, ETH is still not feeling a strong supply crunch. ETH reserves are accumulated for eventual DeFi purposes, including the creation of new stablecoins. The Ethereum ecosystem remains the leader of DeFi activity, still requiring ETH for collaterals, staking, liquid staking, and other use cases. ETH dips to $3,900 with ongoing liquidations The recent movements on the derivative markets offset the accumulation of ETH. The token dipped to the $3,900 range after another day of liquidations. ETH saw over $272M in long liquidations for the past 24 hours, though some short positions were also liquidated. Open interest fell to $24.2B, retaining the dominance of long positions. The recent volatility happened on the day of the monthly options expiry on Deribit, with a total of $22B in crypto options. During the latest downturn, both crowd money and smart money were cautiously bearish . The recent significant deleveraging may take weeks or months to rebuild positions, though a short squeeze is possible to just above $4,000 with newly accumulated liquidity.

From slow settlements to fragmented user experiences, these problems limit growth and adoption across the industry. Developers struggle to manage complex infrastructure, while users face confusing processes that discourage long-term participation. Mono Protocol steps into this space with a focus on solving these common issues. Backed by $2 million in funding and supported by more than 5,000 whitelist users, it is preparing for its Beta launch. The project introduces tools that aim to simplify transactions, improve security, and create better incentives for both users and builders. Instant settlement through execution bonds To ensure transactions are completed without delays, Mono Protocol uses execution bonds. Solvers and routers lock MONO tokens as performance bonds, guaranteeing instant execution under the Resource Locks model. This approach strengthens trust in the system by reducing settlement risks and ensuring users can rely on dependable outcomes. Securing execution at the protocol level helps avoid unnecessary waiting times or failed transactions. The growing whitelist, now at over 5,000 participants, shows that many users and developers are already paying attention. With the Beta Product Launch coming soon, execution bonds could become a core feature that improves how settlements are handled across chains. Turning transactions into revenue opportunities Mono Protocol introduces a model where every transaction can generate value. Developers can set configurable transaction fees, creating revenue streams that help sustain their applications. At the same time, users benefit from MEV protection, consistent execution, and efficient routing. This balance between revenue and user fairness is key. It ensures that while builders gain incentives to maintain their projects, users interact within a system that puts dependability first. Transactions are not only faster and safer but also structured to provide benefits on both sides. By aligning user needs with developer rewards, Mono Protocol helps create an ecosystem that is both functional and sustainable. The emphasis on fair monetisation sets it apart as it prepares for its Beta release. Building apps without the extra complexity Cross-chain development usually requires heavy infrastructure and custom solutions, which slow down progress. Mono Protocol simplifies this by removing the need to build separate logic for each chain. Developers can instead focus on creating apps that work consistently across environments. This means projects can launch faster and at lower costs. More importantly, users experience apps that feel smooth and familiar, without needing to manage multiple steps or balances. By stripping away technical barriers, Mono Protocol allows both developers and users to engage more easily. Apps become easier to adopt, and user retention improves when experiences feel effortless and reliable. Effortless blockchain interactions with cost-saving efficiency Mono Protocol redefines how users engage with multiple blockchains, offering transactions up to 40% quicker than standard routes while guaranteeing execution without reverts. By removing frontrunning and MEV losses, it significantly lowers costs. $MONO powers this ecosystem, allowing seamless swapping, staking, and trading across chains with a single gas payment. For mobile app developers, it provides the tools to build user-friendly interfaces where earning, staking, or trading happens in one click, free from chain or token management. A simpler future for Web3 interaction The rise of Mono Protocol shows how addressing common Web3 and DeFi challenges can make the ecosystem more usable. With $2 million raised and over 5,000 users on its whitelist, the project is entering its Beta phase with momentum. Execution bonds, monetizable transactions, and simplified app building are all designed to make blockchain interactions smoother. Each feature focuses on creating trust, reducing complexity, and encouraging sustainable growth. As the Beta launch approaches, Mono Protocol highlights how thoughtful solutions can improve both user and developer experiences. It is an example of how addressing friction points can move the industry forward.

According to Musk, Grok Vision can understand pretty much anything the camera points at. According to the announcement made on X, Grok Vision is smart and fast. The post reads, “Grok analyzes what you see, explains it, translates text, and even finds products and answers all your questions Just point your phone and ask…It’s incredibly good.” Grok-1.5 Vision (Grok-1.5V), unveiled by xAI this year, was able to “process a wide variety of visual information, including documents, diagrams, graphs, screenshots, and photographs.” Grok’s voice mode comes with camera access, letting users point their phone at something and ask, “What am I looking at?” Grok Vision can understand pretty much anything you point the camera at https://t.co/9IIpuhc32Z — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 26, 2025 The Vision feature on iOS allows the chatbot to analyze real-world objects, text, and environments through your device’s camera in real time. Users can scan anything—products, signs, documents—and Grok will break it down with context and info on the spot. Grok Vision comes amid new flaw discoveries This development comes after the launch of Grok 4 Fast, its “latest advancement in cost-efficient reasoning models.” According to the release seen by Cryptopolitan, the model features a two-million token context window and introduces a unified architecture that integrates reasoning and non-reasoning modes. xAI reported that Grok 4 Fast was trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning to autonomously decide when to use external resources such as code execution or web browsing. The tech company said it could quickly go through links, look at videos on X, and put together pieces of information in real time. In addition, last month, xAI officially rolled out Grok Imagine, xAI’s image and video generator, to all SuperGrok and Premium+ X subscribers on its iOS app. The generator allows users to make NSFW content. Grok Imagine was touted as capable of turning text or image prompts into 15-second videos featuring native audio. However, it has not been a smooth ride. According to a Forbes investigation published in August, more than 370,000 private conversations with Grok were indexed by search engines, including Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, without users’ knowledge. The exposure stemmed from a flaw in Grok’s “share” feature, which generated unique URLs when users shared conversations. These URLs were automatically made available to search engines, effectively publishing private chats to the web. Elon Musk is set to turn his focus on xAI Tesla shareholders will vote in November on a proposal to invest in xAI, a move Musk says could shape the automaker’s future. However, the board is also weighing a trillion-dollar compensation package to keep him focused on Tesla. Elon Musk’s xAI filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against OpenAI. The lawsuit claimed OpenAI tended to hire away its employees to gain access to trade secrets related to its AI chatbot Grok. xAI’s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, now has 64 million monthly users. The company, valued at $120 billion, has seen leadership turnover but continues to expand hiring and infrastructure. According to reports, Meta AI and Grok are also chasing the top AI app, ChatGPT. Grok ranked fourth on the web and No. 23 on mobile. This is quick growth, given that Grok went from having no stand-alone app at the end of 2024 to now. In July 2025, Grok also climbed nearly 40% when Grok 4 was released. However, it is trailing far behind ChatGPT, which reported 700 million weekly active users in August. Meanwhile, as reported by Cryptopolitan, the US General Services Administration (GSA) confirmed today that it signed an 18-month OneGov agreement with xAI, offering federal agencies access to Grok 4 and Grok 4 Fast for just $0.42 per agency.

CoinStats has integrated Glider Token Risk, a breakthrough scanning technology from elite cybersecurity firm Hexens . The tool gives traders instant visibility into 22+ smart contract risks before they buy. Now live across the CoinStats platform. The timing is critical. Over 74,000 scam tokens launched in 2024. These tokens drained nearly $10 billion from traders. And 94% of these malicious tokens contained exploit logic from day one. Revolutionary Approach to Token Security Glider Token Risk doesn't just skim the surface. It decomposes contract logic, breaking down every function, path, and dependency. This deep analysis reveals threats that others miss. Think of it as an X-ray for tokens, showing the bones of a contract before you trade. With this integration, CoinStats becomes more than a portfolio tracker. It's now an education tool, security guard, and BS detector all in one app. What Glider Token Risk Detects The scanner identifies 22 risk categories. The most common threats include: Blockable transfers (59% of analyzed tokens) External calls during transfers (29% of tokens) Balance manipulation (25% of tokens) Centralized minting (21% of tokens) Hidden fees (10% of tokens) Centralized burn capabilities (9% of tokens) Upgradeable contracts (9% of tokens) Blacklists/Whitelists (5% of tokens each) Pausable transfers (7% of tokens) Additional risks include cooldown mechanisms, transfer fees, and other exploit patterns. Basically, if it smells like a rug, it gets flagged. Each risk comes with clear explanations, giving traders actionable insights without needing technical expertise. Building Safer Trading Habits This integration addresses a critical market gap. Education is the first line of defense. Glider Token Risk isn't about blind trust in risk scores. It's about clear and actionable insights into the tokens that traders interact with. Not every low-trust project is a scam, and not every scam looks suspicious. By exposing the risks coded into smart contracts, the tool helps traders make smarter, safer decisions. How to Access Glider Token Risk works across major EVM-compatible chains. At the moment, these include: Ethereum, BNB, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum One, Optimism, Avalanche C Chain, Blast, Linea, Mantle, Polygon zkEVM, Arbitrum Nova, Celo, Cronos, Gnosis, Moonbeam, Moonriver, Abstract, Ape, Berachain, Bit Torrent, Frax, Memecore, Sonic, Sophon, Swellchain, Taiko, Unichain, World, XAI, and XDC.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.7398 Market cap $732.77M Trading volume $193.05M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.7679 24-hour low $0.7219 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.96% 50-day SMA $0.8819 14-Day RSI 33.09 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 28 (Bearish) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.8059 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is under pressure after failing to hold above $0.80. The coin’s immediate support sits at $0.72. As it stands, bulls need to reclaim $0.812 to initiate a sustainable rebound. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily timeframe for September 26, WIF is trading at $0.736, showing a minor gain of +0.96% after several consecutive red candles. The Alligator lines are spread bearishly, all sitting above the current price, confirming sustained downward pressure. The MACD also remains deeply negative, with histogram bars still very much in the red. Volume has also cooled to 25.5M, reflecting reduced buyer and seller conviction. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The key support for WIF lies around $0.72, which has been tested recently. A daily close below this level risks extending the decline toward $0.68. On the upside, bulls need to reclaim $0.81–$0.85 to confirm a shift in trend, though that appears challenging in the near term. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF is consolidating around $0.736 after dipping to $0.719. The SMA-21 sits at $0.770, which aligns as immediate resistance, while stronger barriers are marked at $0.812 and $0.915. The MACD histogram has turned lighter red, indicating fading bearish momentum, but both MACD lines remain well below zero. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The price structure suggests short-term stabilization, with buyers defending $0.72, but momentum is too weak to expect a breakout yet. For now, the most likely scenario is sideways trading between $0.72 support and $0.77 resistance, unless volume increases sharply. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7919 SELL SMA 5 $0.8013 SELL SMA 10 $0.8752 SELL SMA 21 $0.8905 SELL SMA 50 $0.8819 SELL SMA 100 $0.9114 SELL SMA 200 $0.8059 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8480 SELL EMA 5 $0.8399 SELL EMA 10 $0.8375 SELL EMA 21 $0.8586 SELL EMA 50 $0.8963 SELL EMA 100 $0.9029 SELL EMA 200 $0.9998 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF looks oversold at the moment, though the current structure does not yet favour a rebound. Unless buyers defend the $0.72 price level with higher volume, WIF could break below $0.7. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

After a recent pullback, the cryptocurrency now hovers near $196, reflecting a 3.98% drop in the past 24 hours and a 20.09% decline over the week. Analysts emphasize that Solana’s near-term trend largely depends on overcoming resistance zones while maintaining strong support levels. Crucial Resistance at $218 Ali Martinez, a market analyst, highlights $218 as a major supply wall for Solana. The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart indicates nearly 29 million SOL were acquired around this level, representing 4.8% of total supply. This concentration creates a cluster of potential sellers seeking to break even, potentially triggering profit-taking if the price approaches $218. Below this zone, Solana enjoys strong support between $165 and $180, where large volumes were previously transacted. If bulls can break past $218, the path toward $238–$250 opens, offering lighter resistance. Conversely, repeated rejections may reinforce consolidation and pressure Solana downward. Source: X Bounce Potential Near $194 Another analyst, Tom Tucker, points out that Solana recently moved beyond its 0.618 Fibonacci retracement at $200. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits deep in oversold territory, suggesting a possible bounce if $194 holds. This combination of technical support and oversold momentum makes the current price zone a watch area for traders anticipating a short-term recovery. Consequently, a successful rebound could set the stage for renewed upward momentum toward higher resistance levels. Institutional Interest and ETF Impact Beyond technical trends, Solana could gain significantly from institutional adoption. Pantera Capital notes that institutions currently hold less than 1% of Solana’s supply, compared to 16% of Bitcoin and 7% of Ethereum. Potential Grayscale spot ETF approval on October 10 could dramatically boost institutional participation, providing direct exposure to Solana. Additional applications from Bitwise, VanEck, and others await SEC review through October 16.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-26 13:53:56

Launched earlier this year with Bitcoin and Ether, the ETF will now also include XRP, Solana, and Stellar according to the press release , providing exposure to a combined market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion. This move not only strengthens Hashdex’s position as a pioneer in crypto index investing but also provides investors a simpler entry into digital assets at a critical time for market sentiment. Broader Market Access Through NCIQ The expansion of NCIQ marks a significant milestone in the U.S. market. Investors now have one of the first opportunities to access multiple crypto assets directly through a single spot ETF. With the Nasdaq Crypto US™ Index (NCIUS) as its benchmark, the fund focuses on assets that meet strict liquidity and compliance criteria. While ADA is currently eligible under the index rules, it is not included in NCIQ’s holdings. Hashdex already manages similar multi-asset products in Europe and Latin America, highlighting its global reach and experience. Marcelo Sampaio, CEO of Hashdex, emphasized that the expansion reflects the growing demand from U.S. advisors and investors. CIO Samir Kerbage added that index investing in crypto eliminates the need to pick individual winners, making diversified products like NCIQ a natural next step for the sector. Solana Faces Pressure After Rally Despite its inclusion in the expanded ETF, Solana is under notable pressure in the spot market. The token has slipped nearly 20% over the past week, now trading at $193.25 . According to Umair Crypto, the decline began after bearish divergence appeared while Solana was near $250. Since then, price has broken below $200, a key psychological level, and is now testing lower supports. Immediate defense sits at $184.88, while a failure to hold could expose $160.88 as the next downside target. Source: X Momentum indicators confirm the weakness. The daily RSI has fallen below 40, suggesting strong selling pressure remains in play. Umair Crypto highlighted the need for a bullish structure to reemerge before confidence returns. Short-Term Patterns in Focus On shorter timeframes, MartyParty pointed out Solana’s repeating technical patterns. He noted that the hourly chart shows “three legs up with 50% pullbacks,” which mirrors previous Wintermute-driven moves. These formations reflected 23% appreciation from the floor, but recent declines suggest caution until buyers regain control.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-26 13:59:49

Ready for a Rally? Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/has-solana-sol-hit-its-bottom-ready-for-a-rally-price-analysis,"A 25% correction in the Solana (SOL) price may be over. There are signs that $SOL has potentially made a bottom. Could a relief rally be about to take place, or could this even be the start of a prolonged rally back to $250 and beyond? Signs a $SOL bottom might be in Source: TradingView While these might be early hours in which to call a bottom for the $SOL price , signs are emerging that this could well be the case. The 4-hour chart reveals the long descent inside a channel which even brought the price below the major $200 horizontal support level, as well as a longstanding trendline. Nevertheless, it may be that this trendline could have held the price up, provided of course that the price does not dip and confirm below from here. The next sign is a potential double bottom. This is illustrated by the two small green arcs. Finally, a third sign is the emergence of bullish divergence in the RSI. Such a low dip to the 15.00 level has not been matched since January this year. This resulted in an upward trend in the RSI, while the price action continued to fall. This must be considered as the strongest case for a $SOL rally from here. One last dip to confirm the ascending trendline as support could see the back of the bearish price action and an upward surge could follow. A trend break confirmation on the daily? Source: TradingView There is still a concern on the daily time frame in the form of a potential confirmation of the break of the ascending trendline. The fact that this is also a strong resistance level lends credence to the scenario of a confirmed trend break here. That said, at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI reveals the indicator lines at the very bottom, with a possible cross-up already taking place. This would favour the bulls and signal upside price momentum once the indicator lines get above the 20.00 level. Strong $SOL support levels below Source: TradingView The weekly chart gives a bird’s eye view of price action for $SOL and reveals the support levels below, should the price fall through the trendline. $188 is a very strong level that has mainly provided resistance in the past, so it should be a really solid support level if the price does get there. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators have crossed down once again. This reflects the drop in the price action. It may be that these indicators continue to bounce along the top of their limit. If they don’t bounce, the resulting drop would take the $SOL price much lower, with a descent into a bear market not out of the reckoning.

After weeks of tight consolidation, the token now trades near $2.72, with traders worldwide watching the weekly chart for the next decisive move. A confirmed bullish engulfing candle on this timeframe could reset the medium-term trend and propel prices toward fresh highs. As of report time, XRP is fluctuating between $2.70 and $2.72 following a brief rally earlier in the month. This narrow range has sharpened attention on the next weekly close, as investors gauge whether momentum will break upward or yield to further consolidation. Recent market data shows consistent volume, suggesting bulls and bears are evenly matched.

He points to a potential bullish engulfing candle forming on the weekly chart—a classic reversal signal when backed by strong volume. #XRP : The Bullish Engulfing Candle : People are crying out while they should be scooping it out. If I see anyone asking for a dip again, I might block them! You wanted prices below $3.00? Well, here it is! The next time we see a Bullish Engulfing Candle on the weekly… pic.twitter.com/dtjYpZRvNb — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 26, 2025 EGRAG also emphasizes the importance of the “Bull Market Support” band , a key zone that currently underpins price action. According to his analysis, as long as XRP avoids a full-body weekly close below this band, bullish momentum remains intact. Key Levels to Watch EGRAG identifies $2.60 as an important line of defense and $2.37 as a potential last-chance buying opportunity if Bitcoin weakness spills over. Independent chart reviews align with this view, noting a support cluster between $2.70 and $2.80 and heavy resistance in the $3.10–$3.30 zone. A clean weekly close above that resistance would strengthen the case for a rally toward previous highs—and perhaps a move toward the $7.30 target EGRAG envisions over the longer term. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Bitcoin Connection XRP’s path is still tied to Bitcoin’s broader trend . Bitcoin’s recent pullback toward the $109,000 region has injected caution across the crypto market. If BTC stabilizes, XRP’s bullish engulfing pattern gains credibility; if Bitcoin slides further, XRP could revisit the $2.37–$2.60 range before any sustained advance. Savvy traders will therefore monitor BTC’s trajectory as closely as XRP’s own candles. Strategy and Outlook For traders, the playbook is straightforward: wait for confirmation. A strong weekly close above the Bull Market Support band, accompanied by rising volume, would confirm a bullish trend. Aggressive buyers may choose to scale in near the $2.37–$2.60 support pocket, but only with disciplined risk management. To protect against sudden market downturns, it’s crucial to set stops below the support band. Final Thoughts XRP’s technical backdrop shows promise, but patience remains key. According to EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis, the weekly timeframe is crucial for cutting through market volatility and spotting genuine trend changes. Whether the next move is a powerful breakout or a final retest of lower levels, the coming weekly candles will determine XRP’s trajectory into the final quarter of 2025.

Today, we’re witnessing a notable US Stock Market Rally , with major indices opening higher. Understanding these trends isn’t just for Wall Street veterans; it provides crucial context for anyone navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Let’s delve into what’s happening and why it matters to you. What’s Driving the US Stock Market Rally Today? The three major U.S. stock indices kicked off the day with a robust performance, signaling positive investor sentiment. This uplift is a welcome sight for many, reflecting a broader sense of optimism in the financial markets. The S&P 500, a key benchmark for large-cap U.S. equities, climbed by 0.20%. This gain suggests a healthy appetite for growth-oriented stocks. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies, advanced by 0.06%. While a smaller gain, it indicates continued confidence in the tech sector’s future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant U.S. companies, led the charge with a 0.43% rise. This strong showing from blue-chip stocks often signals stability and investor confidence in established businesses. These early gains highlight a positive start to trading, driven by various factors such as corporate earnings reports, economic data, or shifts in monetary policy expectations. A sustained US Stock Market Rally can ripple through various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. How Does a Strong US Stock Market Rally Impact Crypto? It’s easy to view crypto as an entirely separate entity, but its correlation with traditional markets, especially during periods of significant movement, is undeniable. When the US Stock Market Rally , it often fosters a ‘risk-on’ environment. This means investors are generally more willing to take on higher-risk assets, which can include cryptocurrencies. Here’s why this connection is important: Increased Risk Appetite: A rising stock market can make investors feel wealthier and more confident, prompting them to allocate capital to more speculative assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Capital Flow: Positive sentiment in traditional finance can sometimes lead to capital flowing from stocks into other asset classes, including digital assets, as investors seek diversification or higher returns. Macroeconomic Indicators: The same economic factors that drive the stock market – such as inflation data, interest rate decisions, or GDP growth – also influence investor decisions in the crypto space. A strong economy, often reflected in a stock market rally, can provide a favorable backdrop for crypto. However, it’s crucial to remember that while correlations exist, crypto markets also have unique drivers. Regulatory news, technological advancements, and network adoption can cause crypto to move independently, or even inversely, to traditional markets. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the interconnectedness, how should a crypto investor react to a significant US Stock Market Rally ? It’s not about blindly following, but about informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Broader Trends: Keep an eye on major economic indicators and stock market performance. These provide context for potential shifts in overall investor sentiment. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: A “risk-on” environment might tempt you to increase exposure, but always align your investments with your personal risk profile. Diversify Wisely: While a rising tide lifts all boats, not all crypto assets react the same way. Consider a diversified portfolio that balances established assets with newer, potentially higher-growth tokens. Stay Informed: Continue to research specific crypto projects, understand their fundamentals, and track relevant news within the digital asset space. Don’t solely rely on traditional market signals. Ultimately, a strong stock market can signal a period of general economic health and investor confidence, which can be beneficial for the crypto ecosystem. However, due diligence and a nuanced understanding of both traditional and digital asset markets remain paramount. In conclusion, the current US Stock Market Rally offers a compelling snapshot of broader financial optimism. While the crypto market operates with its own unique dynamics, these traditional market movements often serve as important indicators of global investor sentiment and risk appetite. For crypto investors, understanding this interplay is key to making more informed decisions and navigating the exciting, yet complex, world of digital assets. Staying abreast of both traditional and decentralized finance trends will undoubtedly provide a more holistic perspective on your investment journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when U.S. stock indices open higher? A1: When major U.S. stock indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones open higher, it generally indicates positive investor sentiment and optimism about the economy or specific company performances. It suggests a “buy” trend at the start of the trading day. Q2: How quickly does a US Stock Market Rally impact cryptocurrency prices? A2: The impact can vary. Sometimes, the correlation is immediate, with crypto prices reacting swiftly to significant traditional market moves. Other times, there can be a delayed effect, or crypto might even decouple due to its own unique market drivers. It’s a dynamic relationship. Q3: Should crypto investors always follow the US Stock Market Rally? A3: While it’s wise for crypto investors to monitor the US Stock Market Rally as an indicator of broader market sentiment and risk appetite, it’s not the only factor. Crypto markets have their own fundamentals, regulatory news, and technological advancements that can influence prices independently. A balanced approach is recommended. Q4: What are “risk-on” and “risk-off” environments in finance? A4: A “risk-on” environment is when investors are more willing to take on higher-risk assets (like stocks and cryptocurrencies) due to economic optimism. Conversely, a “risk-off” environment sees investors flocking to safer assets (like government bonds) due to uncertainty or pessimism. Q5: What are the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average? A5: These are three of the most widely followed U.S. stock market indices. The S&P 500 tracks 500 large U.S. companies, the Nasdaq Composite is heavily tech-focused, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks 30 major U.S. blue-chip companies. They serve as barometers for the overall health of the U.S. stock market. Did this article help you understand the crucial link between traditional markets and your crypto investments?

But while the intent is promising, questions remain over whether Europe can act swiftly enough to compete with the U.S. and Asia, where regulatory clarity and market adoption are already accelerating, Aruliah said. Growing Appetite for Digital Assets A consortium of European banks is reportedly exploring the launch of a euro-denominated stablecoin, showing the industry’s growing appetite for tokenized assets and digital money. Nine European banks will launch a MiCA-regulated, euro-backed stablecoin that will contribute to Europe’s strategic autonomy in payments. #EURStablecoin #MiCARegulation https://t.co/FEUGRf7hgS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 25, 2025 The banking consortium includes ING, Banca Sella, KBC, Danske Bank, DekaBank, UniCredit, SEB, CaixaBank, and Raiffeisen Bank International. This step could provide a much-needed alternative to dollar-backed stablecoins, which currently dominate the market. Yet without urgency and scale, experts warn Europe risks ceding ground to overseas competitors. Aruliah from Elliptic notes that banks are eager to engage. “European banks have shown their appetite to engage with stablecoins and tokenized assets, but they need clear regulatory pathways and the right tools to manage risk,” he said. Pressure from Global Peers Across the Atlantic, the U.S. has taken major strides toward developing regulated stablecoins, while regulators in Asia, including Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), are moving decisively to shape frameworks and encourage adoption. “News that a consortium of European banks is exploring a euro stablecoin is a positive signal, but it must be matched by scale, urgency, and more clarity on regulatory expectations,” Aruliah added. “If European banks don’t move quickly to adopt and scale credible euro-denominated stablecoins in a robust and safe way, there is a real risk that dollar-backed alternatives will continue to dominate by default.” ECB Concerns Loom Large The European Central Bank (ECB) has already raised alarms about the region’s overreliance on U.S. dollar-based stablecoins. Without credible euro-backed offerings, the ECB fears Europe could see its financial infrastructure increasingly dependent on foreign products. Such a development would weaken the region’s monetary sovereignty and influence in global finance, explains Aruliah. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) offers Europe a robust legal framework, while progress on the digital euro provides a complementary initiative. However, translating these frameworks into adoption requires coordination between policymakers and financial institutions. Europe’s Chance to Lead Aruliah argues that the first jurisdictions to move decisively will set the global standards and capture the lion’s share of capital flows. For Europe, the next few years will be key. A competitive euro stablecoin could strengthen the euro’s international role, support financial development, and enhance resilience against overdependence on dollar-backed products. If European banks and regulators act decisively, the region has a chance to reclaim ground in the stablecoin race. If not, it risks being left behind in a dollar-dominated future.

Many investors are wondering why the leading cryptocurrency is struggling to gain momentum, particularly as it hovers below the significant $110,000 mark. The answer, according to recent analysis, points directly to persistent Bitcoin selling pressure . What’s Driving the Intense Bitcoin Selling Pressure on Binance? Recent insights from CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain shed light on the forces at play. The analyst’s observations highlight that aggressive selling activity on Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, is the primary factor preventing BTC from breaking higher. Here’s what the data suggests: Negative Net Buy-Sell Volume: For the previous day, Binance’s net buy-sell volume for BTC remained negative. This indicates that more Bitcoin was being sold than bought, signifying a dominant bearish sentiment among traders on the platform. Insufficient Demand: The vol-delta indicator, a crucial tool for tracking buying flow, consistently showed insufficient demand. This means there simply isn’t enough buying interest to absorb the aggressive selling and trigger a significant price surge. Essentially, the market is experiencing a strong push from sellers, making it difficult for buyers to establish control and drive the price upward. This ongoing Bitcoin selling pressure is a key challenge for BTC’s immediate future. Why is Reclaiming $113,000 Crucial to Overcome Bitcoin Selling Pressure? The current market conditions suggest that Bitcoin is at a pivotal juncture. Arab Chain’s analysis outlines critical price levels that could determine BTC’s next major move. Understanding these thresholds is essential for anyone following the market. The analyst projects two distinct scenarios: Intensified Selling: If BTC fails to recover to the $114,000 level and the vol-delta indicator remains negative, the Bitcoin selling pressure will likely intensify. This could lead to further price declines as sellers gain more confidence. Shift to Buyer-Led Environment: Conversely, market sentiment could undergo a significant shift if two key conditions are met: the vol-delta indicator turns positive for at least one hour, AND BTC successfully reclaims the $113,000 level. This would signal a renewed buying interest and a potential reversal of the current trend. Therefore, the $113,000 mark is not just another price point; it represents a psychological and technical barrier that, if broken, could fundamentally alter the market’s dynamics from a seller-dominated environment to one led by buyers. Navigating Current Bitcoin Selling Pressure: What’s Your Strategy? Given the prevailing market conditions, how can investors and traders best navigate the current Bitcoin selling pressure ? Staying informed and observing key indicators is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Binance Activity: Keep a close eye on the net buy-sell volume on major exchanges like Binance. A sustained shift to positive volume could indicate weakening selling pressure. Watch the Vol-Delta: This indicator provides valuable real-time insights into buying and selling flow. A consistent positive reading, especially over an hour, could be a strong bullish signal. Identify Key Price Levels: The $113,000 and $114,000 levels are crucial. A clear break above $113,000, supported by volume, is a significant sign of strength. Consider Risk Management: In volatile markets, prudent risk management is always advisable. Do your own research and make informed decisions based on your risk tolerance. In conclusion, Bitcoin is currently grappling with considerable Bitcoin selling pressure , primarily originating from Binance. The immediate future hinges on its ability to overcome this challenge and reclaim critical price levels, especially $113,000. A successful reclaim could pivot the market towards a buyer-led environment, offering a fresh wave of optimism for BTC investors. However, failure to do so might intensify the bearish sentiment, making vigilance and informed decision-making more important than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ‘net buy-sell volume’ on an exchange? A1: Net buy-sell volume indicates the difference between the total volume of buy orders and sell orders over a specific period. A negative value means more selling than buying occurred. Q2: How does the ‘vol-delta indicator’ work? A2: The vol-delta indicator tracks the difference between buying and selling volume at specific price levels. A positive vol-delta suggests buying pressure is dominant, while a negative one indicates selling pressure. Q3: Why is Binance specifically mentioned in this analysis? A3: Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, and significant trading activity there can have a substantial impact on overall market prices. Analyst observations often focus on such high-volume platforms. Q4: What does it mean for the market to be ‘buyer-led’ versus ‘seller-led’? A4: A buyer-led market means that buying demand is strong enough to push prices higher, often resulting in an uptrend. Conversely, a seller-led market indicates dominant selling pressure, typically leading to price declines. Q5: Should I sell my Bitcoin if selling pressure continues? A5: This article provides market analysis, not financial advice. Investment decisions should always be based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and thorough research.

Trump signed papers last week to officially start the Gold Card program, which now costs $1 million instead of the original $5 million price he announced in February. The card promises to give buyer s re sidency much faster than the usual methods. Th e pr ice drop has made the Gold Card one of the cheapest ways for wealthy people to get into America compared to similar programs in other countries . Si ngapore charges nearly $8 million for its investment visa program, while New Zealand asks for just under $3 million. Even small Samoa requires $1.4 million. Reaz Jafri , wh o works at the law firm Withers, thinks the new price might be too low. “You get access to the U.S. education system, health care system, banking system, and financial markets, all for $1 million,” he said as quoted in a CNBC report. Rich families are already showing strong interest in the program . Ja fri spoke at a conference in Singapore this week where three families approached him right away about buying Gold Cards. Tw o fa milies were from China and one from India. He believes his office will work on hundreds of cases once the program begins operating. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, officials plan to give out 80,000 Gold Cards. Along with a future Platinum Card an d ne w H-1B visa fees that jumped to $100,000, these programs should bring in $100 billion for the federal government. Gold Card still faces some big problems Even though Trump announced it at the White House o n Fr iday, there’s no way to apply for it yet. The website that started in June only asks for basic information like names and home countries. People who signed up say they haven’t heard anything back yet. Courts and Congress will likel y ch allenge the program. Since Congress makes immigration laws, Trump had to use existing visa programs called EB-1 and EB-2 as the foundation for his Gold Card. The shaky legal ground might make wealthy buyers hesitant at first. Many will probably wait to see the first Gold Cards actually given out before spending their money. Some might wait even longer. Dominic Volek from Henley & Partners said wealthy clients usually want to see programs running smoothly for three to six months before they commit. “People don’t want to be the first one to try it,” he explained. China and India face major roadblocks Volek has already gotten questions from clients and thinks the program could attract 5,000 to 10,000 applications each year. The timing works well for the global visa market. As wars and political problems increase worldwide , ve ry rich people are buying backup citizenships and residences a s pr otection against troubles in their home countries. About 142,000 millionaires are expected to move to other countries in 2025, according to research from New World Wealth and Henley & Partners. America ranks as the second most popular destination, wit h 7, 500 millionaires expected to arrive this year. Most come from Asia, the U.K., and Latin America. Immigration advisers say most Gold Card demand will come from China and India. But people from those countries might face disappointment. The EB-1 and EB-2 programs that form th e Go ld Card’s base already have huge waiting lists from Chinese and Indian applicants that stretch for years. If Gold Card buyers can skip ahead because of their $1 million donation, people who have been waiting coul d fi le lawsuits. At the same time, Gold Card buyers won’t want to spend $1 million if they have to wai t ye ars for approval.

This substantial activity, reported by on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, immediately captures attention, raising questions about market sentiment and future price movements. Such large-scale movements by major holders often serve as key indicators for the broader crypto community, suggesting a strong conviction despite recent market fluctuations. What’s Behind the Colossal Bitcoin Whale Movement? Recently, an anonymous address, identified as 1F1neJ, embarked on a remarkable accumulation spree. This mysterious entity pulled 2,261 BTC, valued at approximately $247 million, directly from various exchanges. This isn’t just a minor transaction; it represents a significant portion of capital being moved off central platforms. What exactly is a “whale” in the crypto context? Simply put, a Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin. Their actions, whether buying, selling, or withdrawing, can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume involved. Lookonchain’s report highlights that these whales are actively accumulating BTC, even as the market experiences a decline. This pattern suggests a long-term bullish outlook from these major players, indicating they view current prices as attractive entry points rather than reasons to sell. Why Do Bitcoin Whales Matter to the Market? The movements of large holders like this anonymous Bitcoin whale are crucial because they can often foreshadow broader market trends. When whales accumulate, it can be interpreted as a sign of confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Conversely, large sell-offs can trigger panic and downward price pressure. Here’s why their actions are so closely watched: Market Influence: Their massive holdings mean their transactions can directly impact Bitcoin’s price. Sentiment Indicator: Accumulation often signals a belief that the asset is undervalued or poised for growth. Liquidity Impact: Withdrawing BTC from exchanges reduces the supply available for trading, which can, in turn, contribute to price increases if demand remains constant or grows. This recent withdrawal by the new Bitcoin whale suggests a strategic long-term play, possibly aiming to hold these assets for significant future gains, rather than short-term trading. Decoding Whale Behavior: Accumulation vs. Distribution Understanding whale behavior involves distinguishing between accumulation and distribution. Accumulation is when whales buy and hold, often moving their assets off exchanges into cold storage. Distribution, on the other hand, involves whales selling their holdings, typically by moving BTC onto exchanges to be sold. The current trend, as observed by Lookonchain, is clear: whales are in an accumulation phase. This consistent buying and withdrawal activity, particularly during market dips, reinforces the idea that smart money views these periods as opportunities. It implies a belief that Bitcoin’s underlying value and long-term potential remain strong, regardless of short-term price volatility. This sustained accumulation by major holders, including the mysterious 1F1neJ, provides a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s resilience. What Does This Mean for the Average Crypto Investor? While the actions of a single Bitcoin whale don’t guarantee future price movements, they offer valuable insights. For the average investor, observing such significant accumulation can be a reassuring signal, suggesting that institutional or high-net-worth individuals are confident in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. However, it’s vital to remember a few key points: Do Your Own Research: Always conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Whale activity is just one data point. Long-Term Perspective: Whale accumulation often points to a long-term strategy. Short-term market volatility is still possible. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. The crypto market remains inherently volatile. This latest move by the anonymous whale serves as a powerful reminder that while markets may fluctuate, strong hands are still actively building their positions, preparing for what they believe is yet to come. In conclusion, the colossal withdrawal of $247 million in BTC by a new anonymous Bitcoin whale is a remarkable event that underscores a prevailing trend of accumulation among major holders. This strategic move, reported by Lookonchain, signals a robust long-term confidence in Bitcoin, even amidst market downturns. For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, such whale activity offers a fascinating glimpse into the mindset of significant players, suggesting a resilient future for the world’s leading digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin whale? A1: A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a significantly large amount of Bitcoin, often enough to influence market prices with their transactions. Q2: Why is the anonymous whale’s withdrawal of $247M in BTC significant? A2: This withdrawal is significant because it indicates a large-scale accumulation, where a major holder is taking Bitcoin off exchanges. This often signals a long-term bullish outlook and reduces the immediate supply available for sale, potentially impacting price. Q3: Does whale accumulation always lead to a price increase? A3: While whale accumulation is often seen as a positive indicator for future price appreciation, it doesn’t guarantee immediate price increases. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, and whale activity is just one piece of the puzzle. Q4: How can average investors track whale activity? A4: Average investors can track whale activity through on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or other similar services that monitor large transactions and movements of cryptocurrencies.

At the same time, Bitcoin is hovering just below the $110,000 mark — a level it briefly tested earlier this cycle. There are thick liquidity clusters around $110K, suggesting a retest may be on the horizon. Powered by Outset PR’s data-driven market insights, this article explores how Bitcoin is navigating a pivotal moment as precious metals hit record highs. As traders and investors track market swings and fundamental data, Outset PR applies a similar discipline to communications. By closely monitoring the performance of media outlets and publishing regular analytical reports , Outset PR ensures that PR campaigns are both data-driven and highly efficient. Bitcoin Dances in the Range, Eyeing Future Highs Source: tradingview Bitcoin is trading between nearly $110k and $117k. Recently, it faced a minor slip but gained 32% over the past six months. It shows a steady climb, albeit slowly. Support is strong around $112k, with resistance near $119k. If Bitcoin overcomes this barrier, it might aim for $123k. This could mean a potential gain of around 5% to 9% from its current range. Recent trends indicate some selling pressure, as shown by the relative strength index. However, a steady move past resistance levels could spark further optimism for investors, potentially setting the stage for even higher gains. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Conclusion The rise in precious metals to all-time highs indicates a potential shift in market behavior. BTC is now positioned for a possible $110K retest. This trend shows strong interest as investors seek alternatives. Outset PR’s ability to spot trends — not in price charts but in media landscapes — reflects the same kind of analytical rigor that traders apply to technical indicators. By turning insights into market-fit stories, Outset PR demonstrates how data-driven strategies can cut through uncertainty. Whether Bitcoin breaks past resistance or consolidates further, understanding the signals behind the movements remains essential, both for investors and for shaping narratives that resonate.

After nine years of inactivity, this mysterious address has moved a staggering 100,000 ETH, valued at an incredible $390 million, to a new location. This significant transaction, first reported by AmberCN, instantly raises questions about its implications for the broader Ethereum ecosystem and the crypto market at large. What Just Happened? The Ethereum Whale’s Monumental Move Imagine holding onto a fortune for nearly a decade without touching it. That’s precisely what this particular Ethereum whale did. For nine long years, an address held a massive amount of Ether, seemingly forgotten by its owner. Then, without warning, a substantial portion of these holdings — 100,000 ETH — was transferred. This isn’t just a casual transaction; it represents a significant shift in a multi-billion dollar portfolio. Such a large movement by an old, inactive address often signals a potential change in strategy or intent from the holder. The Transfer: 100,000 ETH moved to a new, unidentified address. The Value: At current market prices, this equates to approximately $390 million. Remaining Holdings: Even after this massive transfer, the whale still possesses an astonishing 482,000 ETH, valued at around $1.89 billion. This highlights the sheer scale of this entity’s wealth within the Ethereum network. It could be a precursor to selling, rebalancing, or even participating in new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Why Does a Dormant Ethereum Whale’s Activity Matter? When a large holder, especially one that has been inactive for an extended period, makes a move, the crypto community pays close attention. Why? Because these “whales” possess enough capital to influence market sentiment and even price action. Their decisions can send ripples across the entire market. Consider these crucial points: Market Sentiment: A large transfer can be interpreted in various ways. Some might see it as a bearish signal, fearing an impending sell-off that could depress prices. Others might view it neutrally, as a simple portfolio management move. Supply Dynamics: Moving such a substantial amount of ETH from a dormant wallet effectively brings it back into circulation, or at least makes it accessible for future actions. This shift in accessible supply is crucial for market analysis. Historical Context: Nine years is a lifetime in crypto. This Ethereum whale acquired their ETH during the very early days, likely at significantly lower prices. Their current actions are thus highly anticipated. The sheer volume of the transfer means it cannot be ignored. Analysts are now closely monitoring the new address for any subsequent movements that might provide further clues. Understanding Ethereum Whale Behavior and Market Dynamics What exactly is a “crypto whale”? In simple terms, it’s an individual or entity holding a vast amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its price. Their moves are often tracked by blockchain analytics firms, providing insights into market trends and potential shifts. Tracking these large holders offers a window into the broader market psychology and transparency: Transparency: Unlike traditional finance, blockchain offers a degree of transparency, allowing anyone to observe these large transactions, even if the identity of the holder remains pseudonymous. Strategic Implications: An Ethereum whale might move funds for various reasons: To transfer to an exchange for selling. To participate in staking or DeFi protocols. For security reasons, consolidating funds or moving them to a cold storage solution. To diversify their portfolio. This particular transaction serves as a potent reminder of the concentrated wealth within the crypto space and the power held by these early adopters. Their actions are not just personal financial decisions; they are often indicators for the rest of the market. Navigating the Waters: What This Ethereum Whale Transfer Could Mean for You While the exact intentions of this long-dormant Ethereum whale remain unknown, their actions provide valuable data for all market participants. For individual investors, it’s a moment to observe and potentially adjust strategies, rather than react impulsively. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue to follow reputable crypto news sources and blockchain analytics reports for updates on this whale’s activities. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. The actions of a single large holder underscore the volatility inherent in crypto. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term price fluctuations can be exciting or alarming, a long-term view often helps in navigating such events. This whale held for nine years, demonstrating extreme patience. The crypto market thrives on information and anticipation. This monumental ETH transfer is a prime example of how the actions of a few can captivate and potentially influence the many. Whether this move portends a major market shift or is simply a strategic reallocation, only time will tell. The Awakened Giant: A Compelling Summary The awakening of a nine-year dormant Ethereum whale , marked by a massive $390 million ETH transfer, is undeniably one of the most compelling stories in the crypto world right now. It highlights the immense wealth accumulated by early adopters and the significant influence these large holders can wield. While the immediate impact on market prices is yet to be fully determined, the event underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain activity and understanding the potential implications of such colossal moves. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the behavior of these digital giants will always remain a key indicator for investors seeking to navigate its dynamic waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ether (ETH), enough to potentially influence its market price through their transactions. These holders often acquired their assets early on or have significant capital. Why is this particular ETH transfer significant? This transfer is significant because it involves a colossal amount ($390 million worth of ETH) from an address that had been dormant for nine years. Such a long period of inactivity followed by a major move often signals a change in strategy or intent, which can impact market sentiment. What are the potential reasons for the whale’s move? Reasons for an Ethereum whale to move funds can vary. It could be for security (transferring to a new, more secure wallet), rebalancing a portfolio, preparing to sell on an exchange, participating in staking or DeFi protocols, or simply consolidating assets. How might this transfer impact the Ethereum market? The impact is currently uncertain. If the funds are moved to an exchange for selling, it could create downward pressure on ETH prices. However, if they are moved for staking or DeFi participation, it could be seen as a bullish signal. The market will closely watch for subsequent actions from the new address. How can individual investors track crypto whale movements? Individual investors can track whale movements using blockchain analytics platforms (like Etherscan for Ethereum) or by following reputable crypto news outlets and on-chain analysis firms that report on significant transactions. What should individual investors do in response to such news? It’s generally advised for individual investors to remain calm and avoid impulsive decisions. Instead, focus on staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, and maintaining a long-term perspective. The actions of one large holder do not necessarily dictate the entire market’s direction.

Who Misses Out?",https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-season-draws-fresh-focus-on-aethir-mantle-and-hyperliquid-liquidity-infrastructure-and-etf-whispers-at-play/,"Altcoin season is developing through tokens that show both trading depth and current catalysts. Instead of a blanket rally across the sector, liquidity has been rotating into assets tied to infrastructure, derivatives, and gaming platforms. The latest movement puts Aethir, Mantle, and Hyperliquid in focus, each with distinct reasons behind recent price action. This rotation reflects how altseason often unfolds in waves . Traders look for names with active order books, visible narratives, and exchange access. Aethir has gained from surging volumes and attention around its gaming and cloud-based tools. Mantle continues to build momentum through exchange support and recognition as a Layer-2 scaling solution. Hyperliquid remains a centerpiece of discussion around derivatives and speculation tied to institutional activity. Aethir (ATH): Volume Expansion Fuels Attention Aethir is trading near $0.06 , with a daily volume above $110 million and a market capitalization of about $742 million. The circulating supply stands at roughly 12.2 billion tokens out of a maximum of 42 billion. The price has gained about 7% in the past day, supported by liquidity flows into centralized exchanges. It’s DePIN Day at @token2049 Singapore and you already know Aethir’s CSO & Co-founder @MRRydon had to show up Catch him on Oct 3rd dropping hot takes on AI, Aethir & all things DePIN at @depinday : https://t.co/x2CU4tV2EO pic.twitter.com/h1E73BQpbC — Aethir (@AethirCloud) September 26, 2025 The sudden increase in trading activity has made Aethir a candidate for short-term altseason allocations. Exchange books show more substantial depth than in prior weeks, and ATH has been among the more liquid gaming-related tokens this month. Its infrastructure role in cloud and gaming contexts gives it recurring visibility, which helps maintain turnover once liquidity arrives. Mantle (MNT): Exchange Support and Layer-2 Demand Mantle is trading around $1.69, with a market capitalization of nearly $5.5 billion and a daily turnover of more than $500 million. The circulating supply is about 3.25 billion MNT. The price has climbed about 5% in the past 24 hours, extending a multi-week trend that has lifted MNT from the $1.40 range earlier this quarter. Mantle Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The token’s strength comes from steady exchange support and expanded derivatives access. Partnerships with trading venues such as Bybit have encouraged consistent activity, and the project’s positioning as a Layer-2 scaling network has added longer-term appeal. For traders, MNT combines liquidity with a credible narrative, making it a recurring target when altcoin season rotations look for infrastructure exposure. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Derivatives Activity and ETF Speculation Hyperliquid is now trading near $43 , with a daily volume between $650 million and $700 million and a market capitalization of about $14.5 billion. The circulating supply stands at around 336 million tokens out of a maximum of 1 billion. The recent move has been linked to speculation around a potential Hyperliquid spot ETF filing by Bitwise, which drew discussion about institutional entry points. At the same time, derivatives markets tied to Hyperliquid remain heavily traded, giving the token consistent turnover. While HYPE has pulled back from its recent highs, its open interest across perpetual markets keeps it in focus for traders looking at altseason derivatives plays. Altcoin Season Outlook Aethir, Mantle, and Hyperliquid show how altcoin season builds through diverse narratives . Aethir’s rising volume anchors it in gaming-linked trading. Mantle captures capital through its role in scaling and steady exchange support. Hyperliquid remains tied to derivatives activity and speculation about institutional involvement. This combination illustrates why altseason often moves in stages. Traders respond to liquidity and catalysts, not sector-wide momentum. For now, the flows into these three tokens show where selective participation is shaping the current cycle. The post Altcoin Season Just Shifted – Traders Crowd Aethir, Mantle, Hyperliquid.

Reportedly, the company has begun laying the groundwork and holding external discussions due to strong client demand for digital assets and a shifting regulatory environment. The mutual fund giant with $10 trillion in assets under management has, until now, remained on the sidelines regarding digital assets. For the longest time, it has opted for a more conservative approach than rivals Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab. Vanguard looks to list Bitcoin ETFs on their platform, contrary to their previous views. Life happens fast! They also have a new CEO. https://t.co/HXnR1PeS1S — Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) September 26, 2025 There are currently no plans for Vanguard to launch its own products, as BlackRock has done. Instead, the firm is considering letting brokerage customers access select third-party crypto ETFs. “They’re being very methodical in their approach, understanding the dynamics have been changing since 2024,” the source said. Vanguard falls in love with the crypto market This initiative is most likely being pushed by Vanguard’s CEO, Salim Ramji. He oversaw the launch of BlackRock’s wildly successful Bitcoin ETF IBIT, which has seen over $60 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024 and now holds more than $80 billion in assets. Since taking the helm at Vanguard last year, investors have looked forward to seeing if he will take a page from his former boss Larry Fink’s playbook. However, in July at the Morningstar Investment Conference, Ramji said that Vanguard will not copy competitors by launching its own crypto ETFs. However, he sidestepped questions about offering access to third-party crypto ETFs on the platform. Industry watchers such as Nate Geraci of The ETF Store have long expected the company to be influenced. He argued that Vanguard’s resistance could not last indefinitely once competitors proved the viability of crypto ETFs. Vanguard’s new approach to crypto can be linked to several factors, including the improved regulatory environment and the success of crypto ETFs. Over the past year, the Trump administration has reshaped the US regulatory landscape, directing it toward a more pro-crypto direction. Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), two of the most important financial regulators, are working together increasingly to make digital asset rules clearer and simpler. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the two will have a joint roundtable on regulatory harmonization on Monday. Their collaborative approach has transformed what was once an unregulated frontier into a more structured market, which has sparked big interest from institutions and sped up growth in the crypto sector as a whole. At the same time, the major success of the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has undoubtedly influenced the asset management firm’s decision. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds have attracted more than $70 billion in inflows since launching last year, bringing their total assets to over $150 billion. Meanwhile, other major firms are expanding crypto access for their clients. Morgan Stanley partnered with Zerohash to enable E*Trade clients to trade Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana directly through traditional brokerage accounts, with rollout starting in the first half of 2026. BlackRock’s IBIT records inflows amidst major outflows While many ETFs reported losses, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) drew $79 million in inflows, showing its strong market position. Other major ETFs faced substantial withdrawals, including Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise, ARK 21Shares, Franklin, VanEck, and Grayscale. Fidelity’s fund lost $114.8 million, Bitwise posted $80.5 million, and ARK’s ARKB saw $63 million exit. In addition, analysts say that Bitcoin ETFs collectively maintain net-positive inflows exceeding $57 billion since their launch. This shows its enduring confidence in the sector. Strong inflows into BlackRock’s fund suggest investor preference for well-established platforms during turbulent periods. Ether ETFs recorded $251 million in outflows on Thursday. This added to weekly withdrawals of $547 million as Ethereum traded near $3,900, down 8% on the day and 21% from last month’s highs. This triggered more than $1.1 billion in liquidations of leveraged positions. BlackRock also set up a “Bitcoin Premium ETF,” which shows that big investors are still interested in organized crypto exposure. These developments suggest that, even amid corrections, major players continue to innovate and diversify offerings, betting on long-term growth. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The meme coin market is up for the quarter and has gained 36% in its market cap over the past year. Stablecoins – one of crypto’s recent darlings – have seen their market cap climb from a little over $200B to nearly $300B this year. Recent days have highlighted some exhaustion with Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have sagged back a bit. Still, analysts increasingly point to three interlocking forces that could drive performance in the final quarter of the year: Regulatory clarity The continued rise of stablecoins Rotation from Bitcoin into high-growth sectors The upbeat mood goes beyond those three issues; a recent Grayscale report shows growth in all six core crypto sections. Here’s how the pieces align – and how PEPENODE fits in. Potential Q4 Positives Here are some things investors can watch for as October draws closer. Legislative Clarity The CLARITY Act , a sweeping U.S. bill designed to give a legal framework to crypto financial services, should serve as a bridge between the digital asset space and traditional finance, potentially opening doors for broader institutional participation. Complementing that is the SEC’s new move to allow a generic listing standard for commodity-based ETPs. That change could expand the menu of crypto assets accessible to U.S. investors, lowering the barrier for institutional inflows. Stablecoins and Tokenization Stablecoins may become foundational infrastructure. Analysts highlight that chains heavily used for stablecoin activity – Ethereum, Solana, Tron, BNB, and others – could benefit disproportionately. That builds on other reports that saw steady growth in stablecoins in the year’s third quarter. Tokenization of real-world assets, including tokenized money market funds, deposits, and ETFs, continues to gain traction. That follows a steady increase in the RWA market cap over the past month. Bitcoin First, Altcoins Close Behind Following the Fed’s September rate cut, a ‘Uptober’ rally is widely anticipated. Renewed momentum in Bitcoin could cascade into altcoins, continuing a pattern of market rotation where assets cycle from large caps to smaller, more speculative tokens. Among the sectors most likely to shine are those with revenue generation baked in: lending, staking, yield farming, and tokenized real-world assets. Projects combining DeFi principles with tangible cash flows could also attract outsized interest. That trend is likely already underway, as the DeFi sector roared back in the past months with a focus on platforms specializing in perpetual futures contracts. Emerging platforms like Aster ($ASTER), which saw its token price jump nearly 2400% in a month. But there’s another token lurking that could see similar gains. Will PEPENODE power up the green frog meme market once again? PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – The Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Makes Big Gains in Presale Mine-to-Earn is PEPENODE’s meme coin innovation. Memes aren’t mined, they’re made – but with $PEPENODE, they can be both. $PEPENODE token holders gain access to their own virtual mining node. At first, the node is a blank space. Users spend $PEPENODE to upgrade their nodes, adding additional mining rigs and boosting their ability to mine memes faster. The best part is that miners won’t just earn $PEPENODE; they’ll also be eligible for bonuses in $PEPE, $FARTCOIN, and other leading meme coin market performers. The $PEPENODE presale currently boasts an incredible 909% staking rewards, and the project has generated over $1.4M so far. The token price is only, but our price prediction shows that it could reach $0.0023 by the end of the year. Learn how to buy $ PEPENODE and visit the presale page today. Q4 2025 could be a defining window for crypto if regulation, tokenization, and rotation align. The stage is set for a strong close to the year — and PepeNode’s mine-to-earn model fits the zeitgeist perfectly.

This strategic move highlights a growing trend among institutional players to accumulate digital assets. Cangao’s Growing Bitcoin Holdings: A Strategic Accumulation? Cangao recently announced an increase of 141 BTC to its reserves. This addition brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 5,708.3 BTC, as reported by BitcoinTreasuries. Consequently, Cangao now ranks 19th among all publicly traded firms globally for its Bitcoin reserves. This accumulation signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As a prominent Bitcoin mining operation, Cangao is not just extracting new coins but actively strengthening its balance sheet with existing ones. Why Do Institutional Bitcoin Holdings Matter for the Market? The actions of companies like Cangao provide crucial insights into broader market sentiment. When publicly traded entities increase their Bitcoin holdings , it often reflects a bullish outlook and strengthens institutional confidence in the asset class. Furthermore, such moves can: Signal Stability: Large corporate holdings can contribute to market stability by reducing the circulating supply available for speculative trading. Validate Bitcoin: It legitimizes Bitcoin as a treasury asset, encouraging other corporations to consider similar strategies. Boost Investor Confidence: Retail and institutional investors often look to the moves of major players for cues on market direction. This trend underscores Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital currency to a recognized store of value and an increasingly adopted corporate asset. Navigating the Volatility: The Risks of Large Bitcoin Holdings While increasing Bitcoin holdings offers potential for significant gains, it also comes with inherent risks. Bitcoin’s price is known for its volatility, meaning the value of Cangao’s reserves can fluctuate dramatically. Companies holding large amounts of BTC must therefore have a robust risk management strategy in place. However, many firms view this volatility as a short-term challenge against a backdrop of long-term growth potential. Their investment decisions are often based on a belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental technology and its increasing adoption globally. What’s Next for Cangao and Institutional Bitcoin Holdings? Cangao’s latest move could inspire other mining companies and public firms to reassess their own treasury strategies. The continued accumulation by such entities suggests a sustained belief in Bitcoin’s future. For readers, observing these trends offers valuable insights: Market Indicators: Pay attention to announcements from major institutional holders as they can foreshadow market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: Understand that strategic accumulations often reflect a long-term investment horizon, rather than short-term speculation. The ongoing narrative of institutional adoption, driven by companies like Cangao, continues to shape the cryptocurrency landscape. It paints a picture of a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly integrated into traditional financial frameworks. Cangao’s impressive increase in its Bitcoin holdings is more than just a company update; it is a powerful indicator of the growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin. This strategic accumulation by a key player in the mining industry underscores Bitcoin’s strengthening position as a valuable asset for corporate treasuries. As more companies follow suit, we can anticipate a further solidification of Bitcoin’s role in the global financial ecosystem.

In 2028, XLM will range between $1.49 and $1.70, with an average price of $1.59. The token could reach as high as $2.76 in 2031. Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and payment protocol launched in July 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. Developed by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation, it aims to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Stellar operates on its blockchain, using the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to validate transactions, which enhances security and efficiency. One of Stellar’s key features is its ability to enable currency exchange between different fiat and digital assets. The network charges a minimal transaction fee of 0.00001 XLM, making it an attractive option for users seeking affordable transaction solutions for real world assets with low transaction costs. Stellar is particularly focused on financial inclusion, targeting unbanked populations in developing regions by providing access to essential financial services without traditional banking systems and as an alternative to traditional money. XLM, the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network, is used for transaction fees and as a bridge currency in cross-asset transactions. Initially, there were 100 billion XLM, but in 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation burned approximately half of the total supply to enhance its value and utility. Today, around 30.6 billion XLM are in circulation, with the network gaining traction for its real-world applications in remittances and asset transfers due to its ongoing project developments. Is XLM a good investment? Will it go up? Is Stellar Lumens a buy or sell? Where will it be in 5 years? We answer these questions and more in our Stellar’s Cryptopolitan Price Prediction.

Cryptocurrency loses up to 2.25% of its value. XLM coin prices target the next support around $0.321. On September 26, 2025, Stellar price analysis revealed a decreasing trend for the currency. Coin value has depreciated to $0.350 in the last 24 hours, decreasing by 2.25 percent.

XLM historical price sentiment XLM price history Stellar (XLM) was launched in April 2015, starting with a price of approximately $0.00279. The cryptocurrency experienced a challenging year, closing at around $0.00175, marking it as one of its worst years. In 2016, XLM’s price further declined to an average of $0.00200, with a maximum price of $0.00338. The following year, 2017, was a turning point, as Stellar surged significantly, reaching an average price of $0.0335 and peaking at $0.3904, as per historical data of financial markets. The bullish momentum continued into 2018, where XLM hit its all-time high of $0.9381 in January. However, the price fell sharply throughout the year, closing at approximately $0.1103. In the subsequent years, XLM’s price fluctuated, with notable lows in 2019 around $0.0450 and a recovery in 2021, where it reached $0.7930. In July 2023, Stellar’s price jumped to $0.159, reflecting its volatility and potential for growth in the cryptocurrency market.

A new report from Standard Chartered suggests Ethereum is set to benefit more than Bitcoin or Solana as treasuries continue to expand. This shift comes at a time when altcoin momentum is starting to build, and experts are eyeing emerging plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some analysts believe could deliver up to 55x returns as capital rotates into new opportunities. The Rise of Digital Asset Treasuries Treasury firms act like corporate balance sheets for crypto. Instead of holding traditional reserves, these entities accumulate and manage large amounts of tokens. Their influence is already being felt across the market. Standard Chartered estimates treasuries collectively hold around 4% of all Bitcoin , just over 3% of Ethereum , and less than 1% of Solana . This concentrated ownership means that whenever treasuries adjust their strategies – whether it’s buying, selling, or merging – the impact on prices can be substantial. Investors are increasingly tracking treasury activity the same way traditional markets watch central banks and sovereign wealth funds. Why Ethereum Stands Out At first glance, Bitcoin seems like the ultimate treasury coin. It has the largest pool of holdings and the longest track record as a store of value. But Ethereum offers something Bitcoin doesn’t: yield. By staking ETH, treasuries can generate ongoing income from their reserves, which provides resilience during volatile periods. Solana also offers staking, but Ethereum’s staking system is more established and widely integrated into financial products. Standard Chartered argues that this makes Ethereum treasuries more sustainable than their Bitcoin counterparts. With yield built directly into the protocol, ETH treasuries can offset financing costs, making them less vulnerable to downturns. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum While large-scale treasuries shine a spotlight on Ethereum, retail and early investors are searching for breakout opportunities in smaller-cap projects. One of the most talked-about is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its presale has been rapidly selling out, and analysts believe the combination of an audited ecosystem, community expansion, and limited supply could deliver outsized gains. Some forecasts point to a potential 55x upside before the next bull market reaches full speed. Unlike many short-lived presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been steadily gaining traction with both retail participants and early whales. Its momentum has already drawn comparisons to the early growth stages of SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN – projects that rewarded early entrants with massive returns. With treasuries dominating larger coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin, altcoin investors are betting MAGACOIN FINANCE will become one of the next names to benefit from fresh capital inflows. Challenges Facing Treasury Firms Despite their rising influence, treasury firms face an uphill battle. Many of their stocks have been trading below the value of their underlying crypto holdings. This “discount to NAV” problem makes it harder for treasuries to raise new funding since investors are reluctant to pour money into firms already undervalued by the market. Standard Chartered noted that scale, yield, and financing costs will determine which treasuries survive long term. Without access to efficient capital or revenue-generating reserves, smaller players could struggle. Ethereum treasuries, supported by staking income, are better equipped to handle these pressures than Bitcoin-focused firms that rely solely on price appreciation. Consolidation Could Be Coming One possible outcome is consolidation. Undervalued treasuries might merge to cut costs and increase efficiency. Standard Chartered believes Bitcoin treasuries are most at risk of this kind of shake-up, since many depend entirely on BTC price performance. In contrast, Ethereum’s treasury ecosystem appears more stable, not just because of staking but also due to more sophisticated operators managing reserves. That said, consolidation wouldn’t necessarily mean new inflows. Mergers would mostly shuffle existing coins between firms rather than drive fresh demand. Still, it could create more efficient players that can hold and manage assets for longer cycles. Ethereum’s Strong Backer: BitMine Immersion Perhaps the clearest sign of Ethereum’s advantage lies in BitMine Immersion (BMNR), one of the most prominent ETH treasuries. BMNR now controls over 2 million ETH – around 5% of total supply – thanks to its regulator-approved strategy. Standard Chartered highlighted BMNR as proof that Ethereum’s treasury ecosystem is attracting serious, long-term capital. This kind of commitment adds structural support for ETH prices. As treasuries like BMNR accumulate and stake their holdings, they effectively reduce circulating supply while reinforcing Ethereum’s yield-driven model. That makes ETH more attractive as a base-layer asset for treasuries compared to Bitcoin or Solana. What Comes Next The outlook from Standard Chartered is clear: Ethereum is better positioned than Bitcoin to benefit from the growing role of treasuries. With yield mechanisms, established staking infrastructure, and heavyweight players like BMNR backing it, ETH looks set to enjoy stronger price support as treasury adoption expands. At the same time, altcoin investors are watching for new breakout plays that treasuries may overlook. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the standout names in this regard, with analysts highlighting its rare mix of scarcity, growth, and early momentum. If Ethereum treasuries prove to be the institutional story of the cycle, retail investors may find MAGACOIN FINANCE to be the parallel opportunity on the other end of the spectrum. Conclusion Digital asset treasuries are reshaping the crypto landscape, and Ethereum looks like the ultimate winner thanks to its built-in yield advantages. Bitcoin remains the largest player in size, but ETH is emerging as the smarter treasury choice. Solana, while innovative, has not yet reached the same level of adoption. For investors looking beyond the established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention with projections of a 55x upside as altcoin rotation picks up speed. Together, these trends highlight how institutional and retail capital flows are moving in parallel but complementary directions.

This bold claim, shared in an interview with the New York Post, has ignited discussions across financial and cryptocurrency circles. But what exactly are stablecoins , and how might they play such a pivotal role in the global economy, especially concerning the world’s reserve currency? Understanding the Power of Stablecoins To grasp Eric Trump’s perspective, it is essential to understand what stablecoins are. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value. They achieve this stability by being pegged to a reserve asset, most commonly a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or sometimes to commodities or other cryptocurrencies. This pegging mechanism aims to combine the benefits of blockchain technology—speed, transparency, and borderless transactions—with the predictability of traditional currencies. Fiat-backed stablecoins: These are the most common type, holding an equivalent amount of fiat currency (e.g., USD) in reserve for every digital coin issued. Algorithmic stablecoins: These use smart contracts and algorithms to maintain their peg without direct fiat reserves. Commodity-backed stablecoins: Pegged to assets like gold or silver. Why Eric Trump Believes Stablecoins Will Save the U.S. Dollar Eric Trump’s conviction stems from the belief that stablecoins can modernize the U.S. dollar’s infrastructure, making it more competitive and resilient in an increasingly digital world. He specifically mentioned USD1, a stablecoin issued by WorldLibertyFinancial, as an example of this potential. His argument centers on several key advantages: Firstly, efficiency in transactions . Stablecoins enable faster and cheaper international money transfers compared to traditional banking systems, which often involve multiple intermediaries and can take days to settle. This efficiency could enhance the dollar’s utility in global commerce. Secondly, global accessibility . Stablecoins can reach populations worldwide, including those who are unbanked or underbanked, providing them with access to a stable, dollar-denominated digital asset. This broadens the dollar’s reach and influence. Moreover, as nations explore central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), Eric Trump’s view suggests that privately issued stablecoins , especially those transparently backed by the U.S. dollar, could serve as a de facto digital dollar, reinforcing its status without direct government issuance. This approach could offer flexibility and innovation driven by the private sector. The Benefits and Challenges of Embracing Stablecoins The potential benefits of widespread stablecoin adoption are compelling: Reduced Transaction Costs: Lower fees for remittances and international payments. Faster Settlements: Near-instantaneous transfers, improving liquidity and efficiency in financial markets. Financial Inclusion: Providing digital access to a stable currency for individuals without traditional bank accounts. Innovation Catalyst: Fostering new financial products and services built on blockchain technology. However, embracing stablecoins is not without its challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a significant hurdle. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee these digital assets, ensuring consumer protection, financial stability, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Furthermore, the reserves backing stablecoins must be transparent and regularly audited to maintain trust and prevent systemic risks. The collapse of certain algorithmic stablecoins has highlighted the importance of robust backing mechanisms. What Does This Mean for the Future of the U.S. Dollar? Eric Trump’s comments highlight a growing recognition that digital assets are not merely a niche interest but a force shaping the future of global finance. Whether stablecoins ultimately “save” the U.S. dollar remains a subject of ongoing debate. However, their potential to enhance the dollar’s digital presence, improve transaction efficiency, and expand its global reach is undeniable. The conversation around stablecoins is evolving rapidly, urging policymakers and financial institutions to consider their role in maintaining the dollar’s preeminence. The path forward will likely involve a collaborative effort between innovators, regulators, and financial experts to harness the advantages of stablecoins while mitigating their inherent risks. As the digital economy continues to expand, understanding and adapting to these technological shifts will be paramount for any currency aiming to retain its global influence. FAQs About Stablecoins and the U.S. Dollar Q1: What is a stablecoin? A1: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar. Q2: How do stablecoins differ from Bitcoin? A2: Unlike Bitcoin, which is highly volatile, stablecoins aim for price stability, making them more suitable for everyday transactions and as a store of value. Q3: What are the main benefits of stablecoins for the U.S. dollar? A3: They can offer faster and cheaper international transactions, expand the dollar’s global reach, and potentially enhance financial inclusion. Q4: What are the risks associated with stablecoins? A4: Risks include regulatory uncertainty, the need for transparent reserve management, and potential systemic risks if not properly overseen. Q5: Will stablecoins replace the U.S. dollar? A5: Most experts believe stablecoins are more likely to complement rather than replace the U.S. dollar, acting as a digital extension of its utility. Did you find this article insightful?

Based on reports, regulators and payment networks moved after authorities recorded big jumps in both the number of cases and the money lost to scams last year. India: RBI And NPCI Move Fast Regulators have pushed several changes into the banking and payments system. According to published figures, incidents tied to Unified Payments Interface or UPI more than doubled from about 7.25 lakh ($8,700) to 13.42 lakh ($16,200) in fiscal year 2023-24. Reported losses rose too, from ₹573 crore ($69 million) the year before to ₹1,087 crore ($131 million) in 2023-24. The central bank has allowed risk-based additional checks for certain transactions, and NPCI has told banks and apps to block pull or collect requests on UPI from October 1, 2025, a move meant to shut a common scam vector.

The central… pic.twitter.com/NH7xKuMmzm — All India Radio News (@airnewsalerts) September 25, 2025 New Authentication And Domain Rules One of the headline changes is a requirement for two-factor authentication for payments, set to come into effect on April 1, 2026. Banks and payment firms will need to apply at least two methods of ID for transactions — such as biometrics, device tokens, or passphrases — while SMS OTPs will still be allowed in some cases. Reports also say the industry will be asked to reserve clear, trusted web domains for banks and finance firms — examples given include “bank.in” for banks and “fin.in” for non-bank financial companies — to make phishing sites easier to spot and block. How Users And Banks Will Be Affected The new rules are meant to stop impersonation scams , fake calls that pretend to be law enforcement, and other social engineering tricks that send money out of accounts. A special Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre and the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre will coordinate responses, and a suspect registry drawn from the national cybercrime portal is being used to track suspicious accounts and identities. Banks and small operators that run Aadhaar-enabled payment services will face stricter due diligence requirements for their agents and terminals. Costs, Complexity And The Rural Gap Banks and tech providers must upgrade systems to run the extra checks and keep records. That will add cost and complexity, especially for smaller firms and rural operators that rely on older devices. Users may face more steps when they pay, particularly for cross-border or unusual transactions. Reports warn that fraudsters often change tactics after rules tighten, so the measures will need constant review and active enforcement to stay effective.

The latest edition highlights a sharp decline in realized volatility across major cryptocurrencies, a bearish shift in bitcoin skew, and strategic insights into options positioning. The report underscores a market dynamic where realized volatility for bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and solana (SOL) reached historic lows in early September, even as macroeconomic headwinds and monetary policy shifts added pressure to global markets. Despite the subdued realized activity, implied volatility remains elevated, pointing to ongoing demand for risk protection. Key highlights: Historic lows in realized volatility: BTC, ETH, and SOL all posted realized volatilities significantly below their 2025 averages, with BTC falling to 20% compared to its annual mean of 42%. Persistent implied premium: Options continue to price implied volatility at roughly 1.5 times realized levels across major assets, a trend that narrowed slightly following the Federal Reserve’s September policy decision. Bearish bitcoin skew: Despite bitcoin’s all-time high of $124,000 in August, options markets priced downside protection at a premium, marking a sentiment shift from bullish to bearish. BTC skew has since remained negative, while ETH skew diverged in late September toward call-side strength. Realized Volatilities Collapse to Historic Lows Despite macro-driven rallies in August and September, realized volatility for BTC, ETH, and SOL fell to historic lows. Seven-day realized volatility dropped to 20% for BTC (vs. a 2025 average of 42%), 40% for ETH (vs. 71%), and 56% for SOL (vs. 85%). Implied volatility, however, held at roughly 1.5 times realized levels across all three assets, a pattern the report attributes to structural demand for optionality beyond short-term event risk. BTC Skew Reflects Bearish Sentiment Amid Inflation Shock Bitcoin’s August 14 all-time high of $124,000 quickly reversed following a hotter-than-expected inflation print, driving risk-off sentiment. Options markets reacted with BTC’s 90-day skew turning negative for only the third time this year, reflecting strong demand for downside protection at that time. The bearish skew has persisted through September, with ETH diverging — flipping bullish on out-of-the-money calls — creating the sharpest year-to-date split in skew and volatility between the two assets.

Two wallets closely connected to the prominent cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, made a significant move on the blockchain. This event involved a massive supply of Ethereum (ETH) to a decentralized lending protocol, followed by a substantial loan in USDT and its subsequent transfer to a specialized vault. Understanding these on-chain maneuvers is crucial for anyone tracking major movements in the digital asset space. What Happened: The Mechanics of Bitfinex USDT Borrowing? Onchainlens, a reputable analytics platform, reported that these Bitfinex-associated wallets initiated a large-scale transaction. They first supplied an impressive 200,000 ETH, valued at approximately $790 million, to Aave V3. Aave V3 is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol, allowing users to lend and borrow various cryptocurrencies. Following this significant deposit, the same wallets then borrowed 151 million USDT. USDT, or Tether, is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged to the US dollar. This Bitfinex USDT borrowing was a calculated move, likely aimed at leveraging their ETH holdings without selling them outright. Subsequently, these borrowed funds were swiftly transferred to a Plasma Vault, adding another layer of intrigue to the transaction. Aave V3: A decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. USDT: A stablecoin that aims to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, often used for liquidity and trading. Plasma Vault: A specific type of smart contract or secure storage solution, often associated with enhanced security or specific functionalities within the blockchain ecosystem. Why Does This Bitfinex USDT Borrowing Matter? The sheer scale of this transaction makes it noteworthy. Supplying $790 million worth of ETH to a DeFi protocol and then engaging in Bitfinex USDT borrowing of $151 million demonstrates significant institutional-level participation in decentralized finance. Such large movements can impact market liquidity and potentially signal strategic shifts by major players. Moreover, this activity highlights the growing interconnectedness between centralized entities like Bitfinex and the decentralized finance landscape. Traditional exchanges are increasingly exploring and utilizing DeFi protocols for various purposes, including yield generation, liquidity management, and arbitrage opportunities. This blend of CeFi and DeFi operations is a trend worth monitoring closely. Understanding these flows provides valuable insights into how large entities manage their digital assets. It shows a sophisticated approach to capital deployment, where assets are leveraged to acquire other assets without direct liquidation. This strategy can be crucial for maintaining long-term holdings while accessing short-term liquidity. Diving Deeper: Understanding Plasma Vaults and Bitfinex’s Strategy The transfer of the borrowed USDT to a Plasma Vault raises interesting questions. Plasma Vaults are typically designed for enhanced security, asset management, or specific programmatic functions within a blockchain framework. While the exact purpose of this particular vault remains undisclosed, common uses include: Enhanced Security: Protecting large sums of assets with multi-signature requirements or advanced access controls. Yield Generation: Deploying assets into other DeFi protocols for additional returns. Operational Liquidity: Storing funds for future operational needs, trading, or market making. Arbitrage Opportunities: Positioning funds to capitalize on price differences across exchanges. Bitfinex, as a major exchange, likely has a strategic reason behind this move. This Bitfinex USDT borrowing could be part of a broader strategy to optimize its treasury, manage risk, or expand its services. On-chain analysis, therefore, becomes a powerful tool for transparency, allowing observers to track these movements and deduce potential intentions, even if the precise details are not publicly announced. Navigating the Future of Bitfinex USDT Borrowing and DeFi This event underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing sophistication of on-chain strategies. As more institutional players engage with DeFi, we can expect to see similar complex transactions that leverage the unique capabilities of decentralized protocols. Keeping an eye on these developments is essential for investors and enthusiasts alike. The transparency of blockchain technology allows for unprecedented insight into the financial activities of even the largest entities. This continuous flow of data helps in understanding market sentiment, liquidity trends, and potential future directions. Therefore, monitoring significant on-chain events like this Bitfinex USDT borrowing provides a real-time pulse of the crypto ecosystem. Key takeaways for readers: Large entities are actively using DeFi for strategic asset management. On-chain data offers crucial insights into market movements. Understanding protocols like Aave V3 and Plasma Vaults is becoming increasingly important. Conclusion The recent Bitfinex USDT borrowing and subsequent transfer to a Plasma Vault represent a significant on-chain event, showcasing the sophisticated strategies employed by major players in the crypto space. This transaction highlights the growing convergence of centralized exchanges and decentralized finance, emphasizing the power of leverage and strategic asset deployment within the transparent world of blockchain. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, staying informed about such crucial movements will be key to understanding the broader market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Aave V3? Aave V3 is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on various blockchains.

How You Can Profit from What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/pain-coming-for-us-xrp-holders-how-you-can-profit-from-what-is-coming/,"Markets love drama, and right now XRP sits in the center of a story that mixes technical tension , big-money derivatives, and plain human emotion. Traders and holders are asking a single question: when the music stops, will you be the one left scrambling or the one stepping in with a plan? What Austin Hilton is flagging Crypto commentator Austin Hilton recently posted a video on X, warning that “we could have some pain coming for XRP” and tying that risk to broader Bitcoin price action and a major options expiry. Hilton’s message is not fearmongering; it’s a tactical observation — he points to tightening indicators and a looming options expiry that could amplify moves, and he plainly says he will “load up” if XRP retests lower prices. As of report time, XRP is trading around $2.74, having pulled back from earlier highs, and is currently showing a pattern of sideways movement with occasional price spikes. Those levels matter because support around the low-$2s would be a clear buying window for many spot buyers. Pain coming for us XRP Holders?! Find out what you can do about it! How you can PROFIT from what is coming! pic.twitter.com/tu6Xcb75Hh — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 25, 2025 Macro catalyst: Bitcoin and the options wall Hilton’s primary mechanism for the drop is not an XRP-specific event but a systemic one: Bitcoin weakness. Bitcoin has recently traded below $110,000 amid market deleveraging, and markets are braced for a roughly $22 billion crypto options expiry that commentators say could increase volatility and create directional squeezes. When BTC weakens sharply, altcoins, including XRP, often follow in the first wave of deleveraging. Why this can become a buying opportunity History shows that large expiries and short-term liquidations often produce “emotional sells” that leave quality projects cheaper for patient buyers. Analysts and outlets tracking the market note that this kind of spillover can push alts to test support before a resumed upside run; that context is exactly what Hilton is describing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market headlines and data also confirm recent weekly pullbacks across BTC, ETH, and XRP as investors unwind leveraged positions. Practical steps to profit (and protect) First, prepare capital: hold a planned allocation of stablecoins or fiat ready to deploy rather than attempting to time a panic with cash you don’t have. In addition, use staggered limit orders or dollar-cost averaging into predetermined support bands rather than market-panic buys; this smooths execution and reduces emotional mistakes. Also, set stop-loss rules for any short positions and avoid over-leveraging around known expiry dates. For traders comfortable with options, skewed implied volatility around expiries can create defined-risk opportunities (e.g., buying protective puts or selling covered calls), but only with strict position sizing and a firm understanding of Greeks. Finally, treat Hilton’s call as one input among many: combine it with on-chain flows, order-book depth, and your own risk plan before acting. Volatility is inevitable; being prepared is optional. If Hilton’s warning plays out, disciplined buyers who planned not in the heat of the moment are most likely to turn “pain” into profit.

The company is expanding its data capabilities and gearing up to introduce a new trading product on Solana, LYS Flash, aiming to optimize transaction execution. LYS Labs recently announced its seed round with participation from Alchemy Ventures, Auros Global, and Frachtis, among others, expanded its ecosystem through integrations with QuickNode , and joined the Chainlink Build on Solana Program . The company has also launched new developer-facing initiatives that are already driving significant traction. Phase 1 of LYS Development has been completed, with its ultra-low latency, structured Solana data now available to the public. Additionally, its aggregated data is in testnet with a few selected partners. For Phase 2, LYS Labs will release a new product that complements its stack, aimed at Solana traders. Execution on Solana can be complex: every DEX has its own contract quirks, associated token account logic, and fee structures. Priority fees, bribes, and MEV protection require careful tuning to avoid failed transactions or suboptimal fills. LYS Flash smart relay engine abstracts this complexity away, enabling machines to get from signal to settlement in under 36 milliseconds. QuickNode Integration: Latency as Low as 14ms As part of Phase 1, LYS Labs integrated with QuickNode Marketplace , where it now delivers structured Solana data with latency as low as 14 milliseconds. Traders and developers can access wallet flows, token insights, and liquidity events from Solana’s largest DEXes and launchpads like Meteora, Raydium, Pump, Bonk, and others directly through the QuickNode Marketplace. This gives builders near-real-time access to event-driven data pipelines, closing the gap between analysis and execution. Chainlink Build on Solana LYS Labs is also joining the Chainlink Build on Solana Program , a Chainlink initiative focused on builders on Solana . By collaborating with Chainlink, LYS Labs gains enhanced technical support, cryptoeconomic security, and access to new dApp integrations. Andra Nicolau, LYS Labs co-founder commented: “We are very lucky to have such a great and supportive team at Chainlink Labs helping us accelerate our vision. We’ve only joined a few weeks ago, and we are already seeing massive value added through our collaboration with them. We have an exciting integration roadmap ahead and believe our synergies can change the game for their Solana efforts”. Developer Ecosystem Momentum The launch of the LYS Developer Portal and LYS Builders Program has generated strong early traction, with hundreds of developers gaining direct access to APIs, structured datasets, and community support. In its first month alone, LYS Labs recorded over 620 active users, 16B events processed and, and 14+ TB of data transferred, a strong signal of market demand for structured blockchain data on Solana. Demand for LYS Flash is also lining up. Leadership with Proven Impact LYS Labs co-founder, Marian Oancea , a veteran builder who coded the original Ethereum crowdsale contract in 2014 and later developed Ethstats.dev to make Ethereum’s state more transparent. Reflecting on his journey, Marian commented: “We started off attempting to make Solana’s data usable. Given the large number of transactions per block, it is difficult for most users to access clean, useful data so we wanted to fix that as a first step. Organically, once you have near-instant alpha, the immediate thing you want to do is execute, which is why we are building LYS Flash, which can land transactions in 1ms, and users will be able to get from alpha to settlement in 36ms.” The Operating System for Internet Capital Markets LYS Labs’ mission is to become the operating system for the machines powering automated global finance . It’s stack transforms raw blockchain events into contextualized, AI-ready insights and optimizes execution, thus enabling traders, protocols, and autonomous agents to execute strategies at the speed of the chain. By delivering consistency, semantic structure, and reliability at scale, LYS Labs is laying the foundation for the next generation of programmable finance. About LYS Labs LYS Labs is building the operating system that powers automated global finance on Solana, featuring contextualized AI-ready insights and a smart execution engine.

This development marks a significant moment for Solana, a high-performance blockchain, and signals a growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. Investors and enthusiasts are watching closely to understand the potential ramifications of such a fund hitting the market. Unpacking VanEck’s Latest SOL Spot ETF Filing What exactly does VanEck’s updated S-1 filing for a SOL spot ETF mean? An S-1 filing is a preliminary registration statement required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for new securities. In simple terms, it’s the first step a company takes when it wants to offer new shares or, in this case, a new exchange-traded fund to the public. A spot ETF, unlike a futures ETF, directly holds the underlying asset – in this case, Solana (SOL). This structure means the fund’s value closely tracks the actual market price of SOL, providing investors with direct exposure without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. VanEck’s move suggests a serious intent to bring this product to market, following the successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. Why is a Solana Spot ETF a Game-Changer for Investors? The introduction of a SOL spot ETF could revolutionize how traditional investors access the Solana ecosystem. Currently, investing in SOL often involves navigating crypto exchanges, managing digital wallets, and understanding complex security protocols. An ETF simplifies this process dramatically. Consider these key benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: Investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through standard brokerage accounts, just like stocks or other traditional assets. This eliminates many technical barriers. Increased Liquidity: ETFs typically offer high liquidity, allowing investors to enter and exit positions easily throughout the trading day. Regulatory Clarity: An SEC-approved ETF operates within a regulated framework, potentially offering more security and investor protection compared to direct crypto purchases. Institutional Adoption: The availability of a regulated investment product can attract more institutional capital, which often requires regulated avenues for investment. This increased institutional interest could bring significant capital inflows into the Solana market, potentially fostering greater stability and growth. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape for a SOL Spot ETF The path to approval for any cryptocurrency spot ETF in the U.S. is notoriously challenging. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, the recent approvals of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs suggest a shifting regulatory stance. VanEck, a prominent asset manager, has extensive experience navigating these regulatory waters. Their updated S-1 filing indicates they are actively addressing the SEC’s requirements and concerns. The approval process involves rigorous scrutiny of the fund’s structure, custody arrangements, and market surveillance mechanisms. Success here could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs. What Could a SOL Spot ETF Mean for Solana’s Future? An approved SOL spot ETF would likely have a profound impact on Solana’s ecosystem. It could: Boost Price Discovery: With more traditional investors participating, the market for SOL could become more efficient and transparent, leading to better price discovery. Drive Network Development: Increased investment could provide more resources for developers building on Solana, fostering innovation and expanding its utility. Legitimize Solana: An ETF stamp of approval from the SEC would lend significant credibility to Solana as a serious and viable blockchain platform, attracting more users and enterprises. This move by VanEck is not just about a new financial product; it’s about further integrating Solana into the broader financial world, potentially unlocking new growth phases for the entire ecosystem. In conclusion, VanEck’s updated S-1 filing for a SOL spot ETF represents a pivotal moment for Solana and the wider cryptocurrency market. While challenges remain, the potential benefits for accessibility, liquidity, and institutional adoption are immense. This development underscores the ongoing maturation of digital assets and their increasing integration into traditional investment portfolios, paving the way for a more inclusive financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a SOL spot ETF? A SOL spot ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Solana (SOL) as its underlying asset. Its price aims to track the real-time market price of SOL, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning the cryptocurrency. How does a SOL spot ETF differ from a SOL futures ETF? A spot ETF holds the actual cryptocurrency, while a futures ETF invests in futures contracts that speculate on the future price of the cryptocurrency. Spot ETFs typically offer more direct price exposure to the underlying asset. What are the main benefits of investing in a SOL spot ETF? Key benefits include easier access through traditional brokerage accounts, increased liquidity, potential for greater investor protection due to regulatory oversight, and attracting institutional investment. What are the challenges for a SOL spot ETF getting approved? The primary challenges involve meeting the U.S. SEC’s concerns regarding market manipulation, investor protection, and ensuring robust surveillance mechanisms are in place within the underlying crypto market. How might a SOL spot ETF impact Solana’s price? An approved SOL spot ETF could potentially increase demand for SOL, leading to higher trading volumes, improved liquidity, and a positive impact on its market price due to increased institutional and retail investment.

This claim is based on a list of assets Sun's team shared with Bloomberg. The Tron network, led by Sun, has become a prominent global payments system. By enabling fast, cheap, and anonymous cross-border money transfers through dollar-backed stablecoins, Tron has reached a monthly transaction volume of $600 billion. This figure is more than four times PayPal's volume. Meanwhile, as some allies in Washington are pushing for regulations that will pave the way for Tron's further expansion in the US, the Trump family is also promoting their own stablecoin project using Tron's infrastructure. However, the Tron network has long been mired in controversy. Money laundering experts allege that the platform has become a payment network favored by terrorist organizations, Russian sanctions evasion groups, and Chinese criminal groups operating large-scale fraud. Sun maintains that it helps authorities block illegal transactions but claims it bears no direct responsibility due to the network's decentralized nature. Related News: Giant Ethereum Whale That Has Been Sleeping for Years Has Woken Up - Here Are Its Transactions and Other Whale Movements The controversy escalated further with a valuation published by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index in August. The index claimed Sun held 60 billion TRX, based on wealth calculations he shared in February, putting his net worth at $12.5 billion. Sun filed a lawsuit in federal court in Delaware challenging this report. Sun's lawyers argued that the list shared with Bloomberg erroneously included ecosystem wallets not owned by Sun, arguing that Sun does not control the majority of the Tron supply. However, Sun's lawyers declined to specify which wallets were not owned by him, Bloomberg reported in a court filing. On September 22, a court rejected the Sun's request for an injunction to block the story. The case is still ongoing. *This is not investment advice.

As the US Dollar braces for what appears to be a winning week, all eyes are fixated on the impending Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data. This crucial economic release isn’t just another number; it’s a potential game-changer, poised to influence everything from global trade to your crypto portfolio. How will this data shape the future of the Forex market and the broader economic narrative? The US Dollar ‘s Ascent: What’s Driving Its Strength? The US Dollar has been on a remarkable run, positioning itself for a winning week against a basket of major currencies. This strength isn’t accidental; it’s a confluence of several powerful macroeconomic forces. Investors often flock to the dollar during times of global uncertainty, viewing it as a safe haven asset. When geopolitical tensions rise or concerns about a global economic slowdown emerge, the dollar typically benefits as capital flows into what is perceived as a more stable and liquid market. One of the primary drivers behind the dollar’s recent resilience is the interest rate differential. The Federal Reserve , unlike many of its global counterparts, has pursued an aggressive monetary tightening policy over the past year. Higher interest rates in the U.S. make dollar-denominated assets, such as Treasury bonds, more attractive to international investors. This increased demand for dollar assets translates into a stronger currency. Furthermore, economic data out of the U.S., while showing some signs of cooling, has generally remained more robust than in other major economies like Europe or China, further bolstering the dollar’s appeal. Consider the following factors contributing to the dollar’s strength: Safe-Haven Demand: Global economic slowdown fears and geopolitical instability push investors towards the perceived safety of the dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve make dollar assets more attractive compared to those in other major economies. Relative Economic Strength: The U.S. economy, despite challenges, often shows more resilience compared to its global peers, attracting capital. Liquidity: The dollar remains the world’s most liquid currency, making it easy for large institutions to move in and out of positions. Why is PCE Data So Crucial for the Markets? While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) often grabs headlines, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is the Federal Reserve ‘s preferred measure of inflation trends . This distinction is vital for understanding monetary policy and market reactions. The PCE data, particularly the ‘core’ PCE which excludes volatile food and energy prices, provides a more comprehensive and stable picture of underlying inflationary pressures. Why does the Fed prefer PCE? It’s primarily because PCE covers a broader range of goods and services than CPI, and it accounts for changes in consumer behavior, such as substituting cheaper alternatives when prices rise. This makes it a more accurate reflection of what consumers are actually paying. When the PCE data is released, economists and traders scrutinize it for any signs of accelerating or decelerating inflation, as this directly influences the Fed’s decisions on interest rates. Market expectations leading up to the PCE release are always high. Analysts forecast the month-over-month and year-over-year changes, and any deviation from these expectations can trigger significant market volatility. A higher-than-expected PCE reading could signal persistent inflation, potentially prompting the Fed to maintain or even increase interest rates, thereby strengthening the US Dollar further. Conversely, a lower-than-expected reading might suggest inflation is cooling, opening the door for a more dovish stance from the Fed and potentially weakening the dollar. Key aspects of PCE data : Fed’s Preferred Metric: Provides a more holistic view of inflation, guiding monetary policy. Broader Coverage: Includes a wider array of goods and services compared to CPI. Consumer Behavior Adjustment: Accounts for changes in spending patterns, making it a more accurate measure. Core PCE Focus: Excludes volatile items (food and energy) to reveal underlying inflation trends. Navigating the Forex Market : Impact of a Strong Dollar The Forex market , the world’s largest and most liquid financial market, is directly and profoundly affected by movements in the US Dollar . A strong dollar has a ripple effect across all major currency pairs and can significantly impact global trade dynamics, commodity prices, and the profitability of multinational corporations. For instance, when the dollar strengthens, it makes U.S. exports more expensive for international buyers, potentially reducing demand. Conversely, it makes imports into the U.S. cheaper, which can help alleviate domestic inflationary pressures but might hurt local industries. Consider the major currency pairs. A strong dollar typically means a weaker Euro (EUR/USD), Japanese Yen (USD/JPY moving higher), and British Pound (GBP/USD). This is because it takes fewer dollars to buy these other currencies, or more of these currencies to buy a single dollar. For emerging market economies, a strong dollar can be particularly challenging. Many emerging market governments and corporations borrow in dollars, and a stronger dollar makes these dollar-denominated debts more expensive to service in their local currencies, increasing the risk of financial instability. Furthermore, commodity prices, often denominated in dollars, tend to fall when the dollar strengthens. This is because it takes fewer dollars to buy the same amount of a commodity, making it cheaper for non-dollar buyers. This dynamic is especially relevant for oil, gold, and other raw materials, and can have significant implications for countries that are net exporters or importers of these commodities. The interplay between the US Dollar and these various segments of the Forex market creates a complex web of economic consequences that investors must carefully monitor. Key impacts on the Forex market : Currency Pair/Asset Impact of Strong US Dollar Explanation EUR/USD Typically falls Euro becomes relatively cheaper against the stronger dollar. USD/JPY Typically rises More Japanese Yen needed to buy one US Dollar. Emerging Market Currencies Weakens Increased cost of servicing dollar-denominated debt, capital outflows. Commodities (e.g., Oil, Gold) Prices tend to fall Become more expensive for non-dollar buyers, reducing demand. U.S. Exports More expensive Reduces demand for U.S. goods and services abroad. The Federal Reserve ‘s Dilemma: Balancing Inflation Trends and Growth The Federal Reserve stands at a critical juncture, navigating the delicate balance between controlling stubborn inflation trends and fostering sustainable economic growth. The upcoming PCE data will be a pivotal piece of information for the central bank as it deliberates its next moves on interest rates. The Fed’s dual mandate is to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability. When inflation runs hot, as it has been, the Fed’s primary tool is to raise interest rates, making borrowing more expensive and thereby slowing down economic activity to cool price pressures. However, aggressive rate hikes carry the risk of tipping the economy into a recession, leading to job losses and reduced economic output. This is the dilemma the Federal Reserve faces. If the PCE data shows that inflation is still elevated and not trending downwards towards the Fed’s 2% target, it could reinforce the argument for further monetary tightening. Conversely, if PCE indicates a significant slowdown in price increases, it might give the Fed more room to pause or even consider cutting rates in the future, easing the pressure on the economy. The market closely watches the Fed’s rhetoric and projections, particularly the ‘dot plot’ which illustrates policymakers’ expectations for future interest rates. Any hawkish signals – indications that the Fed is prepared to continue raising rates – tend to strengthen the US Dollar and put downward pressure on risk assets, including equities and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, dovish signals – suggesting a more accommodative stance – can weaken the dollar and provide a tailwind for riskier investments. The Fed’s decisions are not just about numbers; they are about managing expectations and guiding the economy through turbulent waters, with PCE data serving as a critical compass. Unpacking Inflation Trends : What PCE Data Tells Us About Price Stability Understanding inflation trends is paramount for investors, businesses, and consumers alike. The PCE data offers one of the clearest lenses through which to view these trends, providing insights into the persistence and breadth of price increases across the economy. For the past couple of years, inflation has been a dominant concern, driven by supply chain disruptions, strong consumer demand, and geopolitical events. While some indicators, like energy prices, have shown signs of cooling, core inflation (which PCE focuses on) has often remained stubbornly high, reflecting ongoing price pressures in services and other non-volatile sectors. When the latest PCE data is released, analysts will be looking for several key signals: Directional Movement: Is inflation accelerating, decelerating, or plateauing? A clear trend towards the Federal Reserve ‘s 2% target would be a welcome sign. Breadth of Price Increases: Are price increases concentrated in a few sectors, or are they widespread across the economy? Widespread inflation is more concerning. Comparison to Expectations: How does the actual data compare to market forecasts? Significant surprises can lead to sharp market reactions. Core vs. Headline: The ‘core’ PCE, excluding food and energy, often provides a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures that are less susceptible to transient shocks. The insights derived from PCE data help shape future economic projections. If inflation proves more persistent than anticipated, it could necessitate a longer period of restrictive monetary policy, impacting everything from borrowing costs to investment returns. Conversely, evidence of rapidly cooling inflation might allow the Federal Reserve to pivot towards a more growth-supportive stance. For the Forex market , clearer signs on inflation trends translate directly into expectations for central bank policy, influencing currency valuations and capital flows globally. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders Given the pivotal role of the US Dollar and impending PCE data , what does this mean for your investment strategy, especially in the interconnected world of traditional finance and crypto? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Dollar Strength: A strong dollar can put pressure on commodity prices and potentially dampen demand for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. If you’re holding dollar-denominated assets, this is a positive, but for international investors, it might reduce purchasing power for U.S. assets. Watch Fed Commentary Closely: Post-PCE, listen intently to statements from the Federal Reserve . Their forward guidance on interest rates will be crucial. Any hint of a more hawkish or dovish stance will directly impact market sentiment. Diversify Your Portfolio: In times of uncertainty and fluctuating currency strength, diversification remains key. Consider a mix of assets that can perform well in different economic scenarios. Assess Inflation Trends: Pay attention to the core PCE data as it gives a clearer picture of underlying inflation. Persistent high inflation could mean continued pressure on real returns for certain asset classes. Impact on Crypto: While not directly tied, macroeconomic factors like dollar strength and interest rate expectations often influence crypto markets. A strong dollar and higher interest rates can sometimes draw liquidity away from speculative assets. Concluding Thoughts: The Dollar’s Path and PCE’s Guiding Hand The US Dollar ‘s impressive run towards a winning week underscores its enduring role as a global economic bellwether. However, the true test of its trajectory, and indeed the broader market’s direction, hinges significantly on the upcoming PCE data . This critical inflation gauge will provide invaluable insights into the underlying health of the U.S. economy and the future path of the Federal Reserve ‘s monetary policy. For participants in the Forex market and beyond, understanding these intricate connections is not just academic; it’s essential for navigating the complex financial landscape. Whether the PCE data confirms a cooling of inflation trends or signals persistent price pressures, its implications will reverberate through currency markets, equity valuations, and even the sentiment around digital assets. As we await this decisive economic release, the financial world remains on high alert, poised to react to the numbers that will help shape the immediate future of global finance.

The company has long been preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), but the listing has now been postponed to 2026, Fortune reported. Despite the delay, the move cements Kraken’s position among the strongest crypto exchanges preparing to go public. Rapid Expansion and Big Deals While its recognition may trail competitor Coinbase, Kraken has carved out a reputation among professional traders and institutional investors. Over 2024–2025, the exchange has been on an aggressive expansion drive, securing new products, markets, and high-profile acquisitions. In one of its boldest moves, Kraken spent $1.5 billion to acquire NinjaTrader, a leading trading platform with more than 2 million users. Co-CEO Arjun Sethi called it “the largest transaction ever combining traditional finance and crypto markets.” The deal demonstrates Kraken’s ambition to bridge traditional finance and blockchain technology on a global scale. Kraken also introduced xStocks , its tokenized shares platform featuring Apple, Tesla, and other leading companies. Demand for these tokenized assets has surged, particularly in markets like South Africa where traditional brokerage fees exceed 10% per transaction. Strong Financials but Leadership Changes Financially, Kraken remains robust. In Q2 2025, the exchange recorded $411 million in revenue and nearly $80 million in EBITDA profit, keeping it profitable during expansion. However, internal changes have raised questions about the timing of its IPO. Since co-founder Jesse Powell stepped down in 2022, Sethi and Dave Ripley have taken over, with Sethi emerging as the key decision-maker. His arrival brought a series of management exits, including the CTO, COO, and legal counsel. Kraken insists these shifts were strategic restructuring moves. The IPO Path Forward The wider crypto market is enjoying a surge of IPO activity, with Circle, Gemini, and Bullish successfully going public. Kraken’s decision to push its IPO to 2026 comes with risks, particularly if market conditions weaken. Yet investors remain optimistic thanks to its institutional-first approach. “Our model is built on professional traders and institutions. Kraken Pro, our robust API, and streamlined interfaces make us the go-to exchange not for flash, but for execution and liquidity,” Sethi said. With $500 million in fresh funding and a $15 billion valuation, Kraken is betting its long-term strategy will pay off when it finally steps onto Wall Street.",News|Business,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-26 16:55:17

Both projects showcase how technical patterns and ecosystem activity drive speculative moves across the market. But beyond these plays, BlockDAG (BDAG) is reshaping expectations by blending measurable adoption with mainstream recognition. With over $410 million raised, Seattle sports sponsorships, and real-world miner deployments, it stands out not just as a presale leader but as the best crypto to invest in now. Shiba Inu’s Consolidation Shapes a Strong Price Prediction Shiba Inu (SHIB) price prediction has drawn attention as the token consolidates after recent volatility. According to AMBCrypto , SHIB has defended its $0.0000078 support, signalling a base for a potential bullish move. Analysts suggest that a breakout from this consolidation could lead to retests of the $0.000010 zone, setting the stage for upside momentum. The SHIB price prediction narrative is also supported by its ecosystem growth. The Shibarium Layer-2 continues to record increased daily transactions, while burn rates remain steady, gradually reducing supply. If market sentiment improves, SHIB could aim for a 20% to 30% rally in the coming weeks. Despite its meme coin origins, SHIB has maintained its relevance due to its massive holder base and integration into DeFi activity. This mix of technical structure and ecosystem progress keeps SHIB among the top cryptos to invest in now. Avalanche Token Analysis Points Toward Bullish Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) token analysis shows the asset holding firm near key support zones while preparing for a breakout. CaptainAltcoin reports that AVAX’s consolidation pattern around $40 indicates strength, with projections targeting $55–$60 in the medium term. Analysts argue that strong network participation and DeFi adoption could reinforce this bullish scenario. AVAX token analysis also highlights the role of Avalanche’s subnets. These scaling solutions are driving activity across DeFi protocols, gaming, and institutional projects. With total value locked (TVL) showing resilience, Avalanche continues to differentiate itself as a high-performance blockchain with significant real-world applications. If AVAX breaks above resistance, bullish continuation could attract new inflows, further fueling the token’s upward move. While risks remain tied to broader market trends, Avalanche’s technical setup and ecosystem fundamentals place it firmly among the top cryptos to invest in now. BlockDAG’s Seattle Sponsorships and Ecosystem Growth Cement Its Strength BlockDAG (BDAG) is proving its ability to move beyond promises by delivering tangible progress that underscores why it is the best crypto to invest in now. The project has raised more than $410 million, placing it at the forefront of 2025’s presale market. This funding success signals broad investor confidence in its vision. One of BlockDAG’s standout moves is its Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas sports partnerships, which embed its brand into global sporting culture. These sponsorships provide visibility across North America and Asia, highlighting BDAG as a project bridging blockchain and mainstream audiences. At the same time, BlockDAG is expanding its ecosystem with practical adoption tools. Its X1 mobile app miner and X10 hardware demo confirmed real-time production of 200 BDAG daily, showing that mining is not just accessible but scalable. With over 26.5 billion coins sold and 20k miners shipped, adoption is underway well before listing. The Dashboard V4 has also transformed the presale experience, functioning like a live exchange with wallet balances, referral tracking, and real-time data. This transparency and usability separate BDAG from traditional presales that offer little visibility. By combining global sponsorships, real adoption, and exchange readiness, BlockDAG positions itself not just as a presale project but as a long-term ecosystem leader, making it one of the top crypto coins right now. Final Words Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows resilience by consolidating and preparing for a breakout, while Avalanche (AVAX) demonstrates technical momentum supported by ecosystem fundamentals. Both tokens offer upside potential, but they remain tied to market sentiment and speculative cycles. BlockDAG (BDAG), in contrast, delivers measurable execution. With over $410 million raised, Seattle sports sponsorships, miner adoption, and Dashboard V4 transparency, it is already creating value before hitting exchanges. This blend of financial strength, real-world branding, and ecosystem delivery makes BDAG a clear frontrunner. For investors weighing top crypto to invest in now, the conclusion is straightforward: SHIB and AVAX provide opportunities, but BlockDAG offers execution and visibility that make it the stronger long-term choice.

Among these, Polkadot stands out, often hailed as a foundational layer for the next generation of the internet – Web3 . Many investors and enthusiasts are keenly watching its trajectory, asking the crucial question: what does the future hold for Polkadot Price Prediction ? Specifically, will the DOT Price finally cross the significant $10 mark and continue its ascent in the years leading up to 2030? This comprehensive guide delves into the intricate factors shaping Polkadot’s potential, offering insights into its long-term viability and market performance, helping you navigate the complex landscape of Cryptocurrency Price Prediction . What is Polkadot and Why Does it Matter for Web3? Polkadot is not just another blockchain; it’s an ambitious project designed to create a truly interoperable and scalable decentralized web. Conceived by Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot aims to solve the major challenges facing existing blockchains: isolation, scalability, and upgradeability. It does this through a unique architecture that allows various blockchains, known as parachains, to connect to a central Relay Chain, sharing security and enabling seamless communication. This fundamental design positions Polkadot as a critical infrastructure layer for the evolving Web3 ecosystem. Interoperability: Polkadot allows different blockchains to transfer messages and value in a trust-free manner, fostering a network of specialized chains. Scalability: By enabling multiple parachains to process transactions in parallel, Polkadot significantly boosts the network’s throughput. Shared Security: All connected parachains benefit from the robust security of the Relay Chain, eliminating the need for each chain to establish its own security. Upgradeability: Polkadot’s on-chain governance allows for forkless upgrades, meaning the network can evolve and adapt without disruptive splits. These features make Polkadot a compelling platform for developers building decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and entire new blockchain economies. Its vision for a multi-chain future is central to understanding its potential impact on the broader Cryptocurrency Price Prediction landscape. Understanding the Core Technology Driving Polkadot’s Value To truly grasp the potential of Polkadot, it’s essential to look under the hood at its innovative architecture. The ecosystem comprises several key components that work in harmony to deliver its promised functionality. The Relay Chain: This is the heart of Polkadot, responsible for the network’s shared security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability. It processes a limited number of transaction types, focusing on coordinating the entire system. Parachains: These are independent blockchains with their own specific functionalities, tokens, and governance models. They connect to the Relay Chain and benefit from its security. Parachains can be optimized for various use cases, from DeFi and NFTs to gaming and supply chain management. Parathreads: Similar to parachains but with a pay-as-you-go model, allowing smaller projects to access Polkadot’s security without needing a full parachain slot. Bridges: These enable Polkadot to connect with external networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, further expanding its reach and utility within the broader crypto space. The continuous development and expansion of this technological framework are crucial for the long-term success and adoption of Polkadot . Each new parachain launch, each successful bridge integration, adds value and utility to the network, directly influencing the long-term Polkadot Price Prediction . Historical Performance: A Glimpse at Past DOT Price Movements Understanding where Polkadot has been can offer context for where it might go. DOT, the native token of Polkadot, has experienced significant volatility since its launch, characteristic of the broader cryptocurrency market. Its journey has seen remarkable highs and challenging lows. Year Key Milestones Approximate DOT Price Range (USD) 2020 Mainnet Launch, Token Re-denomination $2.70 – $6.80 2021 Bull Run Peak, Parachain Auctions Begin $6.50 – $54.98 (All-Time High) 2022 Bear Market Contraction $4.20 – $20.00 2023 Market Recovery & Consolidation $4.50 – $9.00 The All-Time High (ATH) of nearly $55 in November 2021 showcased the immense market enthusiasm for Polkadot’s vision and technology. However, like many altcoins, the DOT Price retreated significantly during the subsequent bear market. Despite these fluctuations, Polkadot has maintained its position as a top-tier project by market capitalization, demonstrating resilience and continued developer activity. Analyzing these historical trends is a foundational step in any robust Cryptocurrency Price Prediction . Key Factors Influencing Polkadot Price Prediction Predicting the future price of any cryptocurrency, especially for a complex project like Polkadot, involves analyzing a multitude of factors. These range from broad market sentiment to specific technological advancements within the ecosystem. Market Dynamics and Broader Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Trends The overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market play a significant role in Polkadot’s performance. When Bitcoin experiences a bull run, altcoins like DOT often follow suit, albeit with higher volatility. Conversely, a bearish trend in Bitcoin can drag down the entire market. Macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability also influence investor appetite for risk assets like crypto. Understanding these broader trends is crucial for any accurate Cryptocurrency Price Prediction , including that of Polkadot. Technological Advancements and the Evolution of Polkadot Polkadot’s roadmap is continuously evolving. Major upgrades, successful implementation of new features, and the stability of its core technology are vital. The launch of new parachains, the development of innovative cross-chain communication protocols, and improvements in developer tooling all contribute to the network’s utility and attractiveness. Any significant technological breakthrough or, conversely, any major security flaw, can have a profound impact on the Polkadot Price Prediction . Adoption, Partnerships, and the Growth of the Web3 Ecosystem The true value of a blockchain platform lies in its adoption. The number of projects building on Polkadot, the active user base of its parachains, and strategic partnerships with established companies or other blockchain networks are key indicators. As more developers choose Polkadot for their Web3 projects, the demand for DOT (for staking, governance, and parachain slot auctions) naturally increases. This organic growth in adoption is a powerful driver for the DOT Price . Regulatory Landscape and Investor Sentiment Global regulatory developments can significantly impact the crypto market. Clear and favorable regulations can encourage institutional investment and mainstream adoption, while restrictive policies can create uncertainty and dampen investor enthusiasm. Additionally, overall investor sentiment – driven by news, social media trends, and market FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) – can cause rapid price swings for Polkadot. Polkadot Price Prediction 2025: What Can We Expect for DOT Price? As we look towards 2025, several factors suggest a potentially positive outlook for Polkadot Price Prediction . The crypto market often operates in cycles, and many analysts anticipate a renewed bull market following Bitcoin’s halving events. If this pattern holds, Polkadot is well-positioned to benefit from increased investor confidence and capital inflow. Continued Web3 Growth: By 2025, the Web3 ecosystem is expected to mature further, with more mainstream applications emerging. Polkadot’s role as a foundational layer for interoperability will become increasingly critical. Parachain Expansion: More parachain slots are likely to be filled, bringing diverse projects and increased utility to the network. This will drive demand for DOT for bonding and staking. Technological Stability: The core Polkadot network should be highly stable and robust, having weathered previous market cycles and undergoing continuous improvements. Considering these factors, a conservative Polkadot Price Prediction for 2025 could see DOT trading in a range of $8 to $15 . An optimistic scenario, driven by strong market momentum and significant adoption, could potentially push the DOT Price higher, possibly challenging its previous all-time highs. Polkadot Price Prediction 2026: Navigating Growth and Challenges Moving into 2026, the market might experience a period of consolidation or continued growth, depending on the intensity and duration of the preceding bull run. For Polkadot, sustained development and ecosystem expansion will be key to maintaining momentum. Competition: The interoperability space is competitive, with other projects vying for market share. Polkadot’s ability to innovate and attract developers will be crucial. Real-World Utility: By 2026, the focus will likely shift even more towards real-world applications and tangible benefits derived from Polkadot’s parachains. Projects demonstrating strong user adoption will boost the entire ecosystem. Scalability Solutions: Polkadot’s continued efforts to enhance scalability and transaction efficiency will be vital as network usage potentially grows. For 2026, a reasonable Polkadot Price Prediction might place DOT in the range of $12 to $25 . This forecast assumes continued progress in its technological roadmap and a healthy overall cryptocurrency market. The ability of Polkadot to differentiate itself and deliver on its promises will be paramount in this phase. Polkadot Price Prediction 2027-2030: Will DOT Price Soar Beyond $10? The long-term outlook for Polkadot Price Prediction , extending to 2030, depends heavily on its ability to solidify its position as a leading Web3 infrastructure. If Polkadot successfully becomes a cornerstone of the decentralized internet, its value proposition will be immense.

52300331,589983,1758906016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52300331.jpeg,Ethereum On-Exchange Holdings Falls To Multi-Year Low – Here’s How Much ETH Is Left,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-exchange-holdings-drop/,"In a shocking development, the price of Ethereum has fallen below the key $4,000 level as the ongoing bearish pressure in the broader crypto market intensifies. On-chain data shows that a notable portion of ETH is still being withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the face of the growing market volatility. Investors Are Still Withdrawing Ethereum From Exchanges Even though its price is heading downward , the on-chain dynamics of Ethereum are entering a striking new phase. A recent report reveals that the total balance of ETH on all cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped sharply to its lowest level in years. Shared by Coin Bureau on the social media platform X, this swift withdrawal of coins from centralized platforms highlights a clear shift toward long-term holding and self-custody among investors. Typically, such a trend is viewed as a sign of increasing confidence in ETH’s future trajectory. Since there are fewer tokens available for purchase in every crypto exchange in the ever-evolving sector, the market appears to be entering a tightening phase. This trend might increase the volatility and pave the way for more robust price reactions in the coming months. According to Coin Bureau, ETH’s total exchange balance has plunged by over 20% since July this year. After the persistent decline in inflows, the overall number of ETH present in exchanges is approximately 14.8 million ETH, which marks the lowest levels since 2016. In the midst of the fading Ethereum inflows to crypto exchanges, the ETH treasur y is growing rapidly as companies continue to acquire the leading altcoin. The ETH treasury growth is hinting at a potential supply shock in the near future. Francesco Andreoli, a developer and investor, highlighted that ETH is on a tear due to the notable growth of its treasury reserves among big companies. Within a two-month period, cryptocurrency treasuries holding ETH have soared from $2 billion to around $21 billion. This rise highlights ETH’s growing allure as a long-term strategic asset and the rapid diversification of treasuries into digital assets. Andreoli stated that the surge makes ETH the fastest-growing treasury asset in the crypto and financial sector. A Shift In Crypto Treasury Dominance Ethereum treasury’s significant growth has placed it ahead of Bitcoin treasuries , marking a turning point in the digital asset landscape. With this rise in treasury reserves, ETH is now carving out a dominant role, as institutional investors look beyond Bitcoin. Coin Bureau noted that Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) are now in control of 0.36% of the ETH supply in circulation, edging out that of BTC. Data shows that DATs are presently holding 0.35% of the BTC overall supply. Although the disparity in treasuries is tiny now, it is likely to become bigger in the near future. ETH’s outperformance may be bolstered by its utility-driven ecosystem, staking rewards, and deep integration across Decentralized Finance (DeFi).",Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury|btc|Coin Bureau|DATs|decentralized finance|DeFi|Digital Asset Treasuries|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Exchange Balance|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum treasury|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Francesco Andreoli,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 17:00:16

After a year of dramatic swings, the digital asset is hovering near key support levels, leaving investors debating whether this is a mere pause or the calm before a deeper storm. Technical analysts warn that when a market revisits a crucial price floor multiple times without a strong rebound, history often rewards caution. Current Market Snapshot XRP is trading in the mid-$2 range after repeated attempts to hold above the psychological $3 barrier. This consolidation follows an energetic rally earlier in the year, but momentum has cooled, and buyers are defending critical horizontal support levels that have been tested several times in recent weeks. Market data shows persistent selling pressure as traders weigh the strength of this support against broader crypto market sentiment. XRP has created a structure that commonly leads to a capitulation. pic.twitter.com/12MM4dTL2w — Blockchain Backer (@BCBacker) September 26, 2025 Blockchain Backer’s Warning Blockchain Backer, a respected chart analyst on X, has highlighted a striking technical formation that he believes “commonly leads to capitulation.” In a three-panel chart comparison, he placed XRP’s 2025 price action side by side with two historic breakdowns: XRP’s own 2021–2022 decline and Bitcoin’s 2018 bear market. Each example shows a long consolidation phase resting on a horizontal base, followed by a sharp, high-volume breakdown when that base finally failed. According to his analysis, XRP’s present structure closely mirrors those earlier patterns. Lessons from Past Market Cycles History provides sobering context. During 2021–2022, XRP’s value halved after breaking key support levels, with the price sinking below $0.50 as macroeconomic pressures and investor fatigue intensified. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin’s 2018 cycle followed a similar script: months of sideways action gave way to a dramatic sell-off that flushed out late buyers and set the stage for a multi-year bottom. These episodes underscore a core market principle—capitulation often arrives suddenly after long periods of apparent stability. What Capitulation Would Mean for XRP Capitulation is more than a price target; it’s a market event defined by panic selling, surging volume, and the mass triggering of stop-loss orders. For XRP holders, a capitulation move could mean a swift drop below established support zones before bargain hunters step in. While painful for short-term traders, such a washout can reset the market and create conditions for a healthier long-term rally once selling pressure exhausts itself. Navigating the Road Ahead Blockchain Backer’s analysis is not a prediction etched in stone but a cautionary roadmap. To manage risk, traders and investors should monitor volume near key support levels, practice disciplined position sizing, and set protective stops. Whether XRP holds firm or succumbs to a final shakeout, managing risk with clear strategies will matter more than betting on a single outcome. The market has spoken through patterns before—and if those patterns repeat, XRP could face a defining test in the weeks ahead.

According to the report, the project involves more than a dozen global banks, including BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, and is exploring the use of a stablecoin-like token for settlement. Exclusive @TheBigWhale_ SWIFT chooses Linea for blockchain testing According to information gathered with @BukovskiBuko3 , SWIFT and several major global banks (including BNP Paribas and BNY) have chosen @LineaBuild , the Ethereum layer 2 developed by @Consensys , to experiment… pic.twitter.com/EaWLg1IfKp — Grégory Raymond (@gregory_raymond) September 26, 2025 The trial marks a significant step for SWIFT, which connects over 11,000 financial institutions and processes billions of messages annually. Traditionally, SWIFT has functioned as a secure messaging service that transmits payment instructions between banks. SWIFT Blockchain Pilot With Ethereum Could Redefine International Payments Initial tests seek to focus on on-chain messaging and settlement functions, with the interbank stablecoin token serving as a model for how financial institutions could settle transactions directly on blockchain infrastructure. SWIFT has emphasized that this effort goes beyond transmitting digital cash transfers, expanding its role into comprehensive on-chain activities. The blockchain experiment seeks to extend this role into direct value transfer, potentially reducing reliance on multiple intermediaries and streamlining international settlements. Notably, Linea was selected for its zk-rollup technology, which provides low-cost, high-throughput transactions while retaining Ethereum’s security. Its design also emphasizes data privacy through advanced cryptographic proofs, a feature seen as essential for banks navigating strict compliance requirements. The experiment could take several months to materialize, but industry participants say it represents a major technological step forward for the interbank sector. A banking source described it as a “significant transformation” for international payments, which today remain dependent on intermediaries and cumbersome legacy infrastructure. The collaboration with Linea also builds on SWIFT’s earlier experiments in blockchain interoperability. In recent years, the network partnered with Chainlink to test cross-chain communication solutions. Interbank messaging system SWIFT has partnered with price oracle provider @chainlink ( #LINK ) to work on a proof-of-concept (POC) project which would allow traditional finance firms to transact across blockchain networks. https://t.co/Fp4SaoE6eF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 29, 2022 In August 2023, SWIFT published the results of a series of trials examining how tokenized value can be transferred across both public and private blockchains. At the time, the organization said the findings could help ease barriers that have slowed the expansion of tokenized asset markets, creating conditions for them to scale more efficiently on a global level as they continue to mature. For Ethereum, the project reinforces its central role in financial experimentation. Linea, launched by Consensys, is designed to scale Ethereum through zk-rollups, and its ecosystem is supported by the LINEA token, which rewards ETH stakers bridged onto the network. By leveraging Ethereum’s security while introducing cost-efficient settlement, the Layer 2 platform has positioned itself as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Banks and Big Tech Circle Stablecoin as Adoption Accelerates Stablecoins are moving from niche crypto instruments into the mainstream of global finance, with adoption accelerating across technology, payments, and banking. The market now exceeds $230 billion in value , led by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), according to Morningstar DBRS. Morningstar warns stablecoins could drain U.S. bank deposits & payment fees. $230B+ market now dominated by USDT & USDC. #Stablecoins #Banks https://t.co/nHvgcA3OME — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 19, 2025 Their rise has been fueled by speed and cost advantages: transactions settle instantly at minimal fees, compared with up to $50 and multi-day delays on traditional rails like SWIFT or wire transfers. Monthly volumes are surging. Chainalysis data shows USDT clearing over $1 trillion per month this year, while USDC peaked at more than $3 trillion in activity last October. Regulation is also reshaping the sector. Following the U.S. passage of its first federal stablecoin law in July , banks are weighing launches of their own tokens. Analysts warn that widespread use could divert deposits and payment revenues away from traditional banks, with the Bank for International Settlements noting stablecoins already account for 1.5% of U.S. deposits. Big tech is taking notice. Apple, Airbnb, Uber, and X have all held early talks on stablecoin integration , while Google Cloud has already accepted PYUSD payments. On September 16, Google announced a new AI-focused payment framework supporting stablecoins alongside card networks, developed with Coinbase and the Ethereum Foundation. Google announced stablecoin support for its new AI payment framework, partnering with Coinbase and Ethereum Foundation to enable seamless AI agent transactions. #Google #Stablecoin https://t.co/lV1fPydukF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 16, 2025 Institutional infrastructure is expanding in parallel. Fireblocks, a crypto services firm valued at $8 billion, has launched a stablecoin payments network with more than 40 participants, including Circle and Stripe-owned Bridge. The system supports multiple stablecoins and is designed for enterprise cross-border transactions, with pilots underway in Japan. Together, these moves point to a financial system where dollar-pegged digital tokens operate alongside, and potentially in competition with, legacy banking rails.

The decision came Thursday, as China’s Ministry of Commerce confirmed it would probe not only Mexico’s 50% tariff on Chinese cars, but also a list of other new trade measures. The same day, China opened an anti-dumping case into Mexican pecan nuts, accusing exporters of selling them at unfairly low prices. This is one of Beijing’s strongest actions yet aimed at countries helping the U.S. clamp down on Chinese trade. The announcement followed a proposed bill in Mexico that would raise import tariffs on more than 1,400 products, including steel, textiles, and vehicles. All countries that lack a trade deal with Mexico would be affected, but China was the clear target. According to the Financial Times , China’s Ministry of Commerce said the proposed tariffs “will seriously damage the trade and investment interests of Chinese companies.” The investigation is being handled under Chinese law intended to maintain what the ministry called “foreign trade order.” Mexico sets higher tariffs while trying to downplay conflict Earlier this month, Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum publicly downplayed the friction. “We have a very good relationship with China, and we want to keep having a good relationship with them,” Claudia said, insisting that the tariffs were about protecting local industries, not provoking a global fight. But those words did little to slow Beijing. The timing of the tariffs, just months before the scheduled 2026 review of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, only added fuel to the backlash. China is the top vehicle exporter to Mexico, which makes the 50% car tariff especially sensitive. The decision follows mounting pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration is pushing allies to isolate China economically. Mexico relies heavily on trade with the U.S., sending more than 80% of its exports across the northern border. That dependence makes Mexico vulnerable to U.S. demands—including on immigration, investment policy, and cross-border trade. U.S. officials have repeatedly accused China of using Mexico as a route to dodge American tariffs. Beijing, in response, is now looking closely at what it describes as “other trade and investment restrictive measures” by Mexico in recent years. A particular point of concern is Mexico’s plan to roll out a new national security screening mechanism, similar to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, that would increase scrutiny of Chinese capital and business operations inside Mexico. China hits back with anti-dumping pecan probe and trade warning The trade ministry in Beijing also opened a year-long anti-dumping probe into Mexican pecan exports. Officials said there was “evidence” that Mexico had been selling pecans into China at prices below fair market value, which triggered a flood of imports and lower prices. The case could be extended by another six months if needed. Even though pecans are a tiny part of the overall trade relationship, Beijing chose them carefully. Mexico exported about $5.7 billion worth of goods to China last year. By contrast, China shipped roughly $115 billion to Mexico. While China has limited direct leverage, it’s shown in past disputes, such as those involving Europe’s pork industry, that it doesn’t need massive trade volume to apply painful pressure. Over 40% of Mexican exports to China are made up of copper, minerals, and concentrates, which are not covered by the new trade actions. But even a small sector like pecans gives Beijing an opening to retaliate, make a public point, and draw global attention to what it sees as unfair treatment. In a separate statement, China’s Ministry of Commerce warned that, “If Mexico’s unilateral tariff increase is implemented, it will harm the interests of relevant trading partners, including China.” They also stated, “All countries should jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and should never sacrifice third-party interests due to coercion from others.” Get seen where it counts.

From Dogecoin’s run in 2021 to Shiba Inu’s historic $40 billion peak, investors have seen small amounts of capital turn into life-changing sums. Attention is shifting to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a meme coin with real utility and long-term plans. Currently priced at $0.0022 in Stage 13 of its presale, the token has already raised over $25.9 million and secured listings on CoinMarketCap. For those wondering what an $800 investment today could look like by 2026, the numbers may point to an exciting future. Understanding LILPEPE’s Growth Potential LILPEPE is not just another meme coin chasing viral attention. The PEPE Launchpad is at the center of its roadmap, a platform designed to incubate and sustain new meme-based projects. This utility-first approach ensures that the ecosystem continues to attract activity, keeping demand alive long after its presale ends. Unlike tokens that spike and vanish, LILPEPE aims to maintain steady relevance by positioning itself as the dedicated Layer-2 network for meme coins. With zero trading tax, sniper-bot resistance, and ultra-low fees, LILPEPE makes trading fair for both small retail buyers and large investors. This structure sets it apart from traditional meme coins, lending it real-world utility and cultural relevance. The tokenomics of LILPEPE were designed to encourage long-term holding and adoption. Its total supply is 100 billion tokens, distributed across presale, staking rewards, marketing, liquidity, and exchange reserves. The absence of buy and sell taxes makes it attractive to traders who value liquidity without extra costs. This accessibility has already been proven during its presale, where more than 15 billion tokens have been sold. Investors who got in at the beginning, when the price was $0.001, have already made more than 120% on paper. The listing price is $0.003, so anybody buying the cryptocurrency before it goes live on exchanges will benefit immediately. Security remains a big concern in the meme coin space, and LILPEPE has addressed it directly. For investors to trust the smart contract, the project passed a Certik audit. Its transparency distinguishes it from riskier enterprises that fail under investigation. The cryptocurrency has also been featured on CoinMarketCap. These milestones demonstrate respectability and seriousness, rare with meme coins. What $800 could become by 2026 For $800 invested in LILPEPE at $0.0022, investors would obtain 363,636 tokens. This would be worth $1,090 at the listed price of $0.003, a rapid gain before market exposure. Looking ahead, estimates are much more convincing. Utility, viral promotions, and Tier-1 exchange listings push LILPEPE to $0.50–$1.00 by 2026. The $800 investment would be worth $181,000 at $0.50 and $363,000 at $1.00. Some optimistic projections suggest a $2–$3 price range if viral adoption and large partnerships occur. The $800 investment might yield $727,000 to $1,090,000, emulating SHIB and DOGE’s spectacular runs. How to join the presale Getting into the LILPEPE presale is straightforward. Investors need a wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet connected to the Ethereum network. Payments can be made with ETH or USDT, and tokens appear on the Little Pepe dashboard, claimable once the presale ends. The presale also includes the $777,000 giveaway , where 10 winners will each take home $77,000 worth of LILPEPE. This campaign has driven community engagement, with thousands of participants completing social tasks and presale buys to qualify. Stage 13 still offers a price below the listing level of $0.003 for those entering now. Conclusion Meme culture meets real innovation with Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . The project’s Certik audit, CoinMarketCap listing, equitable tokenomics, and ecosystem-driven plan ensure long-term relevance. Depending on adoption and exchange growth, a $800 presale investment might be worth hundreds of thousands by 2026. The combination of utility, security, and cultural momentum gives LILPEPE a unique place among upcoming meme tokens. For investors hoping to catch the next wave before it breaks, LILPEPE presents a rare opportunity to get in early.

The global crypto market capitalization shrank 2% to $3.74 trillion as most coins inched towards oversold territory and liquidations rose. While Solana, XRP and BNB wavered, altcoins like Mantle, Hyperliquid, and Aethir bucked the trend, posting impressive gains. Here’s a brief overview of the crypto market today. Bitcoin retreats below $110k Bitcoin slipped to $108,713, marking a 2% decline in the past 24 hours as price failed to hold above $110,000. The 5.5% dip in the past week means the benchmark digital asset continues to struggle near its lowest level in over three weeks. The drop coincided with the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index falling to 28 , with overriding sentiment now in fear territory as investors show caution. Technical indicators however suggest BTC is nearing oversold territory with the Relative Strength Index at 35. If Bitcoin holds above $109,200, it could rebound toward $112,000.

Ethereum’s struggle under $3,900 Ethereum dropped below $3,900 to touch lows of $3,829 per CoinMarketCap. While the price hovered around $3,950 at the time of writing, it showed a 2% decrease in 24 hours. Over the week, Ether’s price decline has been intensified by ETF outflows and whale selling. For instance, one whale swapped significant BTC for ETH on Hyperliquid, contributing to volatility. Technical analysis warns of further risks if ETH fails to reclaim $4,000, with support levels near $3,500 under scrutiny. However, growing whale accumulation and Ethereum’s network enhancements signal potential for recovery. Hyperliquid price pops to above $43 Hyperliquid has again emerged as a standout performer as most altcoins struggle. Although HYPE has faced pressure amid fierce profit taking recently, the token is showing bullish signals at $43. Per CoinMarketCap, the decentralized exchange token hit intraday highs of $44 amid a 4% increase in volume. Hyperliquid’s decentralized exchange maintains strong user appeal due to its high leverage offerings and user experience. HYPE`s total value is nearly $6.8 billion. Aethir price gains 9% amid AI sector boost Aethir, a decentralized cloud computing platform, saw significant gains in intraday trading on Friday, Sept. 26. Capitalizing on the artificial intelligence and decentralized finance narratives has helped Aethir price rebound 9% to $0.0611. The token dropped to $0.054 as top coins plummeted on Sept. 25. The increasing demand for scalable, decentralized infrastructure adds to Aethir’s bullish structure. Aethir’s rally also reflected in the prices of Mantle, which surged nearly 6% to $1.69, and MYX Finance, which gained 4% to above $9.42. These tokens positioned among the top gaining altcoins on the day. However, 0G, Avalanche and Immutable ranked as top losers in the 100 largest coins by market cap, down 9.5%, 9.2% and 7.9% respectively in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke, has captivated millions with its vibrant community and unexpected surges. From humble beginnings, it has grown into a significant player in the crypto market. Many investors and enthusiasts are asking a crucial question: What does the future hold for DOGE? More specifically, can this beloved meme coin truly hit the ambitious DOGE price target of 1 dollar in the coming years? This comprehensive guide dives deep into the potential trajectory of Dogecoin, offering a detailed Dogecoin price prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030, exploring the factors that could drive its value. Understanding Dogecoin’s Journey and Market Dynamics Before we project Dogecoin’s potential future value, it’s essential to understand its past and the unique market dynamics that govern it. Launched in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin was created as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin. Its branding, featuring the Shiba Inu meme, quickly garnered a loyal following. Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin has an inflationary model, with 10,000 new DOGE mined every minute. This continuous supply addition is a key factor in any Dogecoin price prediction . The coin’s journey has been marked by significant volatility, often driven by social media trends, celebrity endorsements (most notably from Elon Musk), and broader market sentiment. Its community-driven nature fosters strong support, leading to impressive rallies. However, this also means its value can be highly susceptible to sudden shifts in public interest or influential figures’ statements. Understanding these underlying mechanics is crucial for anyone trying to gauge Dogecoin’s potential path. Key Factors Influencing Dogecoin’s Future Value Predicting the Dogecoin future involves analyzing a multitude of factors, both internal and external. These elements collectively shape its market performance and determine whether it can achieve significant milestones like the 1-dollar mark. Market Sentiment and Community Support: Dogecoin’s value is heavily influenced by its community’s enthusiasm and social media trends. Strong sentiment can drive buying pressure, while negative news can lead to rapid sell-offs. Utility and Development: While initially a joke, efforts are underway to increase Dogecoin’s utility. Integrations with payment systems, potential bridges to other blockchains (like Ethereum), and projects like the Doge-1 moon mission could provide real-world use cases, strengthening its value proposition. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Trends: Dogecoin often moves in tandem with the overall crypto market. Bitcoin’s performance, regulatory news, and macroeconomic factors significantly impact altcoins, including DOGE. Influencer Endorsements: The impact of figures like Elon Musk cannot be overstated. His tweets have historically caused dramatic price swings. While less frequent, such endorsements can still provide short-term boosts. Regulatory Environment: Increasing scrutiny from global regulators could affect all cryptocurrencies. Clearer regulations could bring stability and institutional adoption, while restrictive policies could hinder growth. Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025: What’s on the Horizon? As we look towards 2025, several market cycles and technological advancements could influence Dogecoin’s trajectory. Many analysts suggest that 2025 could be a year of recovery and growth for the broader crypto market, following potential post-halving bull runs. This environment could provide a fertile ground for a positive Dogecoin price prediction . In a bullish scenario, increased adoption as a payment method, combined with renewed retail investor interest and continued positive sentiment, could push DOGE upwards. Conversely, a bearish market, characterized by global economic downturns or stringent crypto regulations, could see its price consolidate or even decline. A neutral scenario might see Dogecoin trading within a defined range, reflecting ongoing development efforts without significant catalysts. DOGE Price Prediction 2025 Scenario Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price Bullish $0.18 $0.25 $0.40 Neutral $0.10 $0.15 $0.20 Bearish $0.06 $0.08 $0.12 These figures are speculative and depend heavily on market conditions and Dogecoin-specific developments. The average price represents a likely trading range under expected conditions, while the maximum price reflects significant positive catalysts. Navigating the Path: Dogecoin Price Prediction 2026 – 2027 Moving into 2026 and 2027, the market’s long-term cycles become more pronounced. Historically, crypto markets experience periods of rapid growth followed by corrections. For the Dogecoin future , these years could either see sustained growth from a strong 2025 or a consolidation phase as the market cools down from potential highs. The sustained development of its ecosystem and increased real-world utility will be paramount for maintaining momentum. The ability of Dogecoin to evolve beyond its meme status and secure concrete partnerships or technological integrations will be key to establishing a higher DOGE price target . For instance, if major payment processors begin accepting DOGE widely, or if significant layer-2 solutions are implemented to enhance its scalability, these could provide substantial boosts. Conversely, if newer, more innovative meme coins emerge or if Dogecoin’s development stagnates, it could face increased competition and struggle to hold its value. DOGE Price Prediction 2026-2027 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $0.15 $0.28 $0.55 2027 $0.20 $0.35 $0.70 The Ultimate Question: Will DOGE Reach 1 Dollar by 2030? The question of whether DOGE to 1 dollar is achievable by 2030 is perhaps the most anticipated aspect of any Dogecoin analysis. Reaching this price point would signify a massive increase in its market capitalization, placing it among the top cryptocurrencies globally. For DOGE to hit $1, its market cap would need to be well over $140 billion (given its circulating supply), which is a significant leap from its current valuation. Several scenarios could facilitate this. A sustained, multi-year bull market across the entire crypto space, driven by widespread institutional adoption and favorable regulations, would be a major catalyst. Furthermore, if Dogecoin manages to secure a dominant position as a global payment currency, particularly for micro-transactions or specific industries, its utility could drive its value significantly. Strong, consistent development by the Dogecoin Foundation, coupled with continued support from high-profile figures, could also contribute to this ambitious goal. However, the inflationary nature of DOGE’s supply means that demand must consistently outpace the increasing supply for such a price point to be sustainable. DOGE Price Prediction 2028-2030 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2028 $0.30 $0.50 $0.85 2029 $0.40 $0.65 $0.95 2030 $0.50 $0.75 $1.20 While the maximum price for 2030 indicates a possibility of surpassing $1, it’s crucial to remember that this represents an optimistic outlook requiring significant market shifts and Dogecoin’s continued relevance and utility growth. The average price suggests a strong upward trend, but also acknowledges the inherent volatility and challenges. Analyzing Dogecoin’s Meme Coin Appeal and Risks Dogecoin’s identity as a meme coin is both its greatest strength and a potential vulnerability. A thorough meme coin analysis reveals why it has resonated so deeply with retail investors and what challenges it faces in the long run. Strengths of Dogecoin as a Meme Coin: Strong Community: Dogecoin boasts one of the most passionate and active communities in crypto, fostering a sense of belonging and collective support. Brand Recognition: Its recognizable Shiba Inu mascot and lighthearted nature make it approachable and memorable, attracting new users. Low Transaction Fees: Dogecoin’s network typically offers faster transaction times and lower fees compared to some older cryptocurrencies, making it practical for small transfers. Cultural Impact: Its meme status allows it to tap into internet culture, driving viral marketing and organic growth. Challenges and Risks: Infinite Supply: The continuous minting of new DOGE can exert downward pressure on its price if demand does not keep pace with supply. Lack of Core Utility: While efforts are being made, Dogecoin’s primary utility is still limited compared to platform blockchains like Ethereum. Its value often relies more on speculation and sentiment than fundamental use cases. Volatility: Meme coins are notorious for extreme price swings, making them high-risk investments. Competition: The crypto space is constantly evolving, with new meme coins and utility tokens emerging, vying for investor attention and market share. Investors must weigh these aspects carefully. While the allure of quick gains is strong, the inherent risks associated with meme coins demand caution and a clear understanding of market dynamics. Actionable Insights for Potential DOGE Investors For those considering an investment in Dogecoin, or for current holders looking to navigate its future, here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your funds into one asset, especially a volatile one like Dogecoin. A balanced portfolio with a mix of stable assets and higher-risk options is generally advisable. Understand the Risks: Be prepared for significant price fluctuations. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep up with Dogecoin news, community developments, and broader crypto market trends. Information is power in this fast-moving space. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are looking for short-term gains or are willing to hold DOGE for several years, hoping for long-term growth. Different strategies apply to each. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While this article provides analysis, always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. Consult financial advisors if needed. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Dogecoin The journey of Dogecoin from a playful internet meme to a serious contender in the cryptocurrency world is remarkable. Our Dogecoin price prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030 suggests a potential for significant growth, with an optimistic but plausible path towards the coveted DOGE to 1 dollar mark. This trajectory, however, is not guaranteed and hinges on several critical factors: sustained community engagement, increased real-world utility, favorable market conditions, and continued innovation within its ecosystem. While the challenges inherent in its inflationary supply and meme coin volatility remain, the resilience and enthusiasm of its community provide a strong foundation. Whether Dogecoin ultimately achieves its ambitious DOGE price target of $1 or even surpasses it, its story will undoubtedly continue to be one of the most compelling narratives in the evolving landscape of digital assets.

The drop has pushed the market into negative territory for September, although Bitcoin (BTC) is holding on to a 1% gain for the month. The markets have shed over 2% in the past 24 hours, with the market cap down to $3.75 trillion. BTC slumped to a four-week low as selling pressure intensified. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $108,776 before registering a marginal recovery and reclaiming $109,000. BTC is down over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $109,393, with sellers in control. Ethereum (ETH) slumped below the key $4,000 mark and is down nearly 3%, trading around $3,910. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 4%, trading around $2.75, while Solana (SOL) lost the key $200 level and is trading around $195, down over 5%. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 4%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 3%, trading around $0.772. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines over the past 24 hours. TeraWulf Planning $3B Debt-Finance Expansion Google-backed crypto miner TeraWulf plans to raise around $3 billion to expand its data centers. TeraWulf's finance head, Patrick Fleury, stated that Google is supporting the deal. The debt will be issued through the high-yield bond market or leveraged loans. Morgan Stanley is overseeing the transaction, which could be executed as early as October. The deal is also being reviewed by credit rating agencies, with expectations it will land between BB and CCC, the typical range for junk-rated debt. However, Google’s support could help secure a higher grade. TeraWulf’s push comes amid growing demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure, which has outstripped supply. AI’s rapid growth has created a severe crunch of data center space, graphics processing chips, and electricity access. Mining firms like TeraWulf that operate large-scale facilities have become attractive partners for companies looking to expand into AI computing. Tokenized TradFi Assets Will Redefine Crypto Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of Chainlink Labs, believes the path towards tokenizing the financial system is now clear with Paul Atkins as the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Nazarov believes it will not be an easy task as there are various challenges regarding the tokenization of data, cross-chain connectivity, compliance, and several other areas. However, he stated that the consequences of tokenizing TradFi assets could be revolutionary. Nazarov stated, “What people don’t fully appreciate about TradFi [traditional finance] is its sheer scale.” Nazarov credited President Donald Trump for ushering in the global acceptance of crypto and tokenization of assets, adding that regulators warned investors to stay away from crypto during previous administrations. “Don’t touch this stuff; it’s illegal. But now regulators are saying, ‘Not only is it not illegal, we want you to do it. So, the movement of significant amounts of TradFi assets on-chain seems inevitable, as long as the macroeconomy doesn’t crater.” According to Nazarov, a cratering of the economy could happen if it moves from a risk-on to a risk-off environment. However, he believes tokenization will occur despite the downturn. “All these new tokenized assets need an active market where people want to try new things, trade, and deploy capital into new instruments. Right now, the conditions are positive: Interest rates are expected to be cut, and the SEC chairman is making speeches about how everything will be tokenized. I can’t imagine a more positive scenario.” Nazarov also believes Trump has delivered on his promise of being the “crypto president.” “We were already having meetings with the SEC early in the year. I’d say she already had a green light to start doing things early in the year. So, a lot of work was already underway, and then, it became more public once it was clear who the chairman would be. At that point, risk and doubt were removed from the equation.” MSTR Stock In Trouble Strategy’s (MSTR) stock price fell below a key support level as BTC crashed below $110,000 and its mNAV multiple fell to a year-to-date low. MSTR fell to $297 on Thursday, its lowest level since April, and 35% below its all-time high. The crash brought its market capitalization from $129 billion to $84 billion. The stock has plunged due to the ongoing crypto market crash, with BTC falling below $110,000 for the first time since September 1. Analysts highlighted that it has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating further downside in the near term. Meanwhile, BTC has formed a rising wedge on its weekly chart, suggesting markets could be witnessing the start of prolonged bearish sentiment. A prolonged bear market could spell trouble for Strategy and its stock price. The company has established itself as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin , holding 639,835 BTC, valued at $69 billion at current prices. BTC’s decline means that Strategy's premium has also plunged. Strategy’s mNAV has also dropped to a year-to-date low of 1.195. A falling mNAV is risky because Strategy uses its premium to raise capital and fund Bitcoin purchases. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has wiped out nearly all of its monthly gains after a brutal week dragged the price below the key $110,000 level. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced substantial selling pressure all week, starting with Monday’s flash crash. Buyers attempted a recovery on Wednesday as the price rose above $113,000 and settled at $113,348. However, selling pressure returned on Thursday as BTC plunged almost 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The current session sees the price up 0.49%, trading around $109,585. On-chain analysis shows that BTC could be headed for a deeper correction as cumulative realised long-term holder profit-taking is reaching levels seen during previous cycle tops. According to the analysis, long-term BTC holders realized 3.4 million BTC in profit. ETF inflows have also slowed, indicating exhaustion following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut last week. The flagship cryptocurrency fell below key support levels on Thursday, briefly dropping below $109,000 on Coinbase late Thursday before rebounding. Analysts fear bears could drag prices even lower, with the rebound quickly losing momentum. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, “The bounce back from that dip quickly lost momentum, and with prices now hovering close to this level again, another wave of stop-loss selling could emerge. This comes at a time when many are positioned for a Q4 rally — making the bigger surprise not a surge higher, but a correction instead.” Meanwhile, Glassnode analysts believe BTC could be heading for a cooling phase. Glassnode stated that the realized profit/loss ratio shows that profit-taking has crossed 90% of coins moved three times this cycle, and markets have just stepped away from the third such extreme. “Historically, these peaks have marked major cycle tops, and probabilities favor a cooling phase ahead.” Thielen also pointed out that the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is showing concerning behavior, with some BTC holders beginning to sell at a loss, indicating significant market stress. However, buyers are stepping in, with the aggregate spot orderbook bid-ask ratio tilting towards buyers. The aggregate spot orderbook bid-ask ratio measures the relationship between the number of buy orders (bids) and sell orders (asks) in an order book. “A bid/ask ratio that is greater than 0 indicates that there are more buy orders than sell orders in the order book, which could suggest that there is greater demand for the asset at the current price level.” BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $115,381. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose 1.26% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,832. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $114,724. It recovered from this level to settle at $116,484, ultimately dropping 0.30%. BTC reached an intraday high of $117,998 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,117. The price lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.22% to $115,690. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal increase on Saturday. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.41% to $115,282. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to an intraday low of $111,761 on Monday as bearish sentiment intensified. It recovered from this level to reclaim $112,000 and settle at $112,736. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC reached an intraday high of $113,357. However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $112,017, ultimately dropping 0.64%. The price fell to an intraday low of $111,066 on Wednesday as selling pressure intensified. Despite the bearish sentiment, it recovered to register a 1.19% increase and settle at $113,348. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged nearly 4%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $109,035. The current session sees BTC up 0.51%, trading around $109,598, as buyers look to reclaim the crucial $110,000 level. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) fell below the key $4,000 level on Thursday as selling pressure dragged prices lower. The altcoin has struggled to regain momentum after Monday’s crash and dropped to $4,155 by Wednesday. Selling pressure returned on Thursday as ETH fell almost 7%, slipping below $4,000 to $3,876. The price has recovered during the ongoing session, up 1.62% to $3,962. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs suffered another day of outflows, losing over $250 million after registering the fourth consecutive day of outflows. According to data from SoSoValue, the bulk of the outflows were from Fidelity’s FETH fund, which registered $158 million in outflows. The substantial outflows highlight the growing bearish sentiment around ETH ETFs. Grayscale’s ETHE and Bitwise’s ETHW registered outflows of $30 million and $27 million, respectively. Meanwhile, VanEck’s ETHV saw outflows of $1.4 million. The withdrawals are the largest single-day redemption this week, and take total outflows for the week past $540 million. The substantial outflows have compounded ETH’s price struggles, with ETH dropping below the $4,000 mark. The altcoin has fallen nearly 15% over the past week, with the consistent downward trend erasing a substantial portion of recent gains. ETH ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 1.27% and settling at $4,608. Sellers retained control on Monday as the price fell nearly 2%, slipping below $4,600 and settling at $4,527. ETH dropped 0.55% on Tuesday, settling at $4,502. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising 1.99% and settling at $4,591. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $4,589. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as ETH fell 2.58%, slipping below $4,500 and settling at $4,471. Source: TradingView ETH registered a marginal recovery on Saturday but was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.73% to $4,449. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as ETH started the week in bearish territory. As a result, it fell nearly 6%, falling to an intraday low of $4,083 before settling at $4,202. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH fell almost 1% to $4,166. ETH registered a marginal decline on Wednesday after buyers lost momentum, dropping to $4,155. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 7%, slipping below $4,000 to $3,876. The price has recovered during the ongoing session, and is up 1.38%, trading around $3,930. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has registered a marginal recovery during the ongoing session as it looks to reclaim the crucial $200 level. The altcoin faced tremendous selling pressure over the week, plunging nearly 7% on Monday and dropping to a low of $205 on Wednesday. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL fell almost 9%, slipping below $200 to $192. SOL is trading around $194 during the ongoing session. SOL’s MACD reveals extreme bearish sentiment, with analysts stating prices could go below $190. The altcoin has dropped nearly 20% over the past week, erasing all of the gains made during its ascent to $253. However, a key spot ETF ruling could change the narrative around SOL. Grayscale’s spot Solana ETF is set for its first approval deadline on October 12. The decision could unlock institutional capital flows to SOL, similar to what we have seen with BTC and ETH over the past year. The REX Osprey Staking SOL ETF already offers investors exposure to SOL. However, its structure is less significant than a pure spot product. On the other hand, a Grayscale spot ETF will allow direct institutional participation, unlocking deeper liquidity and broader adoption. The SEC is also set to review five other ETF applications, with a final ruling due on October 16. These include ETF proposals from Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Grayscale, and Canary. Solana (SOL) reached an intraday high of $249 on Sunday (September 14). However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $240, dropping 0.99%. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 2% to $234. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.06% and settling at $226. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price rose over 3% to cross $240 and settle at $244. SOL reached an intraday high of $253 on Thursday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $247, ultimately rising 1.11%. Selling pressure returned on Friday as the price fell 3.59% to $238.

Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL fell nearly 7%, dropping to an intraday low of $214 before settling at $220. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell by over 3% and settled at $213. SOL fell almost 1% on Wednesday and settled at $211. Beamish sentiment intensified on Thursday as SOL plunged nearly 9%, falling from $200 to $192. The current session sees the price marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis Filecoin (FIL) started the previous week in the red, dropping nearly 4% to 2.41. It recovered on Tuesday, reaching an intraday high of $2.66 before settling at $2.55, ultimately rising 5.99%. FIL faced volatility on Wednesday and Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to gain control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose marginally and settled at $2.57. Selling pressure returned on Friday as FIL fell almost 5% to $2.45. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish over the weekend as FIL fell 0.39% on Saturday and nearly 2% on Sunday to $2.39. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price fell 5.99% to $2.25. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as FIL fell 0.56%. Buyers attempted a recovery on Wednesday as the price reached an intraday high of $2.28. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to $2.21.

Selling pressure intensified on Monday as the price fell by over 9% to $0.473. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Tuesday as JUP fell 1.89% and settled at $0.464. The price reached an intraday high of $0.484 on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to take control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as JUP rose 1.51% and settled at $0.471. Selling pressure returned on Thursday as the price fell almost 10% and settled at $0.426. JUP is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $0.427.

52301252,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=820310,1758907073,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52301252.jpeg,Trump pushes joint-venture plan for TikTok while Beijing stays silent,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-no-response-to-trumps-tiktok-deal/,"China has not responded to U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement on Thursday that a deal to keep TikTok running in the United States has been approved. Trump said during the signing of a new executive order that he had “gotten the go-ahead” from Chinese President Xi Jinping. But since that statement, Beijing hasn’t said a word. No press release, no confirmation, not even a half-assed comment from any official. Chinese state media has completely ignored Trump’s statement. Social media discussions were almost non-existent. One state-linked Weibo account quietly quoted a professor from Fudan University calling the deal a “win-win,” but beyond that, silence. That’s raised questions, because the deal can’t actually move forward without China’s approval. Trump pushes joint-venture plan while Beijing stays silent Trump’s new executive order laid out plans to create a joint-venture company that would take over TikTok’s U.S. business, including its data and algorithm. ByteDance, the China-based parent company of TikTok, would keep less than 20% ownership in the new firm. That structure was designed to meet U.S. national security law requirements. The law says ByteDance must give up control or face a ban in the country. On Friday, Chinese outlet LastPost reported that TikTok’s U.S. operations would actually be split into two separate companies. One would be the joint-venture company with majority American ownership. The other would be a separate ByteDance-run U.S. entity focusing on e-commerce, brand partnerships, and relationships with TikTok’s overseas markets. Trump’s order is the latest in a back-and-forth that’s been dragging on for years. The pressure on TikTok began under Joe Biden, who signed the law requiring ByteDance to divest or shut down TikTok in the U.S. But since returning to the White House, Trump has taken over negotiations and extended the deadline multiple times. He’s insisted he wants a deal and has said on several occasions that TikTok helped him win the 2024 election. Xi offers vague statement while ByteDance profit terms emerge Earlier this month, Trump had a nearly two-hour call with Xi. After the call, Trump claimed Xi had signed off on a new TikTok proposal. However, the official statement from Beijing didn’t exactly say that. Xi was quoted as saying that China “would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules” and that any resolution should “comply with China’s laws and regulations” while also protecting “the interests of both sides.” He also urged the U.S. to stop using “unilateral trade restrictions” and to allow “a fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors.” So far, China hasn’t officially said yes or no. Analysts who spoke to CNBC said Beijing has little to no motivation to greenlight ByteDance’s divestment. Trump may have announced a deal, but unless China signs off, nothing is final. Meanwhile, ByteDance is expected to still walk away with a huge financial stake. People familiar with the terms say ByteDance will receive a licensing fee for providing its algorithm to the new U.S. TikTok company, along with a profit share based on its ownership. That adds up to roughly 50% or more of TikTok’s U.S. earnings still going to the Beijing parent company. The arrangement could raise new legal issues in the U.S. If the financial setup doesn’t match what’s allowed under the sale-or-ban law backed by the Supreme Court earlier this year, it could face serious pushback. Vice President JD Vance made things more confusing last Thursday when he told reporters the TikTok deal would likely close for $14 billion. That’s way below Wall Street expectations, where analysts had pegged the sale price between $35 and $40 billion, as Cryptopolitan reported .

52300866,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/bitcoin-price-analysis-pce-data-fails-to-revive-btc-momentum,1758907175,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/52300866.jpeg,Bitcoin Price Analysis: PCE Data Fails To Revive BTC Momentum,https://bitzo.com/2025/09/bitcoin-price-analysis-pce-data-fails-to-revive-btc-momentum,"Bitcoin (BTC) crashed spectacularly on Thursday, falling nearly 4% and going below the key $110,000 level to $109,035. The crash dwarfed Monday’s 2.21% drop, which liquidated over $1.6 billion in leveraged positions. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $109,253. MSTR Stock In The Doldrums Thanks To Bitcoin Drop Strategy’s (MSTR) stock price fell below a key support level as BTC crashed below $110,000 and its mNAV multiple fell to a year-to-date low. MSTR fell to $297 on Thursday, its lowest level since April, and 35% below its all-time high. The crash brought its market capitalization from $129 billion to $84 billion. The stock has plunged due to the ongoing crypto market crash, with BTC falling below $110,000 for the first time since September 1. Analysts highlighted that it has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, indicating further downside in the near term. Meanwhile, BTC has formed a rising wedge on its weekly chart, suggesting markets could be witnessing the start of prolonged bearish sentiment. A prolonged bear market could spell trouble for Strategy and its stock price. The company has established itself as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin , holding 639,835 BTC , valued at $69 billion at current prices. BTC’s decline means that Strategy's premium has also plunged. Strategy’s mNAV has also dropped to a year-to-date low of 1.195. A falling mNAV is risky because Strategy uses its premium to raise capital and fund Bitcoin purchases. BlackRock Chases Bitcoin Yield BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has filed to register a Delaware trust company for its proposed Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The filing indicates BlackRock’s intention to broaden its Bitcoin offerings. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the proposed ETF will sell covered call options on Bitcoin futures and generate yield by collecting premiums. “BlackRock registered the name iShares Bitcoin Premium ETF, filing coming soon. This is a covered call bitcoin strategy in order to give BTC some yield. This will be a '33 Act spot product, sequel to the $87b.” The new ETF will complement BlackRock’s existing iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). IBIT has registered over $60 billion in net inflows since its launch in January 2024. PCE Data Has Little Impact Meanwhile, macroeconomic triggers did little to boost Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, was in line with expectations at 2.7%. The Koebeissi Letter noted that while the PCE was at a seven-month high, the Fed still went ahead with the interest rate cuts. “PCE inflation is at its highest since February 2025. Yet, the Fed will keep cutting rates.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to recover after Thursday’s crash, which saw the price slip below $110,000 to $109,035. The flagship cryptocurrency endured a brutal week starting Monday, when a flash crash liquidated $1.6 billion in leveraged positions. Price action remained bearish on Tuesday before a recovery on Wednesday saw BTC settle at $113,348. However, selling pressure returned on Thursday as it fell almost 4% to $109,035. The price is marginally up during the ongoing session, but selling pressure persists. On-chain analysis shows that BTC could be headed for a deeper correction as cumulative realised long-term holder profit-taking is reaching levels seen during previous cycle tops. According to the analysis, long-term BTC holders realized 3.4 million BTC in profit. ETF inflows have also slowed, indicating exhaustion following the Federal Reserve’s rate cut last week. Analysts fear bears could drag prices even lower, with the rebound quickly losing momentum. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, “The bounce back from that dip quickly lost momentum, and with prices now hovering close to this level again, another wave of stop-loss selling could emerge. This comes at a time when many are positioned for a Q4 rally — making the bigger surprise not a surge higher, but a correction instead.” However, popular chartist Egrag Crypto believes Bitcoin is still in a bull market even after the week’s substantial pullback. According to the analyst, the current market scenario is part of a pattern that has played out since the end of 2022. The analyst believes that Bitcoin’s bullish cycle is not over, and that the market could make one final rally before the onset of a bearish phase. BTC ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 0.56% and settling at $115,314. The price faced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control.

As one of the most vital projects in the decentralized ecosystem, Chainlink has consistently captured the attention of investors and developers alike. Its unique position as the leading decentralized oracle network makes its Chainlink price prediction a topic of intense speculation. Many are asking: Will the LINK price target truly reach the ambitious $100 mark in the coming years? This comprehensive article dives deep into the factors influencing Chainlink’s value, offering insights into its potential trajectory from 2025 to 2030, and explores the compelling arguments for and against LINK reaching this significant milestone. Understanding Chainlink’s Core Value and Its Price Prediction Drivers Chainlink isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a foundational layer for the entire Web3 ecosystem. At its heart, Chainlink provides decentralized oracle networks, which are crucial for smart contracts to interact with real-world data and off-chain systems. Without reliable oracle networks, smart contracts would be confined to their native blockchains, severely limiting their utility and adoption. This fundamental utility is a primary driver for any Chainlink price prediction . Several key factors influence Chainlink’s value: Adoption and Integration: As more decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and enterprise solutions integrate Chainlink’s oracles, the demand for LINK tokens for payment and staking increases. Technological Advancements: Continuous development, such as the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), staking mechanisms, and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) solutions, enhances Chainlink’s capabilities and competitive edge. Market Sentiment and Macro Trends: The broader cryptocurrency market sentiment, regulatory developments, and global economic conditions significantly impact LINK’s price. Network Security and Reliability: Chainlink’s robust security model and proven reliability in delivering tamper-proof data are critical for maintaining trust and attracting new users. These elements collectively paint a picture of Chainlink’s intrinsic value, which underpins its long-term growth potential and informs our Chainlink price prediction for the years ahead. Analyzing Historical LINK Price Target Trends and Performance To gauge future potential, it’s essential to look at Chainlink’s past performance. LINK has experienced remarkable growth since its inception, demonstrating its resilience and strong market demand. Launched in 2017, LINK’s price started at fractions of a dollar, but quickly gained traction as the utility of its oracle services became apparent. Key historical milestones include: 2017-2019: Initial growth and increasing awareness of its core technology. 2020: The DeFi boom propelled LINK to new all-time highs, showcasing its critical role in decentralized finance. This period saw the first major surge towards a higher LINK price target . 2021: Reaching its all-time high amidst a broader crypto bull run, solidifying its position as a top-tier cryptocurrency. 2022-2023: Navigating a bear market, LINK demonstrated relative stability compared to many altcoins, indicating strong fundamental support and continued development. While past performance is not indicative of future results, LINK’s historical trajectory provides valuable insights. Its ability to recover from market downturns and consistently build out its ecosystem suggests a strong foundation. Understanding these trends is crucial when considering if a $100 LINK price target is within reach. The Chainlink Future: What’s Driving Long-Term Growth? The long-term outlook for Chainlink is intrinsically tied to the expansion of Web3 and the increasing demand for secure, reliable, and interoperable data. The Chainlink future is brightened by several key initiatives and market trends: Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP): This flagship product enables seamless and secure data and token transfers across different blockchains. CCIP is positioned to become a foundational layer for the multi-chain future, unlocking vast new use cases and driving demand for LINK. Chainlink Staking: The introduction of staking provides economic security for the network and offers participants a way to earn rewards by helping secure oracle services. Staking reduces the circulating supply of LINK, which can have a positive impact on its price over time. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Automation: Chainlink’s automation services allow smart contracts to perform actions automatically based on predefined conditions, further expanding their utility beyond simple data feeds. Enterprise Adoption: Chainlink is actively pursuing partnerships with traditional enterprises looking to leverage blockchain technology, bringing real-world assets and data onto the blockchain. These developments suggest that the Chainlink future is not just about price speculation but about building essential infrastructure for a decentralized world. The more critical Chainlink becomes to this infrastructure, the stronger its value proposition and potential for significant price appreciation. In-Depth LINK Coin Analysis: On-Chain Metrics and Market Indicators A thorough LINK coin analysis requires looking beyond price charts to understand the underlying health of the network. On-chain metrics and market indicators offer a clearer picture of Chainlink’s fundamental strength. Active Addresses: A growing number of active addresses indicates increasing user engagement and network utilization, signaling healthy adoption. Developer Activity: Consistent and robust developer activity on GitHub points to ongoing innovation and commitment to improving the Chainlink protocol. Total Value Secured (TVS): Chainlink secures billions of dollars across various DeFi protocols and dApps. A rising TVS demonstrates the network’s increasing importance and trust within the ecosystem. Token Distribution and Whale Holdings: Analyzing how LINK tokens are distributed among holders can provide insights into potential market manipulation or long-term investor confidence. While whales hold significant amounts, a healthy distribution across many addresses is generally positive. Staking Metrics: The amount of LINK staked and the participation rate in staking pools indicate network security and long-term commitment from token holders. This LINK coin analysis reveals a project with strong fundamentals, a dedicated community, and continuous development, all of which are crucial for sustained growth and reaching ambitious price targets like $100. The Role of Decentralized Oracle Networks in LINK’s Journey to $100 The very essence of Chainlink’s value lies in its dominance as a provider of decentralized oracle networks . Without secure and reliable oracle networks, the vision of Web3—a truly decentralized internet—cannot be fully realized. Smart contracts need external data to be useful in real-world applications, whether it’s stock prices, weather data, sports results, or IoT sensor readings. Chainlink has established itself as the industry standard for these services due to: Decentralization: Unlike centralized oracles, Chainlink uses multiple independent nodes to fetch and validate data, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing security. Robustness: Its network is designed to be highly resilient against attacks and data manipulation, ensuring the integrity of information fed to smart contracts. Flexibility: Chainlink can provide any type of real-world data to any blockchain, making it highly adaptable to various use cases. Proven Track Record: It has been successfully operating for years, securing billions in value across countless applications. The increasing demand for blockchain interoperability and the integration of real-world data into decentralized applications will only amplify the need for robust decentralized oracle networks . As Chainlink continues to expand its services and maintain its market leadership, its pivotal role in the Web3 ecosystem will naturally drive the demand and value of the LINK token, making a $100 LINK price target a more tangible possibility. Chainlink Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will LINK Price Reach $100? Predicting cryptocurrency prices is inherently speculative, but by analyzing fundamental factors, technical indicators, and market trends, we can form educated estimations for the Chainlink price prediction . The journey to $100 for LINK will depend on several critical factors, including overall market sentiment, the pace of Web3 adoption, and Chainlink’s continued innovation. Chainlink Price Prediction 2025 By 2025, we anticipate continued growth for Chainlink. With CCIP gaining wider adoption and staking fully operational, LINK’s utility and demand should solidify. If the broader crypto market enters a bull phase, Chainlink is well-positioned to capitalize. We could see LINK’s price range between $30 and $50 , with an optimistic scenario potentially pushing it towards $60-$75 if market conditions are exceptionally favorable and development milestones are met swiftly. Chainlink Price Prediction 2026-2027 Moving into 2026 and 2027, the long-term vision for Chainlink should become clearer. The integration of Chainlink into enterprise solutions and government initiatives could significantly boost its value. As more industries recognize the necessity of secure data feeds for smart contracts, the demand for Chainlink’s oracle services will intensify. During this period, a more conservative Chainlink price prediction could place LINK between $50 and $80 . However, with sustained market momentum and groundbreaking advancements in cross-chain capabilities, a push towards the $90-$100 mark becomes increasingly plausible, especially if institutional adoption accelerates. Chainlink Price Prediction 2028-2030 The period between 2028 and 2030 is where the most significant potential for LINK to reach and potentially surpass $100 lies. By this time, Web3 technologies are expected to be far more integrated into daily life and business operations. Chainlink, as a foundational layer, would be indispensable. Its dominance in oracle networks and cross-chain solutions would likely be solidified, making the LINK price target of $100 not just a possibility, but a strong probability. We could see LINK trading comfortably above $100, potentially reaching highs of $120-$150 , and even higher in extremely bullish scenarios, depending on global economic conditions and the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. A more conservative estimate might still see it firmly establish above $80, even in less ideal market conditions. Here’s a simplified outlook: Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $28 $45 $75 2026 $40 $65 $90 2027 $55 $85 $110 2028 $70 $100 $130 2029 $85 $115 $145 2030 $95 $130 $160+ Will LINK Price Reach $100? Based on current developments, its pivotal role in Web3, and the projected growth of the blockchain industry, our Chainlink price prediction suggests that LINK has a very strong chance of reaching and potentially surpassing $100 between 2027 and 2028. This hinges on sustained innovation, broader market adoption, and a generally favorable regulatory environment. What Are the Challenges and Risks for Chainlink’s Growth? While the outlook for Chainlink is largely positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks that could impact its journey to a $100 LINK price target : Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Major market corrections or bear markets could significantly delay or derail price targets.

The project concluded a highly successful presale and followed it up with its pre-launch phase. The pre-launch phase is still ongoing, and has helped the project raise $897,612 so far. Husky Inu’s soaring popularity is due to investors looking for opportunities beyond traditional avenues like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE) to enter the crypto market. Memecoins are a niche market within the altcoin market, which has proven incredibly profitable. What Is Husky Inu (HINU)? Husky Inu (HINU) is a memecoin project on the Solana blockchain. It has quickly established itself as one of the most sought-after memecoins to date. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders added value and utility, and along with its native token, HINU, it aims to bolster the memecoin sector by building a supportive community, boasting innovative features and enhanced rewards. The project is working on an exciting array of offerings, and recently launched SwapCrypto.com, its very own cryptocurrency exchange. The Presale Phase The Husky Inu presale has been a resounding success, with the project having already raised $742,648. The presale stage will end once the project’s fundraising goal is completed or all the tokens are sold out. The HINU token price increases with every new presale stage, with the project inching towards its next milestone of $750,000. The Husky Inu presale owes its presale success to several unique features. Husky Inu is committed to creating a reliable token ecosystem through a carefully designed distribution model, and capping its token supply at 100 billion to ensure scarcity and value. The project has also integrated a deflationary mechanism, with plans to allocate 50% of all platform fees collected from the upcoming decentralized exchange to buy back HINU tokens and reduce their supply over time. The Pre-Launch Phase Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. The Pre-Launch phase picks up where the Husky Inu presale left off and continues the project’s fundraising efforts as it approaches its launch date. The Pre-Launch phase is the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The new phase also welcomes new participants and contributors to the ecosystem. Card Payments Husky Inu (HINU) introduced card payments in partnership with wert.io, making HINU token purchases simple, secure, and easily accessible to investors. The collaboration allowed the project to accept card payments, making the HINU token more accessible than ever before to interested users. The partnership enables anyone with a credit or debit card to seamlessly purchase the HINU token and throw their support behind the fledgling meme coin project. It also simplified a significant complexity faced by many projects, lowering the entry barrier and making it easy to get started. The partnership also makes the Husky Inu presale accessible to new users who want to invest in tokens without complex processes. Launching A Cryptocurrency Exchange Husky Inu recently announced the launch of its very own cryptocurrency exchange, SwapCrypto.com. The launch is a significant step for the Husky Inu ecosystem, reinforcing its commitment to provide value to its nascent user base and building real-world utility. Unlike other memecoins that depend on hype and speculation, Husky Inu is dedicated to its utility and long-term vision. Instead of becoming just another memecoin, it is creating the infrastructure to give its community the tools to engage with digital finance. SwapCrypto.com enhances Husky Inu’s growing ecosystem and solidifies its position in an increasingly competitive DeFi ecosystem. Closing In On The $900,000 Fundraising Milestone Husky Inu has crossed several milestones since its presale and pre-launch phases. The HINU token value remained constant during the project’s presale. However, the project adopted a dynamic and progressive pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, increasing the price of the HINU token every two days. This has enabled the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. This pricing strategy helped Husky Inu cross the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The recent crypto market rally and the return of investor interest have allowed the project to reach the $850,000 milestone in record time, crossing it on July 25. The project has raised $897,612 so far, and is on the verge of crossing the $900,000 mark.

52301590,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=820327,1758907641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52301590.jpeg,Dealers blame IRS backlog for sharp slowdown in U.S. EV sales,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ev-sales-stall-due-to-irs-delays/,"EV sales in the U.S. have slowed down hard, and dealers are blaming the IRS for it. The entire rebate process, meant to help people afford electric vehicles, is now stuck, less than a week before the tax break vanishes. According to CNBC, car dealerships in multiple states say the IRS stopped approving and paying out the promised tax credits in mid-September. The result? A massive traffic jam of unpaid rebates, stressed-out dealers, and customers caught in the middle. These delays hit right when consumers were racing to buy EVs before the federal incentive ends on September 30. The tax credit, worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones, was originally designed to last until 2032. But that was before President Donald Trump signed the “big beautiful bill” in July, ending the program early. Now, instead of a smooth final stretch, dealers are stuck chasing the government for cash they already gave out. Dealers front money while payments stall Jesse Lore, who runs Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, New Hampshire, said the IRS owes him nearly $100,000. He’s still giving customers the rebate upfront, even though twelve applications he submitted after September 15 are still pending. “We’re continuing to pay the tax credit, though with a lot of anxiety,” Jesse said. “We’re in the dark.” Only three of his applications got approved last Thursday, and none of them have been paid yet. Jesse even showed screenshots of the transactions to CNBC, allegedly. Here’s how it works: dealers apply through the Energy Credits Online portal after selling an EV to a qualifying buyer. If the IRS gives the green light, they’re supposed to reimburse the dealer. That’s what happened before mid-September, approvals came in fast, and payments followed. Now? Nothing. No clear answers. No time-of-sale reports. No phone calls answered. Just more waiting. Robyn Capehart, a spokesperson for the IRS, claimed the review process has always been part of the system. “Any submissions through the Energy Credits Online portal have always been subject to IRS review and approval,” Robyn wrote in an email. She added that once the agency approves a report, the vehicle is eligible, even if the approval came after a delay. The White House confirmed all valid claims submitted before the September 30 deadline will still be honored, but gave no reason for the holdup. Sales drop as uncertainty grows Dealers like Gary Pretzfeld, who co-owns AutoTrust USA in Miramar, Florida, said they’ve been left holding the bag. He said he’s floated about $80,000 to $90,000 in rebates this month, but hasn’t been paid. “There are definitely some dealers who can’t afford to do it this way,” Gary said. He explained that two of his applications, submitted September 16 and 17, finally got approved, but no money has landed yet. “The timeline is now longer, and it’s murkier,” Gary said. “That’s the part that’s freaking everyone out.” Other dealers have simply stopped offering the rebate. Jesse said he knows sellers telling customers they can’t even take the car home until the IRS pays up. Some dealerships won’t risk it anymore. They’re either holding cars hostage or walking away from the program entirely. The problem is bigger than just the cash flow. Al Salas, the CEO of Eco Auto, which sells EVs in Massachusetts and Washington, said the upfront rebate made a real difference to buyers. He’s expanding to Florida, Georgia, and New Jersey, and now he’s also stuck. “As dealers, it’s a really unfortunate situation, because we are fronting the money,” Al said. He’s currently waiting on $50,000 in credits. Without that instant rebate, customers can end up paying $80 to $100 more each month on a five-year loan for a used EV. And claiming the credit later isn’t even a guarantee. Buyers need a tax liability to qualify when filing next year. That’s not required when the rebate is given at the time of sale, which made the program so appealing to many buyers in the first place. The National Automobile Dealers Association is hearing the same thing from its members. “Anecdotally, we have heard some dealers report that recent submissions have been placed in pending status since last week,” said spokesperson Amy Hunter Wright. She added that NADA is also working with the IRS and Treasury, and so far, the agencies have been “cooperative.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Tech|IRS,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-26 17:27:21

Analysts are throwing out bearish Solana price prediction too, with some even warning of lower targets ahead. But here is the twist: institutional interest in Solana is heating up. Two big Solana treasuries rolled out back-to-back, and the chain’s stablecoin market boomed to over $12B from just $5B earlier this year. Even with memecoin trading dropping more than 60%, Solana still dominates DEX flow, pulling in about $4.5B daily. In just the past 72 hours, close to 1.5 million SOL worth more than $315M got snapped up . That kind of accumulation says a lot about the confidence from whales and institutions. This is why despite everything, Solana still stands out for traders and its open interest just hit a new record. Solana Futures Open Interest Hits Record $17B Source: CoinGlass On September 20, Solana hit a new record in open interest at $17.10B while the price of SOL was closing in on its all-time high of $250. Right now, SOL trades around $195, yet open interest is even higher than when it touched those highs earlier this year. Perpetual funding rates also flipped positive, climbing to 0.0043% from -0.0065% alongside the jump in OI. Source: DeFiLlama In addition, DefiLlama data flags some weakness. Solana’s total value locked in DeFi protocols dropped 16% over the past week from 13B to 10B, and daily transactions slid by 11%. Even with that dip, Solana continues to dominate key areas. It holds 58% of all tokenized stock volume, boasts 4M daily active addresses, generates $1.7B in annualized application revenue, and leads DEX volumes. All this has led uncertainty around SOL price, and the technicals right now lean more in favor of the bearish side. Solana Price Prediction: Big Move Coming Next? Solana recently slid under its ascending channel after that strong rally, showing it is tracking a bearish path. The $200 level is the key support right now, and if it breaks, SOL could dip toward $185 next. The $198 zone is especially important since it overlaps mid-range support and the channel’s lower trendline. Holding this level could spark a rebound toward $255, and with stronger momentum, extend into the $330–$350 range. If this support cracks, though, the downside opens toward $190 and even $174. RSI sits at 39, hinting at oversold and a possible bounce, but MACD remains bearish, keeping pressure heavy. Bulls must reclaim $215 to keep any higher breakout setup alive. Snorter: One of the Best Trading Bots on Solana Doing Presale Snorter is quickly setting itself apart as a leading bot built right inside Telegram for Solana traders. It packs the tools serious traders want: whale wallet mirroring, MEV protection, honeypot checks, and clean trades at just a 0.85% fee. The presale already ripped past $4M, and the hype keeps climbing. With staking at 115 % APY plus extra holder rewards, Snorter is designed not just for trading but for building long-term gains. Among Solana bots, Snorter is already carving out a top spot, trusted by both early whales and retail piling in. If you want to catch the next wave of Solana action, Snorter is one of the best ways to play it.

Although Solana’s fundamentals remain intact, aggressive whale activity is normally a precursor to violent market action, so some investors are hedging into new opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi altcoin increasingly popular as a hedge against large-price volatility. At presale stage 6 that is 50% sold out, at a price of $0.035, MUTM is creating a lending-and-borrowing protocol with actual utility and far more upside in the early stages. Mutuum Finance has already made over $16.3 million and had over 16,570 holders. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06 and roadmap with multi-chain expansion and institutional partnerships. Solana Technical Image Turns Cautious as $210 Support Faces Critical Test The technical perspective for Solana has weakened as price action cannot trade above $220 and is continuously rejected near $240, trading below its 30-day moving average and exerting heavy pressure on the major $210 support zone. A close below this level could open the door to another dip towards the psychological $200 level, with momentum indicators backing the bearish case. Interestingly, the last time this setup was seen, SOL dropped to $126 before rebounding 62%, with speculation now rampant that another such cycle is now underway. Mutuum Finance Spikes in Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sixth presale round is progressing at a fever pitch. The project has thus far raised over $16.3 million and has been bought by over 16,570 holders. People participating in this round are poised to enjoy astronomical rewards once the token is listed on the market. Besides its success in presale, Mutuum Finance is strongly focused on creating a stablecoin and balanced ecosystem on the Ethereum chain. In addition to protecting its platform, Mutuum Finance has also collaborated with CertiK to announce a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. The program is designed to invite security developers, white-hat hackers, and researchers to find bugs on the platform. The bugs are effort and risk levels: major, critical, minor, and low. This is a significant step towards protecting users’ balances and boosting investor confidence even further. Mutuum Finance is looking to expand the reach of the existing DeFi network. In its community engagement, the project has launched an early bird token reward of $100,000 giveaway, in which 10 winners can receive $10,000 MUTM. Vision and Technology The project’s vision is to test the boundaries of the present DeFi ecosystem. True to this conviction, Mutuum Finance employs Chainlink oracles for trading, lending, and asset prices in USD terms. It also supports assets such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. To make it reliable, the system employs fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages to fetch very precise price data even in times of highly volatile markets. The protocol is a closed-order book architecture with market risk aversion and illiquidity as top priorities. The protocol is implemented through a set of mechanisms like close levels, liquidation thresholds, and incentive to liquidators. Underlying volatility directly prescribes the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio as well as liquidation policies: the higher, the tighter parameters and lending conditions. In addition, reserve multipliers are also differentiated by asset risk weightings for the purpose of adding stability, security, and resilience to the system under different conditions in the markets. From Volatility to Value: Why Investors Prefer MUTM Over SOL Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up steam as a stable hedge against Solana’s (SOL) heightened volatility. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035 and already 50% sold, with a launch price guarantee of $0.06, offering huge upside. The project has raised over $16.3 million and added 16,570+ holders, reflecting ramped-up adoption and firm market confidence. Enter Stage 6 now before the next price hike and get in early to reap maximum returns.

According to the US Department of Labor's previously released operational contingency plan, the September jobs report, scheduled for release next week, would be postponed if the federal government shuts down. The extent of the government shutdown remains unclear. Many agencies, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which prepares the employment report, have not yet released their updated emergency plans. If Congress fails to approve the budget by next Tuesday, these agencies will be forced to cease operations under their previous plans.

The Russian president’s representative is convinced that cryptocurrencies are catching up with gold in terms of stability and are no longer a niche phenomenon. Kremlin official compares cryptocurrency to gold Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have ceased to be a niche asset and have already become as stable as gold, said Boris Titov, Commissioner for the Protection of Entrepreneurs’ Rights under the President of the Russian Federation. Quoted by the Gazeta.ru website, Titov highlighted that the crypto market’s capitalization has reached $4 trillion, noting this is bigger than the economies of several European countries. He also pointed out that 650 million people around the world now have crypto holdings. The arrival of institutional investors has changed the very nature of the market, he added, with disciplined strategies supplanting retail speculation. Speaking at the Crypto Summit 2025 forum, held in Moscow this week, Titov stated: “Volatility is declining, so are excess returns. But the confidence of millions of investors is growing.” The Kremlin official believes the trend is also linked to the symbiosis between cryptocurrency mining and computing services for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and big data processing. Coin minting facilities, often idle during crypto market downturns, are now increasingly being used for other complex calculations, Titov explained. “Mining has already created a large-scale infrastructure that can be repurposed for AI tasks,” he elaborated, reminding that this market is projected to grow to $100 billion by 2030. Russia’s crypto-facilitated trade reached 1 trillion rubles in 2025 In his address, Boris Titov recalled that only a decade ago, central banks considered cryptocurrencies an illegal and speculative instrument. But today, they are recognized as a promising segment that simply needs regulation. In his view, Russia has taken a strategically correct stance in that regard by adopting necessary laws, introducing a registry for mining enterprises, and creating a system for taxation. The results are already visible, Putin’s aide is convinced. According to an estimate he quoted, Russia’s foreign trade transactions using cryptocurrencies for settlement have reached 1 trillion rubles (almost $12 billion) in fiat equivalent during the first half of 2025. Titov went on to suggest that by using its own digital ruble and the global crypto infrastructure, Russia will be able to create an alternative international payment system. He also remarked: “The combination of private crypto assets and central bank digital currencies is a historic opportunity to build a financial system independent of sanctions pressure.” Despite Boris Titov’s enthusiasm, Russia has yet to comprehensively regulate cryptocurrencies and operations with them. Mining is still the only one fully recognized as a legal activity. The Central Bank of Russia maintains strong opposition to allowing crypto payments or other coin transactions inside the country, although it agreed to permit the use of Bitcoin and the like for international settlements. This is only valid within an “experimental legal regime” that helps Russian companies transact in cryptocurrency with foreign partners, bypassing financial restrictions imposed by the West over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The same arrangement gives a limited number of “highly qualified” investors access to decentralized digital assets and crypto derivatives. But these remain out of reach for ordinary Russians. The finance ministry recently called for widening investor access to crypto. Generally, the Russian Treasury has a more liberal view. Speaking during the same crypto event in the Russian capital, its deputy head, Ivan Chebeskov, urged a comprehensive national strategy for digital assets that will allow Russia to use cryptocurrencies to develop its economy. Domestically, the Russian government has taken steps to curb crypto activities. Using anything else than the Russian ruble, and soon its digital version , as legal tender is prohibited by law. A series of recent legislative amendments, allegedly targeting financial fraud, are actually affecting crypto trading as well.

Solana and BlockDAG are both advancing their respective chains at critical moments in the crypto cycle, but their approaches to infrastructure delivery could not be more different. As of September 2025, BlockDAG has sold over 26.5 billion coins, raised more than $410 million in presale funding, and is offering tokens at just $0.0016 despite being in batch 30 with a projected ROI of 2900% from its initial price. In contrast, Solana is pushing validator and consensus upgrades but continues to lack direct proofs in miner integration or hardware deployment. This difference in readiness could affect both price prediction trends and investor positioning for Q4 2025. BlockDAG’s Infras tructure: Already in Motion BlockDAG has entered the late stages of its presale phase, but unlike most projects in similar stages, its infrastructure is already operational. On September 25, the Awakening Testnet is scheduled to go live. This testnet isn’t just for internal trials. It features live explorer tools, hardware miner syncing, account abstraction support, and a unique DAG + Proof-of-Work hybrid model that aims to solve current scalability and decentralisation limits. Additionally, BlockDAG has begun shipping physical miners, with over 20k units delivered globally and production ramping up to 2,000 per week. The significance here is in execution. These components, miner integration, explorer functionality, and account abstraction, are not theoretical roadmaps. They are live, verifiable features, placing BlockDAG in a small group of presale projects that can back fundraising with full-stack delivery. From a price prediction standpoint, this adds credibility and potential upward pressure, especially as the broader market begins to differentiate between promise and proof. Solana’s Consensus Focus: Fast but Limited in Breadth Solana continues to optimise its technical backbone, most recently with the rollout of Alpenglow consensus improvements. These updates aim to reduce block finality to around 150 milliseconds, a remarkable achievement in theory. The network’s validator performance has improved, offering better uptime, faster throughput, and greater appeal to institutions managing high-frequency transactions. Solana’s strong presence across DEXs and staking platforms makes it a natural choice for on-chain liquidity, and institutional adoption continues to expand across DeFi protocols. However, Solana’s roadmap, outlined in detail on CoinMarketCap , still lacks hardware integration or physical miner support, even in testnet form. This gap in infrastructure delivery becomes critical when comparing Solana with BlockDAG, which has already demonstrated device-level functionality through its X1 mobile miner and X10–X100 hardware series. The price prediction potential for Solana depends heavily on performance optimisations and community confidence, but the absence of a tangible hardware layer may cap its appeal to certain investor segments looking for decentralised mining or retail adoption. Presale Momentum and Market Readiness BlockDAG’s current presale status reinforces its delivery credibility. With over $410 million raised, 30 presale batches completed, and an early ROI of 2900% since batch one, the project offers clear metrics of demand. Its current pricing at $0.0016 offers a sharp discount relative to its $0.03 batch price, making the entry point even more attractive for speculative holders. The team has locked in 20 centralised exchange listings, including names like MEXC and BitMart, adding another layer of trust to the roadmap. This pricing structure and operational momentum influence price prediction models. Analysts tracking early-stage token sales often factor in tangible infrastructure as a multiplier for first-month returns. With BlockDAG launching its full testnet and miner devices in parallel, the ecosystem presents a rare alignment of technical maturity and investor-accessible pricing. By contrast, Solana’s price prediction trajectories remain more conservative, constrained by validator-only performance metrics and the lack of presale dynamics due to its already-listed status. Mining as an Entry Point vs Validator Centralisation Another point of divergence lies in how each project views decentralisation. BlockDAG enables users to mine from mobile phones using the X1 crypto mining app or through the plug-and-play X10–X100 hardware. This dual-layered Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Engagement model lowers the entry barrier and invites a broader demographic into mining. Solana’s validator setup, although efficient, is inherently limited to those with significant technical infrastructure or capital, reducing inclusivity across the broader crypto population. This difference may not appear urgent now, but it will have long-term implications for network health, participation diversity, and price prediction reliability. Networks that widen participation often enjoy more organic community engagement, leading to more resilient price floors during market corrections. Closing Analysis While Solana is refining its consensus and staking infrastructure, BlockDAG is delivering a full-stack system already live in testnet, complete with explorer tools, mining hardware , and account abstraction. BlockDAG’s $410 million fundraising, 2900% ROI since batch one, and aggressive deployment strategy present a clear case for near-term investor interest, particularly given its current $0.0016 coin price. Solana’s upgrades will likely sustain its position in high-frequency DeFi, but the absence of hardware-level delivery could limit its future price prediction upside in comparison. For investors weighing infrastructure readiness and pricing opportunity, BlockDAG may represent a more accessible and complete entry point in Q4 2025.

A senior European Space Agency executive stated Thursday that consolidation may be essential for European businesses to achieve the necessary size for global competition, though excessive concentration might restrict customer choices. These remarks were made as Airbus, Italy’s Leonardo, and France’s Thales pursue discussions about uniting their space-based operations. “Having only one in the future is not too helpful,” said Rolf Densing, who runs operations at the European Space Agency. “On the other hand, they need a critical mass of business, which I perfectly understand.” These three corporations, as reported by Reuters, are the sole European entities that manufacture complete space systems rather than separate components. Their planned collaboration, known as “Project Bromo,” seeks to establish a production giant capable of confronting rivals such as Elon Musk’s Starlink constellation and Chinese space enterprises. Michael Schoellhorn, who heads Airbus’ defense and space operations, informed an Italian publication Sunday that the firms might finalize their initial agreement before 2025 concludes. He clarified that transactions of this magnitude usually occur in two phases – initially, a fundamental framework deal, followed by steps toward final completion. “We’re on the right track, but several issues still need to be clarified before taking such a major step,” Schoellhorn said in his interview with Il Corriere della Sera. He added that he believes the initial signing could happen sometime in 2025. European firms struggle against US and Chinese competition The planned $11.68 billion collaboration emerges as European space enterprises face challenges keeping up with rapidly growing American and Chinese competitors. SpaceX’s Starlink has deployed thousands of satellites for worldwide internet service, while Chinese corporations continue expanding their space operations. The European Space Agency functions as Europe’s primary satellite purchaser, and its perspectives will probably influence European Commission officials who must approve any consolidation. The Commission holds authority to prevent deals it deems damaging to competition. Densing emphasized that Europe must decrease its reliance on other nations for space operations. Presently, European astronauts depend on foreign allies to reach orbit, a circumstance he described as troublesome given shifting international relationships. “Former good partners are now in a war,” Densing noted. “And NASA is probably today not what it used to be a couple of years ago.” This also underlines Trump’s plan to cut 6 billion from NASA’s budget as reported by Cryptopoliton previously. The expanding military significance of space technology has intensified the need for independence, according to Densing. “I’m convinced that the future of defense is in space, or at least that space plays a major role in this,” he said. European regulators back consolidation in space sector This year, European authorities demonstrated backing for space sector consolidation. In June, the European Commission cleared SES’s $3.1 billion acquisition of competitor Intelsat without restrictions. The Luxembourg-headquartered firm’s purchase establishes another significant European entity built to compete with SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon’s upcoming Project Kuiper satellite constellation. SES becomes part of additional European satellite enterprises pursuing greater scale to more effectively compete with American corporations that have aggressively entered space-based internet and communications markets. The consolidation talks underscore Europe’s wider challenge to stay competitive in the quickly evolving space sector, where American private enterprises and Chinese government-supported companies keep expanding their international presence.

52302013,317245,1758909002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/68/52302013.jpeg,Splyce and Chintai Launch S-Token to Bring Institutional RWAs to Solana DeFi,https://chainwire.org/2025/09/26/splyce-and-chintai-launch-s-token-to-bring-institutional-rwas-to-solana-defi/,"New York, New York, September 26th, 2025, Chainwire Splyce is pleased to announce a strategic partnership with Chintai to introduce institutional-grade tokenized securities to Solana's DeFi ecosystem through innovative strategy tokens, or ""S-Tokens."" This collaboration addresses a critical gap in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization by enabling retail DeFi users to access yield-bearing institutional assets without traditional KYC requirements or platform restrictions. Breaking Down RWA Barriers Through Innovation The partnership introduces S-Tokens, which mirror Chintai's tokenized securities through a compliant loan structure backed against the underlying assets. While users never directly hold Chintai's security tokens, they gain exposure to the yields through these DeFi-compatible mirror tokens, ensuring full compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. “When we started building on Solana, institutional RWAs were still just a theory. Today, they’re becoming a reality and this partnership makes them usable for the entire DeFi community,” said Tyler Carter, Co-founder of Splyce. Unlocking Institutional Access to DeFi Traditional RWA tokenization has created ""walled garden"" environments, accessible primarily to institutional investors. Retail participants are often forced to navigate cumbersome onboarding processes and provide extensive identifying information to access these platforms– a barrier most DeFi users are unwilling to accept. Splyce's compliance-structured approach eliminates these friction points by enabling users to interact with institutional-grade assets through their existing Web3 wallets. The S-Token structure maintains regulatory compliance while delivering the permissionless access that defines DeFi. Capitalizing on Solana's RWA Momentum This partnership arrives as Solana cements itself as the leading chain for real-world assets. RWAs represent a $400 trillion global market — yet less than 0.1% has moved onchain. Solana is rapidly capturing that opportunity, with RWA TVL already surpassing $600 million in 2025, up 3x since the start of the year. Major institutions like Apollo and Franklin Templeton have already established an onchain presence, validating Solana as the premier blockchain for institutional capital. As Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise, recently said: “Solana is architected to be the new Wall Street.” Until now, most of this growth has been confined to institutional platforms and walled gardens. Splyce and Chintai are the unlock. By introducing S-Tokens, they extend Solana’s RWA momentum to the broader DeFi ecosystem — enabling anyone with a wallet to access institutional-grade yields, trade them 24/7, and integrate them into DeFi strategies without traditional gatekeepers. Immediate Implementation and Future Expansion The partnership will launch with Kin Capital Fund as the inaugural Chintai-backed product on Splyce, providing a concrete example of institutional RWA integration with DeFi protocols. This launch demonstrates the platform's capability to bridge traditional finance and decentralized systems while maintaining regulatory compliance. The S-Token architecture enables sophisticated yield strategies previously unavailable to retail DeFi participants. Users can incorporate these institutional-grade assets into complex DeFi strategies, including liquidity provision, lending, and structured products, all while maintaining the yields from underlying real-world assets. Product Timeline and Market Impact Live product rollout is scheduled for October 2025, beginning with the Kin Capital fund. This timeline positions the partnership to capitalize on growing institutional interest in Solana while providing DeFi users with new yield opportunities. The collaboration represents a significant advancement in RWA accessibility, creating a framework that other institutional players can leverage to reach retail DeFi markets without compromising regulatory requirements. About Splyce Splyce is the home of real-world yield on Solana. The protocol brings institutional-grade assets onchain and makes them permissionless, composable, and available 24/7. Alongside yield products, Splyce is introducing decentralised ETFs (dETFs) that deliver instant diversification across crypto sectors and blended strategies in a single token. By combining institutional scale with DeFi accessibility, Splyce is building the distribution layer for RWAs on Solana. About Chintai Chintai is a regulated blockchain platform for real-world asset tokenization, providing institutional-grade infrastructure for compliant digital asset operations across multiple jurisdictions.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,443 and $15,841 with an average expected price of $13,824. In 2031, ETH could trade between $38,150 and $49,492 with an average price of $39,609. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $3,932 Market cap $475.99B Trading volume (24-hour) $59.75B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $4,021.79 24-hour low $3,829.01 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility $ 4,328.32 (11.41%) 50-day SMA $ 4,357.57 200-day SMA $ 2,984 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green days 13/30 (43%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis Ethereum is stabilizing around $3,938 support with resistance near $4,383 on the daily chart The 4-hour chart shows support at $3,843 and resistance at $4,065 with weakening bearish pressure Holding above $3,843 may lead to a retest of $4,065 and $4,200 while a drop below risks $3,700 Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum holds near $3,940 after drop from $4,800 resistance The 1-day chart for Ethereum on September 26 shows that it is starting to recover after a sharp drop. The price is bouncing back near $3,940 after recently dropping to $3,869. The RSI at 34.23 shows that the market is oversold, which means that buyers are starting to come in. Bollinger Bands show how volatile a market is. On the Bollinger Bands, ETH is trading near the lower band, which could mean that it will go up. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The MACD, on the other hand, is still deep in bearish territory, showing that the bounce is not enough to stop the strong downward trend. ETH needs to get back above $4,383 to get stronger. If rejected, the price could go back down to $3,800 or lower. Traders need to exercise some caution when trading, but there may be short-term relief rallies. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum holds $3,843 support while eyeing $4,065 resistance Ethereum (ETH) is trading close to $3,930 on the 4-hour chart after finding support around $3,843. The Bollinger Bands show the price hugging the lower band, which means that bearish pressure is still strong. However, there is a small bounce back. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The MACD is still negative, showing that the market is still going down, and the Balance of Power at -0.25 shows that sellers are in charge. ETH needs to get back above $4,065 and $4,287 for bullish momentum to start up again. If these levels don’t break, there could be a retest of $3,800 or lower. In general, ETH is stuck in a bearish channel, and any attempts to recover are facing strong resistance above.

Ethereum is starting to recover after a big drop. The 1-day chart shows that support is around $3,938 and resistance is around $4,383. The RSI at 48.77 shows that the momentum is neutral, and the Bollinger Bands show that the market is consolidating before making a big move. The 4-hour chart shows that there is immediate support at $3,843 and resistance at $4,065, and the price is trying to get back to where it was before. MACD is still bearish, but the selling pressure is getting weaker, which could mean that things are about to stabilize. If ETH stays above $3,843, it could try $4,065 and then $4,200. If this base isn’t kept up, though, the asset could go down even more, to $3,700. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $4,800 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $33,171 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with a potential high of $10,700. Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029. By 2029, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $23,496. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $49,492 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $49,492 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

These Signals Show Where The Market Is At,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bull-run-is-over/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a critical phase in its cycle, prompting analysts to debate whether the long-standing bull run is finally nearing its peak. With volatility tightening and historical cycle data indicating a potentially explosive breakout, market experts are closely watching the next few weeks for signals that reveal the market’s current position and future direction. Bitcoin Bull Run Cycle Nears Endgame Market analyst, ‘CRYPTOBIRD’ has warned that the Bitcoin bull run could end within 30 days. In a thread on X social media, he noted that this current cycle has now reached 1,038 days since the November 2022 bottom, which is equivalent to 97.5% of a standard cycle. Historically, the final 2.5% of Bitcoin’s bull runs have delivered the most dramatic price surges, often catching both retail and institutional investors off guard. Related Reading: These Analysts Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash And Their Forecasts Say It’s Not Over Examining the cycle bottom-to-top chart, BTC’s current market structure aligns closely with that of past cycles, where it experienced its largest accelerations just before cycle completion. The black line representing the current 2022-2025 trajectory shows Bitcoin consolidating after strong gains, much like the 2016 and 2020 cycles before their peaks. From a technical standpoint, the expert notes that BTC is trading in an unusually tight 5% range between $110,500 and $116,000, signaling heavy compression. However, the cryptocurrency recently broke down again and is now sitting slightly above $109,600. CRYPTOBIRD highlights key levels: 200-week SMA at $53,111 acting as long-term macro support, the 50-week SMA near $99,000 as the bull market floor and the SPX correlation (-0.19). The analyst explained that short-term structures remain mixed, with High Time Frame (HTF) support at $111,296 still intact. However, compression has created conditions where any breakout could set the tone for the remainder of the year. Furthermore, the Current Trend Framework (CTF) is at $114,916, signaling bearish periods. Presently, price is gravitating toward the 200-day BPRO at $112,250, and if Bitcoin can hold above it, bulls could remain in control. Halving Math Signals Final BTC Breakdown Continuing his analysis, CRYPTOBIRD emphasized that Bitcoin is now 523 days post-halving, placing it firmly within the historical “peak window” of 518-580 days after each halving event. Every previous major cycle top has occurred in this exact range, suggesting Bitcoin is entering the statistical sweet spot for its final move. Related Reading: Strategist Publishes Bitcoin ‘Cheat Code’ As Factors That Led To Previous ATHs Return Adding to the setup is the market’s present volatility squeeze. Average True Range (ATR) has dropped to 2,250, its lowest reading of 2025, while 50-day volatility sits at 2,800. The analyst notes that such compressed volatility rarely lasts and typically precedes a violent breakout within two to four weeks. Institutions also appear to be positioning accordingly, with Bitcoin ETF flows showing distribution. Sentiment indicators add another layer, as the Fear and Greed index stands at 44, indicating rising fear rather than euphoria. Meanwhile, RSI is neutral at 46, suggesting that momentum has cooled but not collapsed. Despite September’s reputation as Bitcoin’s weakest month, CRYPTOBIRD notes that it gained 4.4% month-to-date, defying its historical 6.2% decline. This anomaly, combined with October, which is typically seen as a green month, could set the stage for a bullish Q4.

The popular chatbot Grok claimed that the cycle top may occur in the next few months. Don’t Call It Quits Yet The primary cryptocurrency hasn’t been in its best shape lately, tumbling by 6% in the past week and briefly slipping below $109,000. The negative performance has caused some critics of the digital asset industry, such as the economist Peter Schiff, to argue that Bitcoin has entered a bear market. Some popular AI-powered chatbots, though, don’t agree with his assumption. According to ChatGPT, BTC is experiencing a mid-cycle correction, indicating that the bull run is not yet over. It reminded that such drops are standard and have occurred during previous similar phases. “Right now, the pullback from ~$124K to ~$108K is in line with those historical retracements,” ChatGPT estimated. In addition, the chatbot noted that whales continue to increase their possessions, which signals increased confidence and may set the stage for a resurgence in the short term. At the same time, ChatGPT outlined the $95,000-$100,000 range as a critical support level that could flip toward a true bear market if broken to the downside. GROK, the AI chatbot built into the social media platform X, shares a similar opinion. It acknowledged the substantial price correction but at the same time claimed that the broader market structure, historical cycle patterns, and institutional momentum all point to more upside ahead, potentially peaking in Q4 2025 or early 2026. The chatbot estimated that a post-halving bull market typically culminates 518-550 days later, placing the top between now and November this year. In addition, it outlined that BTC’s RSI has entered oversold territory, which may be followed by a rally , whereas exchange balances have not spiked with profit-taking. ‘A Complex Transitional Phase?’ According to Perplexity, BTC’s bull run is not definitely over, but appears to be at a challenging turning point. “While there was a correction phase, some new signals indicate a potential start of a fresh bull run, with buying pressure increasing and selling pressure on exchanges at cycle lows. The weakening US Dollar also supports a positive outlook for Bitcoin price,” the chatbot suggested. Additionally, it claimed that the ongoing market setup resembles the one prior to the “2020 legendary bull run.” Last but not least, it expects further Fed rate cuts in the following months to help Bitcoin regain its strength.

That sense of inevitability is exactly what prominent trader Gordon highlighted in his recent post on X. Here’s a closer look at why his view is resonating, what the charts reveal, and the key factors shaping XRP’s next move. Market Snapshot: Price and Momentum XRP is currently trading at $2.73 after a week of choppy action marked by profit-taking and broader market weakness. Recent daily data shows noticeable intraday volatility as traders weigh global risk sentiment against crypto-specific catalysts. Despite this turbulence, XRP remains one of the more liquid and actively watched assets in the digital-asset space. It doesn't take a genius to see what happens next for $XRP … pic.twitter.com/pq3rAx8L47 — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) September 26, 2025 A Classic Breakout Setup Gordon’s shared chart highlights two sharp downward trendlines and a textbook “bull flag” formation . The pattern begins with a steep rally, followed by a tightening consolidation phase beneath a new resistance line. Technical analysts note that a decisive close above this upper boundary, supported by strong volume, often signals a fresh leg higher. Historically, similar slope-resistance breaks in XRP have led to extended multi-week surges, a precedent that strengthens Gordon’s argument. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Levels to Watch For traders, the signals are clear. A sustained daily close above the $3.30–$3.40 resistance band , accompanied by rising volume, would confirm a bullish breakout and open the door to targets significantly higher—some analysts suggest gains of 50–70% from that level. On the downside, a failure to clear resistance and a drop below the $2.60–$2.80 zone would indicate a failed breakout, likely sending XRP back into a prolonged range. The Takeaway Gordon’s statement that “it doesn’t take a genius to see what happens next” is more than bravado. It reflects a powerful combination: a clean technical setup and a regulatory environment finally free of the uncertainties that have held XRP back. The next decisive move will depend on volume and confirmation, but the chart’s geometry and improved fundamentals give this potential breakout an undeniable logic. Traders and long-term investors alike will be watching closely because once the trigger fires, hesitation may prove costly.

Neura , developed by a former Microsoft AI team, is an emotional AI startup built on Web3 principles. The company has now secured the backing of MH Ventures, CSP DAO, IBC Group, Grammy-winning artist Ne-Yo, and entrepreneur Mario Nawfal. While most AI innovation has focused on logic, efficiency, and generative scale, Neura is betting that the next leap will come not from higher IQ, but from deeper EQ. The company is developing agents that don’t just respond to queries but can remember emotional context, adapt to personalities, and maintain coherent emotional continuity over time. Neura’s architecture fuses multimodal processing, emotion-conditioned decoding, and cultural adaptation to deliver interactions that feel less like a transaction with software and more like a relationship with a presence. In early testing, the company reports that 91.4 percent affect recognition and a 78 percent user retention rate after 90 days—figures that suggest people may be ready for AI that resonates emotionally. What makes Neura stand out further is its Web3-native design. By anchoring its agents in decentralized infrastructure, Neura ensures that users own their data and digital relationships rather than ceding them to centralized platforms. This design choice reflects a broader shift toward user sovereignty in the next wave of the internet. “AI has already proven it can reason and generate. The next leap isn’t IQ—it’s EQ,” the Neura team told investors, positioning the company as an emotional layer for the emerging decentralized web. The potential use cases are far-reaching. In healthcare, Neura agents could provide continuity in therapy and elder care. In education, they could track and adapt to student engagement in real time. In retail, recommendations could shift with mood rather than clicks. And in entertainment, emotionally evolving NPCs could create more lifelike digital worlds. The mix of institutional backers and cultural figures suggests Neura is gaining traction not just in venture circles but also in mainstream awareness. Ne-Yo, who has long been active at the intersection of technology and entertainment, joins Nawfal and several Web3-native investment groups in betting that emotional intelligence will define the next phase of AI adoption. If Neura delivers on its vision, by 2030 emotionally aware AI agents may be as foundational to digital life as search engines or social media are today—except this time, powered by empathy, owned by users, and built for connection.

COIN is expanding into financial services and stablecoins, which could drive long-term growth, but crypto volatility remains a key risk. CONY's strategy of covered calls has capped upside, and recent performance lagged COIN, raising concerns about management's strategy execution. Given the high expense ratio and lack of evidence for effective options management, we rate CONY as a sell despite its appealing concept. Introduction The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) is a fund that seeks to provide consistent income derived from the monthly selling of call options on the underlying company, Coinbase. This ETF pursues a strategy that gives investors strong yields on their investment while getting some exposure to the COIN price gains. Please refer to the below for some key facts about the fund, taken from the prospectus . YieldMax The average volume is 18.2M , which is very liquid. Below, we will examine some of the latest news from the underlying security, COIN, and review some of the factors that could make COIN and CONY move. COIN Recent News Coinbase is investing heavily in partner firms and the broader financial ecosystem Recently, Coinbase partnered with Cardless, a firm that raised $60M in their Series C to transform the credit card world. The platform focuses on APIs and plug and play components to build a product for users that can drive faster decisioning, personalized offers to clients, and faster iteration. This goes hand in hand with the recent release of the Coinbase One credit card , which gives users 4% back in bitcoin on all purchases. This is a sign that COIN is looking to diversify in the financial services space and expand out from their roots of purely cryptocurrency. We view this as an example of something to keep an eye on, as new announcements like this could move the markets and cause the underlying shares to move in a very volatile manner. Coinbase is expanding further into stablecoins, which have strong financial institution use case possibilities The firm revealed participation in a stablecoin infrastructure company called Bastion in their $14.6M funding round. This firm is developing a platform that allows companies to issue stablecoins without having to secure their own licenses or build custom routing and infrastructure, and we believe that this is big news. The stablecoin platform Circle IPO’ed this summer, and investors have been looking to get exposure through them for stablecoin access. We view this as strong potential for Coinbase—there have been reports that institutions and corporate investors and treasuries are looking to expand their exposure to stablecoins. If Coinbase can take a larger slice of this pie and become more diversified in their client base outside of retail, this could be a boon for the company. Coinbase leadership is very bullish on Bitcoin, and if their forecasts pan out, there will be a high volume of user activity on the platform Naturally, the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, is very bullish on the future price action of bitcoin. We believe that his sky-high valuation for the cryptocurrency is rooted in supply/demand fundamentals, but no matter which way you stand on the price of Bitcoin, it is to be expected that if the price of the most popular cryptocurrency goes up dramatically, there should be a corresponding spike in Coin users. Further, with the current administration being so open to cryptocurrencies, the next few years should remain a positive environment for all things related to crypto, and this should be a positive for the firm overall as well. It remains imperative that the firm continue to expand and meet its operating goals, as competition could very easily heat up in this space amidst this very bullish environment and backdrop. Fund Strategy YieldMax does not purchase shares of COIN directly. Instead, they trade options contracts in a manner that returns mimic the price movement of COIN. This is called “synthetically owning COIN”. For our purposes, we will assume the fund owns COIN directly as the effects are largely the same. After getting synthetic exposure to COIN, YieldMax employs one of 2 strategies: Selling Covered Calls. Selling a Covered Call Spread. Let’s explore the “Selling Covered Calls” strategy first. In this strategy, the fund will sell call options that have a strike price higher than the current price of COIN. To visualize we look at the following example: We own 100 shares of COIN purchased at $50. The current price is also $50. We sell a call option on COIN with a strike price of $60 and a total premium of $200. With this scenario, we chart out our total gains that we will see with and without the option: Doodad Capital We see that for lower prices of COIN, the covered call strategy is slightly better. This is because at prices under $60 (the strike price of the option), the option will not be exercised. Therefore your returns will mimic COIN returns, but with an additional $200 you made from selling the option. After COIN increases past $160, your returns from the covered call strategy flatten out and the shares-only strategy quickly becomes better. This is because after COIN increases past $160, the option will be exercised so you would sell all the shares of COIN for $60. The line flattens out because after exercise you no longer own the option or the shares so there is no change in value. As we see, this strategy is good for investors who want to reduce downside risk and believe that COIN will not increase by a large amount before the option expires. Now let’s look at selling a covered call spread strategy. In this strategy, you would buy a call option with a strike price that is above the current price of COIN and then sell a call option that has a higher strike than the first one. Again, let’s use an example to illustrate: We own 100 shares of COIN purchased at $50. The current price is also $50. We buy a $60 strike call option for $200. We sell an $80 strike call option for $100. Doodad Capital We see here that at generally lower prices, the shares-only strategy is slightly better. This is because at prices below the strike prices of the options, the options will not be exercised. So your returns will mimic the returns of COIN plus the net proceeds from the call options. The net proceeds are the total value of premiums earned/spent. Since the call option you buy is at a lower strike price, it will cost more than the premium you get from the call option you sell. In this case, the net proceeds are $200 - $100 = $100. After the price of COIN hits the strike of the purchased call option (in this case $60), you would exercise that option and would then own 100 additional shares of COIN. This is why the line gets steeper—because you now own double the shares. After COIN increases past the next call option (in this case $80), the purchaser of that call option will exercise, so you will effectively sell 100 shares of COIN at $80 each. The line gets shallower here because the number of shares you own gets halved, back to the original $100. We see that this strategy is good to use when you believe that COIN will increase in value above the lower call strike (technically, a little above that to offset the loss from the options proceeds). This strategy is also relatively helpful on the downside. Yes, you will lose more money than you would with the shares-only strategy. However, that difference in loss is capped at -$100 (the net proceeds). Other options strategies have a much larger loss on the downside. To recap, the CONY will use the covered call strategy when it believes COIN will decline in value or only increase by a modest amount. When CONY believes COIN has a lot of upside potential, it will use the covered call spread strategy so that gains are not capped. Performance We look at the performance of CONY over the past year compared to COIN. Seeking Alpha We see that while COIN increased by 84%, CONY only increased by 31%. This is likely due to the capped gains from the covered call strategy. We see that while COIN had a downtrend from February 2025 until early April, the returns of CONY caught up with the returns of COIN. This can be explained by the left side of the covered call strategy chart we explored above. With that strategy, when COIN goes down, you also lose value, but less so. We also see that in the uptrend for COIN from April 2025 through mid-July 2025, the performance of COIN outpaced the performance of CONY. This is likely due to the nature of the covered call strategy where your gains are capped after COIN increases above a certain level. Risks A sharp drop in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies could lead to adverse returns for COIN and CONY If major cryptos lose a significant amount of value in a short-term period, which is highly possible given the volatility of the market, it could cause COIN to underperform, which could negatively impact CONY as well. This is a risk that all investors with any exposure to the crypto markets should be aware of. Higher expense ratio could lead to negative returns because of the erosion of the already slim margins over the underlying Per the first graph above, we can see that CONY outperforms holding COIN outright by only a slim margin under a certain price point, and since the expense ratio is pretty high at 0.99%, it eats away at these already paper-thin margins. This could definitely cause CONY investors to look for alternatives, which could be a risk to stay aware of. Conclusion Coinbase has been steadily expanding its financial services portfolio beyond that of just retail trading of cryptocurrencies, and these include partnerships with innovative card product firms and stablecoin issuers. It also benefits from higher general interest in cryptos and should benefit from the backdrop of this crypto-friendly administration. However, after reviewing the performance of CONY compared to COIN, we question the management's ability to correctly employ their options strategies. If instead of the covered call strategy, the fund had used the covered call spread strategy during the uptrend starting in April 2025, the performance of CONY would have been much better, and possibly even higher than that of COIN. While the fund claims to potentially use either of the 2 strategies depending on the market conditions, the performance over the past 1 year only shows evidence of the covered call strategy being used, even when the covered call spread strategy would have been much better. In general, we like the strategy of CONY on paper. However, we do not see evidence of effective management of the strategies. This is disappointing to see for a fund with such a high expense ratio. As a result, at this time we rate CONY as a sell.",CONY,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-26 18:11:44

The current price setup closely matches DOGE’s 2015–2017 structure before it broke higher. $0.22 remains a key support zone that must hold for the trend to stay intact. Monthly RSI Structure Points to Defined Market Phases Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing a clear long-term pattern based on its monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI), according to analyst Trader Tardigrade. The chart separates the market into three stages: Accumulating, Hodling, and Selling zones. Notably, the Accumulating zone appears when RSI is low, which has historically aligned with quiet price action and long periods of sideways trading. This was seen before major rallies in 2017 and 2021. The Hodling zone follows, where RSI begins to climb, and price momentum starts to build. The final phase is the Selling zone, reached when RSI spikes to extreme levels. Historical data indicate that this area typically marks the peak of DOGE cycles. At the moment, RSI is rising but still below the Selling zone. Trader Tardigrade stated, $Doge /monthly #Dogecoin monthly RSI offers a simple strategy: – Buy in the Accumulating zone – Hodl in the Hodling zone – Sell only in the Selling zone I just want to say: Don’t sell any of your DOGE before the RSI reaches the Selling zone. pic.twitter.com/EXZxb1JUeV — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) September 26, 2025 This suggests that the current structure may still have room to move upward. Price Action Repeats Earlier Breakout Pattern A separate chart from the same analyst shows that DOGE may be repeating the price structure last seen between 2015 and 2017. In that cycle, the asset formed a base, broke above key resistance, and entered a strong trend. The 2025 breakout appears to be developing in a similar way, with resistance levels and pattern shape closely matching the earlier cycle. Source: Trader Tardigrade/X DOGE was trading at $0.22 at press time. It has declined 4% in the past 24 hours and 19% over the last seven days. Daily trading volume is over $3.83 billion. Support at $0.22 Remains Important for Short-Term Setup Analyst Ali Martinez shared a daily chart showing DOGE inside a rising triangle. The lower trendline of the structure is near $0.22, which also matches the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.2288. According to Ali Martinez, Dogecoin $DOGE must hold $0.22 for a potential rebound to the triangle’s x-axis at $0.29! pic.twitter.com/ZhgcCMAjue — Ali (@ali_charts) September 26, 2025 The chart outlines a possible consolidation within the triangle, followed by an upward move if support holds. A drop below $0.22 could open the way for further losses toward $0.20 or $0.19. Structure Holds, But Needs Higher Lows to Continue Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that DOGE has moved steadily upward since April 2025, forming higher highs and higher lows. He noted that this has not been a smooth trend, but it remains intact. The price is currently above both the daily 200-day EMA at $0.22 and the 200-day MA at $0.20, which are key levels to maintain. I think $DOGE summarizes the market pretty well the past few months. Yes, most coins are up since the April lows, especially the majors. But as you can see, it is moving up very slowly making marginally higher highs and higher lows.

When a project captures the attention of early investors, it can set off a chain reaction that leads to legendary success. This is precisely what is happening with Ruvi AI (RUVI), as early investor demand has driven its Phase 3 presale to 20% completion in just a matter of days. This explosive start is positioning Ruvi AI as a top contender to the legacy of established giants like Ripple (XRP). The numbers behind this surge are a testament to the project’s incredible potential. Ruvi AI has officially rocketed past the $4 million fundraising milestone, with over 285 million tokens sold in a timeframe that has caught the market’s attention. Analysts are highlighting this achievement, noting that such rapid sales velocity is a rare feat, typically seen only with projects that go on to become industry pillars. This momentum has built a global community of over 3,900 holders . The demand is undeniable; after a rapid sell-out of Phase 2, Ruvi AI saw its Phase 3 supply begin to vanish at an accelerated rate. A New Contender to an Established Legacy The comparison to Ripple’s legacy is rooted in a shared foundation of utility and trust. XRP built its legacy by providing a clear, tangible solution for cross-border payments, earning the confidence of both retail and institutional players. Ruvi AI is now following a similar path, but for the digital age. It combines the explosive upside of a low-cap project with the powerful AI narrative, all while being grounded in a mission to revolutionize the massive $104 billion creator economy . This focus on utility is backed by a foundation of credibility. A successful smart contract audit by CyberScope has verified its security, and a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap provides the transparency that serious investors demand. This combination of real-world application and verified security is what makes Ruvi AI a legitimate contender to the market’s established leaders. The Super App Fueling the Investor Frenzy The engine driving this investor frenzy is Ruvi AI’s game-changing super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, which will in turn generate powerful, organic demand for the RUVI token. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving users a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for platforms like YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the application. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency and output. Final Call: Lock In Your Price Before a 40% Increase The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at just $0.020 . With 20% of this stage already claimed in days, this entry point is rapidly closing. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to secure a guaranteed paper gain. The project’s VIP bonus structure is designed to maximize this ground-floor opportunity: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A strategic partnership with the major exchange WEEX ensures future liquidity, while a competitive leaderboard giveaway rewards early supporters, strengthening its unstoppable momentum. The Legacy Begins Now As early investors continue to pour into the presale, the message is clear. Ruvi AI has the momentum, the utility, and the explosive potential to build a legacy that could one day rival the giants of the crypto world. For those looking to be part of the next big success story, the opportunity is now.

That change matters because it alters the company’s revenue mix and the kinds of customers it courts. Market watchers point to similar moves by other miners, including Cipher Mining, where big tech ties have helped land large hosting deals. Still, building and operating large data centers takes time, steady power, and careful cost control. Balance Sheet And Credit Questions Investors are watching TeraWulf’s current finances. Some sources cite a debt-to-equity ratio near 2.96 and negative interest coverage, which helps explain why the company is turning to the high-yield or loan markets. TeraWulf Stock Up Meanwhile, TeraWulf’s stock has been highly volatile, with a sharp 10% spike on Thursday to $11.72 before slipping to close down 3.5% at $10.95 in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. The intraday swing reflects how quickly traders are reacting to fresh headlines around the company. The stock had already seen a huge boost in August, when the announcement of Google’s backing and a multibillion-dollar hosting deal sent shares soaring 80% within days. Since the start of 2025, WULF has gained over 90%, making it one of the stronger performers among crypto-linked infrastructure firms. Analysts see the moves as a mix of optimism and caution. The Google connection and AI data center pivot have fueled bullish sentiment, but debt risks and execution challenges keep investors quick to lock in profits. The result is a stock that reacts strongly to news and remains speculative despite its big year-to-date gains.

When price action tightens and volatility sinks to extreme lows, the next breakout can unfold quickly and with surprising force. XRP now finds itself in precisely that situation, drawing the close attention of traders who remember how swiftly the token has surged after similar periods of calm. Technical Snapshot As of report time, XRP is confined to a narrow trading range between $2.75. This compression is unmistakable on the three-day XRP/USD chart, where Bollinger Bands—a popular measure of volatility—have contracted sharply. The upper band sits near $3.21, while the lower band hovers around $2.60, signaling a steep drop in realized volatility and a market coiled for expansion. Notably, respected market commentator Steph Is Crypto highlighted this setup on X, describing it as a classic Bollinger Band squeeze . Historically, such squeezes often precede powerful directional moves once volatility inevitably re-expands. #XRP volatility is at record lows. HUGE move imminent! pic.twitter.com/wm909l66hQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 26, 2025 Lessons From History XRP has had similar periods of consolidation in the past, and each time, a significant surge in volume and price followed. Earlier in 2025, similar squeezes preceded rallies that caught many traders off guard. While history never guarantees a repeat, it explains why analysts and active traders are preparing for a potentially significant move. Broader Market Context Technical signals are not the only factors fueling interest. XRP benefits from a markedly improved regulatory backdrop. The long-running U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case against Ripple concluded in August, with both parties withdrawing their appeals. This resolution removes a major cloud that had weighed on investor sentiment for years, giving market participants greater confidence to position for future gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Signals to Monitor A Bollinger Band squeeze only predicts heightened volatility, not the direction of the breakout. Traders will watch closely for a daily or three-day close outside the band accompanied by strong volume, which would suggest the start of a trend. Until that confirmation arrives, the market could move sharply either way. Failed breakouts and sudden reversals are common, making prudent risk management essential. Outlook Steph Is Crypto’s analysis underscores what many chart watchers already suspect: XRP is approaching a critical juncture. With volatility at record lows and the Bollinger Bands at their tightest in months, the market is poised for a decisive expansion. Whether that move launches XRP higher or triggers a deeper pullback will depend on the first sustained breakout and broader macro forces. For now, the chart is sending a clear message—a major move is coming, and traders who ignore the quiet may be caught off guard when the noise returns.

What matters here is that Masayoshi Son and Cathie Wood are seriously considering writing huge checks for Tether, the company behind the world’s biggest stablecoin, USDT. The El Salvador-based company is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion by selling just 3% of itself in a private round. Masayoshi’s SoftBank and Cathie’s Ark are part of a very small group of investors who’ve made it to the shortlist . Neither Tether nor SoftBank gave Bloomberg any comment, and Ark said they had nothing to add. But this thing is very much alive. SoftBank and Ark Invest step deeper into crypto Both firms are known for betting early and big on risky tech plays. Masayoshi has dropped billions into semiconductors, AI, and robotics. He’s also planning to throw $30 billion at OpenAI. Cathie, who’s been all over crypto for years, already backed Circle, the closest competitor to Tether, with a market cap of $74 billion. But Tether’s token pile is sitting at $173.5 billion right now. That’s more than double Circle’s, and both of them are publicly visible on-chain. As Cryptopolitan previously reported , this new deal could put Tether up there with the most valuable private companies on Earth. But the real shock is what it could mean for the people running the show. If the $500 billion number sticks, Chairman Giancarlo Devasini would instantly become the fifth-richest person in the world, sitting just behind Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, and Jeff Bezos. His stake alone would be worth $224 billion, blowing past Warren Buffett. CEO Paolo Ardoino and former CEO Jean-Louis van der Velde would each be worth around $95 billion, landing them among the 20 richest people alive. Another major shareholder, Stuart Hoegner, would hit $60 billion. Every single one of them would end up wealthier than Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who’s sitting on $52 billion right now. Jeremy Allaire, who co-founded Circle, is worth about $2.6 billion in comparison. Cantor Fitzgerald’s hands are all over the deal Behind the scenes, Cantor Fitzgerald is steering the whole process. The firm is not just Tether’s lead adviser, it actually manages the company’s reserves and holds a convertible bond from them. Cantor has been around for decades, but now it’s making serious cash from crypto. The firm was long led by Howard Lutnick, who’s now the U.S. Commerce Secretary under President Donald Trump. Yeah, Trump is back in the White House, and one of his cabinet members is directly tied to the hottest crypto deal of the year. USDT, the stablecoin issued by Tether, is pegged to the dollar and backed by assets like U.S. Treasuries. That setup lets users move cash without relying on banks. The company earns profit from interest on its reserves, which are invested in short-term government debt. It’s simple, but it prints money. Despite all that money, Tether has taken heat for years, especially in the U.S., over allegations that it’s been used in shady transactions. That’s part of why they want this deal.

From early setbacks to becoming a reference Jairo’s story does not begin with millionaire figures or a privileged position in an investment bank. On the contrary: his first steps in trading were full of mistakes and frustrations—experiences that for many would have meant the end of the road. But for him, they became essential lessons. “Each fall was hidden training for what would come later,” he recalls. That early learning cemented the discipline and mindset he teaches his students today: to see every mistake as an opportunity for growth. A vision from Dubai for the world Based in Dubai, a global financial hub that connects East and West, Jairo has leveraged the city’s strategic position to deliver his message to an international audience. His approach combines quantitative analysis, emotional management, and macroeconomic vision, but what truly sets him apart is his ability to translate complexity into practical strategies that anyone, regardless of prior experience, can understand and apply. A close and accessible mentor Thousands of traders from Europe, America, and Asia have already benefited from his guidance. What his students value most is not only the technical accuracy of his teachings but also his closeness and personal commitment. Jairo answers questions, shares real experiences, and accompanies his students in the process of moving from theory to practice. This closeness has built a strong global community where beginners find support and more advanced traders discover new perspectives to refine their strategies. From students to confident traders The impact is evident: many who once started without direction now trade with security and confidence, making clear decisions and understanding the importance of risk management. Jairo’s true legacy is not only charts or profitability metrics but the personal and professional transformation of his students. “Training traders is much more than teaching how to enter or exit a trade; it’s about teaching how to think, how to remain calm, and how to build sustainable results over time,” he states. An inspiring reference in financial education Beyond being an experienced trader, Jairo Alonso has become a global educational reference, inspiring thousands to believe that achieving financial freedom is possible with discipline, proper training, and quality mentorship. From Dubai, he continues to expand his mission of creating a new generation of conscious, responsible traders prepared for the challenges of modern markets. His message is simple yet powerful: success in trading is not measured by speed, but by consistency and long-term vision. And under that premise, Dr. Cuantic continues to make a difference in the lives of those who choose to learn with him.

52304166,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=210006,1758913811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/52304166.jpeg,Unveiling Trump’s Potential Shift on US Long-Range Weapons Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-long-range-weapons-policy/,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling Trump’s Potential Shift on US Long-Range Weapons Policy Recent reports from The Wall Street Journal indicate a significant potential shift in international policy, suggesting that President Donald Trump is open to reconsidering restrictions on the use of US long-range weapons inside Russia. This development, if it comes to fruition, could mark a pivotal moment in geopolitical strategy, prompting widespread discussion and analysis among policymakers and global observers alike. What Does Lifting Restrictions on US Long-Range Weapons Mean? Currently, there are understood limitations regarding how U.S.-made weaponry, particularly those with extended reach, can be employed by allies. These restrictions often dictate that such armaments should not be used for direct strikes within Russian territory. Lifting these restrictions would essentially grant greater operational flexibility to nations utilizing these US long-range weapons . This potential policy change could empower allies with more autonomy in defending their sovereignty and responding to perceived threats. Moreover, it could signal a more assertive stance from the United States regarding its approach to international conflicts. Why Is This Policy Shift Being Considered Now? The timing of this consideration is crucial. Global tensions remain elevated, and the dynamics of international conflicts are constantly evolving. Therefore, discussions around strategic capabilities, including the deployment and use of US long-range weapons , are often influenced by the current geopolitical landscape. It is plausible that such a move aims to: Enhance deterrence capabilities against aggression. Provide stronger support to allies facing external pressures. Realign U.S. foreign policy to adapt to new global challenges. This reported openness suggests a strategic re-evaluation of existing doctrines, aiming to bolster security frameworks in a complex world. What Are the Potential Geopolitical Ramifications? A decision to lift restrictions on US long-range weapons use could have far-reaching consequences. On one hand, it might be viewed by some as a necessary step to rebalance power dynamics and ensure stability. It could provide a stronger deterrent, potentially discouraging escalations by adversaries. On the other hand, critics might express concerns about the potential for escalation. They could argue that such a move might be perceived as provocative, leading to heightened tensions rather than de-escalation. The international community would undoubtedly scrutinize any such policy change, weighing its implications for global peace and security. Challenges and Considerations for US Long-Range Weapons Policy Implementing such a significant policy shift is not without its challenges. Decision-makers would need to carefully consider several factors: International Law: Ensuring compliance with international legal frameworks and conventions. Allied Consensus: Building and maintaining consensus among key allies, as their cooperation is vital. Risk Assessment: Thoroughly evaluating the potential for unintended consequences or retaliatory actions. Public Perception: Managing domestic and international public opinion regarding the change. The discussion around US long-range weapons highlights the delicate balance between asserting national interests and maintaining global stability. Any decision would require meticulous planning and diplomacy to navigate the complex web of international relations. In conclusion, President Trump’s reported openness to lifting restrictions on the use of U.S.-made long-range weapons inside Russia represents a significant policy consideration with profound geopolitical implications. This potential shift underscores the ongoing re-evaluation of international defense strategies and the continuous effort to adapt to an ever-changing global environment. The world will be watching closely to see how these discussions evolve and what impact they may ultimately have on the future of international relations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are US long-range weapons? US long-range weapons typically refer to military armaments manufactured in the United States that possess the capability to strike targets at significant distances, often beyond conventional battlefield ranges. This can include various missile systems, artillery, or aerial platforms. Q2: What restrictions are currently in place for these weapons? Existing restrictions often involve agreements or understandings that prevent allies using U.S.-supplied weaponry from directly targeting territory within Russia. These limitations are generally in place to manage escalation risks and maintain certain geopolitical boundaries. Q3: How would lifting these restrictions impact international relations? Lifting these restrictions could be seen as a more assertive stance by the U.S. and its allies, potentially increasing deterrence but also raising concerns about escalation among some international observers. It could lead to a re-evaluation of defense postures globally. Q4: Who reported on President Trump’s openness to this policy change? The report regarding President Trump’s openness to this policy change was published by The Wall Street Journal, a reputable source for financial and business news, which often covers broader political and international developments. Q5: Is this policy change confirmed? As of the report, President Trump has indicated an openness to the possibility, but it is not a confirmed or enacted policy change. Such decisions typically involve extensive internal discussions, consultations with allies, and careful strategic considerations.

Increasingly, they are leasing their energy footprints to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing clients. The model is not speculative; it is already being written into multiyear contracts. In September, Cipher Mining signed a 168-megawatt agreement with Fluidstack, an AI cloud provider. The deal runs for ten years and is valued at $3 billion. Google provided financing support worth $1.4 billion and also acquired a 5% equity stake in Cipher. The arrangement allows Cipher to maintain ownership of its facilities while converting part of its power allocation into contracted AI revenue. Cipher Mining Signs 168 MW, 10-Year AI Hosting Agreement with Fluidstack In this transaction, Cipher will deliver 168 MW of Critical IT Load to Fluidstack at its Barber Lake site, securing ~$3B in contracted revenue over the initial 10-year term. The agreement also includes two… — Cipher Mining (@CipherInc) September 25, 2025 TeraWulf, another U.S.-based miner , followed a similar path. It announced hosting agreements that dedicate more than 200 megawatts to AI workloads at its Lake Mariner site. Analysts estimate the value of the deal could exceed $3.7 billion. Contracts That Change Miner Balance Sheets The financial character of these companies is beginning to change. Miner equity has historically traded with a high correlation to the price of Bitcoin. New long-dated contracts give investors a different risk profile to consider. Regular dollar-denominated payments from AI customers may reduce the exposure of miner stocks to Bitcoin cycles. Iren, an Australian operator, provides an example. It recently expanded its AI cloud business by purchasing more than 12,000 GPUs. The company projects $500 million in annual AI revenue by early 2026. Analysts at Arete initiated coverage on Iren, Riot Platforms, and Cipher Mining with buy ratings, citing the stability of contracted AI revenue as a driver. The case of CoreWeave and Core Scientific stresses the point. CoreWeave, once an Ethereum miner, shifted into GPU-based hosting. In 2025, it acquired Core Scientific in a transaction valued at $9 billion. The deal cemented its place as a supplier of computing power for AI firms, moving entirely beyond token mining. Why the AI Shift Is Different The entry into AI hosting is not simply diversification. It forces miners to rethink operations. Unlike Bitcoin mining, AI customers demand strict service level agreements. Data centers must offer redundancy, cooling efficiency, and long-term maintenance commitments. In practice, this means capital is redeployed from short-cycle ASIC purchases toward infrastructure upgrades that support higher-density workloads. There is also the allocation question. Every megawatt committed to AI hosting cannot be used for Bitcoin mining. Operators will have to balance the immediate predictability of contracted revenue with the option value of a potential Bitcoin price rally. From Hashprice to Lease Price The mining business has long been tied to hashprice, the dollar value of one terahash of computing power per day. That metric is now being supplemented by what could be called lease price, the value of contracted power sold to external clients. In time, the lease price may become as influential for valuation models as the hash price itself. This shift has implications for the broader network. If miners dedicate more capacity to external hosting, the growth of network hash rate may slow. That could alter the competitive dynamics among remaining pure miners and impact difficulty adjustments. At the same time, the capital stability provided by AI contracts could keep some firms alive through periods of low Bitcoin prices, preventing sharp declines in total hash rate. A Changing Capital Formation Cycle The sector’s capital cycle is also adjusting. Past expansions were often financed during bull markets when high margins justified the rapid purchase of machines. Now, multi-year AI contracts provide the collateral base for raising capital in less favorable markets. That changes the rhythm of how mining infrastructure is built. The long-term outcome is not that AI erases mining. Rather, it layers another economic activity on top of the same infrastructure. For investors, miner equities may look less like high-beta proxies for Bitcoin and more like hybrid firms that combine commodity-linked income with contracted service revenue.

The crash started snowballing after Ether dropped a steep 12%, its worst weekly drop since the middle of the year. That fall sent it crashing below $4,000, a level traders had been watching like hawks for months. Bitcoin, the industry’s benchmark, took a 5% hit, its biggest weekly fall since March, and now floats at the low end of its trading band. Traders got crushed when billions in bullish positions blew up in the perpetual futures market. Over $3 billion in long positions were liquidated across various exchanges as the market flipped direction hard. And that figure might not even capture the whole mess since most platforms don’t reveal full liquidation numbers. The whole thing triggered a cascade effect across crypto, sending prices lower across the board. Despite a brief pause on Friday, when new inflation numbers gave the Federal Reserve room to breathe, the bounce barely lifted the mood. Crypto is still bleeding. Bitcoin ETFs post major outflows while corporate buyers disappear Thursday was another rough session, with Bitcoin and Ether ETFs listed in the U.S. seeing more than $500 million in total outflows. That same day, Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said, “Bitcoin’s fall below $109,000 is a sign this market’s overheated and headed into a cooling phase.” That level hadn’t been broken since early September. The dip came as the appetite from institutional buyers completely dried up. Those corporate treasuries that were loading up on crypto during the summer are now pulling back hard. In July, they bought 64,000 Bitcoin. But in August, it dropped to 12,600. This month, they’ve only bought 15,500 so far. That’s a 76% plunge compared to the previous buying spree. The numbers come from CryptoQuant, and they show exactly how fast interest has died. Firms that used to raise money through PIPE deals, private investments in public equity, are now seeing their stocks trading 97% below their initial price. These companies were once seen as stable buyers of crypto, holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets like digital gold. The idea was that corporate treasuries, pension funds, and public firms would lock up Bitcoin long-term and help anchor the market. Now, that theory is falling apart. With less cash and no incentive, these players aren’t stepping in anymore. Paul Howard, senior director at market-making firm Wincent, called the pullback a “healthy correction.” But he didn’t pretend everything’s fine. With Bitcoin now below its 100-day average and total crypto market cap back under $4 trillion, Paul warned that pressure could keep mounting. “There’s no panic, but crypto’s now following macro trends way more than before,” he said. “For the first time in 2025, I’m questioning whether we’ll even revisit all-time highs this year.” Futures traders liquidated as retail ETF inflows keep climbing On top of that, derivatives traders are getting smoked. Within the last 24 hours alone, $275 million worth of Bitcoin longs were wiped out. The demand for longer-dated futures is falling fast. Risk appetite is evaporating. But not everyone’s running; retail buyers are still pouring in through ETFs. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF pulled in $2.5 billion in September, way up from $707 million in August, as reported by Bloomberg. Even as institutional players vanish, retail investors are still chasing exposure. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, said the drop isn’t caused by selling. “It’s not that DATs are dumping—it’s that they stopped buying,” Jeff said . The lack of consistent demand from institutional treasuries has become a problem. Those big buyers weren’t just a floor, they were the whole scaffolding. Morten Christensen, founder of AirdropAlert.com, had seen this coming. Back in August, when Bitcoin crossed $123,000, he warned friends and family to sell. He didn’t see a blow-off top or forced selling. It just didn’t feel right. “All the treasury companies is a huge top signal in my books,” Morten said. His read was simple: when everyone’s bullish, maybe it’s time to get out. Meanwhile, treasury-backed firms that once traded at massive premiums are now being priced at levels that match the actual Bitcoin they hold. The mNAV (the gap between their market cap and the value of their Bitcoin reserves) is nearly gone. These companies used to trade like tech unicorns. Now they’re treated like glorified crypto vaults.

The inflow was fueled by renewed investor confidence following Nvidia’s announcement to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. Throughout the past two weeks, investors have pulled at least $39.91 billion from U.S. equities. Large-cap funds led this week’s reversal after introducing $16.94 billion into the Equity market, posting the strongest weekly inflows since April.

However, according to a Reuters report , global MMF investors pulled out $12.96 billion, recording an outflow for the second week. The increased demand for Equity follows recent activities linked to technology supply chains and infrastructure. On Monday, Cryptopolitan reported that Nvidia revealed a plan to invest $100 billion, causing renewed confidence in the Equity market. The chip maker revealed that the funds will be used to support the construction of data centers powered by its chips, likely 4 to 5 million GPUs, with a 10-gigawatt capacity. CEO Jensen Huang described the initiative as monumental in size, saying the first phase will begin in Q2 2026 using its next-generation Vera Rubin system architecture. NVIDIA’s stock surged to $183.85 on Monday after the announcement, adding at least $200 billion in market value within one hour. However, the stock has dropped, currently trading at $177.17 with a market cap of $4.3 trillion. The collaboration means that Nvidia will be the preferred supplier of chips and networking systems to OpenAI.

Altman emphasized expanding data capacity while focusing on research and product development. OpenAI has already secured backing from investors including Microsoft, SoftBank, and Thrive Capital.

There are differing opinions on where the neutral interest rate level is, but market data will guide the Fed.” Misra emphasized the strength of corporate balance sheets and the structurally sound environment, but noted that customs duties and high interest rates create cyclical pressure on growth. Therefore, he argued that investors should create diversified portfolios: “Fixed-income assets provide both returns and protection against a slowing economy.” Related News: Development in Claim That Would Significantly Impact the Market if Realized for Tether: Two More Companies in Talks Misra also shared his expectations for the bond market, stating that medium- and long-term, high-quality corporate bonds appear attractive, but caution is exercised against lower-grade, high-yield bonds. Misra noted that the US economy is still performing relatively strongly on a global scale, adding, “We need to hedge the US rather than sell it.” Misra noted that uncertainties regarding the labor market persist, adding that customs duties and possible government shutdowns could put pressure on employment, and that the Fed is therefore cautious about downside risks to employment. *This is not investment advice.

For those immersed in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, where innovation is constant, the rapid advancement of AI in platforms like YouTube Music presents a fascinating parallel. Just as blockchain promises to revolutionize digital ownership and transactions, YouTube Music AI hosts are set to transform how we discover and engage with music, moving beyond simple playlists to an interactive, personalized auditory journey. The Dawn of AI Music Hosts: What to Expect from YouTube Music YouTube Music is venturing into a captivating new frontier, actively testing AI music hosts designed to enrich your listening experience. Imagine a personalized DJ that not only plays your favorite tracks but also provides relevant stories, intriguing fan trivia, and insightful commentary about the music you are currently enjoying. This initiative, announced recently, signals a significant shift in how streaming platforms aim to engage their users, making the act of listening more dynamic and informative. These AI hosts are engineered to deliver a contextual layer to your music consumption. Instead of just hearing a song, you might learn about the artist’s inspiration, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, or even the historical impact of the track. This feature aims to create a deeper connection between the listener and the music, moving beyond passive consumption to an active, educational, and entertaining experience. It’s about bringing the human element of a radio DJ into the digital age, powered by sophisticated AI algorithms that understand your preferences and the vast universe of music knowledge. How Does YouTube Music’s AI Compare to Spotify AI DJ? The concept of an AI-powered music host isn’t entirely new. Spotify, a major competitor in the music streaming space, introduced its own Spotify AI DJ two years prior. Spotify’s version focuses on delivering a curated selection of music alongside AI-powered spoken commentary about the tracks and artists you like. It’s designed to learn your taste over time and act as a personal guide through your musical journey. While both platforms leverage AI for spoken commentary and music curation, YouTube Music’s approach appears to emphasize a broader range of interactive content, including fan trivia and storytelling. This suggests a potential difference in the depth and variety of information provided. Spotify’s DJ aims for seamless personalization and discovery, while YouTube Music’s hosts might lean more towards an educational and narrative-driven experience. The competition between these giants in enhancing user engagement through AI will undoubtedly drive further innovation in the streaming landscape, benefiting users with increasingly sophisticated and personalized services. YouTube Labs: The Hub for AI Innovation The development of these new YouTube Music AI hosts is taking place within YouTube Labs, the platform’s dedicated new hub for AI experiments. This initiative mirrors Google Labs, Google’s experimental arm, which allows users to test early-stage AI products and provide valuable feedback. YouTube Labs serves as a crucial incubator for exploring the vast potential of AI across the entire YouTube ecosystem. The open nature of YouTube Labs is particularly noteworthy: it is accessible to all YouTube users, meaning a Premium membership is not required to sign up. However, access to these experimental programs is currently limited to a select number of U.S.-based participants. This controlled rollout allows YouTube to gather targeted feedback and refine its AI offerings before a wider launch. YouTube Labs is not just about music; it has been instrumental in implementing various AI features across the platform recently, demonstrating a holistic commitment to AI-driven enhancements. Expanding Horizons: Beyond AI Music Hosts YouTube’s embrace of AI extends far beyond the new music hosts. The platform has been consistently integrating advanced AI capabilities to enhance user experience and empower creators: AI Conversational Radio: In July, YouTube Music rolled out an AI conversational radio feature. This innovative tool allows users to create custom radio stations by simply describing what they want to hear. This natural language interface makes music discovery intuitive and highly personalized, allowing users to articulate their mood, genre preferences, or even specific activities for which they need a soundtrack. Creator Tools: Earlier this month, YouTube released a suite of GenAI tools specifically for creators, including features for Shorts creation. These tools empower creators to generate content more efficiently and creatively, leveraging AI for editing, content generation, and optimization. Enhanced Search and Discovery: A few months prior, YouTube launched an AI-powered search results carousel, akin to Google’s AI Overviews. This, coupled with expanded access to its conversational AI tool, helps users find more information, receive tailored content recommendations, and even get concise video summaries, making content navigation significantly easier. The Balance: Innovation vs. Integrity in AI Content While YouTube is enthusiastically embracing AI features to drive innovation, it is also keenly aware of the potential pitfalls, particularly concerning content quality and authenticity. The platform has taken a firm stance against what it terms ‘AI slop’ – mass-produced, low-quality, or inauthentic content generated by AI. This commitment is reflected in recent updates to its policies. YouTube has explicitly cracked down on creators’ ability to generate revenue from ‘inauthentic’ content, which includes repetitive videos and other forms of low-effort, AI-generated material. This strategic move underscores YouTube’s dedication to maintaining a high standard of content quality and ensuring a fair ecosystem for genuine creators. It highlights a critical challenge for all platforms integrating AI: how to harness its power for innovation while safeguarding against its misuse and preserving the integrity of human-created content. The Future of Listening: What AI Hosts Mean for You The introduction of YouTube Music AI hosts represents more than just a new feature; it’s a glimpse into the future of personalized entertainment. For users, it promises an even richer, more engaging, and informative listening experience. Imagine never running out of interesting facts about your favorite artists or always having a knowledgeable companion to guide you through new genres. For artists, it could mean new avenues for their stories and legacies to be shared, fostering deeper connections with their audience. This trend signifies a broader shift towards hyper-personalized digital experiences, where AI acts as an intelligent intermediary, curating and contextualizing information to suit individual preferences. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated interactions, potentially leading to fully immersive auditory environments that adapt in real-time to our moods and activities. The intersection of AI and media is just beginning, and YouTube Music is clearly at the forefront of this exciting revolution. The rollout of YouTube Music AI hosts through YouTube Labs marks a significant step in the evolution of music streaming. By offering personalized trivia, stories, and commentary, YouTube aims to deepen user engagement and redefine the listening experience. This move, alongside YouTube’s broader AI initiatives and its commitment to content integrity, positions the platform as a key innovator in the AI-driven digital landscape. As AI continues to integrate into our entertainment, the future of music promises to be more interactive, informed, and incredibly personal, creating a truly unique auditory journey for every listener.

With momentum hanging in the balance, traders are questioning whether this pause is simply a fakeout before a recovery or the start of a deeper move toward the $3,600 support level. Struggling Below $4,060: Key Support Yet To Be Reclaimed Ted, a well-followed crypto analyst, recently shared his insights on Ethereum’s latest price action in a post on X. According to the expert, ETH successfully tapped into the $3,800 liquidity level, a move he had anticipated. This level acted as a key zone where buyers stepped in, providing the much-needed bounce for Ethereum after a short-term decline. Related Reading: Wedge Breakout Or False Alarm? Ethereum Faces Its Biggest Support Test Yet Following this bounce, Ethereum managed to recover some ground. However, Ted pointed out that the asset is still struggling to reclaim the $4,060 support region. This level has now become a crucial barrier for ETH, and its inability to hold above it leaves the market in a vulnerable position. The analyst explained that if Ethereum successfully flips the $4,060 level back into support, the market could see a fresh rally develop. Such a move attracts renewed bullish momentum, fueling optimism for a stronger push higher in the near term. On the other hand, Ted cautioned that failing to reclaim this zone increases the risk of further downside. In such a case, Ethereum could see its price tumble back toward the $3,600 level, which stands as the next critical support area. Fakeout Or Freefall? Ethereum Bulls Cling To Their Last Hope According to Andrew Crypto, in a recent update posted on X, the technical outlook across the crypto market isn’t painting a bullish picture. Andrew highlighted that both BTC and ETH have broken down through key support levels, which increases the likelihood of further declines in the short term. Such breakdowns often suggest that buyers are losing strength, leaving room for sellers to dictate market direction. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Recovery Strong – Major Resistance Test Coming Next While acknowledging that the current setup may not be pleasant for traders, Andrew pointed out that this weakness could present a significant opportunity for long-term investors, offering attractive entry points before the next major market cycle takes shape. However, he also left room for cautious optimism. The only possible bullish scenario at this stage, Andrew explained, is if the current move proves to be a fakeout. In that case, a strong rebound could follow, flipping market sentiment back in favor of the bulls.

Solana has become the standout option, rapidly gaining traction among companies eager to diversify into digital assets with strong growth potential. The latest addition to this trend is Helius Medical Technologies, a Nasdaq-listed company that has confirmed its plans to adopt Solana as its primary reserve asset. Helius recently secured more than $500 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal led by Pantera Capital and Summer Capital. With warrants, that figure could swell to over $1.25 billion. The proceeds will be used to establish a digital asset treasury built around Solana, cementing the company’s position as part of a growing wave of corporate adopters. Solana’s Appeal to Corporations Helius emphasized Solana’s high activity levels, noting its millions of users and billions of processed transactions. An estimated 7% staking yield adds another layer of appeal for treasury management, while its expanding DeFi ecosystem promises future integration opportunities. Pantera Capital’s Dan Morehead described Solana as a “category-defining blockchain” poised to serve as the backbone of next-generation finance. This move isn’t isolated. Other publicly listed firms are making similar bets. Forward Industries, another Nasdaq-listed company, recently disclosed one of the largest Solana treasury purchases to date — 6.8 million SOL at an average price of $232 , totaling $1.58 billion. The acquisition, carried out both on-chain and in open markets, followed a $1.65 billion fundraising round backed by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. Forward Industries has even declared its goal of becoming the world’s leading Solana treasury firm. Why Investors Are Watching Closely The growing list of corporations allocating to Solana — including Sol Strategies, DeFi Development Corp., and Upexi — signals that momentum is building quickly. For investors, this trend raises the question of whether Solana could soon rival Bitcoin’s role as the go-to corporate reserve asset. Speculation on the $500 Target Reaching $500 per SOL may sound ambitious, but several factors suggest it is within reach. Current corporate allocations already represent billions of dollars in inflows, and if adoption by Nasdaq-listed firms continues at this pace, Solana could see sustained buying pressure for years. Analysts highlight that Solana’s supply dynamics also favor long-term appreciation, as a significant portion of tokens are staked, reducing available liquidity on exchanges. At present levels, a run toward $500 would represent more than a doubling from Solana’s current market price, yet such a move would still leave its market capitalization below that of Ethereum. If institutional treasuries continue to expand their allocations and DeFi activity on Solana scales further, the $500 level may evolve from speculation into a legitimate mid-term target. Some strategists believe that with only a handful of additional billion-dollar treasury allocations, Solana could build enough momentum to test that range as early as next year. A Rising Star in the Presale Market While Solana is earning headlines for institutional adoption, retail investors are increasingly gravitating toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has been drawing attention for its trajectory, with analysts pointing to exponential growth potential in Q4 . Unlike established giants, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers early participants the chance to position themselves ahead of major exchange listings, echoing the early days of other breakout tokens. Many see it as one of the rare opportunities where retail investors can capture upside before mainstream exposure fully sets in. Solana’s Expanding Corporate Ecosystem The decision by firms like Helius and Forward Industries underscores a strategic shift in how companies approach balance sheet management. By blending yield, scalability, and DeFi access, Solana offers a combination of benefits that Bitcoin and Ethereum can’t fully match. If the trend persists, Solana may emerge as the preferred blockchain for corporate treasuries, with broader implications for its price trajectory and overall market dominance. Conclusion Corporate moves to adopt Solana are reshaping how institutions view altcoins, adding a layer of legitimacy to its long-term role in financial infrastructure. With companies like Helius and Forward Industries pouring billions into SOL, the path to higher valuations — potentially even $500 — looks increasingly plausible. For retail investors, the story is unfolding differently, with MAGACOIN FINANCE standing out as the project poised for exponential gains in the months ahead. Both trends highlight a dynamic shift in crypto markets, offering opportunities for corporations and individual investors alike.

Trump said he believed surging demand for cryptocurrencies could bolster America’s position in global finance by channeling “trillions from around the world in wonky currencies” into the United States. He argued that Bitcoin mining and tokenized finance could fuel “a kind of financial revolution” rooted in the U.S., adding, “I think it arguably saves the U.S. dollar.” Critics Warn of ‘Unprecedented Risks’ Over Trump Stablecoin Ties The comments coincided with Trump’s appearance at Nasdaq, where he rang the opening bell to mark the debut of American Bitcoin Corp (ABTC). The firm, which trades under the new ticker following a merger between American Bitcoin and Gryphon Digital Mining, is now valued at more than $500 million. Trump holds a large stake, according to the Financial Times. The @realDonaldTrump family’s net worth surged by $1.3 billion this week, fueled by the trading debut of American Bitcoin (ABTC) and gains from @worldlibertyfi . #Trump #WLFI https://t.co/hZronk3iOI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 8, 2025 However, the family’s deep involvement in stablecoins has raised sharp criticism in Washington. When World Liberty Financial was first revealed in March , legal experts and lawmakers flagged conflicts of interest, warning of risks tied to a sitting president’s financial stake in a private stablecoin. Attorney Andrew Rossow described USD1 as “a direct affront to constitutional safeguards meant to prevent conflicts of interest.” In April, Representative Maxine Waters suggested that Donald Trump could seek to replace traditional government payments, from Social Security to tax remittances, with his family-backed stablecoin. @SenWarren and @RepMaxineWaters have asked the SEC to preserve all records tied to Trump-linked crypto firm @worldlibertyfi World Liberty Financial. #WLF #ElizabethWarren https://t.co/mwxXN5DLPB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 3, 2025 Five Democratic senators also issued a letter warning that presidential ties to stablecoin issuance posed “unprecedented risks to our financial system.” Those concerns have only deepened since the Trump administration advanced the GENIUS Act, a regulatory framework for stablecoins signed into law in July . The legislation cleared a path for U.S.-approved stablecoins but included no provisions to prevent the president, his family, or affiliated companies from benefiting financially. Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed the GENIUS Act in a fiery speech on the Senate floor on Monday, citing risks to financial security. #ElizabethWarren #GENIUSAct https://t.co/mSO6QYfuFH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 Critics noted that Donald Trump’s personal fortune has grown by an estimated $2.4 billion from crypto ventures since he entered the sector in 2022. In early August, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Ron Wyden wrote to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, warning that the new law failed to address conflicts of interest surrounding the Trump family’s crypto businesses. The debate comes at a delicate moment for the U.S. dollar. The greenback has faced pressure from Federal Reserve rate cuts and concerns over rising national debt. While President Trump has argued that a weaker currency benefits U.S. trade and pledged to make America the “crypto capital” of the world, Eric Trump insists that stablecoins could restore the dollar’s strength, even as doubts grow over who stands to gain the most from that vision. Citigroup Sees Stablecoins Surging Past $2T by 2030 Citigroup has projected a steep climb for the stablecoin sector, estimating its market capitalization could exceed $2 trillion by 2030, up from roughly $240 billion today. The bank’s report said adoption will be driven by clearer regulation and broader participation from both institutions and the public sector. Citigroup has projected a rise in stablecoin market, forecasting its total market cap to soar from $240 billion to $2 trillion by 2030. #Stablecoin #Citigroup https://t.co/tGNT3XfNC0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 Its base-case forecast sees supply reaching $1.6 trillion, with a more optimistic scenario of $3.7 trillion. But Citigroup also warned the market could stagnate at around $500 billion if regulatory uncertainty lingers. The note comes as Washington pushes ahead with stablecoin legislation under President Trump’s pro-crypto administration . Stablecoin adoption is already reshaping government debt markets. Leading issuers like Tether hold tens of billions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries, and Citigroup predicts they could become among the largest holders of government debt by the end of the decade. The bank cautioned, however, that widespread use could disrupt traditional banking through “deposit substitution.” Not all institutions share Citigroup’s bullish outlook. JPMorgan projects the sector will grow only to $500 billion by 2028, arguing that mainstream adoption remains limited. The bank estimates just 6% of stablecoin demand comes from payments, with most activity still tied to trading and collateral. Still, recent studies suggest stablecoins could capture $1 trillion in annual payment volume by 2030 , potentially transforming settlement infrastructure and cementing their role in global finance.

The company, valued at $183 billion, went from having less than 1,000 business customers to over 300,000 in two years. On Friday, bosses said they’ll triple their international workforce and make their customer help team five times bigger in 2025. The move comes as most of their users are now based outside America. About 80% of people using Claude live in other countries. Places like South Korea, Australia, and Singapore actually have more users per person than the US does. “What is amazing is we haven’t, up until recently, had significant human presence in Europe, in Japan, in our international markets, and yet we already have a very, very significant business over there,” Chief Commercial Officer Paul Smith said in an interview as reported by CNBC. First Asian office opens in Tokyo with major European expansion planned Anthropic is looking for country bosses in India, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Singapore. They’re also hiring across Britain, different parts of Europe, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The company will open its first Asian office in Tokyo and add over 100 jobs in Dublin and London. A research center in Zurich is planned too, with more offices coming later. Chris Ciauri just joined as the person in charge of international business. Before this, he ran a software company called Unily and worked at Google Cloud and Salesforce. At Salesforce, he helped grow their European, Middle Eastern, and African business from $200 million to over $3 billion. “G20 governments are approaching us about doing really, really interesting things at a citizen enablement level,” Ciauri said . Big companies in Europe and Asia want to use Claude for specific industry needs too. This is happening while the AI rivalry in businesses heats up. Anthropic has hit $5 billion in yearly revenue, way up from $87 million at the start of 2024. That puts the company against the big players. OpenAI just announced an $850 billion infrastructure deal with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank. Microsoft and Google keep adding AI stuff to their existing business tools, making it easy for companies to just add things like Copilot or Gemini without changing much. Major corporations report dramatic efficiency Gains with Claude Anthropic is doing something different. Instead of adding AI to old software, they let businesses use Claude directly. “There’s a very good reason why, if you’re an AWS customer, you should also consume Anthropic through Bedrock, and if you’re a great Google customer, through Vertex,” Smith said. He pointed out that most big companies use several AI providers instead of just one. Real Results for Companies Businesses are seeing big wins with Claude. Novo Nordisk, the Danish drug company that makes Ozempic, used Claude to cut down a typical three-month analysis process to just a few days. Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund uses Claude to analyze billion-dollar investments. They’ve saved 213,000 hours of work, which is a 20% boost in productivity across 9,000 companies they invest in. SK Telecom in Korea saw customer service quality jump 34% after rolling out Claude everywhere. The European Parliament made millions of old documents searchable. Australia’s Commonwealth Bank cut fraud losses in half. Moreover, as Cryptopolitan reported, business users can now select either OpenAI or Anthropic models when using Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant. Claude Code, which launched in May, is already making $500 million. Usage went up 10 times in three months. Unlike other companies that make general tools, Anthropic builds custom stuff for specific industries like telecom, drug companies, banks, and government. Anthropic’s team that helps customers set up Claude will grow five times bigger next year. These people help businesses figure out how to use Claude for their specific needs. Anthropic is also putting money into 24/7 support and systems that keep data secure, which matters a lot for regulated industries. Ciauri thinks adapting to local languages and cultures is key to winning. He mentioned how Panasonic uses Claude models that are customized for the Japanese language and culture.

The explosive rise of meme tokens is no accident; it’s a perfect storm of viral marketing, community-driven hype, and innovative token mechanics. September 2025 marks the beginning of a new era, where dynamic presales and tokenomics redefine how investors identify the next big thing. As the market evolves, savvy investors are on the lookout for the best crypto coin with 100x potential and the best new coins launching September 2025 that promise sky-high potential. Among the standout opportunities this month is the $BZIL token from BullZilla , an ERC-20 meme coin that’s already making waves for its extraordinary presale mechanics. The dynamic pricing and mutation engine create a pressure cooker of demand and scarcity, ensuring that bullzilla presale remains a top contender among the best crypto coins with 100x potential discussions this September. Beyond BullZilla, crypto enthusiasts should keep an eye on the best crypto coin with 100x potential spotlight as it shines on projects like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. These tokens combine robust technical foundations with growing ecosystems that can rival traditional cryptocurrencies in both scalability and adoption. For those ready to capitalize on the best crypto coin with 100x potential, understanding the strengths of these coins and how they complement the innovative BullZilla ecosystem is key to building a winning portfolio. 1. BullZilla: The Mutation Engine That’s Roaring Through September BullZilla is no ordinary meme coin. The presale, currently in Stage 4 (Red Candle Buffet), Phase 4B, has already amassed over $680,000 with more than 2,100 token holders enthusiastically participating. At the current price of $0.00009241, BullZilla’s presale offers an unprecedented opportunity, particularly with its mutation engine, which drives the price up every 48 hours or instantly when $100,000 is raised. This pricing strategy accelerates demand, creating a perfect storm for early investors. The heart of BullZilla’s appeal lies in its presale mutation engine. This dynamic pricing model ensures that every dollar invested moves the needle on token value, rewarding those who join early and contributing to a more stable token value. As price surges become inevitable with each milestone, investors are incentivized to act fast. This is a rare chance to participate in an ERC-20 meme coin that combines the excitement of a community-led launch with solid tokenomics. The scarcity of tokens, amplified by the “roar burn” mechanism, which permanently removes tokens from circulation, intensifies the potential for price appreciation. BullZilla also offers a roadmap packed with community-centric features like the Roarblood Vault, which is designed to lock in value and reward long-term holders with staking rewards. According to BullZilla’s official documentation, the presale stages create compounded returns, making it an outstanding entry point among the best crypto coins with 100x potential in September 2025. Early participants can transform a modest $1,000 investment into millions of $BZIL tokens, making the prospect of 1000x gains more tangible than ever. How to Buy BullZilla Coins Acquiring BullZilla ($BZIL) tokens is a straightforward and secure process. First, set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet to handle Ethereum-based transactions. Next, purchase Ethereum (ETH) on popular exchanges like Binance or Coinbase and transfer it to your wallet. Then, navigate to the official BullZilla presale portal, connect your wallet, and swap your ETH for $BZIL tokens. This instant allocation is claimable once the presale concludes, ensuring your investment is secured without delay. 2. Dogecoin: The DOGE Booster Dogecoin (DOGE) is often referred to as the original meme coin and has held a unique place in crypto culture since its launch in 2013. What began as a joke inspired by the Shiba Inu “Doge” meme quickly grew into a vibrant digital asset backed by an active community. Over the years, Dogecoin has evolved from internet humor into a mainstream cryptocurrency, recognized for its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and widespread adoption. One of Dogecoin’s biggest boosters has been Elon Musk, whose tweets and public endorsements regularly spark price surges and media attention. Whales often treat Dogecoin as a speculative asset for short-term moves, though its longevity shows it has staying power. While it lacks the scarcity of Bitcoin or the advanced utility of Ethereum, Dogecoin thrives on its community-driven brand, liquidity, and name recognition, which keeps it relevant in the meme coin space and beyond. 3. Shiba Inu: ShibaSwap Launch Shiba Inu (SHIB), launched in 2020, is widely seen as the spiritual successor to Dogecoin, branding itself as the “Dogecoin Killer.” Unlike Dogecoin, Shiba Inu quickly expanded beyond meme culture into an ambitious ecosystem. It introduced ShibaSwap (a decentralized exchange), as well as utility tokens like LEASH and BONE, and has pushed into areas like NFTs and the metaverse through Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain. The SHIB community, known as the “Shib Army,” is one of the most vocal and organized groups in the crypto industry, often driving social media trends and retail investor interest. Whales have been known to accumulate massive SHIB positions, adding fuel to its reputation for volatility and explosive runs. While critics argue that SHIB’s supply is too large for dramatic long-term price appreciation, its developers’ push toward real utility and ecosystem building has kept it firmly on the radar as one of the most prominent meme coins after Dogecoin. Conclusion: Why September 2025 is a Landmark Moment for Crypto Investors Based on the latest research, the Bull Zilla , Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin ecosystems represent some of the most promising assets within the best crypto coin with 100x potential and best new coins launching September 2025. BullZilla’s innovative presale mechanism offers a dynamic and rewarding entry point for investors eager to capitalize on token scarcity and price growth. Meanwhile, Polkadot’s interoperability and Sui’s scalability bring robust technical foundations that underpin their long-term potential. The fusion of meme coin excitement with serious blockchain innovation makes this an unparalleled moment to explore these tokens. Whether a seasoned analyst or new crypto enthusiast, joining presales like BullZilla offers a front-row seat to wealth multiplication opportunities that have become rare in the evolving market.

A spokesperson for the Frankfurt prosecutor’s office stated that “raids in connection with Northern Data” were conducted on Thursday, declining to disclose the targets or what investigators were searching for. The agency said further details would be provided on Monday. Northern Data did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Its shares slipped following news of the raids, with investors unsettled by the prospect of renewed legal exposure for a company already dogged by controversy. Northern Data’s stock has been on a slide. Source: Google Finance Northern Data went from crypto mining to AI infrastructure Northern Data initially rose to prominence as a provider of computing resources for cryptocurrency miners. But as energy costs soared and regulatory scrutiny mounted, like many infrastructure providers, the company moved toward the promising and booming artificial intelligence and cloud computing industry. In July, it was reported that the company was entering a deal with Abu Dhabi AI group G42. It was disclosed that Northern Data was going to allow G42’s cloud computing arm to access half of the over 22,000 AI chips it manages across facilities in Europe. On Monday, it reshuffled its leadership, naming chief operating officer John Hoffman as co-chief executive officer in a move framed as part of its growth strategy. Tether Holdings SA, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, is Northern Data’s majority shareholder. Tether has also poured money into conservative video platform Rumble Inc. In August, Rumble was reportedly weighing an all-stock offer for Northern Data that would value the target at about $1.17 billion. Past allegations resurface The raids come against a backdrop of prior allegations about Northern Data’s business conduct. In 2024, two former directors accused the company of fraud , misrepresentation of financials and tax evasion. Northern Data denied those claims. Though the allegations were withdrawn and the case dismissed that same year, the episode exposed governance weaknesses. The prosecutor’s office has not said whether the current investigation is linked to past disputes, financial reporting, tax compliance, or new matters. High stakes for Tether and AI sector The raids highlight the risks facing firms at the intersection of digital assets and emerging technologies. Tether, itself the subject of long-running regulatory questions about reserves and disclosures, could find its reputation further tested by association. The scrutiny also reverberates across Europe’s AI infrastructure industry, which is drawing billions in investment from governments and private funds. If prosecutors allege financial improprieties, it could set a precedent for tighter oversight of companies that blend crypto origins with next-generation AI computing. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential Rumble acquisition. With prosecutors promising more information on Monday, the scope of the investigation remains uncertain. Until then, Northern Data, its backers and market participants face a weekend of questions without answers. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The sheer scale of capital being poured into these digital fortresses by giants like OpenAI, Nvidia, and Oracle isn’t just about processing power; it’s about laying the foundation for the next generation of artificial intelligence, which will undoubtedly impact every facet of our digital lives, from decentralized finance to automated trading. Understanding these massive moves is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the future of technology. What’s Driving the Colossal Investment in AI Data Centers? The tech world buzzed with news of unprecedented financial commitments this week, all centered around bolstering AI capabilities. At the forefront was Nvidia, a company synonymous with the graphic processing units (GPUs) that are the bedrock of modern AI. Nvidia announced a staggering investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI, signaling a deep strategic partnership and a clear bet on OpenAI’s future trajectory. This investment underscores the critical need for advanced hardware to power increasingly complex AI models. Not to be outdone, OpenAI itself unveiled ambitious plans to construct five new ‘Stargate’ AI data centers in collaboration with Oracle and Softbank. These facilities are designed to add gigawatts of new computing capacity, a scale previously unimaginable. To finance this monumental undertaking, Oracle reportedly sold $18 billion in bonds, demonstrating the significant financial muscle required to bring such projects to fruition. Each of these deals, individually, represents a dizzying sum. In aggregate, they paint a clear picture: Silicon Valley is moving heaven and Earth to provide OpenAI with enough computational power to train and serve future versions of its flagship product, ChatGPT. These investments are not merely about incremental upgrades; they represent a fundamental re-architecting of global computing infrastructure. The demand for AI processing is growing exponentially, driven by the increasing sophistication of models and the desire to deliver more complex, real-time AI services to a global user base. This shift is creating a new arms race in the tech sector, where access to immense computing power is the ultimate differentiator. OpenAI’s Ambitious Vision: Scaling ChatGPT’s Capabilities The motivation behind these colossal investments becomes clearer when examining OpenAI’s product roadmap. The company is not content with the current iteration of ChatGPT; it envisions a future where AI is more deeply integrated into daily life, offering proactive and personalized services. A glimpse into this future arrived this week with the launch of ‘Pulse’ – a new feature within ChatGPT that works overnight to deliver personalized morning briefings to users. Pulse offers an experience akin to a personalized news app or a social feed, designed to be the first thing users check in the morning. Crucially, it operates independently, even when users are not actively interacting with the ChatGPT app. This ‘always-on’ nature represents a new class of OpenAI products that require continuous, high-intensity processing. The company’s desire to deliver many more such features, and eventually roll them out to its free user base, is currently hampered by a significant bottleneck: the number of available computer servers. OpenAI explicitly stated that Pulse can only be offered to its $200-a-month Pro subscribers due to these capacity constraints. This limitation highlights the direct link between infrastructure investment and product innovation. To democratize access to advanced AI features and realize its full potential, OpenAI needs vastly more computing resources. The Stargate project and Nvidia’s investment are direct responses to this pressing need, aiming to unlock the next generation of AI applications for everyone. Nvidia’s Indispensable Role and Oracle’s Strategic Play in AI Infrastructure The names Nvidia and Oracle are central to this narrative for distinct but equally critical reasons. Nvidia has established itself as the undisputed leader in GPU technology, which is the specialized hardware essential for training and running complex AI models. Without Nvidia’s powerful chips, the rapid advancements in AI seen over the past decade would have been impossible. Their $100 billion investment in OpenAI solidifies their position not just as a hardware provider, but as a strategic partner in shaping the future of AI. This move ensures that Nvidia’s technology remains at the core of cutting-edge AI development, further entrenching their market dominance. Oracle’s involvement, particularly through the Stargate project and its substantial bond issuance, marks a strategic pivot and aggressive expansion into the cloud computing space, specifically targeting AI workloads. While traditional cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have been dominant, Oracle is leveraging its enterprise-grade infrastructure and financial strength to become a significant player in the high-demand AI infrastructure market. By partnering with OpenAI, Oracle positions itself as a critical enabler for the most advanced AI research and deployment, attracting future AI-driven enterprises to its cloud services. The $18 billion bond sale underscores the massive capital expenditure required for these projects, but also Oracle’s confidence in the long-term returns from becoming a foundational pillar of the AI economy. The Future of ChatGPT: Beyond the App Experience The evolution of ChatGPT , exemplified by features like Pulse, points towards a future where AI is less of a tool we actively summon and more of an ambient intelligence that proactively assists us. Imagine AI companions that anticipate your needs, manage your schedule, summarize vast amounts of information, and even generate creative content without explicit prompts. These advanced capabilities require not only sophisticated algorithms but also an immense, always-on computational backbone. The investments in AI data centers are not just about making existing AI models faster; they are about enabling entirely new paradigms of human-AI interaction. As capacity expands, OpenAI can experiment with larger models, more complex multimodal inputs (like video and audio), and more nuanced, personalized outputs. This means AI could become a seamless part of our digital environment, offering continuous support and insight. The ability to roll out such features to free users will be a game-changer, democratizing access to powerful AI and accelerating its adoption across society. This future also raises questions about the ethical implications, data privacy, and the societal impact of such pervasive AI. As AI becomes more autonomous and integrated, the need for robust governance and responsible development becomes even more paramount. The tech industry, alongside policymakers, will need to address these challenges as the capabilities of AI continue to grow. The Grand Challenge: Is This AI Infrastructure Worth the Investment? This brings us to the fundamental question: are features like Pulse, and the promise of future AI advancements, truly worth the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in the underlying AI infrastructure ? On the surface, a personalized morning briefing might seem a tall order for such a monumental investment. However, the true value lies not just in individual features but in the cumulative impact of enabling a new era of AI. The investment is a bet on the transformative power of AI across all industries. From scientific discovery and medical breakthroughs to personalized education and entertainment, advanced AI promises to unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency, innovation, and economic growth. The ability to train larger, more capable models means AI can tackle problems previously deemed intractable. The immediate return on investment might be hard to quantify for a single feature, but the long-term strategic advantage of being at the forefront of AI development is immeasurable. Challenges remain, particularly regarding the immense energy consumption of these massive data centers. Powering gigawatts of computing capacity will require sustainable energy solutions and significant advancements in cooling technologies. Furthermore, the economic viability of these projects hinges on the continued rapid adoption and monetization of AI services. Yet, the consensus among tech giants is clear: the future is AI-driven, and those who control the infrastructure will control that future. These monumental shifts in AI infrastructure are often the hot topics at premier tech gatherings.

52306144,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=819607,1758916800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52306144.jpeg,Will Cardano (ADA) Price Recover As Whales Sell $500 Million Worth Or Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) A Better Bet?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-cardano-ada-price-recover-as-whales-sell-500-million-worth-or-is-mutuum-finance-mutm-a-better-bet/,"The recent sale of over $500 million worth of Cardano (ADA) by big holders rocked market sentiment, jeopardizing ADA’s near-term recovery. While the network fundamentals remain intact, many investors now move their attention from traditional altcoins to newer ones with greater potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi investment costing just $0.035, is quickly becoming the top contender, with its uses in lending and borrowing, being relatively early on in its growth, and high potential return making it a more attractive bet for 2025 than over-leveraged tokens bogged down by whale-created volatility. Cardano Battles Bearish Pressure Amid Whale Selling and Key Support Tests Cardano (ADA) is navigating a crucial technical landscape after dipping below the $0.84 support level following a 6.1% decline, with momentum indicators showing a divided picture of its near-term trajectory. The RSI stands at 40, below the middle-of-the-road 50, and the MACD has recorded a bearish crossover, suggesting additional downside danger that will push ADA to revisit the $0.76 retracement zone if the selling pressure prevails. But there is resilience as retail investors absorb whale-driven sell-offs and are supporting at the crucial $0.88, and a pattern of an ascending triangle forming below $0.95 indicates there may be bullish potential if the trend reverses. A breakout above this resistance can potentially unleash a rally to the $1.20–$1.25 range, but a breakdown from the $0.88 support exposes further losses towards $0.837. With trading volume subdued and active addresses remaining low, ADA’s next move will depend on whether the bulls can reclaim key resistance points and reverse the current bearish trend. Mutuum’s Superb Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has kicked off Presale Stage Six, with the tokens trading at $0.035 after a 16.17% round price increase from the previous stage. Investors are eager, with over 16,570 buyers and over $16.3 million of funds raised. In its quest to introduce security to the platform, Mutuum Finance is introducing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Bugs are categorized into four levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, to enable their greatest discovery and remediation. The protocol depends on tight collateral control of funds in order to secure the system and players. The controls are imposed through certain collateral ratios, limits to lending, and deposit limits. Positions that are undercollateralized are shut down very rapidly, and call penalty and remediation charges are incurred in order to ensure systemic stability. Constructing an Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved by maximizing Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially where overcollateralized credit is involved. Reserve requirements also function as a market shock absorber and excess reserves are available to use for taking on risk-absorbing activities in risky assets. Mutuum Finance uses a dynamic, liquidity-based interest rate model. It maintains lending and borrowing in absolute harmony with shifts in market conditions at every juncture. Where there are greater amounts of money on the platform, borrowing rates are kept low on purpose to encourage further utilization of funds available with it as well as pushing market activity. Where liquidity remains limited, lending rates rise and that encourages existing borrowers to redeem outstanding loans along with drawing new deposits. This feedback mechanism is the one that creates a healthier, more stable setting which protects user interests, minimizes liquidity flows, and decreases the overall protocol exposure both in time of market tranquility and stress. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming an improved 2025 wager as Cardano (ADA) is squeezed by a $500 million whale dump and volatile price movements. Stage 6 tokens now sell at $0.035, an increase of 16.17% from the previous round, with over 16,570 investors and $16.3 million in raised capital. Invest today and receive early-stage tokens before the subsequent price increase.

Several metrics are starting to reflect this waning sentiment among investors toward the largest cryptocurrency asset. A Cooling Accumulation Bitcoin Trend Score When a crypto asset’s price experiences a persistent downward trend, history reveals that the negative movement mostly hampers investors’ sentiment. The same can be said for Bitcoin, with the current state of its market and the action of investors toward BTC’s recent price pullback . Following an examination of the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score, Glassnode, a leading financial and on-chain analytics platform, revealed that the metric is showing signs of weakness. This cooling period in the crucial metric indicates that large and long-term BTC investors are reducing their aggressive purchasing habits. According to the on-chain platform, the BTC accumulation trend score has softened with conviction from large cohorts despite elevated costs. Even though the indicator still demonstrates healthy levels of holding, the recent softening points to a break in the surge of accumulation that may have been boosting the market uptrend and confidence. Such a change currently may signal a transitory stage in which institutions and whales reevaluate their positions in light of altered sentiment toward cryptocurrencies and changing macroeconomic periods. Glassnode highlighted that a more cautious bid is frequently indicated by lighter accumulation. At the end, this cautious trend leaves the BTC market susceptible to a supply overhang until demand picks up speed once again. Market Eyes Shift As BTC Exchange Inflows Drop Investors’ conviction in Bitcoin has not yet fully faded, as evidenced by a drop in BTC total Inflows to all crypto exchanges. In a quick-take post on the CryptoQuant platform, Nino, a market expert, claims that the declining BTC exchange inflows hint at a possible shift in market dynamics and sentiment. Nino determined the continuous decline using the 7-day Moving Average (MA) time frame. Given the present market state, the expert noted that this trend could be explained in multiple ways. When there is a high influx, it often points to potential selling pressure , and derivative markets face a more complex situation than spot exchanges. Furthermore, a surge in inflows may not necessarily imply a clear market direction but rather the potential for future high volatility due to the fact that the funds can be used to open both long and short positions. As a result, the declining inflow might suggest a rising confidence among holders to retain their assets off exchanges. Considering the trend, a s hort-term supply reduction becomes highly likely. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $109,492, showing a nearly 2% drop within the last 24 hours. Despite the fading momentum, its trading volume in the past day has increased by over 36%, indicating a gradual resurgence in bullish bets.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score|bitcoin exchange inflows|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Glassnode|MA|moving average|Nino,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 20:00:01

The largest cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $109,000, which is just 11% below its all-time high. The leading predictions are as follows: Bitwise: $200,000 Standard Chartered: 200 thousand dollars VanEck: $180,000 Matrixport: $160,000 Galaxy Digital: $185,000 Bernstein: $200,000 Anthony Scaramucci: $180,000–$200,000 Peter Brandt: $150,000–$280,000 Arthur Hayes: $250,000 Meanwhile, CoinGecko published its “Bitcoin Dominance in Cryptocurrency Portfolios” report, revealing retail investors' perspectives on Bitcoin. According to the survey, nearly half of investors consider Bitcoin the most important asset in their portfolios. While 20.4% of respondents built their portfolios almost entirely on BTC, the most common strategy, at 28%, was to prioritize Bitcoin and hold small amounts of altcoins. This suggests that many investors are choosing to hold BTC before later diversifying into riskier altcoins. Conversely, approximately a quarter of investors consider Bitcoin less important. 17.3% of respondents distribute their portfolios equally between BTC and altcoins, while 10.2% allocate most of their funds to altcoins and a small portion to BTC. A more extreme 15.9% view Bitcoin as completely unimportant and invest solely in altcoins. This group believes BTC now has limited growth potential or is keeping its distance from the leading cryptocurrency for various reasons. *This is not investment advice.

The world’s largest asset manager has a history of moving deliberately in digital assets, and every hint of interest sends ripples through the market. Now, an illuminating discussion is shedding new light on how BlackRock views the possibility of an XRP ETF—and what it might mean for the token’s price action in the weeks ahead. Strategic Patience from the World’s Largest Asset Manager During an interview highlighted by Good Morning Crypto host Abdullah Nassif, ETF Store president Nate Geraci asked Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, about the firm’s approach to future crypto ETF products, including the possibility of spot XRP and Solana funds. Geraci suggested that BlackRock might be waiting to “swoop in at the last minute” with an application once a formal regulatory framework is in place. BLACKROCK TALKS $XRP ETF FILING! EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW! CLICK BELOW TO WATCH NOW! https://t.co/NpQL7p6FHm — Good Morning Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) September 26, 2025 Mitchnick’s response underscored BlackRock’s hallmark caution. He explained that investor demand and market conditions remain the primary drivers of any new product offering. BlackRock will only consider filing for an XRP ETF when it is confident about client interest, market maturity, liquidity, and the strength of the asset’s long-term investment thesis. This is the same methodical strategy the firm employed before launching its successful spot Bitcoin ETF , when it quietly built exposure and infrastructure before making a public move. Regulatory Landscape Shapes the Timeline Even with the SEC’s recent adoption of generic listing standards that shorten the approval process for spot crypto ETFs, XRP faces unique regulatory complexities. Although Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have concluded their long-running legal battle, lingering questions about XRP’s classification have kept major financial institutions cautious. Mitchnick acknowledged that BlackRock is closely monitoring regulatory developments to ensure any future filing meets all compliance requirements and offers the clarity its clients expect. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The timing of any potential filing is therefore tied to Washington as much as Wall Street. While the SEC’s updated framework has made it easier for exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe to list crypto ETFs, XRP’s history demands an extra layer of certainty. BlackRock is unlikely to proceed until that clarity is beyond dispute. XRP Price Under Pressure While speculation around an ETF continues , XRP’s price has struggled to hold recent highs. After reaching a high of nearly $3.60 this summer, XRP has pulled back about 25% amid a crypto market downturn. Over the last week, it’s shed around 7.93% as traders reduce their risk exposure. Technical analysts are watching key support levels around $2.80 to $2.90. A decisive break below that range could trigger a deeper correction toward $2.50, while a rebound could set the stage for a move back to the $3.20–$3.60 zone if market sentiment improves. For now, investors remain cautious, balancing optimism over a potential ETF with the reality of short-term volatility. What to Expect in the Coming Weeks The conversation shared by Abdullah Nassif’s Good Morning Crypto podcast makes it clear that BlackRock will not be rushed. The firm’s deliberate approach means that an XRP ETF filing—if it comes—will be timed with precision, not hype. Market participants should therefore temper expectations of an imminent announcement, focusing instead on the evolving regulatory backdrop and XRP’s ability to maintain critical price support. BlackRock’s track record suggests that when the conditions are right—robust investor demand, clear regulation, and a mature market—its entry could be swift and decisive. Until then, the XRP community is left to watch the charts and the regulatory calendar, waiting to see whether the world’s largest asset manager will once again change the landscape of digital-asset investing.
