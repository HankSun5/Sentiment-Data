Bitcoin surged to a fresh record of $124,128 just last month. At the same time, the ecosystem continues to broaden, with strong investor enthusiasm carrying over into prominent altcoins and best meme coins . Over the past year, many tokens have achieved new peaks, showcasing the market’s renewed optimism. This resurgence has largely been fueled by two major policy developments out of Washington. First, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first major legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins. Second, the SEC introduced Project Crypto, a framework designed to modernize and clarify how securities laws intersect with digital assets. With improving sentiment, investors are eyeing leading altcoins like XRP, Pepe, and Dogecoin as some of the most attractive dip-buying plays ahead of the next potential bull cycle. Ripple ($XRP): Cross-Border Payment Pioneer and 2025 Blue-Chip Candidate Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , hit a record high of $3.65 on July 18, the same day as the passage of the GENIUS Act. In doing so, it surpassed its previous 2018 peak of $3.40. It has since pulled back to roughly $2.84, representing about a 22% decline from its recent high. XRP’s strength lies in its role as a low-cost, efficient solution for global money transfers, positioning it as a modern alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. This reputation has been bolstered by backing from the UN Capital Development Fund and recognition from the U.S. Ripple’s policy influence was highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a White House crypto regulation roundtable earlier this year. Additionally, with the rollout of RLUSD, a dollar-pegged stablecoin, Ripple has set its sights on capturing a meaningful share in the stablecoin market. Momentum accelerated after a pivotal 2023 court ruling declared XRP’s retail transactions were not securities, ending a lengthy battle with the SEC and marking a major victory for the industry. Over the past year, XRP has delivered a 383% gain, quintupling Bitcoin’s 76% growth. After July’s rally, the token established support near $3, though seasonal weakness in September saw it dip below that level. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers around 42 and may be continuing downward, further discounting the price. While rate cuts and the recent approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t trigger an immediate breakout, probably because markets had already priced it in, additional higher-profile spot ETF decisions expected in mid-October could push XRP above $4 within weeks. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme-Culture Favorite With Room to Run Pepe ($PEPE) , launched in April 2023, quickly rose to the ranks of top meme tokens by market capitalization, inspired by Matt Furie’s famous frog character from his Boy’s Club webcomic. Its meteoric rise inspired countless imitators, though none replicated its success. With a market cap of around $4 billion, Pepe has attracted worldwide attention, even appearing as Elon Musk’s profile picture on X for a brief stint. Currently trading at about $0.000009433, PEPE is currently feeling the effects of a market-wide dip. The coin currently sits 66% below its record high of $0.00002803 from late 2024. However, historically, October tends to be bullish for crypto, and if the “Uptober” trend holds, Pepe could claim new highs as early as November. At present, its RSI is 38 and trending downward, suggesting that further near-term declines may create additional dip-buying opportunities. Supporters argue that a stronger macro backdrop, combined with growing investor optimism, could help propel PEPE to fresh highs later this year. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Is the Original Meme Coin Ready for $1? Initially created in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since transformed into the most recognized meme coin, supported by a loyal fan base and a market capitalization of $35.4 billion. The coin gained mainstream attention in 2021 thanks to backing from celebrities like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons. This past May, renewed institutional activity pushed DOGE back above $0.25 amid speculation of a potential U.S. spot Dogecoin ETF. It now trades around $0.2334, down about 3% alongside a broader correction across all crypto that has hit the meme coin sector a little harder. Meme coins collectively fell 2% to a combined $75.1 billion market cap. Zooming out, the wider $4 trillion crypto market slipped 1.5% today, signalling a general pullback. For long-term holders, this could represent an ideal entry point to stack DOGE. Technically, DOGE’s RSI stands at 44, indicating more potential downside as the selloff continues going into the weekend. However, a rebound later by Monday ahead of “Uptober” could pave the way for meaningful gains, since October has historically been a bullish month for crypto. With increasing adoption, Tesla accepting DOGE for certain purchases and platforms like PayPal and Revolut expanding support, the coin’s real-world utility continues to grow. If positive momentum continues, DOGE could approach the $0.50 level by mid-October, with the coveted $1 target remaining in sight. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Layer 2 Presale Targeting 2025 Growth Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is emerging as one of 2025’s most notable presales, aiming to become the first Bitcoin Layer 2 project that merges viral meme appeal with scalability and decentralized governance. The initiative seeks to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling faster transactions, expanded smart contract functionality, and community-driven governance. So far, the presale has attracted approximately $18.1 million, with analysts projecting potential post-launch gains of 10× or more. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER enables fast, low-cost smart contracts. A key feature is its Canonical Bridge, which allows near-instant Bitcoin transfers while also supporting dApps, meme tokens, and payment solutions. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, boosting investor confidence. The $HYPER token has multiple utilities within the ecosystem, including staking, transaction fees, and governance rights. Early buyers can secure staking rewards up to 65% APY and gain voting privileges once the platform is live.

52263636,https://cryptonews.com/?p=428300,1758839400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52263636.jpeg,"Google’s Gemini AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Shiba Inu and Solana by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/googles-gemini-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-shiba-inu-and-solana-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Google’s in-house ChatGPT rival Gemini AI paints a bullish outlook for the crypto market, suggesting that XRP, Shiba Inu, and Solana could emerge as the biggest gainers if digital assets move into a strong upward trend heading into the final quarter. Bitcoin recently smashed past its previous record, hitting $124,128 last month before easing back slightly after an unexpected rise in July inflation numbers. A week ago, the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% rate cut, briefly boosting risk assets. However, Trump’s surprise proposal of a one-off $100,000 H-1B visa application fee rattled investors, sparking heavy liquidations across crypto markets over the weekend. On the policy front, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act earlier this summer, the first U.S. law to regulate stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold full reserves. Meanwhile, the SEC launched Project Crypto, a major initiative to modernize how securities rules apply to blockchain assets. Together, these catalysts could set the stage for the next explosive altcoin cycle. If Gemini AI’s projections hold true, XRP, Shiba Inu, and Solana could be among the biggest winners in the months ahead. XRP (Ripple): Gemini AI Forecasts $20—A 7× Upside Gemini AI projects Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could surge to $20 by late 2025, around seven times higher than its current trading price of around $2.83. The token has already had a strong year, surpassing its 2018 record of $3.40 and climbing to $3.65 on July 18 before retracing about 22%. Ripple’s international reach is growing, underscored by the UN Capital Development Fund’s recognition in 2024 of XRP as a practical solution for cross-border payments in developing regions. Earlier this year, Ripple finally put its long-standing battle with the SEC behind it, as the regulator dropped its case. This reinforced the landmark 2023 court decision that XRP’s retail sales are not securities, a precedent that resonates in victory across the altcoin sector. According to Gemini AI, XRP’s likely New Year trading zone sits between $5 and $10, with more optimistic scenarios targeting $20, particularly if the Trump administration implements long-promised crypto legislation. Additionally, the SEC is likely to approve a raft of high-profile spot XRP ETFs in mid-October, which could add substantial inflows. Technical indicators support optimism: XRP’s RSI recently dipped to 42, signaling undervaluation and the possibility of a rebound rally. Multiple bullish flag patterns across the chart this year may also hint at a breakout. Positive sentiment could drive XRP back to $4 by October. Over the past 12 months, XRP has soared 383%, hurtling past Bitcoin’s 76% and Ethereum’s 51% gains over the same period. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Gemini AI Predicts Up to 8.5× Growth in a Bull Market Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become Dogecoin’s fiercest competitor, boasting a market cap of around $7 billion. Currently trading near $0.00001176 after a 4% dip in the past 24 hours, SHIB has corrected a little harder than the rest of the meme coin market, which collectively lost 2.2% overnight to post a capitalization of $75.1 billion. On the technical front, SHIB has already broken out of both a falling wedge and a bull flag this year. A move above $0.000025 by November could validate Gemini AI’s target range of $0.00005–$0.00008 by year-end. In the event of a major bull run, the model suggests SHIB could rocket as high as $0.0001, a tidy potential 8.5× gain from current prices. Its RSI sits at 37 following recent corrections. This serves both as a signal that the token is discounted and it potentially sets up a rapid bounce if traders capitalize on the dip when the correction ends. Shiba Inu has also expanded beyond its meme coin roots, powering Shibarium, a dedicated Layer-2 blockchain that supports fast, low-cost transactions, decentralized apps, and added privacy, distinguishing it from rival meme projects. Solana (SOL): Gemini AI Sees ETF Buzz and Ecosystem Strength Driving a Push to $1,000 Solana ($SOL) has cemented itself as a top smart contract network with a market cap of over $108.4 billion and total value locked (TVL) at around $11 billion across its ecosystem. Developer activity and institutional adoption continue to grow. Speculation is mounting that a U.S. spot Solana ETF could be on the horizon, which may trigger similar inflows to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Adding to the intrigue, Trump has even floated the idea of including Solana in a potential U.S. national Bitcoin reserve. Under his plan, however, the government would only obtain SOL through asset seizures, not direct purchases. Price-wise, Solana hit $250 in January, dropped to $100 in April, and rebounded to $198 last week, nearly retesting this year’s high. Having recently broken out of a descending wedge, Gemini AI projects Solana could climb as high as $1,000 by year-end, more than tripling its all-time high of $293.31. That said, regulatory clarity and ETF approvals will be crucial to achieving this milestone. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Speculative Alternative to Dogecoin For those exploring riskier meme coin plays outside Gemini AI’s top picks, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as Dogecoin’s more volatile cousin. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap token often moving with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Maxi Doge embraces high-risk speculation, bolstered by edgy branding and a grassroots community. Its presale has already raised $2.5 million within its first month. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI cultivates community engagement through Telegram and Discord campaigns, trading contests, and cross-project collaborations. Out of its 150.24 billion token supply, 25% is allocated to the Maxi Fund for marketing and partnerships. Staking is live with eye-catching rewards of 133% APY, though yields will gradually decline as participation rises. Currently selling for $0.000259, although the price rises in scheduled nominal increments as the presale progresses through the funding rounds. Interested investors can join via wallets such as MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

The application was submitted today. The goal is to launch a fund that pays investors income using premiums tied to Bitcoin. This isn’t the same kind of product as their earlier spot Bitcoin ETF. It’s built to hand out actual income, not track the price of Bitcoin. This filing follows the success of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF , known as IBIT, which reached $90 billion in assets by September, and now controls 60% of the U.S. Bitcoin ETF market. Both BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have achieved over $260 million in annual revenue within two years. BlackRock shifts focus to Bitcoin income generation The new fund is built for yield-focused investors; people who want income, not just exposure to Bitcoin’s price. That’s different from IBIT , which only follows Bitcoin’s price movements. This premium income ETF will likely use Bitcoin-linked strategies to generate steady payouts. A BlackRock statement said, “Investors are looking for ways to benefit from Bitcoin while minimizing price volatility.” The company has already raked in serious cash from its crypto lineup. Its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs pulled in $260 million in yearly revenue, and that was in under two years. And BlackRock didn’t stop at launching ETFs. It’s been adding crypto to its model portfolios too. They’re now allocating 1% to 2% of those portfolios to Bitcoin, giving regular investors small but steady exposure to digital assets. The new income-focused ETF also targets a different type of investor than their previous products, and instead of tracking value, this ETF will focus on generating returns from Bitcoin premiums, which could come from covered call strategies or similar income-producing methods. BlackRock’s statement continued, “There’s a growing class of investors who want to access Bitcoin’s potential without being exposed to its full volatility.” The firm said this new fund was made to meet that demand directly.

These three coins have all taken significant hits, although some alts—such as Solana, Dogecoin, and Avalanche—have seen 24-hour losses rising above 4% today. This may be disappointing news for anyone who expected last week’s (priced-in) rate cut to result in a bull rally, yet overselling increases the odds of a vigorous comeback. And this is what we’re seeing with XRP, Cardano and Litecoin, which we’ll analyse in this article. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – ETF Approvals Will Push Alt to New Record Highs XRP has dropped back down to $2.82 today, making for a 1.5% loss in 24 hours and a 9.5% decline in a week. But while the altcoin is also down by 3% in a month, it retains a very healthy 380% increase in the past year, making it one of the best-performing top-100 coins over this timeframe. There are two main things to point out when it comes to its crypto price prediction, with the first being that the SEC is very likely to approve several XRP ETFs in the next few weeks. And once these gain the green light, XRP could witness an influx in institutional demand, pushing its price ever higher. Secondly, its indicators show that it’s in a decidedly oversold position, and given its rock-solid fundamentals, this should result in a rebound very soon. Source: TradingView Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have both fallen into negative positions over the past few days, meaning that XRP is selling below a ‘fair’ average price. In turn, this means it could recover very soon, potentially reaching $3 by the middle of October, before ETF approvals send it towards $5 for the end-of-year rally. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA)—Oversold Alt About to Receive Big Push from Grayscale ETF ADA has been one of the bigger losers today, having fallen by 4.5% in 24 hours, to $0.7844. This also represents a 14% loss in a week and a 7% decline in 30 days, although the alt remains up by 100% in a year. And as with XRP, ADA is also waiting on the SEC to approve ETF applications, although it has only one outstanding application to wait for, from Grayscale. Even though it’s less popular among ETF providers, the approval of Grayscale’s ETF could be a massive boost for ADA. Such approvals may arrive just at a time when ADA’s indicators bottom out, meaning that the coin could experience a big price swing upwards. Source: TradingView Its RSI is on its way down to 30 or even lower, so soon ADA will be trading at a discount that investors may be unable to resist. Whales have already been stocking up on the coin, with data showing that one big investor bought $56.8 million in ADA on Coinbase this week. Given such interest in Cardano, which is one of the biggest layer-one networks in crypto , its price is likely to experience a sharp recovery soon. It could reach $1 again by the end of October, while it has the potential to pass $2 in December. Crypto Price Prediction: Litecoin ($LTC)—Altcoin Preparing for Big Push Towards $1,000 Today has also been difficult for Litecoin, which at $103.45 is down by 3.5% in 24 hours and by 10% in a week. However, the same theme applies to LTC as it does to the coins above, in that its oversold price is about to combine with several ETF approvals. In fact, Litecoin is the likeliest altcoin to gain SEC approval, given its forking from Bitcoin. Canary, CoinShares and Grayscale are all waiting on decisions from the SEC, with Bloomberg analysts giving their applications a 95% chance of approval each. Source: TradingView We could therefore see the Litecoin price rise strongly, with its chart today showing that a bullish pennant has been forming since mid-July. Even more so than the two coins above, its RSI and MACD indicators are very close to bottoms, so we may not be that far from a rebound. Assuming SEC approval of the three coins above, it could reach $150 by the middle of October, before entering the New Year at above $500. PEPENODE Raises $1.4 Million in Presale: Could Mine-to-Earn Coin Be Next to 100x? The market is shaping up nicely for a end-of-year bull rally, so traders may want to diversify into newer tokens, in order to widen their exposure to the biggest possible gains. One way of doing this is to allocate some holdings to presale tokens, which can often surge when they list for the first time. Possibly the most interesting presale coin at the moment is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), an ERC-20 token that’s introducing some very novel mine-to-earn functionality. PEPENODE has now raised over $1.4 million in its ICO, which it opened only a few weeks ago, with this figure providing an early warning of its future potential. The PEPENODE presale is live.

XRP / USD 1-day chart, triple bottom fuels bull flag breakout. Source: TradingView. Still, momentum indicators are not decidedly bullish, a sentiment echoed by analysts who call for sustained buy pressure for the triple bottom to be realised. The RSI is stabilizing in the 40s, showing sellers still hold some sway even as buying interest builds. The MACD histogram shows a similar trend shift, flattening into what could be an early golden cross above the signal line, which would confirm a bullish shift. If the flag pattern plays out, XRP could eye a breakout towards $5, an 80% gain from current levels, and a push towards all-time highs into new price discovery. With further U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approvals stacking as catalysts for demand running into Q4, the rally could even extend as far as $10, marking a 260% gain . However, this bullish case heavily relies on the $2.70 level holding as support.

Bitcoin mining giant TeraWulf is making headlines as it pursues a massive TeraWulf financing deal worth an astonishing $3 billion. This ambitious endeavor aims to fuel a substantial expansion of its data centers, signaling a strong belief in the future of digital assets. What’s Behind This Monumental TeraWulf Financing Push? According to reports from Bloomberg, TeraWulf is actively seeking this substantial capital injection. The core purpose is clear: to significantly boost its data center capacity. More data centers mean more power for Bitcoin mining, which is crucial for the company’s growth strategy. What makes this particular TeraWulf financing effort stand out is the reported involvement of tech behemoth Google. The search giant is said to be providing a guarantee for the funds, adding a layer of credibility and stability to the deal. Leading the charge on the financial side is Morgan Stanley, a global leader in investment banking. Key Players: TeraWulf (the mining firm), Google (guarantee provider), Morgan Stanley (lead financier). Goal: Expand data centers to enhance Bitcoin mining operations. Scale: A staggering $3 billion in capital. Why is Data Center Expansion So Crucial for Bitcoin Mining? For a Bitcoin mining company like TeraWulf, data centers are the lifeblood of their operations. These facilities house thousands of specialized computers, known as ASICs, that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. Successfully solving a puzzle allows the miner to add a new block of transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain and earn new bitcoins as a reward. Expanding data centers means: Increased Hash Rate: More machines translate to a higher hash rate, improving the company’s chances of mining Bitcoin.

Imagine an investment vehicle that not only offers exposure to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies but also champions environmental responsibility. This is precisely what 7RCC is proposing with its innovative application for a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF . This groundbreaking filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) aims to combine spot Bitcoin with carbon credits, as reported by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. This move, submitted under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, marks a significant moment for both digital assets and sustainable investing. What Exactly is the Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF? At its core, the proposed Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF seeks to blend two distinct asset classes: spot Bitcoin and carbon credits. Spot Bitcoin refers to directly holding the cryptocurrency itself, rather than derivatives. Carbon credits, on the other hand, are measurable, verifiable permits that allow the owner to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. These credits are typically generated by projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere. 7RCC’s vision is to create a single investment product that gives investors exposure to both. This unique combination could offer a fresh approach to diversification, appealing to a broader range of investors interested in both growth potential and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. It’s a bold step that could redefine what a traditional ETF can encompass, especially in the rapidly expanding digital asset space. Why Combine Bitcoin and Carbon Credits in an ETF? The decision to pair Bitcoin with carbon credits might seem unconventional at first glance, but it addresses several key market trends and investor demands. For years, Bitcoin has faced criticism regarding its energy consumption and environmental footprint. By integrating carbon credits, the Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF could offer a mechanism to offset some of these concerns, presenting a “greener” way to invest in Bitcoin. Moreover, this innovative structure offers a dual benefit: Environmental Responsibility: The inclusion of carbon credits directly supports projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with growing global efforts towards sustainability. Diversification and Growth: Investors gain exposure to Bitcoin’s potential for significant returns while also participating in the burgeoning carbon credit market, which is vital for combating climate change. This approach could potentially attract institutional investors who are increasingly mandated to consider ESG factors in their portfolios. It’s an attempt to bridge the gap between traditional finance, digital assets, and environmental stewardship, all within a regulated framework. Navigating the Challenges of a Hybrid Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF While the concept of a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF is exciting, its path to approval and market acceptance comes with inherent challenges. The U.S. SEC has historically been cautious about approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, though recent approvals signal a shift. However, adding carbon credits introduces another layer of complexity. The regulatory landscape for carbon markets is still evolving, and integrating it with a digital asset like Bitcoin requires careful consideration. Key challenges include: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously evaluate the fund’s structure, custody arrangements for both Bitcoin and carbon credits, and valuation methodologies. Market Volatility: Both Bitcoin and carbon credit markets can experience significant price fluctuations, which could impact the ETF’s performance. Operational Complexity: Managing two distinct and often volatile asset classes within a single fund requires robust operational frameworks and expertise. Despite these hurdles, 7RCC’s filing represents a proactive step towards addressing environmental concerns often associated with cryptocurrencies, potentially paving the way for more sustainable crypto investment products. What Does This Revolutionary ETF Mean for Investors? For investors, the potential approval of a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF could open up new avenues for portfolio diversification and values-aligned investing. It provides a simplified way to gain exposure to both Bitcoin and the environmental commodities market without the complexities of direct ownership. This could be particularly appealing to those who have been hesitant about Bitcoin due to its environmental impact, offering a more palatable entry point. Should this ETF come to fruition, it could: Enhance Accessibility: Make investing in Bitcoin and carbon credits easier for retail and institutional investors through traditional brokerage accounts. Promote Sustainable Investing: Encourage more capital flow into environmental projects by increasing demand for carbon credits. Set a Precedent: Potentially inspire other asset managers to develop hybrid funds that blend digital assets with other socially responsible investments. The journey to approval will be closely watched, as its success could significantly influence the future of sustainable investing in the digital asset space. The filing by 7RCC for a Bitcoin Carbon Credit ETF is undoubtedly a pioneering move, pushing the boundaries of what an exchange-traded fund can achieve. By proposing to combine the innovation of spot Bitcoin with the environmental commitment of carbon credits, 7RCC is attempting to create a unique investment vehicle that addresses both financial growth and ecological responsibility. While regulatory hurdles and market complexities remain, this initiative highlights a growing trend towards integrating sustainability into the core of digital finance. It’s a testament to the ongoing evolution of investment products designed to meet the diverse and increasingly conscientious demands of today’s investors.

A significant development has emerged that could reshape how investment firms operate in the digital asset space: US regulators are now actively probing potential crypto insider trading . What Sparked the Current Scrutiny into Crypto Insider Trading ? Recent reports indicate that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have launched an investigation into potential crypto insider trading . This isn’t just a casual inquiry; it’s a serious look into the trading activities of companies that have adopted cryptocurrency treasury strategies. Authorities sent letters to approximately 200 companies. Concerns were raised over unusual surges in trading volume and stock prices. These surges often occurred immediately before public disclosures about crypto strategies. The letters also highlighted possible violations of fair disclosure rules, which aim to prevent selective sharing of material non-public information. Industry observers view this move as a clear signal: a full-scale regulatory probe into crypto insider trading is likely underway, marking a critical moment for market integrity. Understanding Insider Trading in the Crypto Context Insider trading, in essence, involves using material, non-public information to make trades for personal gain. While traditionally associated with conventional stocks, its application to the crypto market, especially concerning company treasury strategies, presents new challenges. When a company announces it has added cryptocurrency to its balance sheet, it often impacts its stock price. If individuals with advance knowledge of such an announcement trade the company’s stock before the public disclosure, they could be engaging in insider trading. This practice undermines market fairness and investor confidence. The regulators’ focus on firms with ‘crypto treasury strategies’ means they are looking at how companies manage their digital asset holdings and how information about these holdings is handled before it becomes public knowledge. How Regulators Are Tackling Potential Violations The SEC and FINRA’s approach is methodical. By sending letters and requesting information, they are gathering data to identify patterns that suggest illicit activities. This proactive stance is crucial for maintaining transparency and trust in both traditional and emerging markets. Fair disclosure rules, such as Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) in the US, mandate that companies disseminate material non-public information broadly and simultaneously to all investors. This prevents select individuals from gaining an unfair advantage. Violating these rules can lead to significant penalties, including fines and legal action. Moreover, this investigation highlights the increasing convergence of traditional financial regulations with the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. As more mainstream companies embrace digital assets, the need for robust oversight against activities like crypto insider trading becomes paramount. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market and Investment Firms? This probe carries significant implications. For investment firms, it underscores the urgent need for stringent internal controls and clear communication policies regarding their crypto holdings and strategies. Compliance departments will need to be extra vigilant. For the broader crypto market, this regulatory action could be a double-edged sword. While it might initially create uncertainty, in the long run, it could foster greater investor confidence by signaling that authorities are serious about combating market manipulation. A transparent and fair market is essential for sustained growth and institutional adoption. Increased Scrutiny: Expect more regulatory attention on crypto-related announcements and trading patterns. Enhanced Compliance: Firms must review and strengthen their internal policies to prevent crypto insider trading . Investor Confidence: Stronger enforcement can lead to a more trusted market environment. Regulatory Clarity: This probe may pave the way for clearer guidelines on digital asset disclosures. Actionable Insights for Firms and Investors In this evolving landscape, vigilance is key. For firms with crypto treasury strategies, it’s vital to: Ensure strict adherence to fair disclosure rules. Implement robust internal trading policies. Educate employees on what constitutes material non-public information. Conduct regular audits of trading activities preceding major announcements. For investors, understanding these regulatory developments can help in making more informed decisions. It reinforces the importance of researching a company’s compliance practices and being aware of the broader regulatory environment. A Critical Juncture for Crypto Integrity The ongoing probe into crypto insider trading marks a critical juncture for the digital asset space. It signals a maturing market where traditional financial regulations are increasingly being applied to new technologies. While the full extent of this investigation is yet to unfold, its message is clear: transparency, fairness, and compliance are non-negotiable. As the crypto ecosystem continues to grow, such regulatory actions are essential steps toward building a more robust and trustworthy financial future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is crypto insider trading ? Crypto insider trading refers to the illegal practice of trading a company’s stock or related assets based on material, non-public information about its cryptocurrency treasury strategies or other crypto-related developments. This information is typically obtained through privileged access and gives an unfair advantage. Q2: Which regulatory bodies are involved in this probe? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) are the primary bodies conducting this investigation. Q3: Why are companies with ‘crypto treasury strategies’ being targeted? These companies are being targeted because their announcements of adopting cryptocurrency treasury strategies have often been preceded by suspicious surges in their stock prices. This pattern suggests that non-public information might have been used for illicit trading. Q4: What are ‘fair disclosure rules’ and why are they important? Fair disclosure rules, like the SEC’s Regulation FD, require companies to disseminate material non-public information broadly and simultaneously to all investors. They are crucial for preventing selective disclosure and ensuring that all market participants have equal access to information, thus promoting a fair and level playing field. Q5: What are the potential consequences for firms found guilty of insider trading? Firms and individuals found guilty of insider trading can face severe penalties, including substantial fines, disgorgement of illicit gains, civil lawsuits, and even criminal charges, leading to imprisonment.

The overlapping signals, he argues, identify a well-defined take-profit band for XRP between roughly $8.43 and $13.58. “Four charts to rule them all,” he wrote, adding that the market is “clearly positioning itself for higher prices.” Four Charts Signal XRP $8.43–$13.58 Peak On the XRP/USD monthly chart, Bobby plots a multi-month consolidation which is built above “Base Camp 1” and, more recently, above “Base Camp 2.” The structure sits on top of a series of higher lows marked on the chart, with the consolidation developing after price reclaimed long-term moving-average clusters and the upper Bollinger band expanded. The Fibonacci extension grid anchored to the prior cycle shows 1.618 at approximately $5.26, 2.618 at about $8.43, 3.618 near $11.66, and 4.236 at roughly $13.58. Bobby labels the $8.43–$13.58 span as the “Take Profit Zone,” aligning it with the 2.618–4.236 extensions that capped previous euphoric runs on the same timeframe. Beneath the candles, the monthly momentum suite is turning higher: the RSI sits in a positive regime “preparing to initiate one final move toward overbought territory,” while stochastic and MACD lines have curled up from mid-range, consistent with trend continuation rather than exhaustion. Related Reading: XRP Supply Shock Incoming As Axelar And Flare Target 8 Billion Tokens That price-based roadmap is cross-checked against XRP’s total market capitalization on the weekly timeframe. Here, Bobby highlights “price acceptance above the 2018 peak surrounded by skepticism and uncertainty” and annotates “over 300 days consolidating above 2018 highs.” The Fibonacci projection on market cap places the 1.618 extension near ~$210.7 billion, with a boxed “Take Profit Zone” parked just below the ultimate extension band and an overhead dashed guide around ~$13.00 that visually rhymes with the 4.236 price extension on the USD chart. The message of this pane is less about day-to-day candles and more about location: a lengthy basing and re-accumulation phase above a historic ceiling, which converts that ceiling into support and sets up measured-move targets. Macro risk appetite is addressed in the third panel via the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) on the monthly chart. “IWM 1M is firing on all cylinders, and new ATHs are inbound regardless of any short-term noise,” Bobby writes. The chart shows a strong bullish candle reclaiming the 0.786–0.886 retracement area and pressing back into the prior range top around $244–$252. Upside Fibonacci targets are mapped at 1.272 ~$267.1, 1.414 ~$278.9, and 1.618 ~$296.8. The RSI, stochastic oscillator, and MACD on this timeframe are all pointed higher, with Bobby calling the breakout candle “very telling,” the kind of multi-indicator alignment he says “occurs only a few times per decade.” The implication is that a risk-on tone in US small-caps historically pairs well with liquidity rotating into higher-beta crypto segments. Related Reading: Analyst Highlights 2 Scenarios That Sends XRP Price To $9.6 And $33 The final piece is Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) on the weekly chart. Bobby’s retracement panel measures the advance from ~38.9% to ~66.1% share and now shows BTC.D slipping beneath the 23.6% line (~59.7%) and hovering near the 38.2% (~55.5%). Notably, the BTC.D slipped below an ascending channel. Based on that, he draws a downward arrow toward the 50% level (~52.3%) and then into the 61.8% retracement (~49.1%), with a target rectangle in the mid-to-low-40s bracketed by the 78.6% (~45.9%) and 88.6% (~43.2%) levels. “BTC.D will inevitably initiate a move toward the mid to low 40% zone,” he writes. A decline in dominance of that magnitude typically coincides with capital rotating from Bitcoin into large-cap altcoins—precisely the regime in which XRP has historically captured outsized relative performance. At press time, XRP traded at $2.84.

In it, they openly admit that developers made mistakes in the way the bridge was set up and managed. They also acknowledge that they initially didn’t make decentralization a priority. Now, they claim that addressing this issue and improving security are their primary objectives. Shibarium Bridge Security Update: Shiba Inu Devs Accept Responsibility In the latest update , Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya explains that the project’s leadership holds full responsibility for validator key management. She also admits that the team did not prioritize decentralization during the early stages of the bridge, a choice the developers now call a mistake and are working to correct immediately. The team is actively reinforcing Shibarium’s bridge controls and custody policies to prevent similar issues from occurring again. The compromised validators included internal ones, and while a full forensic review is still underway, the possible attack paths include a cloud breach, a compromised developer device, or a supply-chain weakness. The update revealed validator signing keys were in AWS Key Management Service, with limited use on developer machines for administrative tasks. It also provides operational context, noting that each validator held approximately 10,000 BONE in self-delegation, and the team never utilized the rewards from these validators. To increase transparency, the Shibarium bridge security update includes a detailed FAQ section that directly addresses the validator compromise. It clarifies that all answers reflect the team’s current understanding and may evolve as forensic analysis and third-party reviews continue. By sharing these details openly, the Shiba Inu developers are showing that they are not avoiding the Shibarium bridge issue but instead are confronting it directly. Roadmap Forward: Stronger Decentralization And Security With the security review underway, the Shiba Inu developers are now focusing on how to strengthen Shibarium for the long term. In the update, Kaal Dhairya said decentralization will no longer be an afterthought. The network, which had leaned too much on internal validators, will now open up to professional operators and trusted applicants. Dhairya explained that developer recruitment now includes government ID checks and verification through a recognized HR platform, steps that guarantee only trusted individuals can handle sensitive parts of the network. At the end of the update, they made their priorities clear – to protect users, secure the network, contain the attacker, and bring services back online safely. They note that decentralization has always been at the core of Shibarium’s roadmap. Still, early validator applicants refused to complete KYC, and outreach to professional operators failed to progress, which delayed the process. That setback forced the Shiba Inu team to rely on internal validators, a choice they now regret and commit to correcting by expanding validator decentralization , introducing stricter key-rotation rules, and improving custody solutions.",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium network|Shibarium news|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-25 23:00:28

The meme coin faces a decisive moment that could spark a deeper correction or mark a buy-the-dip opportunity. Whales appear to be betting on the latter. Over the past week, the top 100 BONK wallets have deepened their holdings by 3.80 trillion tokens, according to Nansen data . Top 100 Bonk wallets accumulate alongside price decline. Source: Nansen. This show of conviction comes as market narratives continue to favor a Q4 bull run. Rex-Osprey, the issuer behind the first Dogecoin spot ETF, may have a clear shot at a first Bonk spot ETF under new SEC generic listing standards to fast-track crypto ETP approvals. And with U.S. inflation nearing the Fed’s 2% target, hopes for further interest rate cuts are strengthening, fuelling risk-on sentiment and capital rotation into more speculative plays like Bonk.

The current retest of psychological support at $0.000019 marks the final barrier to a breakdown of Bonk’s 6-month support trendline and a wider ascending broadening wedge pattern. BONK / USDT 12-hour chart, ascending broadening wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators lean toward a bounce. The RSI is approaching the oversold threshold at 30, a level that often marks local bottoms as sellers reach exhaustion. The MACD histogram shows a similar shift, reversing toward the signal line in what could be the early stages of a golden cross, signaling a potential new uptrend. If the wedge’s lower boundary holds as a launchpad, the next upward move could target a retest of its upper resistance. That would put the $0.0001 level back in focus, a potential 425% gain from current levels . Still, resistance levels like the $0.00004075 July high and Bonk’s $0.000062 all-time high stand as critical hurdles. To flip them to support, fresh demand catalysts such as U.S. rate cuts and spot ETF approvals will likely be necessary to sustain the rally into 2026. History Says This Bull Run Could Deliver Bonk’s Successor – the Market Has Already Spoken With this breakout setup, Bonk continues to demonstrate a trend: the strongest social momentum lies with Doge-branded tokens. It all started with Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. Every bull run eventually delivers its own parabolic Doge-themed runner. Now, early momentum is pointing to Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the next in line. Maxi Doge blends a no-utility ethos with gym-culture satire and trader degeneracy, positioning itself as more than just a meme coin—it’s a lifestyle asset. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has already pulled in close to $2.5 million in its initial weeks, with early backers locking in a massive 134% APY through staking rewards. You can take part in the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale now on the official website . With exchange listings coming soon, now could be the best opportunity to get involved early.

This aggressive move suggests the company believes the market is undervaluing its position – and that sentiment could extend to DOGE, especially as institutional exposure to mining grows.

The firm recently acquired DogeHash Technologies, a Dogecoin miner that will own 3,500 rigs by the end of the year. In addition, Thumzup owns 19 Bitcoin (BTC) tokens and 7.5 million DOGE worth approximately $1.7 million. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Market Retests Key Trend Line Support Today’s price action has pushed DOGE to retest a key trend line support that could be decisive in determining the asset’s trajectory in the next few days. This key demand zone aligns with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), making it a critical area for buyers to defend. A strong bounce here could ignite a move toward $0.29, while a breakout above the rising wedge formation shown in the chart would confirm a bullish Dogecoin price prediction – with $0.40 as the first major target, and a potential run to $1 if momentum accelerates. Institutional backing from firms like Thumzup, combined with the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF, are adding fuel to the fire, setting the stage for DOGE to shine this cycle. Meanwhile, early crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could deliver even greater upside. With nearly $2.5 million raised so far, this project is building serious traction and could be the next breakout star. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Presale Unleashes Leverage-Powered Meme Trading Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum meme coin that draws inspiration from the popular Doge meme. Maxi Doge taps into a familiar cultural reference that already resonates with the crypto community. The presale has seen early traction, surpassing $2.4 million just a few weeks after its launch . What sets $MAXI apart is its focus on leveraged trading and capturing the market’s hype. Through the Maxi Fund, the project will devote up to 25% of the proceeds raised via the presale to make leveraged bets on the most promising tokens of the cycle. Partnerships with several crypto news aggregators will increase the token’s visibility, and buyers will reap the highest returns once it is listed on exchanges. To buy $MAXI, simply head to the Maxi Doge website and link a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap crypto for this meme coin or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

One of the most pressing issues gaining attention is crypto conflicts of interest . Recently, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced a pivotal move to address these very concerns, aiming to establish clear regulatory standards. This initiative comes amid heightened scrutiny, particularly concerning the cryptocurrency dealings of influential figures and their families. The goal is simple yet crucial: to safeguard market integrity and protect investors from potential abuses arising from undisclosed or unmanaged interests. What Exactly Are Crypto Conflicts of Interest ? At its core, a conflict of interest arises when an individual or entity has competing professional or personal interests. In the crypto space, this could mean: An exchange owner also trading on their own platform with insider knowledge. A project founder promoting their token while holding a significant, undisclosed stake. Regulators or policymakers having financial ties to crypto businesses they oversee. These situations can create an unfair advantage, erode trust, and potentially lead to market manipulation. Chairman Atkins, speaking at Georgetown University’s Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy conference, emphasized the SEC’s commitment. He stated that the agency will “root out” any such situations uncovered and “set clear standards.” Why Is Addressing These Conflicts So Crucial Now? The digital asset market has matured rapidly, attracting significant investment and mainstream attention. However, this growth also amplifies the risks associated with unchecked conflicts. When key players operate without transparent guidelines, it undermines the very principles of fair and open markets. Consider the potential impact: Investor Protection: Unscrupulous practices can lead to significant financial losses for everyday investors. Market Integrity: Undisclosed interests can distort market prices and create an uneven playing field. Public Trust: A lack of clear rules erodes confidence in the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, potentially hindering its long-term adoption and growth. The SEC’s proactive stance on crypto conflicts of interest is a direct response to these growing concerns, signaling a move towards greater accountability. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Regulating Crypto Conflicts of Interest ? Regulating the crypto space is notoriously complex due to its global, decentralized, and often pseudonymous nature. Establishing clear rules for conflicts of interest presents unique hurdles: Jurisdictional Issues: Crypto businesses often operate across borders, making it challenging to apply a single set of rules. Anonymity/Pseudonymity: Identifying beneficial owners and their diverse interests can be difficult. Rapid Innovation: New crypto products and services emerge constantly, often outpacing regulatory frameworks. Despite these challenges, the SEC’s intent is to create adaptable and robust standards. The goal is not to stifle innovation but to foster a healthier, more transparent environment where participants can operate with confidence. What Will New Standards for Crypto Conflicts of Interest Look Like? While the specifics are yet to be detailed, we can anticipate new standards focusing on transparency and disclosure. This might involve: Mandatory disclosure requirements for crypto project founders, exchange operators, and key influencers regarding their holdings and related business interests. Stricter ethical guidelines for individuals involved in crypto regulation and policy-making. Enhanced enforcement mechanisms to penalize non-compliance and deter future conflicts. These measures aim to create a level playing field, ensuring that all participants, from large institutions to individual investors, can engage in the crypto market with greater assurance. A Path Towards Greater Transparency The SEC’s commitment to addressing crypto conflicts of interest marks a significant step towards a more mature and trustworthy digital asset landscape. By setting clear standards, the agency aims to mitigate risks, enhance investor protection, and foster sustainable growth within the crypto ecosystem. This move is not just about enforcement; it’s about building a foundation of trust. As the crypto market continues to evolve, transparent and fair practices will be paramount for its long-term success. All stakeholders, from innovators to investors, stand to benefit from a clearer, more equitable regulatory environment.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a conflict of interest in the context of cryptocurrency? A1: A conflict of interest in crypto occurs when an individual or entity has competing interests—personal or professional—that could improperly influence their actions or decisions in the digital asset market, potentially for personal gain and at the expense of others. Q2: Why is the SEC addressing crypto conflicts of interest now? A2: The SEC is addressing these conflicts due to the rapid growth of the crypto market, increased investor participation, and growing controversies surrounding undisclosed interests of prominent figures. The aim is to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Q3: Who is Paul Atkins, and what is his role in this initiative? A3: Paul Atkins is the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He has announced the agency’s intention to establish clear regulatory standards to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest within the cryptocurrency sector. Q4: How might new regulations on crypto conflicts of interest benefit investors? A4: New regulations are expected to benefit investors by increasing transparency, reducing the potential for market manipulation, and ensuring a fairer playing field. This fosters greater trust and reduces the risks associated with undisclosed or unethical practices. Q5: Will these new rules stifle innovation in the crypto space? A5: The SEC’s stated goal is not to stifle innovation but to create a more secure and transparent environment. By setting clear boundaries, the rules aim to build a foundation of trust that can support sustainable and responsible innovation in the long term. Did you find this article insightful?

So I cried when I heard the court ruling.” Hunminjeongeum was Hwang’s own one-person entertainment agency, a company she owned in its entirety. The court heard that was found that Hwang Jung-eum invested most of the money she embezzled in cryptoassets. Prosecutors also explained that she also used money from her agency’s accounts to pay her credit card bills, and settle her property tax and local tax bills. The prosecution had asked the court to jail Hwang for three years during an August hearing . Prosecutors did not say whether they would seek to appeal the district court’s verdict. Hwang’s legal team noted that she had admitted to all the charges and had repaid the funds in two installments, on May 30 and June 5 this year.

The judge said that it had taken the fact that it was Hwang’s first offense into consideration. The presiding judge also concluded that the damages were “only limited to the defendant,” and noted that she had “repaid the entire amount of money she had embezzled.” Hwang, a former member of the South Korean pop group Sugar, made her small-screen breakthrough in the late 2000s when she appeared in the MBC sitcom High Kick Through The Roof.

With deadlines approaching in October and November, speculation is rising on how XRP’s price could respond if approvals are granted. Industry Braces for Wave of ETF Approvals A new report from Reuters revealed that the SEC has advanced work on its revised ETF rules, setting the stage for the first decisions within weeks. Market analysts expect multiple products, including those for XRP and Solana , to be among the earliest candidates for approval. Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital, confirmed that nearly a dozen applications have already been submitted, reflecting growing anticipation of rapid launches once the SEC finalizes its stance. He added that the sector is preparing for a significant influx of ETF products. The groundwork for these filings began in July, when the SEC initially introduced the updated standards. Since then, fund managers have revised documents and responded to regulatory inquiries. According to people familiar with the process, one last round of amendments is expected before the final review. Bitwise president Teddy Fusaro also noted that most applications have progressed deep into the review process and that the SEC’s adjustments have aligned with what firms had been anticipating. XRP ETFs Could Be Among the First Approved ETF analyst Nate Geraci, co-founder of The ETF Institute, stated that final submissions are expected by the end of this week. He confirmed that several spot ETFs linked to XRP are already well advanced in the process, describing the situation as entering its final countdown phase. Chad Steingraber, a developer and XRP advocate, shared this view, predicting that approvals could arrive soon after the last submissions are filed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Pending applications include products from Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, CoinShares, WisdomTree, Canary Capital, and Franklin Templeton. The SEC’s earliest deadline for a decision is October 18, with later rulings extending into mid-November. At present, XRP trades around $2.75. Some analysts argue that the current price already reflects optimism surrounding the ETF discussions, leaving uncertainty about how much of an additional rally might occur once official decisions are made. Potential Price Impact if Approved If spot ETFs tied to XRP are approved, analysts expect the token could benefit from institutional inflows and greater regulatory legitimacy. In a recent assessment, Google’s Gemini chatbot suggested that XRP could rise into the $5 to $7 range, referencing the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum following their ETF approvals. The chatbot highlighted two key drivers: the entry of professional investors seeking managed exposure to XRP, and the credibility boost that would come from SEC recognition of an ETF product. However, the analysis also included a cautionary note. Markets often react with a “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern, in which initial gains are followed by profit-taking and heightened volatility. The long-term outcome for XRP would likely depend on whether ETFs attract sustained inflows rather than short-lived speculation. With the SEC’s decision window approaching, the digital asset industry is closely watching the fate of the pending XRP ETF applications. While approval could support a sharp price increase and expand institutional participation, short-term reactions may vary. For now, XRP investors await clarity on whether October will mark a turning point for the asset. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to the New York Times, the company wants the ruling paused while it appeals, warning that if the changes go into effect on October 22, its entire Android ecosystem will take a serious hit. In their words, the company and platform “will suffer irreparable harm.” This all started with a case filed by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, who accused Alphabet’s Google of blocking competition by locking developers into the Google Play Store and paying companies to keep it that way. A jury agreed with Epic in December 2023, saying Google crossed the line by cutting secret deals with major phone makers and developers to stop them from using other app stores or billing tools. Following that verdict, Judge James Donato in San Francisco ruled that Google needed to open the gates and stop shutting out its rivals. Google says Android will suffer if mandate kicks in In July 2024, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals backed the jury and ruled that Google has to lift restrictions that block app developers from setting up their own marketplaces and payment systems. The court said developers deserve the right to run their businesses without being locked into Google’s ecosystem. Google didn’t take it lightly. The company said the ruling would “significantly harm user safety” and “undermine innovation for Android.” Epic’s CEO, Tim Sweeney, responded by calling the decision a big win and said it would finally allow Epic to offer its Epic Games Store on Android through Google Play. With Google now running to the highest court, it’s trying to freeze everything before that October deadline hits. The filing hasn’t shown up on the Supreme Court’s website, but the company’s message is clear: if the order isn’t blocked, Android users and developers are going to lose out—at least according to Google. But this fight with Epic isn’t the only legal storm the company’s in. Google is also staring down another penalty in Europe, where regulators under the European Commission are preparing to hit the company with its first fine under the Digital Markets Act. The law took effect in 2023 and was built specifically to rein in Big Tech and give competitors a fair shot. It lays out what massive platforms can and cannot do. Break those rules, and companies can be fined up to 10% of global yearly revenue. Google faces second EU penalty as Commission reviews case The upcoming fine is separate from the €2.95 billion (about $3.45 billion) penalty Google already got earlier this month. That fine was for favoring its own display ad technology and giving its ad exchange, AdX, more power at the expense of rival ad services and publishers. But the next charge focuses on Google’s treatment of vertical search engines, specifically how Google Shopping, Google Flights, and Google Hotels were promoted over other travel and shopping platforms. The complaint was first filed in March 2024. Since then, Google has submitted multiple proposals to try and fix things, but airline companies, hotel chains, retail sites, and comparison tools said nothing has really changed. The Commission isn’t commenting, but Google pointed to comments made earlier by its Senior Director for Competition, Oliver Bethell, who said, “While we have invited feedback throughout this process, we now need to bring this debate to an end without the interests of a few being prioritised over the millions of people and businesses in Europe who benefit from Search.” Even with growing pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration over Europe’s crackdown on American tech, the EU Commission has no intention of stepping back. Officials say they’ll keep holding companies accountable, even if it stirs up more trade tension between the U.S. and the 27-nation bloc. If the fine under the DMA moves forward, Google would become the third American tech company punished under the law—following Apple and Meta Platforms, who were both hit with penalties in April.

Despite launching with major hype, Pi (PI) has struggled to live up to expectations, crashing by 91% from its all-time high of $2.98 set back in February. This wallet’s aggressive accumulation suggests it may be operating on privileged information or strong insider conviction. According to Pi Scan, wallet GASWBDODM currently holds 383.3 million PI , worth around $103 million – making it the 7th largest Pi holder overall, ahead of major exchanges like Gate.io and Bitget . Even more intriguing, this whale added 6.3 million PI tokens to their stack in the past week alone, signaling continued confidence despite the wider market’s retreat. The identity of GASWBD[…]ODM remains a mystery, but its positioning has sparked widespread speculation. Could this investor have early access to Pi’s roadmap, insider knowledge of an exchange listing, or an upcoming ecosystem update? Whatever the case, it adds serious weight to the bullish Pi Coin price prediction thesis – especially if other large players start following suit. Pi Coin Price Prediction: 26% Downside Risk If PI Fails to Break Above $0.30 Pi has rebounded slightly after hitting a new all-time low near $0.22 , consolidating around $0.26 in recent sessions. However, continued market weakness could drag the token back toward last week’s lows. On the 4-hour chart , the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is beginning to show signs of recovery, hinting that Pi Coin might attempt a retest of the $0.30 mark. Still, unless the token break out from its current downtrend decisively, the overall setup continues to support a bearish outlook. If bearish momentum accelerates, the $0.20 level becomes a likely target – implying a 26% downside risk from current levels. Rather than holding underperforming tokens this cycle, many traders are turning their focus to high-upside presales showing strong momentum. One standout is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a new project that enables users to build virtual mining rigs and earn crypto. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Turns Crypto Mining Into a Rewarding Game Pepenode ($PEPENODE) lets users build their own virtual meme coin mining rig. You can buy nodes, build server rooms, and earn more crypto by building more rigs. The game leverages the popularity of the Pepe meme and combines it with an innovative virtual mining model that consists of buying and upgrading rigs to climb the leaderboard. Buyers will use $PEPENODE to set up and boost their mining operation while competing for attractive rewards, like airdrops of top meme coins like Pepe ($PEPE) and Bonk ($BONK). Every upgrade performed to a node adds a deflationary twist: 70% of the tokens spent on improving rigs are burned permanently, reducing the circulating supply as the community expands. As the game gains popularity, the demand for $PEPENODE could skyrocket. To buy $PEPENODE at its presale price, visit the official Pepenode website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap crypto or use a bank card to get started.

The recovered funds came from global operations to crack down on cybercrime, which claimed $40.9B in illegal crypto funds last year. The operation, codenamed HAECHI VI, involved law enforcement agencies from 40 countries across multiple continents between April and August 2025, targeting seven major categories of financial cybercrime: investment fraud, romance scams, phishing , money laundering linked to online gambling, sextortion, e-commerce fraud, and business email compromise schemes. Interpol has recovered $97M in crypto Interpol has announced the recovery of $439M in criminal proceeds following a multinational operation targeting cyber financial crimes. Among the seized assets were $97M in cryptocurrencies and physical property. Authorities blocked more than 68,000 bank accounts and froze nearly 400 cryptocurrency wallets as part of the operation. From the seized wallets alone, investigators recovered around $16M in illegal digital assets. In Portugal, the police dismantled a syndicate accused of siphoning funds from social security accounts intended for vulnerable families. Forty-five suspects were arrested, and losses amounting to $270,000 were traced back to 531 victims. In Thailand , the Royal Thai Police officers seized $6.6M in stolen assets linked to a transnational business email compromise scheme that tricked a Japanese corporation into transferring funds to a fraudulent Bangkok-based entity. The network was allegedly run by Thai and West African nationals. Other notable successes involved the recovery of $3.91M in the United Arab Emirates. Investigators retrieved the funds after a Korean steel company identified forged shipping documents and flagged the fraudulent transfer. The stop was made possible through Interpol’s Global Rapid Intervention of Payments (I-GRIP) system. This mechanism enables law enforcement agencies to freeze criminal proceeds in real time. Global efforts against cybercrime Aside from Europe and Asia, African nations have also intensified cybercrime enforcement. Earlier in 2025, authorities across 18 African countries and the United Kingdom conducted Operation Serengeti 2.0, which led to 1,209 arrests and the recovery of $97.4M. Criminal infrastructures, such as 25 illegal crypto mining centers in Angola and a $300M online investment scam in Zambia, were also dismantled. A separate operation, Operation Red Card, conducted between November 2024 and February 2025, resulted in 306 arrests across seven African nations. Nigerian authorities arrested 130 suspects, including foreign nationals, who were allegedly involved in cyber-enabled investment and casino fraud. South Africa and Zambia also reported large-scale arrests connected to SIM box fraud and malware-driven scams, respectively. “While many people believe that funds lost to fraud and scams are often irretrievable, the outcomes of HAECHI operations demonstrate that recovery is indeed possible,” Theos Badege, the Director pro tempore of Interpol’s Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre, said. Lee Jun Hyeong, the head of South Korea’s Interpol National Central Bureau, also noted that the country has played a leading role in international cooperation. “Operation HAECHI has time and again demonstrated the power of unified global action in eradicating cyber-enabled financial crime,” he said. Experts have also pointed out that cryptocurrencies have accelerated the globalization of financial crime. Phil Larratt, the Director of Investigations at Chainalysis, stressed the effectiveness of cross-border partnerships. He cited Operation Destabilise, which is a joint effort by the UK, France, and the U.S. that dismantled a Russian money laundering network and resulted in $25.5M in cryptocurrency getting recovered. “These outcomes are only possible when governments, regulators and private companies share intelligence and act together,” he added.

Brussels regulators said they want to check if SAP has been playing unfair when it comes to helping customers who use its business management software installed on company computers. The probe will look at “whether SAP may have distorted competition in the aftermarket for maintenance and support services related to an on-premises type of software, licensed by SAP, used for the management of companies’ business operations,” the Commission said. SAP pushed back Thursday, saying its way of doing business follows EU rules. “However, we take the issues raised seriously and we are working closely with the EU Commission to resolve them,” a spokesperson said. “We do not anticipate the engagement with the European Commission to result in material impacts on our financial performance.” The company is worth almost 282 billion euros ($331 billion), making it one of Europe’s biggest companies by value. Its shares fell 2% by 12:45 p.m. in London (7:45 a.m. ET) Thursday. The case centers on its Enterprise Resource Planning software, called ERP for short. Big companies use ERP to handle their money and accounting work day to day. The company has a big chunk of this market, but isn’t the only player – Microsoft and Oracle also sell ERP products. The Commission is looking specifically at the “on-prem” version of SAP ERP. This means software that sits on a company’s own servers, not the cloud version that gets accessed through the firm’s remote data centers. SAP still makes a lot of money from on-prem IT services. But the company has been trying for years to get more customers using cloud services instead. This push comes as SAP battles tech heavyweights like Microsoft and Amazon, who run most of the public cloud market. This EU investigation is different because it doesn’t go after Big Tech. Most of the bloc’s competition work has targeted powerful American tech companies. This has upset both tech firms and US politicians, who say American companies get picked on unfairly. Wednesday, Apple asked for the Digital Markets Act – the EU’s big digital competition law – to be scrapped, saying it was “leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU.” SAP is partnering with OpenAI and AWS Based on an earlier report by Cryptopolitan , SAP announced new deals with OpenAI and Amazon Web Services to grow its “digital sovereignty” services for European governments. The company will work with OpenAI to bring AI services like ChatGPT to Germany’s government workers. The project, called “OpenAI for Germany,” will run through the company’s Delos Cloud, which keeps data stored locally under European laws. SAP and Amazon.com Inc. also said the German company will offer its sovereign cloud service through AWS. Several European countries are rushing to build their own “sovereign” AI services because officials and business leaders worry about Europe losing control of this key technology. SAP has said it will spend around €20 billion ($23.5 billion) on its sovereign services. These partnership announcements come as the company faces regulatory heat, showing how software companies must deal with both government oversight and fast-changing technology demands in Europe.

Reminder to Eligible Users Cardano community member Rick McCracken issued a notice on social media earlier today, pointing out that the claim window for NIGHT tokens is closing soon. A screenshot shared with the post showed just over 10 days remaining before the first phase of claims officially ends. The claim portal, launched on August 5, made NIGHT tokens available to 33.6 million eligible addresses spread across eight supported blockchains. These include Cardano, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Basic Attention Token, and BNB Chain. (1/3) 10 days left to claim Cardano $NIGHT tokens! If you hold $BTC , $ETH , $AVAX , $SOL , $BNB , $BAT , $XRP or $ADA on their native chains, you may be eligible. Claim here https://t.co/Vrl26vLyu5 List of supported chains, wallets & HW in next post pic.twitter.com/RLHSU4sski — Rick McCracken DIGI (@RichardMcCrackn) September 24, 2025 According to the distribution plan, 50% of the total supply was reserved for Cardano users, while Bitcoin holders received 20%. The remaining 30% was divided among the other six networks, including XRP Ledger . Although some participants initially reported technical difficulties when the process began, the Midnight team confirmed that most of those issues have since been resolved, ensuring smoother access for claimants. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has provided several updates on claim activity since the portal went live. On August 19, he revealed that more than 69,000 addresses across the supported blockchains had successfully claimed around 1.32 billion NIGHT tokens, equal to 5.5% of the 24 billion total supply. At that time, Cardano users represented the largest share of claims at 61.3%, while Bitcoin and XRP holders accounted for 19.43% and 5.72%, respectively. By August 23, Hoskinson confirmed that over 70,000 participants had claimed more than 1.6 billion NIGHT tokens in total. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Next Phases of the Airdrop The initial phase of the distribution, known as the Glacier Drop , will close on October 4 at 12:00 p.m. UTC. Once this stage concludes, Midnight will move directly into its second phase, titled the Scavenger Mine. During this stage, which will run for 30 days, users will be able to earn shares of unclaimed NIGHT tokens by completing specific computational tasks. Afterward, a third stage called the Lost and Found phase will allow users who missed earlier deadlines another opportunity to claim tokens. Any remaining supply after these rounds will be directed to the project’s treasury. Importantly, tokens that are successfully claimed will not be distributed in one lump sum. Instead, beneficiaries will receive their allocation in four equal installments of 25%, spread across one year. With only 10 days left before the Glacier Drop ends, eligible XRP, Cardano, and other blockchain users are encouraged to complete their claims promptly. Missing this window will mean waiting for later phases, where the conditions and rewards may differ from the current allocation system.

Despite its struggle to decisively break above the $3 mark, XRP is now forming a Falling Wedge pattern that signals the potential for a powerful breakout by October. Falling Wedge Signals XRP Breakout By October In a recent XRP price analysis, published on Monday, Dark Defender noted that the third-largest cryptocurrency has once again respected its key support levels at $2.85, despite being rejected at $3.13. The XRP price tapped into the primary support trendline, highlighted in orange on the chart, which has consistently held as a structural base. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Definitely Reach $10,000, Gives Reasons Why Importantly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is edging closer to oversold territory, a signal often associated with potential price reversals. While skepticism spreads across the market, Dark Defender insists that the XRP bullish structure remains intact and that disbelief itself is a sign that many could be caught off guard by what’s to come. The analyst notes that the cryptocurrency has been consolidating within a Falling Wedge pattern between July and September. According to him, October could be the month when XRP finally breaks free from the wedge and delivers a rally strong enough to surprise the broader market. Building on this momentum, Dark Defender has forecasted three potential price targets for XRP by October: $4.17, $4.92, and $5.85. These levels correspond to upper Fibonacci Extension zones, specifically 261.8%, 361.8%, and 236.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, XRP has its closest supports set at $2.80 and $2.64, ensuring a strong base for the projected Falling Wedge breakout. XRP Bullish Run Just Starting Following his earlier predictions, Dark Defender further reinforced his bullish case by asserting that XRP has not begun its true rally. He suggested a power shift is underway, hinting that what the market has seen so far is only the beginning of a larger bullish wave. Related Reading: Analyst Unveils 3-Month Prediction For Bitcoin, XRP, And Dogecoin – It’s Very Bullish This perspective arrives at a time when XRP has already delivered a remarkable performance in 2025. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the cryptocurrency has gained 384% Year-to-Date, a surge fueled by increasing demand, rumors of a potential XRP ETF, and renewed confidence after the conclusion of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. With XRP reaching a high of $3.65 earlier this year and trading just over 5% shy of reclaiming its former all-time high of $3.84, Dark Defender remains certain that the asset’s real growth is still ahead. Based on this view, the recent pullback below $3 is not seen as a weakness, but rather as a consolidation phase before the next leg higher. He highlighted that XRP is nearing the end of this corrective ABCDE consolidation phase and preparing for a lift-off. According to his chart analysis, once the cryptocurrency reclaims the $3.33 level, it could pave the way for double-digit prices.

52266715,589282,1758844823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52266715.jpeg,"Liquid Staking Debuts On XRP Ledger, What mXRP Means For Investors",https://bitcoinist.com/liquid-staking-debuts-on-mxrp/,"Midas, in partnership with Axelar, has launched the first XRP liquid staking token, mXRP. The token will provide investors with yields from the XRP DeFi ecosystem and further expand the altcoin’s utility. XRP Liquid Staking Token Launches Midas revealed that the mXRP liquid staking token will be issued on the XRP Ledger EVM via the Axelar bridge, which also facilitates the transfer of the token to the Ledger. The tokenization platform noted that this is a first-of-its-kind tokenized exposure product, offering meaningful XRP-denominated yield strategies. The token is expected to provide an APY of up to 8% for holders, although Axelar indicated it could reach 10%. In an X post , Panek Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, which offers the token on the Ledger, broke down key details about the liquid staking token. He explained that token is a yield-bearing version of XRP that generates yields for its holders. As such, the price of mXRP should continuously grow against the XRP price and trade at a premium. Panek further stated that the yield comes from various strategies, including lending, market making, and depositing on DeFi protocols , among others. He noted that asset managers first lock XRP and then borrow against it in stablecoins, using the capital for various strategies to generate profits. The Anodos Finance co-founder also clarified that investors simply need to hold the staking token to claim their yields or redeem their XRP. He added that holders of the liquid staking token do not receive extra tokens. Instead, the yield and rewards are automatically added and embedded into mXRP’s value. Panek noted that token works similarly to other liquid staking tokens , such as stETH, jitoSOL, and sAVAX, meaning that those looking to get yields from it have to buy the asset and hold it. They can do this by selling XRP or adding new capital to buy the token. What mXRP Means For XRP Panek indicated that the launch of mXRP is beneficial for XRP, as it will add constant buying pressure to the altcoin. He noted that Midas and Axelar said that the goal is to become a perpetual buyer of XRP. Meanwhile, every XRP used to mint mXRP is locked, thereby removing it from circulation. Flare Network also recently announced the launch of ‘FXRP’ to expand XRP’s DeFi. Panek noted that mXRP and FXRP are slightly different, but ultimately, both are beneficial for XRP and the XRP Ledger. mXRP’s capital is managed by asset managers who generate yield on behalf of investors. At the same time, FXRP is a trustless version of XRP on the Flare network, which doesn’t inherently generate yield but can be used in DeFi protocols to generate yields. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $2.84, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Anodos Finance|Axelar Bridge|Coinmarketcap|DeFi|Flare Network|FXRP|jitoSOL|Panek Mekras|ripple|sAVAX|stETH|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BUSINESS|FLR,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 00:00:23

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has taken a significant dive, plummeting 16 points from yesterday to a concerning reading of 28. This sharp drop firmly places market sentiment in the ""Fear"" stage, according to data from Alternative. For many investors, this number can be a stark indicator of prevailing uncertainty and anxiety. But what exactly does this index tell us, and how should we interpret such a low reading? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Drives It? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it’s a powerful barometer of market psychology. It gauges investor sentiment on a scale from 0 (representing extreme fear) to 100 (signifying extreme optimism). Understanding its components helps us grasp the bigger picture: Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin volatility and maximum drawdowns, comparing them to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current market volume and momentum, comparing it with average values. Low volume in a downtrend can indicate fear. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and mentions, assessing their sentiment and engagement. Increased negative sentiment can contribute to fear. Surveys (15%): Gathers weekly sentiment surveys from thousands of crypto investors (currently paused, but historically a component). Bitcoin’s Market Capitalization Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance of Bitcoin often signals fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in ""Bitcoin price manipulation"" or ""crypto crash"" searches indicates fear. When the index registers a low number like 28, it clearly reflects widespread investor apprehension. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a significant shift indicating that many market participants are feeling uncertain about the future direction of cryptocurrency prices. Why Does a Low Crypto Fear & Greed Index Matter for Your Portfolio? A reading of 28 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just an abstract metric; it has real implications for your investment decisions. When fear grips the market, several common behaviors emerge: Panic Selling: Investors, driven by fear, might sell off their holdings to avoid further losses, exacerbating price declines. Reduced Buying Pressure: New money often stays on the sidelines, waiting for clearer signals, leading to lower trading volumes and slower recovery. Increased Volatility: Emotional trading can lead to sharper price swings, making the market even more unpredictable. However, it’s crucial to remember that fear in the market can also present unique opportunities. Historically, periods of extreme fear have often preceded market recoveries. Savvy investors sometimes view these times as chances to accumulate assets at lower prices, following the old adage: ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" Navigating Market Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index deep in the ""Fear"" zone, what should you do? Reacting emotionally is often detrimental. Instead, consider these strategies: Revisit Your Investment Thesis: Remind yourself why you invested in certain assets. Has the fundamental value changed, or is it just market sentiment? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the bottom, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can help mitigate risk during volatile periods. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Focusing on the long-term potential rather than daily fluctuations can help you weather downturns. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Keep an eye on reliable news and data, but avoid constant monitoring that can lead to emotional decisions. The current reading of 28 should serve as a prompt for caution and strategic thinking, not panic. It’s a moment to assess, plan, and potentially act with a clear head. What’s Next for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and the Market? While the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals significant apprehension, market sentiment is dynamic. It can shift rapidly based on news, regulatory developments, or major price movements. A sustained period of low fear could indicate a capitulation phase, where most weak hands have exited, potentially paving the way for a recovery. Conversely, continued negative news or price drops could push the index even lower, into ""Extreme Fear."" Monitoring this index, alongside other fundamental and technical indicators, can provide a more holistic view of the market’s health and potential direction. It serves as a reminder that emotional biases often play a huge role in financial markets, and understanding them is key to making rational decisions. Summary: Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The recent drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 28 is a clear signal of heightened fear in the cryptocurrency market. This index, powered by factors like volatility, trading volume, and social media sentiment, provides a crucial snapshot of investor psychology. While fear can lead to panic selling and increased volatility, it also historically presents opportunities for long-term investors. By adopting a disciplined approach, focusing on risk management, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can navigate these challenging times effectively. Remember, understanding market sentiment is a powerful tool, but it should always be combined with sound research and a well-defined investment strategy.

The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods of rapid growth for various assets. Recently, a significant shift has caught the attention of many investors: the Altcoin Season Index , a crucial barometer for market sentiment, has taken a notable dip. Falling three points from yesterday, the index now stands at 69. This movement isn’t just a number; it signals a potential change in the prevailing market winds, moving away from a strong altcoin dominance. What is the Altcoin Season Index and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the crypto world, understanding the Altcoin Season Index is fundamental. CoinMarketCap developed this index to provide a clear snapshot of market performance. It helps investors determine whether the current period favors altcoins or Bitcoin. How does it work? It meticulously compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Crucially, stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of speculative asset performance. The comparison is made against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when 75% of these top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin during that specific timeframe. A score closer to 100 indicates a much stronger and more pervasive altcoin trend. Conversely, a lower score, especially one like 69, suggests that Bitcoin might be regaining its footing or that altcoins are broadly underperforming relative to the crypto king. Understanding the Current Dip in the Altcoin Season Index The recent three-point drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 69 is a significant event. While 69 is still above the 75 threshold for a full “altcoin season,” the downward trend is what truly matters. This movement implies that fewer altcoins, among the top 100, are currently outperforming Bitcoin compared to previous days. What could be driving this? Market Rotation: Often, after periods of strong altcoin gains, investors rotate profits back into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer haven, or even into stablecoins. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin itself might be experiencing a resurgence, attracting capital away from altcoins. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainties can lead investors to favor less volatile assets within crypto, often meaning Bitcoin. It’s vital to remember that the crypto market is highly interconnected. A shift in the Altcoin Season Index can reflect a complex interplay of various factors, from specific project news to global economic sentiment. How Does This Affect Your Crypto Portfolio and Strategy? A falling Altcoin Season Index prompts investors to re-evaluate their strategies. If you’ve been heavily invested in altcoins, this might be a signal to: Review Your Holdings: Assess the performance of your individual altcoin assets. Are they still strong performers, or are they lagging behind Bitcoin? Consider Rebalancing: You might consider rebalancing your portfolio to increase your Bitcoin exposure, especially if you anticipate further Bitcoin dominance. Research New Opportunities: While some altcoins might be struggling, others could still present unique opportunities. Always do your due diligence. Conversely, for those with a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio, a lower Altcoin Season Index could be seen as validation of a more conservative approach. However, even during “Bitcoin season,” specific altcoins can still deliver impressive gains due to unique developments or strong community support. The key is never to rely solely on one metric but to use it as part of a broader analytical framework. Navigating the Shifting Tides: Actionable Insights from the Altcoin Season Index Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is just the first step. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these shifting market tides: Stay Informed: Regularly check the index and other market indicators. Follow reputable crypto news sources and analysts. Diversify Wisely: Even if the index suggests a Bitcoin season, a well-diversified portfolio that includes a mix of strong altcoins and Bitcoin can mitigate risks. Long-Term Vision: Short-term fluctuations are common. A long-term investment strategy, based on fundamental analysis of projects, often yields better results than reacting to every index movement. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits when appropriate. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin is a continuous narrative. While the Altcoin Season Index provides a valuable snapshot, it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Smart investors use such tools to inform, not dictate, their decisions, always prioritizing research and a balanced approach. In conclusion, the recent three-point drop in CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index to 69 serves as a timely reminder of the market’s ebb and flow. It signals a potential recalibration where Bitcoin might be asserting more dominance over a broader range of altcoins. For investors, this isn’t a call for panic, but rather an invitation to reassess strategies, rebalance portfolios if necessary, and remain vigilant. By understanding the underlying dynamics and utilizing tools like this index, you can better position yourself to thrive in the ever-changing cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions About the Altcoin Season Index Q1: What does it mean when the Altcoin Season Index falls? A1: A falling Altcoin Season Index indicates that fewer altcoins, among the top 100 by market capitalization, are outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It suggests a potential shift towards Bitcoin dominance or a general underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. Q2: Is an Altcoin Season Index score of 69 considered good or bad? A2: An index score of 69 is still below the 75% threshold needed to officially declare an an “altcoin season.” While it’s not extremely low, the recent drop from a higher point suggests a weakening trend for altcoins relative to Bitcoin. It’s a signal to reassess market conditions. Q3: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A3: The Altcoin Season Index is typically updated daily by CoinMarketCap, providing a continuous snapshot of market performance trends between altcoins and Bitcoin. Q4: Should I sell all my altcoins if the Altcoin Season Index is falling? A4: Not necessarily. A falling Altcoin Season Index is one indicator among many. It’s crucial to perform your own research (DYOR) on individual altcoin projects, consider your long-term investment goals, and assess your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. It might be a time to rebalance your portfolio, not to panic sell. Q5: What’s the difference between an “altcoin season” and a “Bitcoin season”? A5: An “altcoin season” occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A “Bitcoin season” is the inverse, where Bitcoin significantly outperforms most altcoins during the same timeframe. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Slowing momentum has deflated expectations, and XRP’s destiny is still robust but kept in check compared to previous estimates. Meanwhile, new Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum in a big way. Mutuum Finance is priced at $0.035 presale level 6 which is already 45% sold out. The protocol has already raised over $16.25 million from over 16,570 holders. With lending-and-borrowing exclusively designed for utility-driven adoption, MUTM has been highlighted by analysts as one of the probable high-growth altcoins. There are even predictions of a price explosion of 4,500%, putting it on the list of the most viral emerging coins by 2025. XRP Price Prediction: Projections Reduced as Resistance Continues XRP is trading at $2.87 currently. Analysts have toned down previous bull predictions, with predictors who had put XRP at $10 now anticipating a lower cap at about $5 as a result of repeated resistance at $3, declining volumes, and macroeconomic headwinds. Absent until demand buyers stage a robust comeback or new catalysts emerge, XRP may range from $2.80–$3.50 in the near-medium term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outranks XRP by comparison. Stellar Presale Performance Mutuum Finance has kicked off Presale Stage Six, with the tokens selling at $0.035 after a 16.17% price appreciation from the previous round. Investors are famished, with over 16,570 buyers and more than $16.25 million of capital raised. In its bid to provide the platform with added security, Mutuum Finance is introducing a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. Bugs are differentiated into four categories, that is, critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure their greatest discovery and fixing. The protocol depends on stringent management of collateralized funds to safeguard the system and participants. Controls are imposed through certain collateral ratios, lending caps, and deposit caps. Undercollateralized positions get shut down very rapidly, and call penalties and remediation fees are levied to ensure systemic stability. Creating an Efficient Platform Efficiency is achieved by maximising Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, especially for overcollateralised credit. Reserve requirements also serve as a shock absorber for the market, and excess reserves are available for undertaking risk-absorbing activities with risky assets. Mutuum Finance’s overall goal is to reorganize the DeFi structure on the pillars of long-term viability, reliability, and inclusiveness. The project provides not only a secure borrowing and lending facility but also represents a new era of decentralized finance being made more available to retail and institutional investors. To encourage early adoption as well as community, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway contest in which 10 participants will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. This initiative focuses on the project’s commitment to inspiring its backers while ensuring awareness and contribution across the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance utilizes a dynamic, liquidity-based interest rate framework. It maintains lending and borrowing in harmony with fluctuations in market conditions at all times. Where there is excess money in the platform, borrowing rates are kept deliberately low to encourage greater utilization of available funds as well as fuel market activity. Where liquidity is nonetheless tight, borrowing rates rise and that encourages existing borrowers to repay outstanding loans as well as draw in new deposits. This positive feedback mechanism builds a better, stronger climate which protects user interests, slows down liquidity flows, and lowers the overall protocol exposure during both times of market stability and stress. Why Investors are Abandoning XRP for MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly becoming the investor’s go-to as forecasts about Ripple lose their appeal. In spite of the capped future value of XRP reaching $5 today, Mutuum Finance presale tokens are priced at $0.035 in Stage 6, already sold 45%, and more than $16.25M raised.

Today marks a significant Bitcoin options expiration event, alongside a substantial expiry for Ethereum options. These events, involving billions of dollars, often create ripples across the market, making it essential for traders and enthusiasts to pay close attention. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Options Expiration? To fully grasp the implications of today’s Bitcoin options expiration , it’s helpful to understand what options contracts are. Simply put, an option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. This date is known as the expiration. Call options: Grant the right to buy. Traders typically buy calls if they expect the price to rise. Put options: Grant the right to sell. Traders often buy puts if they anticipate a price drop. When these contracts expire, they can influence market sentiment and even price action, especially when large volumes are involved. The underlying assets, in this case, are Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Scale of Today’s Bitcoin Options Expiration: A Deep Dive Today’s expiry is particularly notable due to its sheer scale. According to crypto options exchange Deribit, a staggering $16 billion worth of Bitcoin options expiration is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 26th. This massive notional value represents a significant portion of the derivatives market. Additionally, Ethereum options totaling $5 billion will expire concurrently. Such large expiries can sometimes lead to increased volatility as traders adjust their positions. For Bitcoin, the put/call ratio stands at 0.71. This ratio indicates the number of put options relative to call options. A ratio below 1 suggests a slightly bullish sentiment, as more call options are open compared to put options. Ethereum’s put/call ratio is 0.86, also leaning slightly bullish. These ratios offer a snapshot of market participants’ collective expectations regarding future price movements. Understanding ‘Max Pain’ and Its Market Influence A key metric associated with options expiration is the ‘max pain price.’ For the expiring Bitcoin options expiration , the max pain price is currently $111,000. For Ethereum, it’s $3,800. What does ‘max pain’ mean? It’s the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. Essentially, it’s the price point where the majority of options traders would experience the most pain. While not a definitive prediction, the market sometimes gravitates towards this price point as expiration approaches. This phenomenon is often attributed to the actions of options writers (those who sell options) who might hedge their positions, potentially influencing the underlying asset’s price. However, it’s crucial to remember that max pain is just one indicator among many and should not be the sole basis for trading decisions. What Does This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for Traders? With such a substantial Bitcoin options expiration looming, what should traders consider? Historically, large options expiries can usher in periods of heightened volatility, though outcomes are never guaranteed. Here are some actionable insights: Increased Volatility: Be prepared for potential price swings around the expiration time as market participants close or roll over their positions. Sentiment Shift: Observe how the market reacts post-expiration. A significant move away from the max pain price could indicate a strong directional bias. Risk Management: Ensure your trading strategies account for potential increased risk. Consider using stop-losses or reducing position sizes if you are sensitive to volatility. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and analysis from reputable sources. While the expiry itself doesn’t guarantee a specific price movement, it does create an environment where significant capital is in play, potentially leading to dynamic market behavior. In conclusion, today’s colossal Bitcoin options expiration , coupled with a notable Ethereum options expiry, marks a critical moment for the crypto markets. While the max pain prices offer a fascinating insight into potential market gravitating points, the true impact will unfold as the expiration time arrives. Traders should remain vigilant, practice sound risk management, and stay informed to navigate any potential shifts. The crypto market’s inherent dynamism means every major event, like this one, presents both challenges and opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin options expiration? A1: It’s the specific date and time when Bitcoin options contracts become void. At expiration, option holders decide whether to exercise their right to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at the agreed-upon strike price, or let the option expire worthless. Q2: What is the significance of the put/call ratio? A2: The put/call ratio indicates market sentiment. A ratio below 1 (like Bitcoin’s 0.71) suggests more call options are open than put options, often interpreted as a slightly bullish sentiment. Conversely, a ratio above 1 could suggest bearish sentiment. Q3: How does ‘max pain’ affect Bitcoin’s price? A3: The ‘max pain’ price is the strike price where the most options contracts expire worthless, causing maximum loss for option holders. While not a direct price predictor, some believe the underlying asset’s price can gravitate towards this point as expiration nears, potentially due to hedging activities by options writers. Q4: Will today’s $16B Bitcoin options expiration cause a price crash? A4: A large options expiration doesn’t automatically lead to a price crash or surge. It can, however, contribute to increased volatility and potential price adjustments as large positions are settled or rolled over. Market dynamics are complex, and many factors influence price. Q5: Where can I find data on options expirations? A5: Reputable crypto options exchanges like Deribit, CME, and others provide data on open interest, put/call ratios, and max pain prices for their listed options contracts. Financial news outlets also often report on these significant events. Did you find this analysis of the Bitcoin options expiration insightful?

The move comes after mass demonstrations this month that called out suspected corruption in public works and flood control projects. Integrity Chain Piloted For Infrastructure Contracts According to reports, a platform called Integrity Chain — developed with BayaniChain Ventures — is being used to log public-works contracts and progress updates. The system anchors cryptographic hashes on the Polygon network so files can be proven unchanged later. Local civic groups and some universities have been named as independent validators who can attest to entries, and their attestations are also recorded. Budget Documents Notarized On-Chain Reports have disclosed that the Philippines Department of Budget and Management has already been using blockchain notarization for budget paperwork. Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) can be hashed and uploaded so anyone can check whether a document was altered after publication. Officials describe this as a way to make parts of the budget trackable in public view while keeping sensitive details protected. Why The Shift Happened Now Public anger spiked in September after large protests over alleged corruption tied to infrastructure projects. Demonstrations reached tens, and some estimates said crowds swelled to over 100,000 in the capital on September 21, 2025. Based on reports, lawmakers and city officials pointed to those street protests as a key reason to speed up transparency measures. City Launches Local Pilot At the city level, Baguio has rolled out a local system branded GoodGovChain to log municipal financial statements, procurement records, and infrastructure reports. The launch, according to city leaders, is aimed at making official documents available and nearly impossible to tamper with after publication. Philippines Lawmakers Propose A National System Meanwhile, a Senate filing — Senate Bill No. 1330 — was lodged to create a National Budget Blockchain System, according to press releases. The proposal would let Philippines citizens trace national spending more easily. Lawmakers backing the measure argue that blockchain logs could give the public a clearer view of where funds move, though opponents warn about cost and complexity.

Dogecoin Whale Has Made A Massive Move During The Past Day According to data from cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a large move has been spotted on the Dogecoin blockchain over the past day. The transfer in question involved the movement of nearly 122.4 million DOGE, worth around $28.5 million at the time the network processed it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Sell 147,000 BTC Since August, Fastest Selloff Of Cycle Considering the scale of the transaction, it’s likely that a whale entity was behind it. Whales refer to the big-money investors of the cryptocurrency, who can carry some degree of influence in the market thanks to their large holdings. Moves related to such holders can be worth keeping an eye on, due to their standing. The transfers may not directly impact the memecoin’s price, but they can still contain information about the sentiment among these giants. A lot of these moves are anonymous, however, meaning it can be hard to infer anything from them. Luckily, the latest Dogecoin whale transaction involved a wallet that has already been identified. Below are the address details related to the transfer. As is visible, the sending address in the case of this Dogecoin whale transaction was a wallet attached to cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The receiver, on the other hand, was an unknown wallet, suggesting that it was likely to be an investor’s self-custodial address. Moves of this type, where coins flow from centralized exchanges to self-custody, are known as Exchange Outflows. Generally, holders move coins away from the custody of these platforms when they plan to hold them in the long term, so Exchange Outflows can have a bullish impact on the asset’s price. The latest Binance Exchange Outflow from the whale has interestingly come following a drop of almost 18% for the memecoin over the past week. As such, it’s possible that the withdrawal corresponds to the large investor using the lower prices to accumulate DOGE.

As displayed in the above chart, the total supply of the Dogecoin investors carrying between 100 million and 1 billion tokens has gone up by 2 billion DOGE (about $465 million) within this window. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.23, down more than 4.5% over the last 24 hours.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang sat down with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen during the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday. The talks came as the world’s second and third largest economies try to smooth over their own trade disputes while dealing with new tariffs from Washington. Von der Leyen posted about the meeting on her social media account, saying she talked with China’s second-highest leader about trade issues. She said she was glad to see China ready to work with Europe “in a spirit of mutual understanding.” I had a good and frank exchange with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. The main focus of our meeting was to follow up on the productive EU–China Summit in July. We both agreed on the importance of moving from words to action as soon as possible. The best way forward is to build on… pic.twitter.com/eW4eQo0xPD — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) September 24, 2025 The EU chief mentioned that Europe has well-known worries about export controls, getting access to markets, and having too much production capacity. These have been significant issues between the two sides for months. China and the EU have been close to starting a trade war for two years now. Most experts say this started when European officials decided in 2023 to look into whether China was giving unfair favors to its electric car companies. This led to China checking EU brandy, dairy products, pork, and other goods in return. Trade relations between China and Brussels are improving Now that Trump’s trade moves are hurting EU and Chinese exports, Brussels and Beijing have good reasons to improve their relations. According to a statement from China’s foreign ministry on Thursday, Li said he hoped China and the EU could remember why they started working together. He also said he wanted the EU to keep its promise to maintain open trade and investment markets. The Chinese statement added that “as two important poles in the world, China and the EU should demonstrate responsibility and maintain strategic independence.” Chinese trade workers have found it hard to deal with Washington and Brussels simultaneously. Foreign business groups have complained about long waits, while government workers work long hours on complex issues like permits to export rare earth materials. The European Commission, which makes trade rules for all 27 EU countries, has also had trouble getting everyone to agree. Last October, when it came to tariffs on Chinese electric cars, 10 countries supported them, 12 stayed neutral, and five said no. Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, was one of those that opposed the tariffs. China has also become more important to Europe’s thinking about the war in Ukraine, say diplomats. Many see Chinese President Xi Jinping’s influence over Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s role as Russia’s economic support as a better way to reach peace than Trump’s hard-to-predict foreign policy. Von der Leyen said she asked China to use its power to stop the killing and push Russia to talk about peace. The Chinese foreign ministry’s statement did not mention the Ukraine conflict. “Time for diplomacy is now. It would send a strong signal to the world,” Von der Leyen said. China links purchases of American soybeans to tariff removal A Chinese commerce ministry spokesman said Thursday that America should get rid of what China calls unreasonable tariffs and create better conditions for more trade between the two countries. China buys more soybeans than any other country, but according to a recent Cryptopolitan report, China has not ordered any soybeans from the US recently. Instead, it has been buying from South America. American farmers could lose billions of dollars in soybean sales because of ongoing trade problems that have stopped exports to China. Senior Chinese trade official Li Chenggang met with business and political leaders from the American Midwest on Monday. This area grows most of America’s soybeans. The meeting suggested that China buy some American soybeans before bigger trade talks happen.

This move is more than just a financial transaction; it signals a powerful shift in corporate strategy and highlights the growing confidence in digital assets as a primary form of capital. For those watching the convergence of AI and blockchain, this strategic decision by Silex is certainly one to keep an eye on. Why is Silex Making a BTC Investment in DatavaultAI? Silex’s decision to invest $150 million in DatavaultAI is notable for several reasons. Firstly, the sheer scale of the investment demonstrates a strong commitment to the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. DatavaultAI, as an AI data firm, likely offers innovative solutions that Silex believes will drive future growth and competitive advantage. However, the most striking aspect is the payment method. Instead of traditional U.S. dollars, Silex will execute this substantial BTC investment . This choice underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage cryptocurrencies not just as speculative assets, but as functional currency for large-scale transactions. It also positions Silex as a pioneer in integrating digital assets directly into its corporate finance strategy. This strategic move could offer several benefits: Reduced Transaction Costs: Cryptocurrencies can often facilitate cross-border transactions with lower fees compared to traditional banking systems. Faster Settlement: Bitcoin transactions can settle much quicker than conventional wire transfers, especially internationally. Alignment with Innovation: Using Bitcoin for such a significant investment aligns Silex with the innovative spirit of both AI and blockchain technologies. Potential for Appreciation: While carrying risks, a Bitcoin holding could potentially appreciate in value over time, adding another layer of strategic benefit. Exploring New Frontiers: RWA Tokenization and the Future of Finance Beyond the immediate BTC investment in DatavaultAI, Silex has also unveiled plans to delve into the market for blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This initiative represents another bold step into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. RWA tokenization involves converting tangible assets—like real estate, art, or commodities—into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process offers enhanced liquidity, fractional ownership, and transparency, making previously illiquid assets more accessible to a broader range of investors. Silex’s interest in this area suggests a vision for a future where digital assets play a central role in representing and transferring value across various sectors. This exploration could lead to: New revenue streams for Silex. Increased adoption of blockchain technology in traditional finance. Greater efficiency and accessibility for asset management. The convergence of AI, blockchain, and real-world assets is creating exciting opportunities, and Silex appears keen to be at the forefront of this transformation. What Does This BTC Investment Mean for the Crypto Market? Silex’s significant BTC investment sends a strong signal to the broader cryptocurrency market. When a Nasdaq-listed company chooses Bitcoin for a major corporate investment, it lends considerable credibility to the digital asset space. This action can: Boost Institutional Confidence: It encourages other corporations to consider Bitcoin for treasury management and strategic investments. Validate Bitcoin’s Utility: It reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a viable medium of exchange for substantial transactions, not just a store of value. Drive Further Adoption: Such high-profile moves can inspire more mainstream businesses and individuals to engage with cryptocurrencies. This development is a testament to the increasing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin within the global financial landscape. It highlights a growing understanding that digital assets are not just for early adopters but are becoming integral to modern corporate strategy. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While Silex’s move is undeniably innovative, navigating the crypto and RWA tokenization landscape comes with its own set of challenges. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and technological complexities are all factors that companies like Silex must carefully manage. However, the potential rewards—disrupting traditional markets, fostering innovation, and tapping into new growth vectors—are substantial. Silex’s strategic BTC investment into DatavaultAI and its foray into RWA tokenization positions the company at the intersection of several high-growth industries. This bold strategy could redefine its future, setting a precedent for how traditional companies engage with the digital economy. It’s a clear indicator that the lines between conventional finance and the crypto world are blurring rapidly. Concluding Thoughts on Silex’s Bold Move Silex Holding Company’s $150 million BTC investment into DatavaultAI, coupled with its ambitions in RWA tokenization, marks a pivotal moment. It’s a powerful demonstration of how leading companies are embracing blockchain and artificial intelligence to drive innovation and secure a competitive edge. This development not only strengthens the position of Bitcoin as a corporate asset but also paves the way for a more integrated and digitally-driven financial future. We are witnessing the evolution of corporate finance, where digital assets are no longer an alternative but a strategic imperative. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Asia’s hunger for US tech stocks is rising, with retail investors from Taiwan and South Korea flooding into new ETFs. Leading the way is JPMorgan Asset Management. Earlier this month, JPMorgan introduced a new Taiwan-listed active ETF. The product allows local investors to gain exposure to technology giants in the United States, including Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Subscription will begin on September 30 and run until October 3. The bank considers this a critical move to increase its ETF business in Asia. Philippe El-Asmar, head of APAC ETF, digital & direct at JPMorgan Asset Management, said the firm views active ETFs as a key growth driver in the region. Mirae Asset Global Investments in South Korea is also making a big push. This month, its Tiger ETF arm introduced a fund that invests in US software companies linked to artificial intelligence. Mirae’s executives say the move is a direct reaction to the boom in retail trading. Nathan Namki Kim, head of ETF management at Mirae Asset, said the rise in retail investing has created a strong demand for new product development. These launches have brought the total to 19 US tech-focused ETFs in Asia just this year. That paces the region to surpass the 22 debuts of last year. In all, 63 of these ETFs are now listed in Asia. Retail money fuels momentum and risk Retail investors across Asia are proving to be strong fans of US tech equities , especially the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps. These companies, which include Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple, have driven the Nasdaq 100 up more than 115 percent since late 2022. However, the flows are volatile as US tech ETFs in Asia have seen more than $500 million of net outflows over the last three months. Analysts caution that the rally may be overheating and that too much money is piled into just a few stocks. Yet the broader trend remains intact: over the last three years, Asian investors poured more than $4.3 billion into US tech ETFs, betting that Federal Reserve rate cuts and AI-driven optimism will extend the rally. The Nasdaq 100 gained more than 4.5% in September through its close on the 24th, making it the best month since June. Rebecca Sin, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said US tech remains a strong growth area in Asia with many opportunities for issuers, adding that recent outflows may reflect profit-taking after months of solid gains. Asia’s ETF explosion broadens beyond tech The rush into tech ETFs is part of a broader wave crashing across Asia’s ETF marke t. In just the first eight months of 2025, 461 new ETFs have started trading. It is that pace that could exceed the 508 recorded last year. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts that total ETF assets in Asia will soar to $8 trillion by 2035, from just under $2 trillion today. China is poised to lead the charge, but markets in Taiwan and South Korea are also growing rapidly. The US ETF market is already valued at about $12.5 trillion. Retail-heavy Asian markets like JPMorgan are a huge new opportunity for large asset managers worldwide. Day traders in South Korea, Taiwan, and elsewhere in the region are increasingly looking for higher returns overseas, notably in US technology. The momentum is not without danger as heavy concentration in a handful of megacap US companies leaves investors exposed if sentiment shifts. A rising tide of competition among ETF sponsors also means that any product must stand out in a crowd. Still, the aggressive entry by JPMorgan puts it at the head of the pack.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have contacted some of the more than 200 firms that announced crypto treasury strategies this year, sources told the Journal. Officials warned companies about possible breaches of rules against selectively sharing material non-public information. The scrutiny comes amid a wave of companies adopting crypto treasury strategies. Inspired by the success of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, dozens of firms outside the crypto sector have announced plans to raise capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases. According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. regulators have flagged unusual trading activity ahead of crypto-treasury announcements by some companies. The SEC and Finra suspect potential violations of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) and have issued inquiry letters, which… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 25, 2025 Crypto Treasury Craze Fuels $20 Billion Fundraising Wave The trend accelerated in early 2025 after a Trump administration executive order established a national strategic Bitcoin reserve . Since then, more than 60 companies, from software and gaming to biotech and energy, have unveiled plans to put portions of their balance sheets into crypto. Together, they have targeted over $20b in fundraising through stock offerings, convertible debt and private placements. The aim has been to hedge against inflation, attract younger investors and mirror the outsized gains seen by early movers. However, stock prices often soared in the days before announcements, sometimes doubling or tripling. These unexplained moves have raised questions about whether insiders leaked details or tipped investors, prompting regulators to act. Corporate Crypto Buys Spur Stock Surges, Draw SEC And FINRA Attention Trump Media and Technology Group is among the most high-profile cases. Ahead of its May 27 disclosure that it planned to raise $2.5b for a Bitcoin treasury , its shares posted a week of unusual volatility. The announcement pushed the firm into the ranks of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders, alongside Strategy and Marathon Digital Holdings, but regulators quickly flagged suspicious trading. GameStop followed a similar path. The retailer revealed a $500m Bitcoin buy on May 28, but its shares had already surged 40% in the three trading sessions before the news. SEC officials are examining clustered buy orders tied to company vendors, while FINRA is reviewing broker communications. Biotech firm MEI Pharma also drew attention in July when it announced plans to allocate a quarter of its cash reserves to Litecoin. Its stock nearly doubled in four days leading up to the filing, with unusually heavy call option activity. Investigators are reviewing whether investor briefings breached disclosure rules. Debt-Funded Buybacks Signal Strain On Firms Chasing Crypto Gains SharpLink Gaming, a small-cap marketing firm specializing in sports betting and iGaming affiliates, made a major shift into an Ethereum treasury strategy in mid-2025. On May 28, its shares spiked roughly 433% during intraday trading , market data showed. The craze for crypto treasuries that swept through small and mid-cap firms is already showing cracks. Several companies that only months ago trumpeted crypto holdings are now launching share buybacks , often using debt, to counter sliding stock prices. In some cases, market values have fallen below the worth of the Bitcoin on their balance sheets. That gap signals rising investor doubt about whether crypto treasury strategies can deliver long-term value.

The leasing units of at least two state-owned banks are in very advanced talks with Beijing’s financial regulator about converting long-term vessel leases into mortgage loans. This is a defensive proposal against the US tariff move. In altering the composition of their shipping portfolios, banks want to shield themselves from steep US port fees first imposed in mid-October and possibly from Chinese shipowners. Industry insiders say the timing is key: Some of China’s biggest leasing houses have billions of dollars locked in vessels that often visit American ports, and the overall trade war backdrop can only heighten tensions. The National Financial Regulatory Administration (NFRA), China’s top banking watchdog, is closely watching the talks, and people familiar with the matter said the regulator hasn’t made a decision and is considering the financial risks of allowing banks to hold shipping mortgages. This industry was traditionally seen as too risky. People in the talks say it is a highly sensitive process. On the one hand, Beijing would like to protect its lenders and shipping companies from Washington’s measures. On the other hand, regulators are wary of exposing banks to new risks when China’s financial system is already under pressure from soft property markets and slower growth. The deliberations underscore the scale of China’s footprint in shipping. With nearly $100 billion in shipping assets already on long-term leases to China-backed firms, Chinese banks and leasing companies lead the global market. Any change to the structure of how those assets are funded would reverberate across international shipping and could reshape China’s standing as the world’s largest maritime lender. Chinese lenders explore mortgage model for ships The thought arose in August when leasing companies and the shipowners met with NFRA officials. In China, lessors have been the key players in shipping finance worldwide for over a decade, replacing Western banks that have retreated. In a standard leasing contract, the owner buys the vessel and leases it to the operator for over ten years or longer. The legal liability and financial responsibility are reversed if the leases become mortgages. The ship owner owns the ships, but the bank finances them. Mortgages are generally shorter — around five years — and shift the risk of market downturns and defaults from landlords to operators and their lenders. By crossing that line, Chinese banks would be taking an extraordinary leap. Shipping assets have long been considered cyclical and volatile, with values influenced by the ebbs and flows of trade, freight rates, and global demand. In case of default, these banks would have to spend years in court trying to recoup their money. However, other lenders say the risk could be worth it if mortgages shield their portfolios from US exposure. Banks brace for US penalties The urgency comes from an American plan unveiled in April by President Donald Trump. Effective October 14, Chinese-built and Chinese-operated vessels calling at US ports will be charged fees based on cargo volume. The highest fees are likely imposed on vessels directly owned by Chinese companies. The United States says the duties are intended to revitalize its shipbuilding industry and reduce dependence on Chinese maritime muscle. However, Beijing views this step as a direct challenge to controlling global shipping finance. As of last year, Chinese leasing companies owned about $100 billion worth of shipping assets in total, according to Clarkson Research Services. Shipping makes up as much as 40% of some lessors’ portfolios, underscoring their US policy exposure. Industry sources said some shipowners are already looking for ways around the levies. Among the ideas under consideration is raising charter rates on ships that do not call at US ports and overhauling financing for vessels that do. Others are tapping non-Chinese banks for the new money to cut risk.

The new fund distinguishes itself as the first US ETF to pair spot ETH exposure with direct staking payouts. REX-Osprey passes Ethereum rewards to investors According to the release, the new ETF fund gives investors exposure to spot Ethereum while passing through monthly staking rewards. It holds a mix of directly staked ETH and exchange-traded products (ETPs) that also stake ETH. All ETH staking rewards are passed to investors, with none retained by Rex or Osprey. The ETH fund trades under the ticker ESK and is structured under the 1940 Act. Greg King, the CEO of REX Financial, said , “With ESK, we’re giving investors access to Ethereum plus staking rewards in the most broad-based US ETF format.” He explained that the launch of ESK is a continuation of the joint venture work of “introducing crypto staking through the ETF structure.” REX-Osprey is a partnership between REX Shares and Osprey Funds. The joint venture focuses on launching crypto-focused ETFs that give investors regulated access to digital assets. Competitors like BlackRock , Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton are still waiting for approval from the SEC. The Securities and Exchange Commission postponed rulings on staking features for Ethereum funds filed by these companies. Spot Ethereum ETFs in the US already manage close to $25 billion, with BlackRock’s ETHA holding the largest share. On September 25, Bitcoin ETFs recorded strong inflows, while Ethereum funds saw continued outflows. Bitcoin ETFs added more than $149 million in new money, led by BlackRock’s IBIT product. Ethereum ETFs lost about $79 million, showing weaker demand as investors pulled capital from ETH funds. Dogecoin and XRP ETFs go live through Rex-Osprey Last week, Rex-Osprey launched the first US based Dogecoin and XRP ETFs. The Dogecoin ETF trades under the ticker DOJE, while the XRP ETF lists as XRPR. Cryptopolitan reported that XRPR recorded about $37.7 million in trading volume, while DOJE saw around $17 million on launch day. The funds are listed on US exchanges under the 1940 Act structure, the same framework used for Rex-Osprey’s other products. XRPR continues to trade actively with over 200,000 shares exchanged daily, while DOJE has attracted about $8 million in inflows since launch. According to Yahoo Finance data , XRPR closed trading at $22.80 while DOJE is standing at $21.24 per share. The new ETFs were launched to meet rising investor demand for crypto access inside regulated vehicles. Rex-Osprey secured compliance using the 1940 Act framework, while offering a familiar structure to the market.

Who the winner will be is not for certain, but there will be more than 1. — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) September 24, 2025 Background of SHIB and its Market Position SHIB, originally known as a meme coin, has grown into a much larger ecosystem over the years. Developers have expanded SHIB’s utility and functionality beyond its original branding, working on projects designed to drive real-world adoption. Efforts such as token burns , aimed at reducing supply, have sought to create scarcity and potentially improve value over time. This activity has elevated SHIB’s status from a speculative digital asset to one seeking recognition as a legitimate participant in the wider crypto market. Potential Impact of an SHIB ETF An exchange-traded fund tied to SHIB could provide institutional and retail investors with easier access to the asset, eliminating the need to hold the token directly. This approach mirrors what has already taken place with Bitcoin and Ethereum, where ETFs have provided a regulated investment vehicle for a previously complex asset class. A SHIB ETF could also enhance market liquidity, increase institutional participation, and provide additional opportunities for investors who prefer traditional brokerage platforms. While asset managers have not shown much interest in an SHIB ETF , Del Crxpto’s initiative could begin that push toward increased participation and multiple filings.

However, Del Crxpto’s public statement highlights that more than one entity is interested in advancing this product. He said, “Who the winner will be is not for certain, but there will be more than 1.” Additionally, the SEC has softened its stance on ETF regulation and approval, recently allowing Grayscale to launch its Digital Large Cap Fund as an ETF under the new Generic Listing Standards. Supporters of SHIB see it as a strong candidate for a regulated investment product, and applications for ETFs based on the asset might start showing up soon.

US Senate To Put Crypto Taxes Under The Microscope The panel will hear testimony from industry and tax-policy experts, including Jason Somensatto, director of policy at Coin Center; Andrea S. Kramer, a founding member of AS Kramer Law; Lawrence Zlatkin, vice president of tax at Coinbase; and Annette Nellen, chair of the Digital Assets Tax Task Force at the American Institute of CPAs. The committee’s notice lists Chairman Mike Crapo and Ranking Member Ron Wyden for opening statements and says a livestream will be available on the committee’s website. The formal notice follows early reporting on social media. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett wrote : “The @SenFinance Committee has just announced a hearing next Wednesday, October 1st at 10AM EST on crypto taxes,” adding the witness list and framing the session as a focused review of current rules . Although the witness lineup spans advocacy, corporate, legal, and professional-standards perspectives, the committee has not released draft legislation attached to the hearing. The agenda suggests a broad fact-finding remit as senators weigh how to treat the complex spectrum of digital-asset activity for federal income-tax purposes, from staking , token launches, and protocol-level distributions to basis tracking, wash-sale parity, and information-reporting obligations. Market participants are already attempting to read the political tea leaves. The trader known as “HORSE” (TheFlowHorse) posted a pointed aside on X: “Tinfoil hat. Trump admin will do anything to make their crypto activity have less of a tax burn. Major favorable changes are coming.” The hearing lands against a shifting backdrop for US crypto tax policy. Earlier this year, the Senate voted with a wide bipartisan margin to roll back a Biden-era rule that would have extended broker-style reporting to certain decentralized finance platforms beginning in 2027, a move the industry argued misfit the technology and imposed disproportionate costs. The October 1 session is therefore less a narrow technical hearing than a barometer of where the next wave of federal tax guidance may head. The Finance Committee’s site lists the hearing time as 10:00 a.m. ET on October 1; for European readers, that corresponds to 16:00 CEST. A livestream link will be posted on the committee page closer to the start.

The fall in ETH’s price can be attributed to a mix of macroeconomic, structural, and crypto-specific factors. Ethereum Dips Below $4,000, Analyst Explains Why According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, ETH’s latest descent below $4,000 can be blamed on a complex mix of factors. First, a strong US dollar, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) cautious stance following its September rate cut, dampened risk appetite. Related Reading: Ethereum Close To Local Bottom? Analyst Flags Drop In Binance Open Interest Furthermore, rising bond yields and the increasing risk of a US government shutdown have spooked investors, discouraging them from investing in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies like ETH. Second, the analyst points to the role of leverage in ETH’s latest dip. On September 22, more than $500 million in ETH longs were wiped out within 24 hours, resulting in the unwinding of high leverage that was building up in Q2 2025. During the sell-off, ETH whales faced close to $45 million in forced sales. In addition, low weekend trading volume and shallow order books enhanced ETH’s price swings. Notably, institutional investors turned to OTC redemptions, following the Fed meeting to reduce their exposure to ETH. From a technical perspective, ETH failed to decisively break through the stiff resistance near $4,500 – $4,600. Failure to defend the $4,200 support worsened things for ETH, turning the momentum sharply bearish. The fifth reason was regulatory headwinds surrounding digital assets, especially the uncertainty around MiCA in the EU and US crypto legislation. ETH exchange-traded fund (ETF) outflows worth $76 million weighed on investor sentiment. Finally, a surge in validator exit queues and reduced staking inflows weakened natural buy-side support. Other factors, such as seasonal weakness and Bitcoin’s (BTC) rising dominance in the market, contributed to ETH’s sell-off. Arab Chain concluded: While this correction reflects structural positioning and macro forces rather than a broken thesis, volatility may persist until liquidity returns and regulatory clarity improves. Will ETH Stage A Recovery? While the momentum is against ETH currently, some analysts are optimistic about a turnaround in ETH’s fortunes in the coming months. For instance, ETH’s CME futures open interest is inching closer to new highs, setting a new potential target for ETH of $6,800 by the end of 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Stalls As Spot And Perpetual Volumes Flatten On Binance Similarly, the surge in ETH contracts throughout the year has some analysts convinced that the digital asset may soon embark on a rally to $5,000. ETH’s illiquid supply could further propel it to new highs. In his latest analysis, crypto commentator Ted Pillows predicted that the increase in global M2 money supply could pave the way for $20,000 ETH. At press time, ETH trades at $3,959, down 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

The move erased more than $18 billion in market value over the past week and confirmed fresh resistance at $2.80, leaving traders bracing for a test of $2.70 support. News Background • XRP slid 5.83% over the Sept. 25–26 session, falling from $2.92 to $2.75 on heavy institutional selling. • A sharp rejection at $2.80 during the 17:00 hour triggered a 276.77 million volume spike — more than 2.5x the 24-hour average. • Despite SEC approval of the first U.S. XRP ETF, optimism has been offset by Powell’s warnings on valuations and rising Treasury yields. • Over the past week, XRP’s market value has contracted by $18.94 billion, down 10.22%, breaking below the $3.00 psychological threshold. Price Action Summary XRP traded between $2.92 and $2.74 — a 6.3% intraday range — before closing near $2.75. • Sellers dominated after $2.80 rejection on extreme volume, creating a distribution zone that capped further upside. • Subsequent recovery attempts stalled around $2.81–$2.82, confirming fresh resistance clusters. • Final hour saw a brief 1.09% bounce from $2.75 to $2.78, driven by concentrated flows between 00:50–00:57 on volumes above 3 million per candle. • Short-term support is now seen at $2.75–$2.77, with downside risk toward $2.70 if breached. Technical Analysis • Range: $0.18 (6.3%) between $2.92 high and $2.74 low. • Resistance: $2.80 initial rejection; $2.81–$2.82 clusters formed on failed retests. • Support: $2.75 zone defended in late session; $2.70 psychological level next watch. • Volume: 276.77M at 17:00 vs. 108.42M daily average. • Pattern: High-volume rejection signals distribution. Short-term consolidation near $2.77 suggests indecision before next move.

Investors witnessed a significant shift on September 25th, as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded a staggering net outflow of $250 million. This marked a swift reversal, coming just one day after these funds had managed to post net inflows, leaving many to ponder the underlying reasons and potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. What Triggered These Significant Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows? Despite the overall negative trend, it wasn’t a uniform picture across all funds. BlackRock’s IBIT, a prominent player in the space, actually managed to attract a respectable $81.03 million in inflows. This positive individual performance, however, was unfortunately overshadowed by substantial outflows from several other key ETFs. These included: Fidelity’s FBTC: Experienced a significant outflow of $110 million, indicating notable investor rebalancing. Bitwise’s BITB: Saw $80.52 million depart from its holdings, reflecting a similar sentiment among its investors. Ark Invest’s ARKB: Registered outflows amounting to $63.05 million, contributing to the overall negative trend. Grayscale’s GBTC: Contributed $42.9 million to the net outflow figure, often influenced by its unique conversion dynamics and fee structure. The combined effect of these individual fund movements painted a clear picture of net selling pressure, ultimately leading to the substantial $250 million in Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows . This daily fluctuation highlights the inherent volatility and rapid shifts that can occur within the digital asset investment landscape, often driven by profit-taking or short-term market sentiment. Decoding the Broader Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows When such considerable Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows occur, it naturally raises questions about broader market sentiment and Bitcoin’s immediate price trajectory. While daily movements are common, a quarter-billion-dollar net outflow in a single day can signal a cautious approach from institutional investors or a wave of profit-taking after recent price appreciation. It suggests that, for this particular day, the desire to reduce exposure outweighed the appetite for new investment in these structured Bitcoin products. These ETFs are designed to provide institutional and retail investors with regulated access to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Therefore, their inflows and outflows often serve as a barometer for wider institutional interest and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. Persistent outflows could indicate a cooling interest, whereas consistent inflows typically signal growing adoption and bullish sentiment. The balance between supply and demand within these funds directly influences market perception and, consequently, Bitcoin’s price action. Navigating Volatility: Understanding Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows For investors monitoring the market, understanding the nuances behind these daily reports is crucial. It’s important to remember that the ETF market is still relatively nascent, and daily fluctuations, while significant in magnitude, do not always dictate long-term trends. Instead, they offer snapshots of investor behavior at specific points in time. When analyzing Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows , consider the following: Short-term vs. Long-term View: A single day’s outflow, even a large one, should be viewed within the context of longer-term trends and overall market adoption. Market-wide Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate changes, or significant regulatory news can all influence investor decisions, prompting shifts in capital. Individual ETF Dynamics: Outflows from specific funds, especially older ones like GBTC, might be due to unique factors such as fee structures or conversion opportunities, rather than a universal bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin itself. The fact that BlackRock’s IBIT continued to attract funds, even amidst widespread outflows, suggests a degree of confidence in certain offerings or a strategic reallocation of capital within the ETF ecosystem. This resilience in specific funds provides an interesting counterpoint to the overall negative flow, highlighting diverse investment strategies at play. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows and the Market? Looking ahead, the trajectory of Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows will be closely watched by market participants. The ability of these funds to consistently attract capital is vital for demonstrating sustained institutional demand for Bitcoin. While a single day of significant outflows can create headlines, the overall trend over weeks and months will provide a clearer picture of the market’s health. Investors should continue to perform their due diligence, focusing on diversified portfolios and a long-term investment horizon. Avoiding impulsive decisions based on daily market movements is key. The digital asset space is maturing rapidly, and while volatility is a characteristic, the underlying technology and growing adoption continue to present compelling opportunities for those who approach it strategically. Ultimately, the story of spot Bitcoin ETFs is one of ebb and flow. While September 25th saw a significant “ebb,” the underlying interest in Bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle continues to drive innovation and product development. Investors should remain informed, look beyond daily headlines, and consider the broader market context when making decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly buying, holding, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why did Spot Bitcoin ETFs experience a net outflow on September 25th? The net outflow of $250 million on September 25th was primarily due to significant outflows from several major ETFs like Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and Ark Invest’s ARKB, which overshadowed BlackRock’s inflows. Reasons could include profit-taking, rebalancing, or short-term market sentiment shifts. How do Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows impact Bitcoin’s price? Significant Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows can signal decreased institutional demand or increased selling pressure, potentially leading to a negative impact on Bitcoin’s price due to a shift in the supply and demand dynamics within the market. Is this a sign of declining institutional interest in Bitcoin? A single day’s outflow, while notable, doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term decline in institutional interest. It’s crucial to observe trends over longer periods and consider the unique dynamics of individual funds, as some, like BlackRock’s IBIT, still saw inflows. What should investors do when faced with significant Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows? Investors should avoid making impulsive decisions. It’s advisable to maintain a long-term perspective, conduct thorough due diligence, diversify portfolios, and consider broader market factors rather than reacting solely to daily fluctuations.

Recently, a notable trend has emerged concerning U.S. Spot ETH ETFs , which have now recorded their fourth consecutive day of net outflows. This sustained period of withdrawals signals a cautious approach from investors, prompting a closer look at what might be driving this shift. Decoding the Alarming Outflows Trend in Spot ETH ETFs On September 25, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively saw a significant $251.2 million in net outflows. This figure, compiled by Trader T, underscores a consistent pattern where more money is leaving these exchange-traded funds than entering them. This isn’t an isolated incident; it marks the fourth trading day in a row that these funds have experienced a net reduction in assets. Breaking down the numbers further, Fidelity’s FETH was at the forefront of these withdrawals, accounting for a substantial $158.07 million in outflows. Following closely was Grayscale’s ETHE, which saw $30.27 million exit its holdings. Interestingly, the day concluded with no Spot ETH ETFs recording any net inflows, highlighting a widespread sentiment of withdrawal across the board. Why Are Investors Pulling Back from Spot ETH ETFs? Understanding the reasons behind these sustained outflows from Spot ETH ETFs is crucial for anyone tracking the crypto market. Several factors could be influencing investors’ decisions to withdraw their capital: Broader Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market, known for its price swings, often sees investors de-risk during periods of uncertainty. Concerns about inflation, interest rate hikes, or global economic slowdowns can lead to a shift away from riskier assets like crypto. Profit-Taking: Some investors might be cashing out after earlier gains, especially if they entered positions when Ethereum’s price was lower. This natural cycle of investment often contributes to temporary outflows. Regulatory Scrutiny: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains complex and evolving. Ongoing discussions and potential new rules can create uncertainty, prompting investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach or reduce their exposure to Spot ETH ETFs . Alternative Investments: As other traditional markets or asset classes become more attractive, some capital might be reallocated away from crypto-focused products. These combined pressures contribute to the current environment of net outflows, reflecting a cautious stance among a segment of investors in Spot ETH ETFs . What is the Impact of Sustained Spot ETH ETF Outflows? A continuous trend of net outflows from Spot ETH ETFs can have several implications for both Ethereum and the broader crypto ecosystem. While not necessarily a definitive bearish signal, it does warrant attention: Potential Price Pressure on Ethereum: Significant withdrawals from ETFs can sometimes translate into selling pressure on the underlying asset, Ethereum. This is because ETF providers may need to sell ETH to meet redemption requests, potentially impacting its market price. Shifting Institutional Sentiment: These outflows might indicate a softening of institutional interest in Ethereum-based products, at least in the short term. Institutions often lead the way in adopting new financial instruments, and their movements in Spot ETH ETFs are closely watched. Market Confidence: A prolonged period of outflows could affect overall market confidence, leading to increased volatility or a more conservative outlook from other investors. Monitoring these trends provides valuable insights into the current health and future prospects of institutional engagement with Ethereum. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Spot ETH ETFs? The current streak of outflows raises questions about the immediate future of Spot ETH ETFs . Will this trend reverse, or is it indicative of a longer-term shift in investor behavior? Several factors could influence the trajectory moving forward: Regulatory Clarity: Any significant progress or definitive guidance from U.S. regulators regarding crypto assets could restore investor confidence and potentially spur new inflows into Spot ETH ETFs . Ethereum Network Developments: Ongoing upgrades and improvements to the Ethereum network, such as scalability solutions or new use cases, could reignite interest and attract fresh capital. Broader Economic Environment: A more stable or favorable macroeconomic climate, characterized by lower inflation and clearer economic outlooks, might encourage investors to re-engage with risk assets like crypto. While the recent outflows present a challenge, the underlying technology and potential of Ethereum remain strong. The performance of Spot ETH ETFs will continue to be a key barometer for institutional sentiment in the crypto space. Summary: The fourth consecutive day of net outflows from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs , totaling $251.2 million on September 25, highlights a period of investor caution. Led by Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s ETHE, these withdrawals reflect a complex interplay of market volatility, profit-taking, and regulatory uncertainties. While this trend warrants close observation, the future of Spot ETH ETFs will likely depend on evolving regulatory landscapes, Ethereum’s ongoing development, and broader economic conditions. Investors are encouraged to stay informed and monitor these critical indicators to make well-informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Spot ETH ETFs? A1: Spot ETH ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency itself. Q2: What does “net outflows” mean in the context of ETFs? A2: Net outflows occur when the total value of shares redeemed by investors from an ETF is greater than the total value of new shares purchased. Essentially, more money is leaving the fund than is coming in. Q3: Is a fourth straight day of outflows from Spot ETH ETFs unusual? A3: While daily fluctuations are common, a sustained period of four consecutive days of significant net outflows is notable. It suggests a consistent trend of investor withdrawal or caution, rather than just a one-off event. Q4: How do Spot ETH ETF outflows affect the price of Ethereum? A4: When investors redeem shares from a Spot ETH ETF, the fund often has to sell some of its underlying Ethereum holdings to meet those redemptions. If these sales are substantial and sustained, they can contribute to downward pressure on Ethereum’s market price. Q5: What factors could reverse the trend of outflows for Spot ETH ETFs? A5: Several factors could trigger a reversal, including clearer regulatory guidance for cryptocurrencies in the U.S., positive developments on the Ethereum network (e.g., scalability, new applications), and an improvement in the broader macroeconomic environment that encourages investment in risk assets. Q6: Should I be concerned about these Spot ETH ETF outflows as an Ethereum investor? A6: While these outflows indicate caution among institutional investors, they are one of many market indicators. It’s important to consider them alongside other factors like Ethereum’s fundamental technology, development roadmap, and overall market sentiment. Diversification and a long-term perspective are generally recommended. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Market research group Sistine Research has outlined this repeating structure, identifying a sequence of compression and expansion phases that appear consistently in XRP’s long-term chart. These phases highlight how price consolidates within narrowing ranges before breaking upward into significant rallies. Currently, XRP is in what Sistine Research describes as its third compression since the election. Expecting a large expansionary move from XRP soon (within months). As the price action compresses, so does the orderbook, with most liquidity compressing into a tighter and tighter range. This results in very large gaps in liquidity. XRP is on its 3rd compression since the… pic.twitter.com/hjRVzeK8wc — Sistine Research (@sistineresearch) September 24, 2025 XRP’s Current Journey The firm emphasized that the current compressive phase is “the tightest one yet at 3 consecutively higher price points.” According to their chart, each compression has occurred at progressively higher levels, suggesting structural strength within the market. The first compression, which began in July 2023 following the first favorable ruling in the XRP lawsuit , concluded in late 2024, causing a breakout of over 500% for the digital asset. Following that, XRP entered another compressive phase, with a major breakout in July that sent it to an all-time high of $3.65 . The digital asset has now entered another phase of compression, and Sistine research anticipates a major breakout in the coming months. Historical Patterns Suggest Repetition Based on XRP’s trajectory since 2014, the recurring setup of compression followed by expansion stood out. During each past cycle, extended consolidation was followed by steep upward moves, validating the technical structure highlighted in the research. The sequence of higher lows paired with contracting ranges suggests that price has not only stabilized at stronger levels but has also formed the conditions that historically led to sharp advances. The repeated occurrence of these patterns strengthens the case that XRP may be preparing for another large-scale move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Liquidity Tightening Across the Orderbook The analysis also examines the behavior of XRP’s orderbook , where trading activity reflects shifts in liquidity. Sistine Research explained that as the price action compresses, “so does the orderbook, with most liquidity compressing into a tighter and tighter range.” This condition leaves fewer layers of liquidity available outside of the narrowing bands, which in turn creates large gaps in liquidity. Such gaps often contribute to accelerated price movements once consolidation phases end. By charting both historical and recent price action, Sistine Research illustrates how these compression phases have consistently preceded expansions in XRP’s market history. Earlier cycles displayed the same buildup before notable surges, reinforcing the expectation that the present formation could deliver another expansionary move.

The debt is expected to be issued either through the high-yield bond market or via leveraged loans, Fleury told Bloomberg in a recent interview. Morgan Stanley is arranging the potential transaction, which could be launched as early as October. Credit rating agencies are still reviewing the deal, with expectations that it could fall between BB and CCC, the typical range for junk-rated debt. Google’s backstop could reportedly help secure a higher grade. Negotiations are ongoing, and there is no guarantee the deal will move forward. TeraWulf didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. TeraWulf is expected to raise approximately $3 billion to support the build-out of its data centers via a structure supported by Google https://t.co/ceLrIX7oRv — Bloomberg (@business) September 25, 2025 AI Boom Drives Demand For Data Centers, Puts Crypto Miners In Spotlight The push comes as demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure has outstripped supply. The rapid rise of AI has created shortages of data center space, graphics processing chips and access to electricity. Crypto mining firms like TeraWulf, already operating large-scale power-hungry facilities, have become attractive partners for companies seeking to expand into AI computing. TeraWulf has already seen growing interest in its facilities. In August, Fluidstack, an AI cloud platform, expanded its use of a TeraWulf-run data center in New York. Around the same time, Google increased its backstop commitment to TeraWulf by $1.4b, taking its total to $3.2b and lifting its equity stake in the miner to 14% from 8%. TeraWulf, Cipher Raise Capital To Expand Data Center Capacity Meanwhile, another mining firm, Cipher Mining, has signed a colocation deal with Fluidstack and Google. Under the agreement, Cipher will supply data center capacity. In return, Google will backstop US$1.4 billion in obligations and take an equity stake. In addition, Cipher is expected to seek more debt financing, similar to TeraWulf. Separately, in August TeraWulf said it plans to raise $400m through a private offering of convertible senior notes due 2031. The company explained that proceeds will partly fund capped call transactions. The rest will go toward expanding its data centers and other corporate needs. If completed, this financing would be one of the largest debt deals by a crypto miner shifting into AI infrastructure. Furthermore, it shows how Google is expanding its role in building out computing power to meet surging demand from AI developers.

A recent, highly significant development involves asset management giant VanEck, which has engaged directly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) crypto task force. This pivotal meeting focused on the transformative potential of ETF tokenization , signaling a serious consideration of how digital assets could reshape investment products. What Exactly is ETF Tokenization and Why Does it Matter? At its core, ETF tokenization refers to the process of representing shares of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) as digital tokens on a blockchain. Imagine owning a piece of an ETF, but instead of a traditional share certificate or digital entry in a brokerage account, you hold a secure, verifiable token on a decentralized ledger. This isn’t just a technological tweak; it’s a fundamental shift in how these investment vehicles could operate. Increased Efficiency: Tokenization can streamline the creation, redemption, and transfer of ETF shares, potentially reducing operational costs and settlement times. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, auditable record of ownership and transactions. Greater Accessibility: In the future, tokenized ETFs could offer fractional ownership and easier global access for investors. Nate Geraci, CEO of Novadius Wealth Management, highlighted the meeting’s agenda, emphasizing the discussion around the introduction of tokenized crypto ETFs and the crucial role issuers would play. This indicates the SEC is not just observing but actively engaging with the practical implications and regulatory frameworks required. What are the Benefits and Challenges of Tokenized Crypto ETFs? The move towards ETF tokenization promises several compelling advantages for both investors and the broader market. However, like any innovation, it also presents a unique set of challenges that require careful navigation. Key Benefits: Liquidity: Tokenized assets can potentially trade 24/7 on various platforms, enhancing liquidity. Programmability: Smart contracts can automate various aspects of an ETF, such as dividend distribution or rebalancing. Reduced Intermediaries: A more direct relationship between issuers and investors could emerge, cutting down on fees. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The primary hurdle remains establishing clear regulatory guidelines for tokenized securities. The SEC’s involvement is crucial here. Security Risks: While blockchain is secure, the digital nature of tokens introduces new cybersecurity considerations. Interoperability: Ensuring different blockchain networks can communicate and transfer tokenized assets seamlessly is vital for broad adoption. VanEck’s discussion with the SEC likely delved into these complexities, seeking to understand the regulatory body’s perspective on how to balance innovation with investor protection. The issuer’s role in maintaining compliance and managing these digital products will be paramount. How Might ETF Tokenization Shape the Future of Investment? The dialogue between VanEck and the SEC’s crypto task force represents a significant step towards integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. It suggests that regulators are seriously evaluating the mechanisms and implications of bringing blockchain technology into traditional investment products. This engagement could pave the way for a future where: Investment products are more agile and adaptable. Investors have greater control and transparency over their holdings. The operational backbone of financial markets becomes more efficient. While the path to widespread ETF tokenization is still unfolding, the fact that a major asset manager like VanEck is actively discussing it with the SEC indicates a strong industry push. This collaboration is essential for building robust frameworks that can support this evolution responsibly. The meeting between VanEck and the SEC’s crypto task force marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. The focused discussion on ETF tokenization underscores a growing industry interest and regulatory willingness to explore innovative investment structures. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of enhanced efficiency, transparency, and accessibility are too significant to ignore. As these conversations continue, we move closer to a future where digital assets play an integral role in diversified investment portfolios, redefining how we think about ownership and liquidity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a tokenized ETF? A tokenized ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund whose shares are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. This allows for potential benefits like faster settlement, increased transparency, and fractional ownership. Why is VanEck meeting with the SEC about ETF tokenization? VanEck, a prominent asset management firm, met with the SEC to discuss the potential impact and regulatory considerations of introducing tokenized crypto ETFs. This indicates a serious exploration of bringing blockchain innovation into traditional financial products. What are the main benefits of ETF tokenization? Key benefits include increased operational efficiency, enhanced transparency through blockchain’s immutable ledger, potential for 24/7 trading and improved liquidity, and greater accessibility for investors. What challenges does ETF tokenization face? Challenges primarily involve establishing clear regulatory frameworks, addressing cybersecurity risks associated with digital assets, and ensuring interoperability between different blockchain networks for seamless asset transfer. Will tokenized ETFs replace traditional ETFs? It’s unlikely that tokenized ETFs will completely replace traditional ETFs in the short term. Instead, they are more likely to coexist, offering investors new options and potentially evolving the market over time as technology and regulations mature.

Andrei Grachev, the visionary founder of DWF Labs, recently stirred the cryptocurrency community with a bold declaration on X. He stated that while many investors lament current market conditions, he believes this season will be the absolute last opportunity to acquire cheap crypto . This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a significant call to action from a prominent figure in the digital asset space, urging a re-evaluation of current market sentiment. Why is This the Last Chance for Cheap Crypto? Grachev’s perspective isn’t a fleeting thought; it’s deeply rooted in the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets. Historically, periods of market consolidation and lower prices often precede significant bullish runs. For savvy investors, these dips represent crucial accumulation phases, offering a chance to build positions before the next surge. Many experienced traders understand that market cycles present unique windows. The current environment, despite its complaints, might be signaling a rare opportunity. When the broader market is feeling pessimistic, that’s often when the best long-term value can be found. Consider these key benefits of acting during such a period: Lower Entry Point: Buying during a dip means acquiring assets at a reduced cost, essentially securing cheap crypto . Higher Potential Returns: If the market rebounds as anticipated, the percentage gains from a low entry point are significantly amplified. Strategic Accumulation: This period allows investors to build substantial positions in promising projects before the next major bull cycle begins. Understanding Market Sentiment and Finding Cheap Crypto It’s easy to get caught up in negative market sentiment when prices are down. Many investors feel discouraged, focusing on perceived losses rather than potential opportunities. However, as the old adage goes, the best time to buy is often when there’s ‘blood in the streets’ – a metaphor for widespread fear and selling pressure. This counter-intuitive approach requires both discipline and a long-term vision. Instead of succumbing to panic, successful investors look for strong projects with solid fundamentals that are temporarily undervalued. Identifying genuinely cheap crypto isn’t about chasing every dip blindly, but about understanding intrinsic value and future potential. Such periods test an investor’s resolve. Yet, they also separate those who react emotionally from those who execute a well-researched strategy. A clear head is essential to differentiate between a falling knife and a genuine buying opportunity. Actionable Insights for Capitalizing on Cheap Crypto Opportunities So, if Grachev’s prediction holds true, how can you make the most of this potential ‘last chance’ for cheap crypto ? Here are some actionable insights to guide your investment strategy: Conduct Thorough Research: Focus on projects with strong use cases, active development teams, and robust communities. Do not just buy any cheap crypto ; prioritize quality and long-term viability. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, spread your investments over time. This strategy helps mitigate risk by averaging out your purchase price, smoothing out market volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into a single asset. Invest in a mix of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside promising altcoins with growth potential. Set Clear Goals: Understand your personal risk tolerance and investment horizon. Are you looking for short-term gains, or are you aiming for significant long-term growth over several years? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technological advancements, and regulatory changes. Knowledge is power in the fast-paced crypto world. Is This the Ultimate Opportunity? Andrei Grachev’s statement serves as a powerful reminder: while market downturns can be challenging, they often present the most significant opportunities for future growth. Whether this truly is the ‘last chance’ for cheap crypto remains to be seen, but the underlying message is clear. Proactive, informed investment during these times can yield substantial rewards down the line. The future of digital assets is dynamic, and understanding these cycles is key to navigating them successfully. Don’t let market noise overshadow potential long-term gains. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does Andrei Grachev mean by “last chance to buy crypto cheap”? A1: Grachev suggests that current market conditions, characterized by lower prices and general pessimism, represent a final, significant window to acquire cryptocurrencies at highly favorable valuations before a potential long-term uptrend makes such prices unavailable. Q2: Is now truly the best time to invest in cryptocurrency? A2: While no one can predict the market with certainty, historical data shows that bear markets and periods of low prices often offer the best entry points for long-term investors. Grachev’s statement aligns with this contrarian investment philosophy. Q3: What strategies can I use to buy crypto at low prices? A3: Effective strategies include Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of price, and conducting thorough research to identify fundamentally strong projects that are currently undervalued. Q4: How can I identify promising cryptocurrencies during a market dip? A4: Focus on projects with strong technology, clear use cases, active development, a solid community, and transparent roadmaps. Avoid speculative assets and prioritize those with real-world utility and adoption potential. Q5: What are the risks associated with investing during a “last chance” period? A5: Even during perceived opportunities, risks remain. Market prices can drop further, and some projects may not recover. It’s crucial to invest only what you can afford to lose and to conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. Did Andrei Grachev’s insights resonate with you?

He predicts that if the global crypto market cap climbs to $25 trillion within the next five years, Ethereum could command a market valuation of approximately $3.37 trillion. This translates into a price of about $28,000 per token—a level that would mark a historic moment for ETH. The Ark Invest Director pointed to key drivers underpinning the cryptocurrency’s strength to reach such a valuation. These include the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA) on the Ethereum blockchain, the network’s rapid growth in DeFi, the growing presence of stablecoins, and ongoing innovations across Layer 2 solutions . Valente further notes that more than $120 billion in total value is already locked within Ethereum and its scaling networks, highlighting its liquidity dominance. For stablecoins, the blockchain accounts for over $100 billion of the sector’s $200 billion capitalisation, a commanding position that underscores its role as the backbone of the DeFi landscape . Notably, Valente emphasized ETH’s yield-bearing nature, with staking making the cryptocurrency one of the few revenue-generating digital assets. Beyond its ability to generate yield, the Ark Invest Director notes that Ethereum is also the number one collateral used on Layer 2s, a medium of exchange within NFT marketplaces, and the currency for paying network fees . He also believes that scaling improvements on Layer 1 and Layer 2 over the next five years could attract millions more users, reinforcing ETH’s dominance and positioning it as a unique asset unlike any other in the crypto market. XRP’s Growth Potential In A $25 Trillion Crypto Market While Ethereum is positioned at the forefront of Ark Invest’s projection, XRP remains one of the most closely watched altcoins in the market. Currently valued at approximately $2.8 billion after a recent decline , the cryptocurrency has a total market capitalization of $170.6 billion. For reference, the entire crypto market also has a market cap of $3.93 trillion, as of the time of this report. Based on these figures, XRP’s current market share is about 4.3% of the entire industry. If this ratio is maintained during the broader market’s projected rise to a $25 trillion valuation, XRP could achieve a market cap of roughly $1.05 trillion. With its current circulating supply , this would imply a price of approximately $17 per token, representing a more than sixfold increase from current levels.",Ethereum|Altcoin|ARK Invest|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Layer 1|Layer 2|Lorenzo Valente|real-world assets|RWAs|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 03:00:24

The expert, also a Bitcoin author and economist, predicts that there is at least a 50% chance that the Bitcoin price could reach a new all-time high of $200,000 by June 2026, a forecast he shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday. Optimistic Projections For The Bitcoin Price Peterson’s optimistic outlook is grounded in his analysis of the Median Bitcoin Yearly Price Path chart, which suggests that October typically marks the beginning of a new upward trend for the Bitcoin price, extending through to June of the following year. He elaborated that achieving the $200,000 target would require an average monthly return of approximately 7%, translating to an 120% annualized increase. Furthermore, he noted a 50% or greater likelihood of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high by early November of this year. Related Reading: All-Time Highs For Gold, S&P500; Crypto Stands Alone In The Red – What’s The Root Cause? As seen in the chart below, Peterson outlined additionally, two potential bullish scenarios for Bitcoin’s trajectory. The most scenario points toward a surge to a new record of $240,000, while a more conservative estimate suggests a rise toward $160,000. Regardless, these indicators he referenced imply that the remainder of the year and subsequent months of 2026, could be marked by significant price increases for the market’s leading cryptocurrency. However, the broader crypto market performance has not been without its challenges. Investors Brace For Friday’s PCE Data On Thursday, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), experienced a downturn as investors shifted their focus to upcoming economic data, particularly following a sharp market correction earlier in the week. Traders are particularly attentive to Friday’s personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) preferred measure of inflation, which could have implications for future interest rate decisions. When interest rates decrease, more stable investments such as bonds or equities tend to offer lower yields, encouraging investors to seek riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ex-Binance CEO CZ Criticizes FT Report On YZi Labs, Calls It A ‘Negative Narrative’ Earlier in the week, a substantial sell-off occurred across the crypto market, marking the largest deleveraging event of the year. On Monday, many digital asset investors unwound bullish positions that had been established after the Fed’s recent quarter-point interest rate cut. Maja Vujinovic, CEO of Digital Assets at FG Nexus, commented on the situation, emphasizing that the recent liquidations stemmed from excessive leverage rather than failing market fundamentals. She noted, “Overheated funding post-Fed left traders exposed; once Bitcoin rolled over, forced unwinds hit ETH and altcoins hard.” Despite the cautious sentiment prevailing in the crypto market this week, Vujinovic pointed out that historical trends suggest these “leverage washes” often pave the way for a healthier market foundation.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Technically, Bitcoin trades inside a descending triangle, with resistance at $111,128 and support near $109,000. A breakdown risks $107,282 or $105,201, but the RSI near 38 suggests oversold conditions. A bullish candle at these levels could trigger a rebound to $113,900 and $117,372, where major resistance sits. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For traders, cautious accumulation between $109,000–$110,000 with stops under $105,000 remains viable. A recovery above $114,000 would confirm a breakout path toward $120,000. With U.S. states embracing crypto payments, altcoins expanding ecosystems, and stablecoin firms attracting billions, Bitcoin may be setting up for a renewed rally into year-end.

This significant event saw long positions, betting on price increases, getting overwhelmingly liquidated across major digital assets. It’s a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and rapid shifts that define the crypto landscape, leaving many traders caught off guard by sudden market movements. What Exactly Are Ethereum Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the market moves against their trade, and they no longer have enough collateral to maintain the position. For example, if you bet on Ethereum’s price rising (a long position) but it unexpectedly drops, your position might be liquidated to prevent further losses for the exchange. Over the past 24 hours, these forced closures were immense. Here’s a breakdown of the liquidation volumes for major cryptocurrency perpetual futures: ETH: $440 million liquidated, with long positions accounting for a substantial 89.86%. BTC: $280 million liquidated, with an even higher 96.34% of long positions affected. SOL: $85.56 million liquidated, with 92.93% of these being long positions. These figures highlight how predominantly long positions were hit, underscoring a market largely positioned for upward momentum that quickly reversed. Unpacking the $805 Million Crypto Market Shockwave This massive wave of liquidations, totaling over $805 million, highlights a crucial aspect of leveraged trading: it dramatically magnifies losses as well as gains. The overwhelming dominance of long liquidations suggests a market caught off guard by a sudden downturn or unexpected consolidation. Traders with high leverage, anticipating continued upward momentum, were the most vulnerable to these swift market corrections. The fact that Ethereum liquidations led the charge underscores ETH’s pivotal role. Often, ETH’s price movements can signal trends for other digital assets. Its significant decline contributed to a cascading effect across the ecosystem. This interconnectedness means a major move in one asset, especially Ethereum, can trigger widespread consequences and volatility. Navigating Volatility: Lessons from Recent Ethereum Liquidations For crypto participants, this event offers critical lessons in risk management. The allure of amplified profits through leverage is strong, but it comes with equally amplified risks. Understanding market dynamics and having a robust exit strategy are paramount. Diversification, setting stop-loss orders, and avoiding excessive leverage are fundamental practices to protect capital during volatile periods. Moreover, keeping an eye on fundamental developments and technical indicators can provide insights into potential market shifts. While no one can predict the market perfectly, informed decision-making based on thorough research can mitigate some risks associated with widespread Ethereum liquidations . Always remember, the crypto market can turn on a dime, making vigilance essential for any trader. In conclusion, the recent $805 million in crypto liquidations, heavily led by Ethereum, serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s unpredictable nature. It emphasizes caution and strategic planning, especially in leveraged trading. As the market evolves, adapting to its inherent volatility through sound risk management will be key to long-term success in digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations What exactly are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange. This happens when their collateral falls below a required margin due to the market moving significantly against their prediction. Why were long positions predominantly affected in this event? Long positions are bets that an asset’s price will increase. The high number of long liquidations indicates a sudden and significant price drop, catching traders expecting upward momentum off guard. This decline pushed many leveraged long positions below their liquidation thresholds. How can traders protect themselves from significant Ethereum liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, diversifying portfolios, and conducting thorough market research. Robust risk management strategies are crucial for navigating volatile markets. Does this event signal a broader crypto market crash? While significant liquidation indicates high volatility, it doesn’t automatically signal a sustained market crash. It often reflects a price correction. However, it reminds traders to remain cautious and adapt their strategies. If you found this analysis helpful, please share this article with your network on social media.

It’s crucial to be aware of an upcoming development that might impact your ability to move these digital assets. Binance has announced a temporary Binance KSM DOT suspension of deposits and withdrawals for both KSM and DOT, a move essential for supporting their respective network migrations. Understanding the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind this decision is key for every crypto enthusiast. What’s Happening with the Binance KSM DOT Suspension? Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently issued an official notice detailing the temporary halt of services for two significant blockchain projects: Kusama (KSM) and Polkadot (DOT). This isn’t a cause for alarm, but rather a standard procedure to facilitate important network upgrades. For Kusama (KSM) , the suspension of deposits and withdrawals will commence at 7:00 a.m. UTC on October 7 . Subsequently, Polkadot (DOT) will experience its service suspension starting at 7:00 a.m. UTC on November 4 . These specific dates highlight Binance’s proactive approach to ensure the safety and integrity of user assets during critical network transitions. It’s a temporary measure designed to support the underlying technology, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem. Why the Temporary Halt? Understanding Network Migrations The core reason behind this Binance KSM DOT suspension is to support ongoing “network migrations.” But what exactly does that mean for these prominent projects? Both Kusama and Polkadot are at the forefront of the Web3 movement, known for their innovative parachain architecture. Network migrations typically involve: Upgrades to Core Infrastructure: Enhancements to the blockchain’s fundamental code, improving performance, security, or adding new features. Parachain Slot Auctions & Migrations: Both KSM and DOT ecosystems regularly undergo processes where new parachains are integrated or existing ones migrate, requiring careful coordination. Ensuring Asset Safety: During complex upgrades, temporarily pausing transfers helps prevent potential issues like transaction errors, lost funds, or security vulnerabilities that could arise from interacting with a network in transition. Binance’s decision to implement the Binance KSM DOT suspension ensures that all user assets are securely handled and accurately reflected once the network upgrades are complete and stable. It’s a testament to the exchange’s commitment to protecting its users. Impact on Users: What You Need to Know and Do About the Binance KSM DOT Suspension While the suspension is temporary, it’s essential for KSM and DOT holders to understand its implications. During the specified periods, you will not be able to deposit new KSM or DOT into your Binance account, nor will you be able to withdraw existing KSM or DOT from the platform. Here are some actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you anticipate needing to move KSM or DOT during these windows, ensure you complete your transactions well before the announced suspension times. Trading Remains Active: Typically, trading of KSM and DOT on Binance’s spot markets will remain unaffected. This means you can still buy, sell, or trade these assets within the exchange. However, always refer to Binance’s official announcements for the most precise details. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Binance’s official announcement channels and social media for updates regarding the exact resumption times. These can sometimes be adjusted based on the progress of the network migrations. The key is to avoid last-minute rushes and ensure your asset management aligns with these scheduled pauses. This temporary Binance KSM DOT suspension is a minor inconvenience for a greater good: a more robust and efficient blockchain. Ensuring a Seamless Transition: Binance’s Commitment Binance’s role in facilitating these network migrations goes beyond simply pausing services. The exchange actively collaborates with the Kusama and Polkadot development teams to understand the technical requirements of the upgrades. This proactive engagement allows Binance to: Conduct Thorough Testing: Before resuming services, Binance will conduct rigorous internal testing to confirm the stability and functionality of the upgraded networks. Safeguard User Funds: The primary objective of any suspension is to protect user assets from potential risks associated with network changes. Provide Clear Communication: Binance is committed to transparently informing its users about the status of the suspension and when services are expected to resume.

Some analysts see recovery hinging on ETH reclaiming $4,200, while others lean bearish, eyeing a slide to $3,500 unless support holds. Are the Bulls Coming Back? Ethereum, which was at the forefront of gains this summer, briefly plunged below $4,000 earlier today (September 25) amid an ongoing red wave passing through the entire crypto market. It later surpassed the psychological level but remains 12% down on a weekly scale. Despite the negative performance, three crucial factors signal that a resurgence could be on the way. The first one is the diminishing supply of ETH tokens stored on crypto exchanges. CryptoQuant’s data shows that today the figure has dropped to a nine-year low of around 16.3 million coins. This development indicates that many investors have switched from centralized platforms to self-custody solutions, which in turn reduces immediate selling pressure. Next in line is Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). The technical analysis tool examines the asset’s recent price movements to indicate whether it has entered oversold or overbought territory. It ranges from 0 to 100, and readings below 30 suggest that the first scenario could be in play, which can result in a rally. As of press time, the RSI stands at roughly 22. ETH RSI, Source: CryptoWaves Last but not least , we will touch upon the latest whale activity that may also positively impact ETH’s valuation. X user ZYN revealed that ten new wallets have purchased over 200,000 tokens worth more than $800 million in the last 24 hours. Such actions reduce the amount of coins available on the open market and could be followed by a price pump (should demand remain constant or rise). Additionally, smaller players may view this as an encouraging sign and join the ecosystem by distributing fresh capital. The Analysts’ Take According to X user Lennaert Snyder, Ethereum’s road to recovery goes through a crucial reclaim of $4,200. “Watching that level for confirmation shorts and longs after the gain. Losing $3,900 support brings us to the $3,700 zone, holding that is key to maintain the weekly uptrend,” he argued . The analyst, using the X moniker Ted, leaned more bearish for the short term. He predicted that ETH will most likely retest $3,800, which could result in a further downtrend to $3,500. On the other hand, if it holds this level, “a rally will happen.” The post 3 Reasons Ethereum’s (ETH) Bull Run Isn’t Over Yet appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-26 03:38:42

A drop below $260 would weaken the outlook and could drag the price down toward $245. Aave 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for September 26, AAVE is trading at $265.75, posting a slight bounce of +2.13%. The price is pinned closest to the lower Bollinger Band at $262.68, confirming it is still deep in a bearish zone. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView Recent candles show repeated attempts to break lower, but buyers currently provide minimal support just above $260. The MACD remains strongly negative, though the histogram seems to be slightly easing. A breakdown below $260 would invalidate recovery hopes and could drag AAVE toward $245. Aave 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, AAVE is trading at $265.50, showing a sharp bounce after dipping near $259. The RSI has recovered from 39.3 to 39.9, signaling that bearish pressure is cooling, though it remains well below neutral. The Alligator indicator, though lined up bearishly, shows AAVE might soon test its first dynamic resistance at $267.16. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Momentum suggests AAVE may attempt a push toward $270–$274 if buyers sustain volume. Failure to clear $267–$270 would likely trigger another pullback, with a potential retest of the $260 level.

Authorities said the ordeal lasted nine hours before law enforcement intervened and the suspects fled the state. Kidnappers hold the family at gunpoint Prosecutors identified the men as Raymond Christian Garcia, 23, and Isiah Angelo Garcia, 24. The brothers are from Waller, Texas. Officials said they traveled to Minnesota and carried out the crime. The brothers confronted the father of a family outside his home in Grant, Minnesota. He was taking out the trash when the criminals appeared with an AR-15-style rifle and a shotgun. They zip-tied his hands and forced him back inside. Inside the home, the suspects woke the man’s wife and adult son. Both were tied up and held at gunpoint. Prosecutors say that Raymond kept watch over them while Isiah focused on transferring cryptocurrency from the father’s accounts. Investigators say the brothers demanded access to digital wallets and forced large transfers into their own accounts. They also made repeated phone calls to an unidentified third person who appeared to guide the operation. The victim told them more funds were stored on a hardware wallet at a family cabin nearly three hours away. Isiah then drove the father to the cabin while carrying the shotgun. There, the victim was forced to move the remaining funds. During this time, Raymond stayed in the family home, holding the wife and son hostage with the rifle. Prosecutors estimate the suspects stole a total of $8 million in cryptocurrency. A criminal flees after seeing the policemen After hours, the son managed to call 911 when Raymond stepped outside the house. The police arrived within minutes, and they found the wife and son restrained inside the house. They saw Raymond fleeing out the back door. The police found a suitcase hidden in a tree line after searching the area. They found a disassembled AR-15 rifle, ammunition, clothes, and drinks. At the same time, Isiah was driving back with the father. Several emergency vehicles passed them on the road unknowingly. Isiah later abandoned the shotgun near a middle school parking lot. The situation forced the school to cancel its homecoming football game for safety. Authorities connected the brothers to the crime using receipts and surveillance. A Wendy’s receipt from the suitcase showed that Isiah had rented a car in Houston days earlier. Surveillance footage confirmed Raymond had rented a Motel 6 room in Roseville, Minnesota, before the attack. The car used in the kidnapping was later tracked on traffic cameras. It was seen in Oklahoma before returning to Texas a day later. Authorities arrest the brothers Law enforcement arrested the brothers in Waller, Texas. Officials say Isiah confessed after being taken into custody. He admitted that he and his brother traveled to Minnesota, tied up the family, and forced the crypto transfers. County prosecutors filed state charges, including kidnapping with a firearm, aggravated robbery, and burglary. Moreover, federal prosecutors filed additional kidnapping charges. Both brothers are awaiting their first federal court appearance, and prosecutors will seek detention until trial. Prosecutors said the investigation is ongoing. Authorities are still trying to identify the third person who allegedly guided the transfers by phone.

Some analysts suggest the altcoin’s price is retesting a make-or-break level that will determine the direction of its next big move. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Price Holds Key Support, But Analyst Warns Rally Could Be At Risk SUI Hits Two-Month Low On Thursday, SUI is retesting the local range lows after an 8% daily drop from the $3.40 area to a key support level. The recent market pullbacks have momentarily halted most bullish rallies, sending leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) to an eight-week low of $3,800. Now, SUI’s rally, which was fueled by institutional interest, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), and positive developments for the network, has declined over 21% in the weekly timeframe. The cryptocurrency has seen a strong three-month rally following its early Q3 breakout to its multi-month high of $4.44. The altcoin has hovered between the $3.10-$4.00 levels over the past three months, attempting to break out of this range multiple times. Last week, SUI’s price retested this area for the third time during this period, but has since been rejected from the range highs after failing to hold the $3.80 mark as support. Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been “stuck” inside the $3.10-$4.30 range since May, briefly losing the support area during the June pullback. According to the trader, the five-month consolidation should eventually lead to a big price move out of the range. “As we approach the range low/support, it’s back on my radar for a potential range play,” he noted, adding that it would need a strong bounce from this area to hold the macro range. On the contrary, Daan suggested that “If it sits there and doesn’t do anything, then that’s a red flag,” as it would risk losing the crucial multi-month support and retracing toward the June lows. Price Retests Make-Or-Break Level Amid the retracement, SUI is also retesting another crucial support. As multiple analysts pointed out, the cryptocurrency is trading within a textbook ascending triangle pattern on a higher timeframe. Notably, the price has been compressing within the pattern’s upper and lower boundaries since early Q2. Throughout the multi-month consolidation, each time the altcoin has bounced from the ascending support, it has retested the flat upper trendline. Ali Martinez highlighted that a successful breakout from the bullish formation’s resistance line around the $4 barrier would set the stage for a retest of its all-time high (ATH) level of $5.35 and an overall 75% rally toward the $7 area. Similarly, analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that “it’s really time to pay attention” to the bullish formation, as the price compression continues and a break from the pattern seems imminent.

Failing to maintain this key support, currently located around the $3.10 area, could invalidate the setup and lead to a retest of the $2.40-$2.90 zone. As of this writing, SUI is trading at $3.15, a nearly 10% decline in the monthly timeframe.

ING, UniCredit, & Other European Banks Are Coming Together For Stablecoin As announced in a press release by Italian banking giant UniCredit, the bank is joining forces with eight other major European institutions to launch a stablecoin pegged to the euro. “This digital payment instrument, leveraging blockchain technology, aims to become a trusted European payment standard in the digital ecosystem,” read the press release. The stablecoin will have compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), the bloc’s comprehensive framework on cryptocurrencies. MiCAR covers a range of areas, like issuance and custody of digital assets, as well as the operation of platforms related to them. The full list of banks that have come together to form the consortium for the euro-denominated token includes: ING, Banca Sella, KBC, Danske Bank, DekaBank, UniCredit, SEB, CaixaBank, and Raiffeisen Bank International. All of these are major banking players, but two are perhaps particularly prominent: ING and UniCredit. ING is a Dutch multinational bank that’s designated as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) by the Financial Stability Board (FSB). G-SIBs are considered to be institutions so ingrained into the world financial order that any disruptions related to them can have widespread economic consequences. Italy’s UniCredit was also included in this category until 2023, when FSB removed it from the list. The nine banks have formed a new company in the Netherlands, planning to get approval from the Dutch Central Bank as an e-money institution. The press release noted that the consortium is welcoming more banks to join them. The stablecoin, which is currently slated for issuance in the second half of 2026, will be positioned as a real European alternative to the currently US-dominated market. “At UniCredit, we believe in the importance of a stronger Europe and in the power of constructive dialogue and collaboration,” said Fiona Melrose, Head of Group Strategy and ESG at UniCredit. “By joining this consortium of leading European banks, we are contributing to fill the need for a trusted, regulated solution for on-chain payments and settlement.” The consortium also intends to appoint a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the near future, subject to regulatory approval, to lead the new entity in the Netherlands. Meanwhile, in the US, stablecoins have been seeing regulatory momentum lately. Just this Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) launched an initiative to explore their use as collateral in derivatives markets, a move that could further integrate them into mainstream finance.

It dropped to a low of $2.75, down from the all-time high of nearly $3.2. Still, its strong technicals and the ongoing asset growth in the XRPR ETF will likely lead to a strong rebound soon. REX-Osprey XRPR ETF is thriving One catalyst for the XRP price is that the recently launched REX-Osprey XRPR ETF is thriving. It has had inflows in the last five days, even as the crypto market crashed . According to its website, it has gained over $70 million in assets since it launch last week. Data on ETF.com shows that the XRPR ETF has had inflows in each day since its launch last week. The ongoing ETF inflows is important because it is happening in the same week that the XRP price has moved into a bear market after plunging by over 25% from its highest level this year. It is common for cryptocurrency ETFs to have outflows when they are plunging. The inflows are also notable because XRPR is not a cheap ETF as it has an expense ratio of 0.75%, much higher than other cryptocurrency funds. For example, the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) has an expense ratio of 0.15%, while the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has a 0.25% ratio. The popular Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has a ratio of 0.03%. A 0.75% ratio is a big one because it means that a $100,000 investment costs about $750 a year for an asset that one can invest in directly and avoid the fee. As such, it means that Wall Street is ready for more XRP ETFs. XRP ETF approval is coming up The ongoing inflows into the XRPR ETF is a sign that the more mainstream XRP ETFs will be popular among investors. For one, these funds are being issued by companies that are more mainstream than REX-Osprey. They include popular firms like Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Invesco. The funds will also be much cheaper than the XRPR ETF. Like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the expense ratios are likely to range between 0.15% and 0.25%. Most importantly, these funds will be based on the more common 33’ Act that has been used on other mainstream ETFs. XRPR fund is based on the Investment Company Act of 1940. XRP price technical analysis XRP chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the XRP price has moved into a bear market. It has plunged by over 25% from its highest point this year. Ripple’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a descending channel and has moved below the neutral point at 50. On the positive side, the coin wants to form a break-and-retest pattern by moving to the upper side of the falling wedge. This pattern is one of the most popular continuation signs. The XRP price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and is now in the handle section. It has also formed a bullish pennant pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout a bulls target the year-to-date high of $3.6655, up by about 35% from the current level.

From new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, furniture, and heavy trucks to a TikTok US divestiture order, Asian equities opened lower, while crypto markets faced over $1 billion in liquidations. Investors are navigating rising trade tensions, regulatory shifts, and market volatility worldwide. Here’s a glance at major developments on Friday morning. Trump slaps latest salvo of tariffs US President Donald Trump announced a new wave of tariffs set to begin on October 1, 2025, targeting key imports like branded pharmaceutical drugs, kitchen cabinets, upholstered furniture, and heavy-duty trucks. The most impactful move is a 100% tariff on patented medicines, unless companies are actively building manufacturing plants in the US. This is part of Trump’s ongoing “America First” drive to boost domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign imports. The tariffs also include a 50% duty on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on furniture, and 25% on heavy trucks, affecting industries from home renovation to logistics. Though supporters highlight job protection and industrial revival, economists warn these tariffs could raise consumer prices and intensify inflation pressures. The pharmaceutical industry, especially companies operating globally, faces a critical challenge to ramp up US manufacturing fast or pay heavy tariffs, which might lead to higher medicine costs for consumers.

Trump signs executive order on TikTok deal Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order declaring that his plan to sell TikTok’s US operations meets the requirements of a 2024 federal law aimed at preventing a ban on the popular app. The order sets the stage for a divestiture of TikTok’s US business from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to a consortium of American and international investors, including Oracle, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, and tech entrepreneur Michael Dell. The deal, valued at around $14 billion, aims to ensure US user data is managed securely by American entities while keeping the platform operational. Trump noted he won approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping for the arrangement and emphasized that the new governance would treat all viewpoints fairly. The executive order also delays enforcement of the TikTok ban until January 23, 2026, allowing time to finalize the sale. TikTok’s 170 million US users get a reprieve amid national security concerns.

Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.7%, with traders cautious about how a stronger dollar could hurt export-heavy economies. South Korea’s Kospi 100 dropped over 2%, pressured by tech stocks facing supply chain uncertainties and export challenges. China’s Hang Seng index fell 0.9%, dragged down by drugmakers hit hard by the US 100% tariff on pharmaceutical imports. The mainland’s CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite were also in the red, reflecting renewed valuation concerns and a global risk-off sentiment. India’s markets are expected to open under pressure, especially in pharma and export-oriented sectors, given its role as a major supplier of generics to the US. Investors remain watchful ahead of crucial US inflation data, balancing hopes for economic recovery against rising trade tensions. Read full report here. Crypto liquidations mount ot $1 billion Cryptocurrency markets faced intense selling pressure on Thursday, triggering more than $1 billion in liquidations of leveraged trading positions, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin tumbled below $109,000, hitting its lowest level in nearly a month, while ether plummeted 8% toward $3,800. The sharp selloff wiped out over $400 million in ether longs alone, with bitcoin liquidations totaling $265 million. Crypto equities took a hit as well, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) stock falling as much as 10% to a five-month low, erasing all its gains for 2025. Other bitcoin mining companies like MARA and Riot Platforms also declined by 7-8%. This sudden downturn has pushed bitcoin towards critical support levels near $107,000, raising questions about whether it can hold or if further declines lie ahead. The selloff reflects mounting concerns about market volatility and leverage risk in crypto trading.

The world of cryptocurrency is often rife with strong opinions and bold forecasts. Recently, a significant and often controversial debate has ignited around Ethereum price predictions , particularly those made by prominent figures. This article delves into the claims surrounding these forecasts and their potential implications for the market. Are Recent Ethereum Price Predictions Creating Exit Liquidity? Andrew Kang, the insightful co-founder of crypto trading firm Mechanism Capital, has presented a compelling, albeit controversial, argument. He suggests that the recent optimistic Ethereum price predictions from figures like Tom Lee might be serving a different purpose than simply boosting investor confidence. Kang argues these bullish forecasts could be inadvertently creating “exit liquidity.” This means they encourage new capital to enter the market, allowing large holders – potentially including the Ethereum Foundation itself – to sell off their significant holdings at favorable prices. He drew a parallel to the Celsius bankruptcy events of 2021-2022, implying a pattern where market hype facilitates strategic exits. The sentiment from Kang also touched upon the tendency of what he termed “Baby Boomer investors” – an apparent reference to Lee – to promote established, rather than truly innovative, technologies. This perspective adds another layer to the discussion, questioning the underlying motivations behind such high-profile endorsements. Understanding Tom Lee’s Bullish Ethereum Price Predictions Tom Lee, a managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, has certainly not shied away from making significant bullish calls for Ethereum. His recent statements have undeniably fueled market excitement and contributed to the current buzz around Ethereum price predictions . Specifically, Lee has predicted that ETH could soar to an impressive range of $10,000 to $12,000 by the end of the year . This audacious forecast has naturally captured the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. Furthermore, he has expressed a belief that Ethereum holds more promise than Bitcoin, suggesting its market capitalization is likely to eventually surpass that of the leading cryptocurrency. These predictions, coming from a well-known financial analyst, carry considerable weight and can significantly influence market sentiment. They often lead to increased buying pressure as investors look to capitalize on potential gains, creating the very liquidity that Kang refers to. Navigating the Volatility of Ethereum Price Predictions In the dynamic crypto landscape, discerning the true intent and impact of any Ethereum price prediction is crucial. While bullish forecasts can inspire confidence, they also highlight the inherent volatility and speculative nature of digital assets. Here are some key considerations for investors: Verify Information: Always cross-reference predictions with fundamental analysis and broader market trends. Understand Motivations: Consider who is making the prediction and what their potential stake or influence might be. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, regardless of how optimistic a prediction appears. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between long-term technological potential and short-term price movements driven by sentiment. The debate between Kang and Lee underscores the complexity of the crypto market. It’s a reminder that while expert opinions can be valuable, they should always be weighed against a broader understanding of market mechanics and personal investment goals. Ultimately, the crypto market thrives on information, but it also demands critical thinking. Whether Tom Lee’s bullish Ethereum price predictions are genuine indicators of future growth or merely a catalyst for market manipulation, investors must remain vigilant and informed. What Does This Mean for Your Ethereum Investments? For investors holding or considering Ethereum, this discussion provides a vital lesson in market dynamics. It’s not enough to simply follow bullish news; understanding the potential forces at play behind such pronouncements is paramount. Consider diversifying your portfolio and avoiding over-reliance on single predictions, no matter how influential the source. The crypto market is still relatively young and susceptible to rapid shifts based on sentiment and large capital movements. By staying informed and maintaining a balanced perspective, you can better navigate the exciting yet challenging world of digital assets.

But what if a project could paradoxically exploit these very inefficiencies to eliminate them, paving the way for a more robust and efficient ecosystem? This is precisely the groundbreaking vision behind Treehouse DeFi , as highlighted in a recent report by global crypto research firm Four Pillars. Unpacking the Paradox: What Makes Treehouse DeFi So Unique? Four Pillars’ insightful report, titled “Treehouse: Looking at the Next Chapter of DeFi,” delves into Treehouse’s innovative strategy. At its core, Treehouse aims to generate profit by identifying and leveraging market inefficiencies, while simultaneously working to eradicate these same discrepancies. This might sound counterintuitive, but it’s a powerful mechanism designed to bring greater stability and fairness to the DeFi landscape. DOR (Decentralized Reference Interest Rate): Imagine a benchmark interest rate that isn’t controlled by a central entity but is instead determined by the market itself, in a transparent and decentralized manner. DOR is designed to be this foundational element, providing a reliable and unbiased reference rate for various financial products within DeFi. This is crucial because a standardized, trustworthy rate is essential for complex financial instruments to thrive. tAsset (Treehouse Asset): This component actively seeks out and capitalizes on market discrepancies. By identifying mispricings or imbalances, tAsset can generate returns. However, its ultimate goal isn’t just profit; it’s to push the market towards greater equilibrium. As tAsset exploits these inefficiencies, it naturally reduces them, making the market more efficient over time. Think of it as a self-correcting mechanism for the DeFi ecosystem. This dual approach suggests a future where profitability and market improvement are not mutually exclusive but rather intertwined, driving positive change within decentralized finance. Navigating Risks in Treehouse DeFi: Ensuring Stability Any innovative financial system, especially in the volatile crypto space, must prioritize robust risk management. The Four Pillars report acknowledges this, detailing Treehouse’s prudent measures to safeguard its operations and user funds. Managing risk effectively is paramount for the long-term viability and adoption of any Treehouse DeFi solution. Limited Leverage for tETH: Currently, Treehouse restricts the leverage process for its tETH asset to a single cycle. This is a critical step in preventing excessive risk-taking and cascading liquidations, which can destabilize the entire system during periods of high volatility. By limiting leverage, Treehouse aims to build a more resilient platform. WstETH Liquidity for Emergency Redemptions: Furthermore, Treehouse strategically holds back a portion of wrapped staked Ethereum (wstETH) liquidity. This reserved liquidity acts as an emergency buffer, ensuring that users can redeem their assets even during unforeseen market shocks or liquidity crunches. This commitment to liquidity provision instills confidence and enhances the platform’s reliability. These proactive risk management strategies demonstrate Treehouse’s commitment to building a sustainable and secure environment, a crucial factor for attracting broader participation in Treehouse DeFi solutions. The Future Impact: How Treehouse DeFi Could Transform Finance The implications of Treehouse’s approach, particularly with DOR, are profound. Four Pillars draws a compelling parallel to the past: just as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) served as a benchmark that facilitated the creation of a massive $600 trillion fixed-income market four decades ago, DOR possesses the potential to unlock a similar, perhaps even larger, era for decentralized finance. The introduction of a reliable, decentralized reference rate could pave the way for a plethora of new financial products and services. Imagine a future where: New types of fixed-income instruments, previously difficult to implement in DeFi due to a lack of stable reference rates, become commonplace. Lending and borrowing protocols gain greater transparency and efficiency, reducing costs and increasing accessibility for users worldwide. More sophisticated derivatives and hedging tools emerge, offering better risk management options for participants in the crypto market. The potential for Treehouse DeFi to standardize and stabilize key aspects of decentralized finance is immense, promising to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain. Concluding Thoughts: A New Horizon for DeFi The report from Four Pillars paints a vivid picture of Treehouse as a potential game-changer. By embracing a paradoxical strategy of profiting from and simultaneously eliminating market inefficiencies, Treehouse offers a fresh perspective on overcoming the persistent limitations within decentralized finance. Its core components, DOR and tAsset, are not just theoretical constructs but practical solutions designed to foster a more robust, transparent, and efficient financial ecosystem. If successful, Treehouse DeFi could indeed usher in a new era, making DeFi more accessible, reliable, and ultimately, more impactful for global finance. Frequently Asked Questions About Treehouse DeFi Here are some common questions about Treehouse and its innovative approach to decentralized finance: Q1: What is the main problem Treehouse DeFi aims to solve? A1: Treehouse aims to overcome the inherent limitations and inefficiencies within decentralized finance by creating a more robust, transparent, and stable ecosystem. It does this by paradoxically exploiting and then eliminating market discrepancies. Q2: How does DOR contribute to Treehouse’s vision? A2: DOR, the Decentralized Reference Interest Rate, is designed to provide a reliable, market-driven benchmark interest rate. This is crucial for the development of complex financial products in DeFi, much like LIBOR was for traditional finance. Q3: What is the role of tAsset in the Treehouse ecosystem? A3: tAsset actively identifies and capitalizes on market inefficiencies. While generating profit, its primary function is to drive the market towards greater efficiency and equilibrium by correcting these discrepancies. Q4: How does Treehouse manage risk for its users? A4: Treehouse implements robust risk management, including limiting tETH leverage to a single cycle to prevent excessive risk, and holding back wstETH liquidity for emergency redemptions, ensuring user asset safety and platform stability. Q5: What impact could Treehouse DeFi have on the future of decentralized finance? A5: By establishing a decentralized reference rate (DOR) and improving market efficiency (tAsset), Treehouse could unlock a new era for DeFi, fostering the creation of new fixed-income markets, enhancing lending/borrowing protocols, and offering more sophisticated financial tools.

With the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now adopting a more favorable stance toward crypto assets, the stage is set for a surge in ETF applications. Industry insiders are optimistic about the potential for new products that aim to provide exposure to alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Hedera (HBAR). SEC Streamlines Crypto ETF Approval Process The SEC’s newly updated standards for crypto ETFs, announced just last week, promise to stimulate demand for exchange-traded products linked to these cryptocurrencies. Analysts are particularly eager about the anticipated approval of products associated with Solana and XRP, with expectations that these ETFs could make their debut as early as October. Steven McClurg, founder of Canary Capital Group, noted a surge in filings with the SEC, stating , “We’ve got about a dozen filings with the SEC now, and more coming. We’re all getting ready for a wave of launches.” Jonathan Groth, partner at DGIM Law, also pointed that the fourth quarter of the year is shaping up as “boom time” for the crypto ETF market, further adding to the anticipation for the altcoins to join this trend. The SEC’s recent vote to adopt new listing standards streamlines the approval process, reducing the time required for new crypto products to launch from up to 270 days to 75 days or less. This change eliminates the need for individual regulatory reviews for each application, allowing firms to bring products to market more swiftly. As Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, explained, “These are the rules we had been anticipating.” Market Readiness In Question Grayscale has already taken advantage of this, rolling out its Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF less than 48 hours after receiving approval from the SEC to transition from a private to a publicly traded fund. This ETF includes major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside XRP, Solana, and Cardano. To qualify for the expedited approval process, an ETF must meet at least one of three criteria: the underlying asset must already be traded on a regulated market or have futures contracts regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that have been active for at least six months. Alternatively, an existing crypto ETF tied to that coin, with at least 40% of its assets invested directly in the cryptocurrency , could also pave the way for approval. Despite the excitement surrounding these new developments, questions remain about the market’s appetite for a flood of crypto ETFs centered on lesser-known coins. Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets product at asset manager VanEck, highlighted the need for investor education, noting, “There will be a flood of tokens that many folks have never heard of, and instead of years, there will be weeks or months to provide that education.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|bitcoin|BTCUSDT|crypto|Crypto ETF|crypto ETFs|Crypto ETFs approval|cryptocurrencies|Cryptocurrency|spot crypto ETF,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MARKET|SOL|ADA,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 05:00:47

Chainlink Is Coiling Inside A Triangle Right Now In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a triangle pattern forming in the weekly price of Chainlink. Triangles refer to consolidation channels from technical analysis (TA) that involve an asset trading between two converging trendlines. Like any other consolidation channel, the upper trendline acts a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. In other words, tops can be likely to occur on retests of the former and bottoms at the latter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Down 18%, But Whale Withdraws 122 Million DOGE From Binance There are a few different types of triangles, with some of the popular ones being the ascending, descending, and symmetrical variations. The orientation of the trendlines decides which type a particular triangle falls into. Ascending and descending triangles have one trendline parallel to the time-axis: upper line in the former and lower one in the latter. Symmetrical triangles lie between the two, having both lines at a roughly equal and opposite slope. Chainlink has potentially been trading inside a triangle over the last few years, but as the below chart shared by Martinez shows, this particular triangle doesn’t cleanly fit into any of these types. From the graph, it’s visible that Chainlink’s triangle lies is angled upward, but not fully, so it lies somewhere between a symmetrical triangle and an ascending one. LINK made a retest of the upper line of the pattern earlier in the year and ended up finding rejection. The cryptocurrency is now on the way down, but the analyst thinks an extended drawdown may not actually be so bad. “A dip to $16 on Chainlink $LINK would be a gift,” says Martinez. This price is where the 0.5 Fibonacci level lies. Fibonacci Extension/Retracement levels are lines drawn using ratios derived from the famous Fibonacci series. The analyst has taken LINK’s top and bottom from the last few years as the 1 and 0 levels, respectively, and has drawn retracement levels between them. The $16 mark happens to be where one such key retracement level lies. Martinez has highlighted in the chart what path the asset could end up following if it bounces off this level. It would appear that in the analyst’s view, a rebound from the line could end up leading to a breakout from the triangle and set a potential target at the 1.272 extension level, drawn up from the 1 level (top). In Chainlink price terms, this level corresponds to almost $100.

This article provides a DOGE price forecast as a risky pattern forms despite the ongoing DOJE ETF inflows. Dogecoin price technical analysis as a rising wedge forms The daily timeframe chart indicates that the DOGE price has declined significantly over the past few days. It has plunged from a high of $0.3076 on September 13 to the current $0.2275, its lowest level since September 8. The coin has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It has also moved below the ascending trendline that connects the lowest level since June 23. Read more: XRP price prediction as XRPR ETF assets near $100 million The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have moved downwards. The RSI has dropped below the neutral point at 50, a sign that the downward momentum is continuing. Worse, the Dogecoin price has formed a rising wedge pattern. This pattern comprises of two ascending and converging trendlines. In most periods, this pattern leads to a strong bearish breakout. However, a closer look shows that the two lines of the wedge are not nearing their convergence. As such, the coin could rebound and move to the upper side of the wedge at around $0.3076. DOGE price will ultimately have a strong bearish breakout, potentially to the key support level at $0.1884, its lowest level on August 3. This lowest point is notable because it formed a double-top point at $0.2870. A move above the upper side of the channel at $0.3076 will invalidate the bearish Dogecoin price forecast. DOGE price chart | Source: TradingView DOJE ETF is gaining momentum There are some potential catalysts for the Dogecoin price in the coming weeks. One of these main catalysts is the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF , which was launched last week. Data on the website shows that the DOJE ETF is gaining momentum in a very difficult period. It now has over $27 million in assets a few days after it was launched. Mot notably, it has had inflows in each trading day, which is a sign of robust demand. The ongoing ETF inflows is a positive thing as market participants wait for the spot ETF approval for companies like Grayscale, 21Shares, and Bitwise. These ETFs will be better, simpler, and cheaper than the REX-Osprey one because they will use the ‘33 Act. The other potential catalyst for the DOGE price is that the Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates. It slashed them by 0.25% last week, and hinted of two more this year. Cryptocurrency prices do well when the Federal Reserve is cutting rates. Most importantly, there are signs of more demand of Dogecoin from companies launching their treasury companies. CleanCore Solutions has launched a $600 million DOGE treasury fund, while Bit Origin and Neptune Origin have announced plans to buy 70.5 million and 1 million coins.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum had a tough week after losing support at $4,000. Its price also closes with a 13% loss. This correction is quite significant and comes after bulls failed to move ETH above $5,000. Since then, sellers have had the upper hand. If buyers cannot reclaim $4,000 as support, this level will turn into a key resistance and push this cryptocurrency much lower and towards $3,345, which is the next major support on the chart. Looking ahead, the next few days are critical for Ethereum as they will decide if the price continues down or reverses. Ideally, buyers return in force soon to stop this downtrend, but that appears unlikely at the time of this post. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) With most of the market in red, XRP also lost 10% of its valuation this week, and its price fell to the key support at $2.72. This level was tested before in early September and held well, but a second test could be less successful if buyers don’t show interest soon. Should $2.72 fall, then this level will turn into a resistance, and buyers will retreat to $2.55, where the asset has a higher chance to bounce. The momentum is also bearish on the daily and higher timeframes, which makes this an uphill battle for bulls. Looking ahead, XRP failed to make a higher high most recently. That’s a sign of weakness that could prolong this downtrend for some time. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano holders had a disappointing week after the price fell by 16%. That’s a significant crash for such a short period of time, which has taken the price to the $0.77 support. Should that fall, buyers will retreat to $0.64 next. This most recent impulse up in mid-September failed to reclaim a price of $1. With a lower high confirmed, sellers took over and pushed ADA lower. Because of this, this cryptocurrency has a high chance of making lower lows in the near future. Looking ahead, this downtrend is likely to continue and only find relief around the $0.60 area where buyers were active in the past. Moreover, the price action shows Cardano has lost its bullish momentum and would be a surprise to see it recover the recent losses. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin made a new record price last Sunday at $1,083. However, the celebrations were short-lived. Since that moment, the price entered a correction that made it close the week with a 5% loss. The asset also fell back under $1,000, but has great support at $900 and $830, where buyers could return in the future. The $1,000 level could also act as resistance going forward. Looking ahead, despite the ongoing correction, this cryptocurrency remains one of the strongest performers in the market. Any future recovery will likely see BNB perform very well, which could see it attempt new price records towards the end of 2025. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) Surprisingly, HYPE is the worst performer on our list this week after a crash of 26%! This huge loss came on the back of the recent launch of Aster, the Binance-backed decentralized exchange created to compete with Hyperliquid. Liquidity left HYPE and moved to Aster, which had a tremendous impact on its price. Sellers visited the $40 support before buyers returned. The current resistance levels are found at $44 and $50. Looking ahead, the battle between decentralized exchanges just got tuned to the max as liquidity and traders switch between platforms chasing quick gains. While Hyperliquid may suffer right now, this could also be a good opportunity to get exposure at discounted prices.

Most altcoins crashed even harder, which is why the leveraged liquidations have skyrocketed to nearly $1 billion, according to CoinGlass. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView It was less than a week ago when the primary cryptocurrency stood tall at $118,000 after the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates for the first time this year. However, the asset failed to maintain its run and started to lose value rapidly. Harrowing trading days were Monday (September 22) and Thursday (September 25). At first, BTC dumped from $115,500 to $112,000. It managed to recover some ground mid-week, but the bears initiated another leg down yesterday, which drove bitcoin further south to its lowest position since the start of the month at $108,600 (on Bitstamp). Although it has recovered around a grand since then, BTC is still below $110,000, which is a crucial support level, according to Ali Martinez. The next one actually managed to hold the freefalls, which is set at $108,530. As usual, many industry observers and commentators began speculating on the state of the correction. Some, such as Peter Schiff, called it the start of a bear market. Crypto analysts remain more optimistic. Captain Fabrik, for instance, referred to the current retracement as a ‘healthy’ one and predicted a surge to $140,000 as long as BTC can reclaim the $113,000 resistance. Nevertheless, almost all altcoins followed bitcoin on the way south, posting massive losses. Ethereum is among the poorest performers as it lost the $4,000 support and slumped beneath $3,900 yesterday. XRP is deep in the red as well, dumping by 10% weekly and struggling to remain close to $2.80. This enhanced volatility has harmed over-leveraged traders, as the total value of wrecked positions has shot up to almost $1 billion on a daily scale.

According to the bank's new report, stablecoin issuance could reach $1.9 trillion by 2030. The previous estimate was $1.6 trillion. In an optimistic scenario, that figure could reach as much as $4 trillion. The report, authored by Ronit Ghose, Global Head of Future Finance at Citi Institute, and Ryan Rugg, Global Head of Digital Assets at Citi Services, described stablecoins as “the ChatGPT moment in institutional blockchain adoption.” Related News: Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Makes Statement Addressing the Future of All Cryptocurrencies The report estimates that the $1.9 trillion stablecoin issuance could support approximately $100 trillion in annual transactions. However, it notes that this amount is still small compared to the $5 trillion to $10 trillion that major banks transfer every day. Citi argued that stablecoins “help us reimagine, rather than disrupt,” the current system, but also noted that these tools cannot provide solutions in every area. It noted that many countries already use low-cost instant payment systems, particularly for local payments, and that cross-border transactions remain the main problem. *This is not investment advice.

This rapid influx highlights the immense interest and trust in the joint initiative by Momentum, a leading ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Sui ecosystem, and BeadlePad. This impressive start to the Momentum liquidity campaign sets a new benchmark for DeFi engagement. What Makes the Momentum Liquidity Campaign So Irresistible? This isn’t just another yield farming opportunity; it’s a strategically designed event offering significant incentives. The campaign, which began at 2:30 a.m. UTC on September 26 and runs until 2:00 a.m. UTC on October 19, provides a limited window for users to maximize their crypto holdings. High Annual Percentage Yield (APY): Some liquidity pools within the Momentum liquidity campaign are offering an astounding APY of up to 155%. This exceptional return potential is a major draw for investors seeking to grow their portfolios. Double Point Rewards: Beyond the attractive APY, participants also benefit from double point rewards, further enhancing the value proposition. Diverse Asset Support: Users can provide liquidity using popular assets such as SUI, BTC, and various stablecoins, catering to different risk appetites and investment strategies. Such high yields, especially on established assets like BTC and stablecoins, are rare and signal a strong commitment from Momentum and BeadlePad to attract and reward liquidity providers. Momentum’s Strategic Power in the Sui Ecosystem Momentum is not a newcomer; it is recognized as the largest ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub within the rapidly growing Sui ecosystem. But what does ‘ve(3,3)’ mean? It refers to a governance model where users lock their tokens to gain voting power, which they can then use to direct emissions (rewards) to specific liquidity pools. This mechanism often leads to deeper liquidity and better trading prices, creating a virtuous cycle for the platform and its users. By positioning itself as a central hub, Momentum plays a critical role in fostering a robust and liquid DeFi environment on Sui. The collaboration with BeadlePad for the HODL Yield Momentum liquidity campaign further solidifies its position, demonstrating its ability to forge strategic partnerships that benefit the wider community and drive significant capital inflows. Ready to Dive In? Maximizing Your Returns with the Momentum Liquidity Campaign For those looking to participate, the process generally involves depositing your chosen assets into the designated liquidity pools on the Momentum platform. However, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of providing liquidity. Actionable Insight: Carefully select pools that align with your risk tolerance. While stablecoin pools generally carry lower impermanent loss risk, pairs involving volatile assets like SUI or BTC might experience fluctuations. Benefit: The dual incentive of high APY and double points makes this a compelling opportunity for both short-term yield generation and long-term ecosystem participation. The success of the initial hour of the Momentum liquidity campaign clearly demonstrates the market’s appetite for well-structured and rewarding DeFi initiatives. This campaign is not just about earning yield; it’s about actively contributing to and benefiting from the growth of the Sui ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Era for Sui DeFi The rapid accumulation of over $30 million in deposits within an hour for the HODL Yield campaign is a powerful testament to Momentum’s influence and the potential of the Sui ecosystem. This Momentum liquidity campaign offers an exceptional opportunity for users to earn substantial yields, up to 155% APY, while supporting the liquidity infrastructure of a promising blockchain. It underscores the innovative spirit within DeFi and highlights how strategic partnerships can unlock massive value for participants. Don’t miss out on this chance to be part of a thriving decentralized finance movement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Momentum liquidity campaign? The Momentum liquidity campaign is a joint initiative by Momentum and BeadlePad, designed to incentivize users to provide liquidity for SUI, BTC, and stablecoins on the Momentum DEX, offering high APY and double point rewards. Which assets can I deposit into the campaign? Users can provide liquidity with SUI, BTC, and various stablecoins during the campaign period. What are the potential APY returns?

The campaign runs from 2:30 a.m. UTC on September 26 to 2:00 a.m. UTC on October 19. What is a ve(3,3) DEX? A ve(3,3) DEX is a decentralized exchange that utilizes a ‘vote-escrowed’ governance model.

While still above the BOJ’s 2% target, the pullback has spurred yen weakness and sharpened focus on the US CPI report later in the day. Tokyo’s inflation figures are often seen as a preview of nationwide trends. Friday’s numbers signaled a slowdown in underlying price growth, potentially making it harder for the Bank of Japan to justify more rate hikes. Nonetheless, the unchanging main gauge shows the data’s sensitivity to government measures, reinforcing why the BOJ is unlikely to base its rate decisions on just one data release. Yoshiki Shinke, senior executive economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute, even commented, “With today’s Tokyo data not showing much change other than the special one-off factors, I don’t think this will prevent the BOJ from mulling a rate hike. This won’t push the BOJ, but it won’t make them hesitate either, as factors are clear.” Rice prices dropped to 46.8% from 67.9% in August Energy prices were a key driver of September’s inflation , with the impact amplified by a smaller drag from government utility subsidies compared with last year. Subsidies cut 0.5% from overall inflation in September 2024, versus 0.3% this year, creating a base effect that led to the first annual rise in energy costs in three months. The broader free daycare program, introduced this month, also trimmed 0.3% from inflation, and water prices also slipped, dragging the index lower. Shinke remarked, “The expanded free daycare was the factor that brought the Tokyo CPI much lower than market consensus. The daycare fees offset a boost from base effects from last year’s utility subsidies. Other than that, there was little surprise.” The annual rise in rice prices also eased to 46.8% from 67.9% in August, extending a five-month streak of deceleration. More moderation is anticipated, though households may not feel much relief yet. Japan’s central bank maintained rates at 0.5% Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stepped down this month after suffering multiple election setbacks that cost him party backing. Much of the discontent stemmed from the ongoing cost-of-living squeeze. The race to head the Liberal Democratic Party has drawn five candidates, all of whom have vowed to address household cost pressures. The leadership election will be held on Oct. 4. Meanwhile, Japan’s central bank decided to keep rates steady at 0.5% on Friday, as markets had predicted. However, Friday’s decision wasn’t unanimous: board members Naoki Tamura and Hajime Takata opposed holding rates steady. The dissent spurred markets to see around a 50% probability of a rate change at the Oct. 30 meeting, more than double previous expectations. Former BOJ board member Makoto Sakurai said the bank can hike rates when it sees fit, with inflation still rising. He added, however, that the timing will depend on how carefully officials want to review the economic fallout from US tariffs. Tokyo’s housing market is still heating up, with prices in the city’s 23 central wards surging. Tokyo Kantei data shows that the average price of a second-hand family condo jumped 38% in August from a year earlier to ¥107 million ($719,680).

He explained that this outcome is possible due to significant movements in both major cryptocurrencies and smaller-cap tokens. According to the analyst, the data from recent months shows clear opportunities that many participants could have taken advantage of if they focused on technical analysis rather than promotional narratives. Theres absolutely NO reason to NOT be FINANCIALLY FREE this cycle! 1. $BTC & $XRP reached ATH 2. Shitcoins 4x-33x w/in months (TP were posted for EVERYONE, but exact levels posted on Patreon/Discord) UNLESS you been following Moonboy Influencers HYPE ignoring TA/CHARTS … — JD (@jaydee_757) September 24, 2025 Key Market Developments The analyst emphasized two notable points. First, he pointed out that both Bitcoin and XRP reached their all-time highs this cycle. These levels are important milestones that confirm the broader market’s strength and the return of substantial investor activity . He indicated that such milestones typically create favorable conditions not only for established assets but also for the wider digital asset market. Second, he noted that a selection of smaller-cap cryptocurrencies achieved returns ranging from four times to as high as thirty-three times their initial value within only a few months. These movements underline the rapid growth potential that exists in the altcoin sector when conditions are favorable. By bringing attention to both major and minor assets, the analyst presented a picture of a market that has delivered meaningful opportunities across different categories of tokens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Guidance and Trade Targets JD also addressed how he provided direction during these movements. He stated that take-profit targets were made publicly available for all followers. At the same time, the analyst mentioned that more specific levels were shared through his Patreon and Discord communities. The analyst concluded by contrasting disciplined strategies with the behavior of those who rely on influencer-driven content. He stated that many traders miss opportunities when they choose to follow hype rather than charts and technical signals. In his view, ignoring technical analysis in favor of unverified promotional narratives has been a key reason why some participants failed to leverage the profitable moves witnessed in recent months. The analyst’s remarks underscore the importance of structured market analysis. Technical analysis offers clear signals and entry and exit levels, while hype-driven approaches are unpredictable and often expose traders to unnecessary risk. He implied that those who remained committed to chart-based strategies were better positioned to benefit during this cycle.

The complaint was submitted on Wednesday in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Elon Musk-led artificial intelligence company alleges that OpenAI unlawfully targeted former xAI employees, including engineers Xuechen Li and Jimmy Fraiture, along with a redacted former senior executive, believed to be former CFO Mike Liberatore. xAI: OpenAI recruited former employees to extract information According to the filing, OpenAI was trying to access Grok’s source code, internal business strategies, and data center operations through a “deeply troubling pattern” of recruiting its former employees “OpenAI is targeting those individuals with knowledge of xAI’s key technologies and business plans, including xAI’s source code and its operational advantages in launching data centers, then inducing those employees to breach their confidentiality and other obligations to xAI through unlawful means,” the complaint stated. The defendant company’s spokesperson has called the lawsuit “the latest chapter in Mr. Musk’s ongoing harassment” and denied any wrongdoing. In the last 2 years, there has been a long-running feud between Elon Musk and OpenAI’s leadership, Sam Altman. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI before leaving the company in 2018, has tried to convince the courts to shut down CEO Altman’s decision to change the organization’s business model from a nonprofit into a for-profit business. xAI propounded that OpenAI had violated both federal and California state law by inducing former employees to share confidential information. The complaint identified Li, Fraiture, and a senior finance executive as examples of staff recruited by OpenAI to obtain access to xAI’s trade secrets, allegedly. “By hook or by crook, OpenAI clearly will do anything when threatened by a better innovator, including plundering and misappropriating the technical advancements, source code, and business plans of xAI,” the complaint read. Musk goes after OpenAI, Apple over leaked emails The case also included communications between Musk’s legal team and former xAI executives. A screenshot of an email from Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, sent in July, accused a former executive of breaching confidentiality obligations, who replied with a short email saying, “suck my dick.” “We sent them many warning letters, but they continued to cheat. Lawsuit was the only option after exhausting all others,” CEO Musk wrote on X Thursday. A little over a month ago, the Grok developer slapped Apple with a separate lawsuit, lodged in the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. It accused Apple of manipulating its App Store rankings to favor OpenAI’s ChatGPT while suppressing rivals like Grok. “Apple has joined forces with the company that most benefits from inhibiting competition and innovation in AI: OpenAI, a monopolist in the market for generative AI chatbots,” the filing said. Musk had threatened to sue Apple directly earlier in the month, claiming the company had committed “an unequivocal antitrust violation” for effectively making it impossible for competing AI applications to top App Store rankings. Apple is the gateway to the Internet for half of America. They are making it impossible for any other AI company to succeed by relentlessly promoting OpenAI in every way possible! https://t.co/p6WdOLuzO5 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 12, 2025 Apple denied the claims, saying its App Store operations were “fair and free of bias.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, responded to Musk’s accusations in a statement posted earlier this month. “This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like,” Altman wrote. xAI mulls expansion into government contracts Elsewhere, through a statement on X published Thursday evening, xAI announced it was launching “xAI For Government,” a program designed to give federal agencies access to its Frontier AI models. According to the public notice, every federal department and agency will be able to use Grok 4 and Grok 4 Fast for a fee of $0.42 per department for 18 months. The initiative also includes hiring and assigning teams of Grok engineers to help agencies integrate and maximize the models’ capabilities. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This significant acquisition, reported by Lookonchain, involved 60,333 ETH through over-the-counter (OTC) trades with major players like Wintermute and Coinbase. While such a massive purchase often signals strong conviction, the address currently shows an unrealized loss of $16 million, adding a layer of mystery to this high-stakes play. Unpacking the Mysterious Ethereum Whale Accumulation This recent acquisition by an anonymous Ethereum whale represents one of the largest individual ETH purchases in recent times. The whale executed these trades over a week, choosing OTC desks rather than public exchanges. OTC trades are often preferred by institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals for several reasons: Price Stability: Large orders on public exchanges can significantly impact market prices, leading to slippage. OTC desks facilitate trades directly, minimizing this effect. Privacy: These transactions are less visible to the broader market, allowing buyers and sellers to move large volumes without immediate public scrutiny. Liquidity: OTC desks can handle massive volumes that might overwhelm regular exchange order books. Wintermute and Coinbase, both prominent entities in the crypto space, served as the intermediaries for these substantial transactions. This highlights their role in facilitating large-scale institutional or private capital movements within the Ethereum ecosystem. Decoding the Whale’s Strategy: What Drives Such a Bold ETH Play? The fact that this particular Ethereum whale is currently sitting on an unrealized loss of $16 million raises questions about their immediate strategy. Why would an entity purchase such a large amount of ETH only to see its value dip shortly after? One common perspective is that whales often operate with a long-term investment horizon. Short-term price fluctuations might be less concerning if the investor believes in Ethereum’s fundamental value and future growth. This accumulation could be part of a broader strategy to build a substantial position ahead of anticipated future price appreciation, perhaps driven by: Upcoming Ethereum Upgrades: Continued development and upgrades to the Ethereum network, such as improvements in scalability and efficiency, could be a key factor. Growing DeFi and NFT Ecosystems: Ethereum remains the backbone for a vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects. Institutional Adoption: Increasing interest from traditional financial institutions in Ethereum as a digital asset. However, it also underscores the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Even the most sophisticated players can face immediate paper losses, demonstrating that timing the market perfectly is a challenge for everyone. The Market Impact of a Major Ethereum Whale When an Ethereum whale makes such a significant move, it naturally draws attention and can influence market sentiment. While the immediate effect of OTC trades is limited due to their private nature, the sheer volume of 60,333 ETH entering a single address is noteworthy. It signals strong conviction from a deep-pocketed investor, which can sometimes inspire confidence among smaller investors. Conversely, if the whale were to begin selling off such a large holding, it could potentially exert downward pressure on ETH prices. This dynamic highlights the significant influence that large individual holders can wield in the relatively less liquid cryptocurrency markets compared to traditional finance. Tracking these anonymous addresses, often dubbed “whales,” provides valuable insights into potential market trends and sentiment. While the identity of this particular whale remains shrouded in mystery, their actions offer a fascinating glimpse into high-stakes crypto investment strategies. Navigating Volatility: What Does This Mean for ETH Investors? For everyday investors, the actions of an Ethereum whale like this serve as a powerful reminder of several key aspects of the crypto market: Market Volatility is Real: Even large, well-funded players can experience immediate unrealized losses. This emphasizes the importance of risk management and investing only what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Vision: Whale accumulations often suggest a belief in long-term value, encouraging a similar mindset for retail investors rather than chasing short-term gains. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While whale movements can be indicative, they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Thorough personal research into Ethereum’s fundamentals, technology, and ecosystem is crucial. This whale’s move could be a strategic accumulation phase, anticipating future growth. However, it’s also a testament to the unpredictable nature of asset prices, even for those with substantial capital. In conclusion, the mysterious accumulation of $240 million in ETH by an anonymous Ethereum whale is a captivating development in the crypto space. Despite an initial unrealized loss, this substantial investment through OTC desks points towards a strategic, long-term conviction in Ethereum’s future. It serves as a compelling example of the bold moves that define the cryptocurrency market and reminds all investors of the importance of strategic planning and understanding market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale? A1: An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH), typically enough to influence market prices or sentiment with their trades. Q2: Why do whales use OTC trades instead of exchanges? A2: Whales use over-the-counter (OTC) trades to execute large orders without causing significant price fluctuations on public exchanges, maintain privacy, and access deep liquidity. Q3: What does “unrealized loss” mean in this context? A3: An unrealized loss means the current market value of an asset is lower than its purchase price, but the loss has not yet been “realized” because the asset has not been sold. Q4: How do whale movements impact the crypto market? A4: Whale movements can impact market sentiment and prices. Large accumulations can signal confidence, while significant sales can create downward pressure, especially in less liquid markets. Q5: Should I base my investment decisions on whale activity? A5: While whale activity can offer insights, it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) and consider your personal financial goals and risk tolerance.

On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) inaugurated an international operations centre for its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan (e-CNY) in Shanghai, according to a report from the South China Morning Post. PBOC Deputy Governor, Lu Lei, framed the move as part of a “historical inevitability” in payments innovation, with the aim of offering a more efficient, inclusive, and open global cross-border payment system. The initiative is intended to enhance settlement efficiency, and serve as building blocks toward a broader framework for e-CNY integration. China's CBDC push comes in the wake of the country pulling the brakes on tokenization efforts.

The blue-chip universe that XRP (XRP) occupies is an ongoing discussion on regulatory clarity, cross-border payments, and centralized exchange liquidity. However, a recent wave of sub $0.50 tokens continues to emerge. Market data indicates a handful of ecosystem-rich, community-valuable, and scaling tokens are good candidates to multiply over the next few years. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Tron (TRX), and Hedera (HBAR) are three that rally with XRP and test $5 before 2027. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): $0.0022 Trading while in Stage 13 of its presale, LILPEPE is priced at $0.0022. $25,964,729 has been raised with a goal of $28,775,000, and over 15.9 billion tokens have been sold. Investor traction indicates a high conviction in LILPEPE’s plan to become the world’s first meme-centric Layer 2 blockchain. Little Pepe’s infrastructure is differentiated by the fact that it isn’t a meme coin. The team’s infrastructure is built around ultra-low fees, fast finality, and sniper-bot resistance. The ecosystem plan includes a dedicated memes launchpad, a hub for creators and community-owned projects. With 0% tax, a staking rewards pool, and deep liquidity allocations, LILPEPE may offer both stability and scalability uncommon in meme-based assets. Community engagement is further fueled by the Little Pepe Mega Giveaway, running across Stages 12–17. With 68,700 entries and 105 days left, top buyers will share over 15 ETH in rewards. The biggest investor may secure 5 ETH, while 15 random buyers could each win 0.5 ETH. In parallel, the project has already been listed on CoinMarketCap, with commitments to debut on two leading centralized exchanges at launch and long-term ambitions to target the world’s largest platform. If meme culture continues to blend with DeFi innovation, market indicators suggest that Little Pepe could evolve into a top-performing ecosystem by 2027. Tron (TRX): $0.3447 Tron (TRX) has quietly maintained its relevance through scalability and adoption in decentralized entertainment and payments. Trading at $0.3447, TRX processes millions of daily transactions, supported by its robust ecosystem of stablecoins and DeFi applications. Tron’s appeal lies in its low transaction costs and high throughput, which continue to attract developers building consumer-focused dApps. The integration of USDT on Tron’s network has also driven liquidity, making it one of the most used blockchains for payments. Although regulatory pressures may pose challenges, the consistent on-chain volume suggests TRX could benefit if digital assets gain broader adoption. Historical performance suggests that projects that sustain utility while keeping fees minimal often exhibit long-term appreciation. Hedera (HBAR) – $0.2466 At its current market price of $0.2466, Hedera (HBAR) serves as a business-focused blockchain alternative. Hedera’s hashgraph consensus produces fast transaction speeds, low energy consumption, and gas fees that are stable in price. A governing council oversees Hedera, comprising companies such as Google, IBM, and Boeing, which lends the project credibility and potentially a more secure blockchain for real-world tokenization efforts. HBAR’s supply chain, tokenized carbon credits, and digital identity use cases could potentially play into blockchain adoption among institutions. Hedera continues to see an increasing number of partnerships being announced, which could lead to an increase in volume as more entities seek scalable and eco-friendly infrastructure. Should more global enterprises adopt distributed ledger technology, Hedera could maintain relevance deep into the next bull cycle due to its unique form of governance. Final Thought As XRP continues to absorb investor focus as the regulatory situation clarifies, sub-$0.50 tokens like Little Pepe (LILPEPE), Tron (TRX), and Hedera (HBAR) may present some of the biggest upside crypto assets to go up significantly in price before 2027. Research indicates that these projects possess ideal combinations of scalability, ecosystem activity, and community strength. However, in the case of Little Pepe, the project has a Layer 2 chain with an exclusive focus on memes. This added to Little Pepe’s community incentivization, such as the Mega Giveaway, may make its meme-based blockchain a unique hedge for investors.

This discussion pivots around these under-the-radar tokens, their ecosystems, and their potential to mimic or surpass the investment trajectory of well-known cryptocurrencies such as XRP. The Case for Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Stirring interest in the crypto community, LILPEPE stands out with its unique position as a meme-centric Layer 2 blockchain solution. Currently in Stage 13 of its presale at $0.0022, it has already garnered $25,964,729 towards a goal of $28,775,000. The infrastructure of Little Pepe dismisses typical meme coin characteristics, focusing instead on ultra-low fees, fast transaction finality, and resistance to sniper bots. The project's emphasis on community engagement through events like the Little Pepe Mega Giveaway, which offers significant ETH rewards to top buyers, adds to its allure. The development team has ambitious plans for listings on major exchanges, indicating a robust growth trajectory. Tron (TRX) - A Staple in Decentralized Solutions Trading at $0.3447, Tron continues to secure its position in the crypto space through its scalable network designed for decentralized applications focused on entertainment and payments. With a high transaction volume and integration of stablecoins like USDT, TRX presents a compelling case for sustained relevance and potential price increases, given its utility and minimal transaction fees. Hedera (HBAR) - Pioneering Business Applications Hedera distinguishes itself with a price point of $0.2466 and a business-oriented approach. Leveraging hashgraph consensus technology, Hedera offers rapid transactions, low energy consumption, and predictable gas fees. Governed by a council that includes industry giants like Google and IBM, Hedera's use cases in supply chains, carbon credit tokenizations, and digital identity are positioned to catalyze broader institutional adoption. Final Analysis As XRP garners mainstream attention and possibly gains regulatory clarity, emerging tokens like Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , TRX, and HBAR are poised to captivate the market's interest. Their unique propositions in technology and market engagement position them as potential dark horses capable of reaching or even surpassing the $5 mark by 2027.

Four tokens under $1 are drawing serious attention for their growth potential in 2025. Little Pepe (LILPEPE), TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) all offer different paths to profit. These four may answer those wondering if $500 could become far larger. And while each has strong points, Little Pepe could deliver the sharpest 12x upside, giving investors a chance to ride early momentum before it becomes mainstream. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The New Meme Leader with Utility At the time of writing, Little Pepe's presale price is $0.0022 during stage 13. Early investors from stage 1 are already up by 120% and current buyers still have a 36.36% potential gain before the listing price of $0.003. The project has raised $25.9 million with more than 15.9 billion tokens sold, proving demand is not slowing down. What makes Little Pepe stand out is not just its meme energy but the real infrastructure behind it. Built on a next-generation Layer 2 network with zero tax on transactions, it blends fun with functionality. It has been audited by CertiK, giving it a security seal, and is already listed on CoinMarketCap, which signals credibility. The team has introduced a $777k giveaway plus a Mega Giveaway rewarding top presale buyers from stage 12 to stage 17 with over 15 ETH in prizes. Community is a big part of the project’s DNA; online energy reflects that. From June to August, LILPEPE peaked in question volume on ChatGPT 5, surpassing Dogecoin, SHIB, and PEPE. That is no small deal in a world where online trends shape financial outcomes. If adoption continues as expected, Little Pepe could be the under $1 token that delivers 12x returns by the end of 2025. Tron (TRX) – The Utility Powerhouse At the time of writing, TRON is trading around $0.35. It has carved out a massive role in stablecoin transactions, particularly USDT, which flows heavily through the TRON network. Its ecosystem is practical, widely used, and quietly building momentum. While a 12x jump would take TRX near $4.20, which is ambitious given its current market cap, the strength of its utility cannot be ignored. Stablecoin settlement volumes are critical to crypto adoption, and TRON is in the middle. Investors looking for steady exposure to one of the most used blockchains may find TRON an interesting part of a diversified $500 bet. Cardano (ADA) – The Smart Contract Visionary At the time of writing, Cardano is trading around $0.92. It has seen accumulation in the $0.85 to $0.95 range, with whales building positions ahead of a potential breakout. ADA’s appeal is its slow but deliberate development of innovative contract features, staking, and scalability upgrades. For ADA to deliver 12x gains, it would need to hit around $11, which would mean a massive surge in adoption and use cases. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Community Titan At the time of writing, Dogecoin trades around $0.28. What continues to drive DOGE is its meme status and the constant reinforcement from the community and culture. Recently, U.S. markets saw ETFs offering exposure to DOGE, which adds legitimacy and may attract institutional buyers. A 12x rise would push DOGE toward $3.36, which feels like a stretch but not entirely out of reach if sentiment explodes in another wave of meme mania. Final Thoughts Crypto is unpredictable, but that is also where opportunity hides. TRON offers utility, ADA delivers long-term vision, and DOGE thrives on community. Yet it is Little Pepe that feels like the breakout contender. With a current presale price of $0.0022, 120% gains already achieved by early investors, and still 36.36% upside before its launch, it stands out as the under $1 token with the strongest shot at 12x growth in 2025. For those ready to take a chance with $500, spreading across these four could work, but anchoring around LILPEPE might just turn today’s small bet into tomorrow’s big win.

Among the many contenders, four cryptocurrencies priced under $1— Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , TRON (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE)—are generating exceptional interest due to their potential for considerable gains. Emerging Crypto: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Starting with Little Pepe, a token that has successfully blended meme culture with tangible utility, it stands out for its notable presale achievements and promising infrastructure. Currently priced at $0.0022 in its 13th presale stage, this token has already secured a 120% increase for early investors, signaling strong future potential. Its advanced technology on a Layer 2 network and zero tax on transactions further position it as a significant contender for exponential growth. Moreover, the project's emphasis on community engagement is evident from its extensive promotional activities, including a $777k giveaway and a substantial Mega Giveaway for presale participants, which can be viewed in more detail alongside the corresponding image of the giveaway. TRON (TRX) - A Stable Force in Crypto Transactions TRON, trading at about $0.35, is a key player in the stablecoin ecosystem, primarily with USDT transactions. Its growing utility across its network demonstrates its potential to make strides in market value, positioning it as a steady investment for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Innovative Pioneering with Cardano (ADA) Cardano, typically found at around $0.92, is progressively enhancing its system with smart contracts and scalability solutions. These advancements are crucial as they could propel ADA to new heights, making it an interesting choice for investors focused on technological innovation in the blockchain space. Dogecoin (DOGE) - The People's Crypto The meme-infused Dogecoin continues to ride waves of community support and cultural relevance, priced at about $0.28. Its robust community engagement and the new investment avenues like ETFs suggest potential for a significant price surge encouraged by widespread adoption and market sentiment. Concluding Insights While the crypto world remains full of unpredictabilities, these four tokens demonstrate distinct pathways towards potentially lucrative outcomes. Especially, Little Pepe emerges as a standout with its vibrant community backing and a solid technological foundation, making it a significant investment consideration for those looking at high returns by 2025.

Ohio To Accept Payments In Bitcoin According to a recent official announcement , the Ohio Board of Deposit has selected a vendor to enable the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments – including BTC – for state fees and services. It is worth highlighting that Ohio’s move to legitimize crypto payments follows a proposal that was passed by the board in May 2025, which designated cryptocurrencies as an authorized financial transaction device. Commenting on the development, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said that the Ohio Board of Deposit’s decision to accept crypto payments will aid Ohio in maintaining its position as a leading state for business. LaRose added: There’s a reason why we now rank among the top five states in the nation to do business. It’s because we’re not afraid to embrace the tools, trends and technologies that incentivize job creators to come here. My office processes hundreds of thousands of financial transactions each year, and we’ve heard a growing demand for a cryptocurrency payment option. I’m excited and ready to be the first to provide it to our customers. With this development, Ohio has become the fourth US state to go ahead with allowing payments in digital assets for government services. Other states that offer similar facilities are Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana. To recall, in April 2025, Colorado became the first US state to accept tax payments in cryptocurrencies. At the time, the state’s Governor, Jared Polis, remarked that Colorado residents can use PayPal’s Cryptocurrency Hub to pay taxes with crypto. Similarly, Utah’s Senate passed House Bill 230 earlier this year to establish several custody protections for the state’s crypto miners. Among other things, the Bill provides the right to mine Bitcoin, run a node, develop software, and participate in staking without regulatory overreach. Are State BTC Reserves Next? While Ohio has become the latest state to accept cryptocurrencies for government fees and services, there are several other states currently in contention to create their own strategic Bitcoin reserves. The following chart shows the current status of strategic Bitcoin reserve plans across different states in the US. Currently, only Texas , Arizona, and New Hampshire have approved state-level strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation. On the contrary, states like Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming have rejected the proposal of having a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, 16 states are still in the proposed stage. At press time, BTC trades at $111,121, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Frank LaRose|Ohio|Strategic Bitcoin Reserve|USA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-26 06:00:18

XRP’s liveliness metric recently hit a two-month low, signaling that long-term holders are keeping their coins off exchanges rather than selling. This dormancy reflects strong confidence in XRP’s future, and historically, such periods of low liveliness have often preceded bullish price movements, making it a key indicator for potential upward momentum. The Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (LTH NUPL) indicates that major XRP holders are sitting on minimal unrealized gains, giving them little reason to sell. This metric, a key measure of holder conviction, suggests that despite market weakness, LTHs remain steadfast, a strong signal that XRP could be poised for a rebound. Together, these metrics highlight XRP’s on-chain resilience, with long-term holders providing a stabilizing force amid short-term volatility. Their steadfast positions often signal accumulation phases, which historically precede significant price rallies, positioning XRP for a potential upward move amid intensified accumulation at the $2.70-$3.0 range. XRP Technical Analysis: Bearish Pressure Intensifies XRP is showing signs of increasing bearish momentum as recent price action indicates a potential continuation of the downtrend. Technical indicators on the 2-hour chart highlight growing selling pressure, signaling caution for traders and investors. Chart Overview The Ichimoku Cloud , a widely respected trend-following indicator, has turned bearish for XRP. The price has decisively moved below the cloud, which historically signals weakness and a higher probability of further declines. This breakdown indicates that XRP has lost key support levels, confirming that sellers are currently in control. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending downward, reflecting waning buying momentum. An RSI moving lower suggests that bullish interest is fading, and bears may continue to exert influence on the market. The combination of a bearish Ichimoku Cloud and a declining RSI creates a technical backdrop for potential additional downside pressure. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.76, representing a 3.1% drop in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data . Conclusion XRP’s on-chain metrics reveal a resilient long-term holder base that could underpin a bullish reversal. With low liveliness and minimal selling pressure from major stakeholders, the cryptocurrency shows signs of strategic accumulation and market confidence despite currently facing significant bearish pressure.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-26 06:04:50

The model in question revealed that Bitcoin follows M2 changes with a delay of approximately 12 weeks and predicted that if this correlation continues, BTC could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. However, Pal argued that this relationship broke down starting July 16th. While global M2 continued to expand, Bitcoin traded sideways throughout the summer. According to Pal, this was not due to the model's obsolescence, but rather to the liquidity tightening measures implemented by the US Treasury Department through the Treasury General Account (TGA). Related News: Surprise Altcoin Launches Major Buyback Program - Sets Date for Radical Update The NPL is the US government's main operating account at the Federal Reserve, where tax revenues, bond sales, and other cash flows are collected and used to cover federal spending. Pal noted that the Treasury has refilled the NPL by issuing approximately $500 billion worth of bonds since July, bringing the balance to a multi-year high of approximately $800 billion. This liquidity drain has depressed cryptocurrencies the most among risk assets. Pal predicts that the TGA has now strengthened sufficiently that the liquidity drawdown will be completely over by the end of the month. He argues that Bitcoin could re-enter its M2-driven upward trajectory once market conditions return to normal. *This is not investment advice.

This expiry event is a big one because it is the end of the month and the end of the third quarter, so there could be some volatility on spot markets, which have tanked this week. More uncertainty from the US Federal Reserve has rattled markets as high-risk assets become less appealing, deepening the September correction. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.76, meaning that there are more long contracts expiring than shorts, as the asset continues to retreat. Max pain is around $110,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has reached $2.7 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There is also around $2.2 billion OI at $120,000, but $95,000 is a popular strike price for short sellers with $1.9 billion in OI. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is around $60 billion, which is close to record highs. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $80 billion, which is still close to peak levels, according to Coinglass. Options Expiry Alert At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $22.3B in crypto options expire on Deribit; one of the biggest quarter-end expiries. $BTC : Notional: $17.06B | Put/Call: 0.76 | Max Pain: $110K $ETH : Notional: $5.20B | Put/Call: 0.80 | Max Pain: $3,800 Q3’s largest… pic.twitter.com/FDT1tWomYH — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) September 25, 2025 Following the market slump earlier this week, “implied volatility (IV) for major terms showed little change, but skew significantly shifted toward puts, with put premiums substantially exceeding call premiums,” said derivatives provider Greeks Live. “This indicates a sharp increase in the options market’s expectation of downside risk.” In addition to today’s bumper batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 1.3 million Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $5.3 billion, max pain at $3,800, and a put/call ratio of 0.80. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $18 billion, reports Coinglass. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $22.4 billion. Crypto Market Correction Deepens Crypto markets have continued their downward slide all week, with total capitalization falling to a four-week low of $3.84 trillion by Friday morning. Bitcoin fell below $109,000 in late trading on Thursday, losing support at the $112,000 zone. The asset is now 12% down from its peak and poised for further losses as the ‘Septembear’ correction appears to be deepening. Ethereum is even weaker, slumping to $3,830 before recovering to $3,950 on Friday morning in Asia. ETH is now 20% down from its all-time high.
