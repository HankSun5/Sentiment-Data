According to CNBC, Warren Buffett, who led the merger that created the food giant in 2015, said on Tuesday that he’s “disappointed” in the breakup. He also said the merger itself was “not a brilliant idea” and that splitting Kraft Heinz apart won’t fix the real issues. The new move divides Kraft Heinz into two separate businesses. One now handles sauces, spreads, and shelf-stable meals. The other is left with U.S. household brands like Kraft Singles, Lunchables, and Oscar Mayer. The announcement was made early Tuesday, and Warren’s comments came later that day in an interview with Becky Quick. Shares dropped more than 7% after his interview aired. Berkshire stays put as Kraft Heinz breaks apart Warren has kept Berkshire Hathaway’s 27.5% stake untouched since the merger. The company hasn’t trimmed or added to the position at all since teaming up with 3G Capital a decade ago to form Kraft Heinz. But now, with 3G already out, having quietly exited in 2023, Warren and his incoming successor, Greg Abel, are left holding the investment solo. Abel, who will take over from Warren at the end of this year, has also expressed his disappointment in how Kraft Heinz is being handled. Since the merger, Kraft Heinz has lost serious ground. Its shares have collapsed nearly 70% since 2015, shrinking its market value to just $33 billion. The decline came after U.S. sales dropped and consumer behavior changed. Shoppers started avoiding processed foods, opting instead for fresh items around the outer edges of grocery stores. The brands under Kraft Heinz, despite being household names like Velveeta and Oscar Mayer, started to lose relevance. Analysts blame some of the collapse on 3G Capital’s aggressive cost-cutting, which prevented the company from investing in its brands at the time they needed it most. Kraft Heinz ended up selling off big pieces of its portfolio, including its Planters nuts and parts of its cheese business. At the same time, it tried to revive a few brands like Capri Sun and Lunchables by investing more heavily in them. Back in May, executives at Kraft Heinz admitted they were thinking about strategic changes and even possible deals. This split is the result of that process. The company didn’t say if more breakups or asset sales are coming, but it’s clear the structure from 2015 isn’t working anymore. Despite the mess, Warren hasn’t walked away. He told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway will do whatever is best for the firm. He also made one thing clear: if anyone comes forward to buy their stake, Berkshire won’t accept a private block deal unless every other shareholder is offered the same exact terms. That means no backroom discounts or side deals. Warren also admitted during a rough quarter back in 2019 that Berkshire “overpaid” for Kraft. Still, unlike other investors who bailed out years ago, he hasn’t sold. Whether that patience pays off after this new split remains to be seen. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Its Hydra upgrade and steady improvements have made it one of the most respected blockchains. But as markets gear up for the next cycle, many traders see ADA as slow-moving compared to other projects. Analysts suggest that while ADA could climb in 2025, bigger returns may come from alternatives such as Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), and the meme-fueled newcomer Layer Brett (LBRETT). Hedera (HBAR) and real-world adoption Hedera has been marketed less as a retail coin and more as an enterprise solution. Its hashgraph consensus allows for high throughput, low cost, and strong security. Instead of promising ideas on paper, Hedera has already signed major companies as governing council members. Brands in tech, telecom, and finance are helping shape the network, a sign of real-world interest. Developers are turning to Hedera for tokenization, payment rails, and supply chain tracking. Cardano also pushes innovation but takes a more academic route. For investors, the contrast is clear: ADA has credibility in theory, while HBAR is gaining credibility through use cases. If enterprise blockchain adoption grows, Hedera could easily outpace ADA’s growth rate. Stellar (XLM) and global payments Stellar was designed with a simple purpose: to make moving money across borders faster and cheaper. With financial institutions, fintech firms, and even central banks testing its rails, XLM continues to build relevance in payments. Its low-cost transactions and partnership activity make it a candidate to benefit from the rise of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Cardano has leaned on a vision of slow but steady upgrades. Stellar, by comparison, has aimed straight at the money-transfer industry. This clear focus on payments has given XLM a path to adoption that ADA doesn’t directly address. If blockchain-powered remittances expand in 2025, Stellar could see the kind of growth that makes it one of the top alternatives to Cardano. Layer Brett (LBRETT) and speculative momentum Then there’s Layer Brett , the newcomer drawing buzz. Unlike most meme coins, it isn’t built on hype alone. It runs on Ethereum Layer 2, giving it fast speeds, low fees, and the ability to connect with Ethereum dApps. This makes it practical for actual use while still carrying the viral appeal of a meme token. The presale has caught fire, thanks in part to staking rewards reported in the thousands of percent APY. That has pulled in both small buyers and early whales. A clear roadmap adds to the interest: NFT tie-ins, gamified staking, and plans for cross-chain features. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is locked in, giving traders another reason to stay interested. Compared to ADA, which is already a large-cap coin, Layer Brett starts from a tiny market base. Even moderate demand could produce outsized multiples. Analysts speculate that if momentum continues, it could rival past meme coin stories, with returns far beyond what ADA might deliver. Final thoughts Cardano remains a cornerstone project, respected for its security and research-driven approach. But in 2025, alternatives may offer more upside. Hedera could capture enterprise clients. Stellar is pushing into global payments. And Layer Brett brings meme energy backed by real infrastructure. For investors, it comes down to risk preference. ADA looks set for steady gains, but those chasing bigger multiples may find opportunities in HBAR, XLM, or LBRETT. Each offers a different path, and together they highlight where capital may flow as the next cycle takes shape.

The first investors will receive a guaranteed minimum return of 300% when MUTM token goes live. The project has already raised over $15.25 million and over 15,950 investors on board. As traders look forward to a potentially bullish Q4, Mutuum Finance stands out as a next-generation decentralised finance (DeFi) protocol that is building a real-world use case and ecosystem all in one. Shiba Inu Resist Market Volatility The current market price of SHIB is close to $0.00001245 with a slight negative weekly impact of 6-7%. Despite this impact on the sentiments in the meme coin world, the SHIB ecosystem is continuing to grow through projects such as token burning and Shibarium. At the same time, DeFi projects related to utilities such as Mutuum Finance are gaining more and more attention from investors. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at presale Stage 6 for $0.035 per token. Cost will go up 14.29% to $0.04 in next phase. With more than 15,950 investors involved and having successfully raised over $15.25 million, the presale is off to an incredible start, and enjoys significant confidence from early adopters. USDT Stablecoin on Ether Mutuum Finance will release an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum The stablecoin is intended for daily use, for decentralised applications and for long-term portfolio stability, increasing usability and trust in the platform. Dual-Lending: DeFi Infrastructure Future-Proof Mutuum Finance is a dual-lending protocol that may be run with automation and user interaction for maximum efficiency. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending smart contracts dynamically change their interest rates (in real time) based on market supply and demand using self-executing smart contracts. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending: This form of lending allows lenders and borrowers to transact directly, eliminating intermediaries and offering more flexibility and transparency. This dual approach positions Mutuum Finance as a secure, future-resistant infrastructure that ensures financial inclusion, high returns, and opportunities for both retail and institutional investors. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability forms the foundation for a sustainable and expansion-ready DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Protocol Overview Mutuum’s dynamic interest rate another smart contract solution for liquidity management. Borrow rates are determined by utilisation, with low rates providing incentives to borrow (and enhance capital efficiency) when capital is plentiful, and higher rates (with accompanying deposit incentives) promoting repayment and drawing deposits during times of scarcity. Stable rates can be used for resource borrowers who are looking for predictability. These fees will usually be higher than variable ones but can be tweaked if the market conditions change to a drastic extent. Only sufficiently liquid assets can be used as collateral to obtain stable-rate borrowing. The protocol promotes a strong risk management based on parameterised assets. Borrowers must over-collateralize and liquidators are rewarded for smoothing under-collateralized loans. Secondary markets enforce limits, including restrictions such as collateral requirements (expressed in terms of high-risk tokens), deposit and borrow constraints to limit exposure to volatile or illiquid asset classes. Improved Borrowing Capacity: Correlated assets predict even greater borrowing capacity, and LTVs limit borrowing based on collateral themselves. Liquidation thresholds and penalties are necessary to keep the protocol solvent and reserve factors are there to generate some interest (so it doesn’t default and causes market extreme conditions). Price discovery is based on solid oracle infrastructure. Permissions data stream will provide reliable pricing for USD and native assets like, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX on a chainlink data feed. Aggregated feeds, oracle standards/fallbacks, and on-chain DEX metrics serve to further sanitise, ensuring valuations are reliable and arrive in a prompt and accurate fashion for downstream collateral management & liquidation operations. Stability and Security Measures Mutuum Finance has established an official Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward pool, rating vulnerabilities as critical, major, minor, and low in severity. The project is also running a $100,000 community giveaway , where 10 investors will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. While SHIB struggles near $0.00001245, Mutuum Finance is attracting significant attention from early adopters. The project is already taking the lead as the next big player in the crypto market.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $111,170 (+2%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $111,564 24-hour low $109,147 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 111,170 Price Prediction $ 117,109 (+6.56%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.01% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 116,091 200-Day SMA $ 95,954 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces bullish surge above $111K Resistance for BTC is at $113,624 Support for BTC/USD is at $107,078 The BTC price analysis for 2 September confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price moves above $111K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bullish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces a move above $111K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bullish pressure as it hovers above $111K. Currently, the market is facing buying domination around resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.41 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $111,391, surging by over 2% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 45.98, hinting that a correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $112K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.84, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $113,624, it will fuel a bullish rally to $121,729. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,078, beginning a bearish trend to $99,908. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as buyers pushed the price above Fib levels. The recent lows triggered strong accumulation. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Metaplanet announced that it purchased 1,009 BTC, worth around $112 million. Its total holdings reached 20,000 BTC, making the company the sixth largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin price prediction September 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $125,000, making August its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction September 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-02 22:00:00
51092254,572057,1756850402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51092254.jpeg,Here’s How Much The TRUMP Meme Coin Will Be With The Market Cap Of Dogecoin,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-with-doge-market-cap/,"The Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin stormed into the crypto scene in January 2025 with a rally that pushed its price from below $1 to a $73.43 peak in a matter of days. This rally placed it among the top twenty digital assets, but today, it is trading far below those heights. Nonetheless, Official Trump is still one of the biggest n ames among meme coins, and investors are still looking towards another rally. A way to measure the potential rally is by asking what would happen if TRUMP reached the same market capitalization as Dogecoin, the leading meme coin. What If TRUMP Reached Dogecoin’s Market Cap? At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading at $8.41, down by 7.2% in the past 24 hours but up by 1.4% in a seven-day timeframe. The meme coin has a market cap of about $1.683 billion. Dogecoin, the most established meme coin and the benchmark of the category, is currently valued at $0.2135 per token, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The leading meme coin has a market cap of about $31.85 billion. When comparing the two side by side, TRUMP’s market cap is just a fraction of Dogecoin’s size. According to calculations from the MarketCapOf tool, TRUMP’s current market value is only about 0.05× that of Dogecoin. Therefore, if TRUMP were to achieve the same market capitalization as the current price of Dogecoin, its price would have to climb to about $160.99 per token, which would represent a 19.21x increase from where it stands today. Dogecoin’s All-Time High The comparison is even more different when considering Dogecoin’s all-time high. At its all-time high of $0.7316 in May 2021, Dogecoin’s market capitalization reached roughly $88.79 billion on the back of the meme coin mania at the time. If TRUMP were ever to match that market cap high, its price would need to increase to about $444.23 per token. That would equate to an extraordinary 53.01x increase from its current price. However, these calculations only take into account the current circulating supply of these cryptocurrencies. TRUMP currently has a circulating supply of 199,999,973 tokens out of a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. Dogecoin, on the other hand, currently has a circulating supply of 150.748 billion tokens with an uncapped maximum supply. TRUMP has arguably had the best meme coin performance this cycle. Its astonishing run in January was reminiscent of similar meme coin rallies in 2021, which the market has been missing this cycle. After its launch on January 17, 2025, the TRUMP meme coin’s value soared by over 300% in under a day, reaching approximately $64 per token on the same day. By January 19, the meme coin had reached a peak of $73.43.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Marketcapof|Trump,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 22:00:02

Analysts say the cryptocurrency’s recent rally is largely driven by Binance whales. Ethereum Rally Driven By Large-Scale Binance Orders According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, Ethereum whales are now dominating order flows on the Binance exchange. The analyst highlighted the average ETH order size on the platform as evidence. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Stays Strong As Exchange Reserves Keep Falling – Details Crazzyblockk shared the following chart showing different phases of average ETH order size on Binance. Retail-driven phases, highlighted in red, dominated much of 2023–24, when small orders drove up ETH’s price but left it vulnerable to corrections. These retail-driven periods were followed by neutral phases, shown in gray, which reflected indecision among ETH investors. This phase was characterized by fragmented participation and sideways trading behavior. Fast-forward to mid-2025, whale orders – highlighted in green – are firmly in control. Average order sizes have now surged past $3,000 per trade, signaling accumulation by institutional and large-scale investors. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that this whale dominance reflects renewed institutional confidence in ETH, aligning with its rapid price appreciation in recent months. Larger average orders suggest fewer fragmented trades and stronger directional conviction. Binance was chosen for the analysis not only as the world’s largest exchange but also because it is the “epicenter of ETH capital flow.” Crazzyblockk concluded: ETH’s latest rally isn’t just retail speculation – it’s being powered by whales on Binance. With large-scale players setting the tone, Ethereum’s market structure looks increasingly robust, and Binance remains the hub where these decisive flows shape price performance. Is ETH Getting Ready For A Rally? While Bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled 4.1% over the past 30 days, ETH is up 23.4% in the same period, indicating that large-scale investors may be in the middle of capital rotation from BTC to ETH over the past month. Related Reading: Ethereum Will ‘Likely 100x From Here,’ Says Joe Lubin Analysts predict ETH may have further room to grow for the remainder of 2025. Ethereum contracts are seeing a sharp resurgence in 2025, setting the stage for a potential rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $5,000 towards the end of the year. Ethereum fundamentals are also strengthening, with as much as 36 million ETH staked on the blockchain, raising the possibility of a supply crunch. That said, despite whale accumulation, some analysts caution that ETH could dip to $4,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,316, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours.

With Bitcoin consolidating around key levels, attention is shifting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns before the next big pump. Analysts say a handful of tokens are attracting both retail and institutional demand, and for good reason. One of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a hot topic after its presale nearly sold out, reminding investors of the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin when those who moved quickly saw exponential gains. XRP Eyes a Return to Strength Ripple’s XRP remains a favorite for investors betting on utility and adoption. Its cross-border payment network continues to expand, with growing partnerships in Asia and the Middle East. After recent price pressure, traders are watching whether XRP can reclaim momentum, with forecasts suggesting it could push toward new yearly highs if the market turns risk-on. Solana’s Speed Still a Major Draw Solana (SOL) has recovered from multiple setbacks, proving its resilience in the competitive Layer-1 space. With transaction speeds that rival traditional financial systems and a growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL is seen as one of the strongest contenders for long-term growth. If institutional flows extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana could be one of the top beneficiaries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Heating Up While established names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building one of the strongest early-stage communities of 2025. Its presale is moving at record speed, with allocations vanishing quickly as whales and retail buyers compete for a spot. Analysts point out that early investors could see as much as 40x returns if MAGACOIN FINANCE mirrors past breakout performances from other meme-powered projects. With a countdown now live and the presale almost sold out, this could be one of the last chances to enter before the next pump phase begins. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Gains Serious Traction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quickly become a favorite in the decentralized trading space. With near-zero fees and growing daily volumes, the project is winning over traders who demand performance and scalability. As its ecosystem develops, many see HYPE as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the market today. Dogecoin Refuses to Fade Despite new meme coins popping up every week, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to command loyalty. Its massive community, strong branding, and new use cases in payments keep it relevant. DOGE has historically surprised skeptics, and if history repeats itself, another major rally could be around the corner. Cardano Pushes Toward Long-Term Adoption Cardano (ADA) has taken a slower but steady path, focusing on peer-reviewed development and scalability. With Hydra scaling technology rolling out, ADA is preparing to handle thousands of transactions per second. This foundation could power new adoption in DeFi, identity solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. Analysts suggest ADA could benefit from the next wave of institutional attention, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion As Bitcoin holds its ground, the real action could soon shift to altcoins. XRP and Solana are positioning for institutional inflows, Dogecoin and HYPE keep expanding their reach, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting records with its fast-selling presale. With the countdown nearly finished, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity may not want to wait much longer.

Solana (SOL) whales are not only fueling Solana’s own rally but also rotating into Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) , signaling a broader appetite for high-utility altcoins ahead of October. Alongside Ethereum (ETH) and XRP , a new player, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is capturing attention as investors look for early-stage opportunities with breakout potential. Together, these five tokens stand out as the top altcoins to watch into October . Solana Whales Drive Market Rotation Despite a surge to $215, Solana has seen 2 million SOL ($432M) deposited onto exchanges in just three days, creating caution about sell pressure. Still, whales remain active, and analysts point to critical levels: Support: $200, aligned with the on-chain MVRV mean. Next Resistance: $280, marked by the +0.5σ MVRV band. Upside Potential: Sustained whale demand could lift Solana toward $300 and beyond . The fact that whales are also loading up on AVAX and DOT suggests Solana whales are positioning broadly across Layer-1 ecosystems. Avalanche (AVAX) Gains Momentum With Government Adoption Avalanche posted 66% transaction growth in a week , surpassing 11.9 million transactions across 181,300 active addresses. Government Catalyst: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced it will publish GDP data directly on Avalanche, among other blockchains — a historic step for decentralized data. ETF Progress: Grayscale has updated its filing for an AVAX spot ETF , potentially unlocking new institutional inflows. These developments are driving renewed demand, with AVAX trading around $23.64 and investors eyeing further growth as adoption widens. Polkadot (DOT) Gains ETF Tailwinds Polkadot (DOT) has joined the growing list of tokens with ETF applications. Grayscale filed registration statements for both DOT and ADA trusts, signaling institutional interest is spreading beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ticker Plans: DOT would list on Nasdaq as a single-asset ETF. Market Impact: ETF filings validate DOT’s role as a next-gen blockchain for cross-chain applications and scalability. As whales rotate into DOT, the token could benefit from heightened visibility and new flows from traditional finance. Ethereum (ETH) Remains a Whale Favorite Whales continue to rotate billions from Bitcoin into Ethereum. $2.59B Rotation: A single whale shifted BTC into a $2.2B ETH spot and a $577M perpetual long. $456M Purchases: Nine addresses added hundreds of millions more. Validator Concerns: Over 1M ETH ($5B) is queued for withdrawal, but institutional inflows are absorbing supply. Trading near $4,300 , ETH remains a top pick among whales betting on DeFi and enterprise adoption. XRP Eyes ETF-Driven Breakthrough XRP is riding speculation that an XRP ETF could attract $5B in inflows during its first month if approved. Price: Currently trading near $3.00. Impact: ETF approval would bring hedge funds, pensions, and sovereign investors into XRP. Outlook: Analysts see potential for XRP to push into double-digit territory. Institutional adoption could cement XRP’s role as a utility-driven digital asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Emerging Altcoin to Watch Whales are now quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE as its transparent team and audited contracts give confidence. With limited tokens available in its early-access stage and significant upside, early investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to get in before it gets listed by exchanges. XRP and Solana investors are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE’s breakout, seeking early exposure before wider adoption, exchange listings, and institutional attention ignite massive growth potential. As whales diversify into Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot, smaller but promising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the surprise outperformers in October . Analysts now expect 51x gains in the coming months of 2025. Final Thoughts Whales are reshaping the altcoin landscape by driving liquidity not just into Solana, but also into Avalanche and Polkadot. Alongside Ethereum’s continued dominance and XRP’s ETF-driven momentum, these tokens represent the top five altcoins to watch as October approaches. But the story isn’t only about large caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a unique early-stage opportunity with strong community backing and growing utility — making it a wildcard that could join the ranks of the top-performing altcoins in the next cycle.

According to the analysis, a large portion of the supply of many popular altcoins is held by just the top 10 wallets. According to the data, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the highest centralization rate. The top 10 wallets control 62.3% of SHIB's total supply, followed by Uniswap (UNI) with 52.2% and Ethereum (ETH) with 51.0%. The situation for other prominent altcoins is as follows: Tether (USDT): 40.5% Pepe (PEPE): 39.4% Chainlink (LINK): 31.5% Dai (DAI): 31.0% USD Coin (USDC): 28.6% Related News: Another Altcoin Launches Token Sale Project for Companies in the US and China Santiment stated that this data has revived discussions about “centralization,” particularly for investors. The intense dominance of large wallets over supply is considered a risk factor, as it could lead to sharper price fluctuations. It's also noteworthy that three of the seven altcoins on the list are stablecoins. However, it's important to note that the list only includes altcoins from the Ethereum ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

According to CoinMarketCap , the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X . The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy , shared earlier in June, that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multi-year reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The Foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making it the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. Tuesday’s announcement comes as ETH price has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high in late August at $4,866.

European Union regulators have postponed the antitrust fine that was expected to be imposed on Alphabet’s Google due to concerns about the United States’ tariff actions. The European Union’s fine against Alphabet’s Google has been delayed Three sources reported that the European Commission , which is responsible for antitrust enforcement, has chosen not to move forward with its penalty against Google. The Commission has decided to stay the fine while waiting on the United States to follow through on its promised reduction of tariffs on European cars. Car duties have been one of the most debated issues in the trade talks between the two sides. Brussels has so far been pushing for the duties to be eased in exchange for concessions on industrial goods. Just last week, the Commission proposed eliminating tariffs on imported U.S. industrial goods. It now expects Washington to announce a cut in tariffs on European cars, reducing duties from 27.5% to 15%. The timing of the delayed fine has raised questions about whether the EU’s competition enforcement is being used as a bargaining chip in economic talks. According to one of the sources , the postponement is not expected to exceed a month. The three sources named the EU’s Trade Commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, who reportedly sought clarifications on the antitrust decision taken by EU competition chief Teresa Ribera, as a factor in the delay. The postponement was announced days after Google was told to expect the fine announcement on Monday. Independence of enforcement The potential link between the EU’s antitrust enforcement to trade talks with the United States has drawn criticism. Germany’s Monopolies Commission, an independent advisory body, stated that the delay sets a worrying precedent. Tomaso Duso, the chairman of the Commission, warned against letting the protection of competition become a “pawn of the Trump administration” in a statement. President Donald Trump has previously threatened retaliation against European authorities if they move too aggressively against American tech companies. The Commission’s decision to delay the fine is being viewed by some analysts as a strategic step to avoid triggering tensions during sensitive trade negotiations. People familiar with the matter also said the fine would be modest compared with earlier penalties levied on the company. The European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podesta told reporters at a daily briefing that the Google investigation is still ongoing and declined to provide further details. Google itself also hasn’t commented on the matter. The fine is a result of a four-year investigation into Google’s advertising technology practices, which started after a complaint from the European Publishers Council. Google has been accused of unfairly favoring its own services over those of rivals in the online advertising market. The eventual decision of the U.S. government concerning the duties on the automotive sector is important as the sector employs millions across the bloc and is central to the economies of Germany, France, and Italy. The fine against Google is symbolically important, but it does not carry the same economic weight as the duties. It is expected that once trade talks are concluded, the Commission will proceed with its decision. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Bitcoin has managed a modest 1.5% gain in the past 24 hours, yet other major tokens have either slipped or failed to move today. However, there are some very good trading opportunities in the market, including several presale and new tokens that could rally very strongly in the coming weeks. These are Maxi Doge, PEPENODE and Wall Street Pepe, which are among the best meme coins to buy now, and we’ll explain why in this article. Best Meme Coins to Buy Now Under $1 Maxi Doge (MAXI) Updating the Dogecoin template with a new, hyper-bullish attitude, Maxi Doge (MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme token that has raised $1.7 million in its presale. This is a hugely encouraging number, especially given that Maxi Doge opened its presale only a few weeks ago. Caffeine in the veins, $MAXI in the wallet. pic.twitter.com/WMBH0v5SSa — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) September 1, 2025 It suggests that the token is quickly attracting new investors and supporters, something we also see from its follower count on X , which recently rose above 10,000. The reason for Maxi Doge’s growing popularity is that it has taken the whole meme token paradigm to a new level. It’s doing this in two ways, with the first being that it’s building an online community focused on trading. To this end, its Telegram and Discord channels will host regular trading competitions, inviting community members to outperform each other and post the biggest returns. Winners of these contests will earn prizes, something which will encourage greater encouragement with Maxi Doge and its ecosystem. Secondly, Maxi Doge extends the meme coin formula via its use of a Maxi Fund, which will equal 25% of its max supply (150.24 billion MAXI). It will use this fund to finance new partnerships and ad campaigns, which together will raise awareness of the project and help attract new investment. Holders of MAXI will also be able to stake the token, earning staking yields on top of any price appreciation. Investors can buy it now by going to its official website , where MAXI currently costs $0.000255. Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE (PEPENODE) One of the newest meme tokens in the market, PEPENODE (PEPENODE) is a ‘mine-to-earn’ coin that opened its presale at the beginning of last month. It has already raised just over $500,000, with the ‘mine-to-earn’ meme coin turning heads by virtue of its unique approach to staking. Instead of offering an entirely passive system, PEPENODE is gamifying staking, enabling holders to participate in a mining game whereby they building virtual mining nodes and facilities. The idea is to encourage engagement, with users who participate more fully in PEPENODE’s gamified staking system receiving greater staking rewards. Other interesting features include tiered node incentives, in that the earliest adopters receive the most powerful virtual mining rigs, thereby enabling them to receive more staking rewards. There’s also a referral system, whereby community members can earn greater rewards by recruiting more users. This all has the potential to make PEPENODE one of the most profitable new projects for investors. They can get in early by going to the official PEPENODE website and joining its presale. PEPENODE is currently available at a price of $0.0010407, but this will rise in just under three days. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Having had one of the biggest presales of 2024, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is in the process of undergoing a major revamp. Launching on Solana You can buy early Every dollar buy on $SOL = burns $WEPE on ETH Once ETH $WEPE hits $0.001 → $SOL Peg goes 1:1 Sol buy = Eth burn New site, new plans, the Solana expansion begins pic.twitter.com/c3GBYJZliX — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) August 19, 2025 Namely, it will be launching a Solana-based version of its WEPE coin, having already launched its Ethereum-based version after the closure of its presale last year. The idea is to take advantage of Solana’s superior scalability, with the coin inviting holders of its ERC-20 token to replace their holdings with Solana-based equivalents. In fact, its protocol will burn Ethereum-based WEPE at a 1:1 ratio whenever investors buy the new Solana-based version, ensuring a stable supply of the coin. More generally, Wall Street Pepe is another trading-focused meme coin that has built a community of cryptocurrency traders, who share tips and strategies on the coin’s channels. Yet Wall Street Pepe’s platform also provides trading signals and insights, helping community members to stay ahead of the market. It has grown considerably since its launch late last year, with its X account now having more than 67,000 followers. The Ethereum-based WEPE token has risen by 275% since late May, with its current price of $0.00005602 also representing a 14% gain in a fortnight. Such momentum is why WEPE is one of the best meme coins to buy at the moment, and the launch of its Solana version should only help its cause. Investors can buy the Solana-based WEPE at the Wall Street Pepe website for a price of $0.001.

The plunge came during a brutal four-day losing streak, cutting Nvidia’s market value by more than $340 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. That dip happened as investors started walking away from big AI names, and Nvidia is right at the center of that exit. The company’s four-day decline now totals over 7%, and this comes right after it delivered a soft revenue forecast last week, raising fresh doubts about how fast the AI boom is actually growing. Even with the sharp selloff, Nvidia’s still up 78% from its April low, holding on to a $4.1 trillion market cap, still ahead of Microsoft, which sits at $3.72 trillion. But that’s not helping calm nerves. Traders now worry the hype has peaked at least for now. Traders eye $160 as next key level for Nvidia Buff Dormeier, the chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners, said Tuesday’s close below the 50-day average is a clear sign things are slowing down. “This shows how the momentum has broken down, and it makes me concerned about the stock over the short term,” Buff said . He’s now watching $160 as the next support, and if that fails, it’s $145, the same level where Nvidia bounced back in June. “If it breaks under $145, I’d be really concerned about its prospects,” Buff added. The selloff didn’t just hit Nvidia. The entire equity market came under pressure, with investors worrying about global tension and bloated tech valuations. That combination made it easier for fund managers to rotate out of high-flying AI stocks. Nvidia was a natural target. Despite recent gains, the stock has gone nearly vertical this year, making it vulnerable to even the slightest negative trigger. And that trigger came fast. Last week’s earnings guidance didn’t deliver the confidence Wall Street was hoping for. Analysts didn’t panic, but the tone definitely changed. Many are still forecasting over 25% upside based on average price targets, but no one’s pretending like the next leg up is guaranteed. As Buff put it, “There’s still long-term opportunity, but it seems like it has peaked for the short or intermediate term.” China builds its own AI chips as Nvidia faces pressure from both sides While Nvidia struggles to hold investor trust amid the rapidly growing AI market, China is pushing hard on its AI Plus plan, which will supposedly embed artificial intelligence across nearly every industry by 2030. This is backed by massive investment into homegrown chips, high-bandwidth memory, and a nationwide supercomputing buildout. Leading that effort is Cambricon, a local chipmaker that’s calling itself China’s Nvidia alternative, but Beijing doesn’t need Cambricon’s Siyuan chips to beat Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra. What it wants is “good enough” tech that can support the country’s AI ambitions without relying on U.S. suppliers. The country’s political class isn’t chasing performance. It wants control. And Cambricon gives it just that. That puts Nvidia in a nasty spot. The company is caught between Washington’s export restrictions and China’s push for chip independence. Trying to keep both sides happy is backfiring. Nvidia’s now serving two masters and satisfying neither, a problem that’s only going to get harder as the tech war and geopolitical pressure continue.

Data revealed that just 1,127 NFTs were recorded on August 1, 2025. This figure is the lowest in the network’s history. Ethereum NFT Collapses In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant noted that this sharp decline demonstrated how far the sector has fallen since the 2021-2022 boom, when NFTs dominated headlines and trading volumes soared. Even as crypto markets showed signs of recovery in 2024 and 2025, NFTs remained unable to capture the same momentum. Analysts attribute the collapse to several factors, such as fading investor enthusiasm, an oversupply of low-quality collections, and a decisive liquidity shift toward newer narratives such as Layer 2 DeFi innovations and real-world asset tokenization. Ethereum is long considered the central hub for NFTs. Hence, the consequence of this historic low could be significant, which could affect not only Ethereum’s fee generation but also the sustainability of NFT marketplaces and the outlook for long-term holders. The bleak August figures follow a surprisingly positive July. NFT July Resurgence DappRadar had recently revealed that NFT activity levels surpassed DeFi in July for the first time in months. Trading volume within the sector jumped 96%, and climbed to $530 million, although the total number of sales slipped by 4% to 5 million. Interestingly, the average price of an NFT increased significantly, more than doubling from $52 in June to $105 in July, as demand for established, high-value collections intensified. On Ethereum, Blur accounted for as much as 80% of daily trading activity during the same period, owing to professional traders and lending services through its Blend platform. On the other hand, OpenSea strengthened its position as the go-to platform for broader participation, as it averaged 27,000 daily traders and maintained strong cross-chain support. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, Base has also emerged as one of the hottest ecosystems for NFTs since its launch two years ago. Since January, Base NFTs have amassed $122 million in trading volume across 6.7 million sales.

Both agencies have had tensions in the past, primarily due to overlapping jurisdictions and opposing regulatory approaches, particularly where cryptocurrencies are concerned. Regulators encourage more crypto listing markets The SEC and CFTC shared their proposed collaboration on Tuesday in a joint statement released via official channels. The effort is to be carried out in furtherance of the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint. It was reportedly facilitated by the President’s Working Group, which urged both agencies to coordinate oversight in order to promote regulatory clarity and keep blockchain innovation within the United States. As part of this mandate, the SEC and CFTC divisions plan to issue guidance on the listing of leveraged, margined or financed spot retail commodity transactions involving digital assets. According to the joint statement, the divisions will collaborate to provide regulatory clarity while reducing jurisdictional overlap. The statement pointed out that the current law allows SEC- or CFTC-registered exchanges to facilitate the trading of certain spot crypto asset products, and invited market participants to engage directly with staff via filings, registrations or requests for relief. The coordination is founded on prior guidance, including the SEC’s digital asset framework and the CFTC’s market advisories. However, it differs in that it focuses on the harmonization of regulatory approaches rather than enforcement actions alone. In the statement, the clearing and settlement, market surveillance, and public dissemination of trading data as priorities for joint attention was also highlighted. This plan to work together is proof that the agencies are now ready to provide clearer compliance pathways. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said: “Market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets.” CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham said: “Under the prior administration, our agencies sent mixed signals about regulation and compliance in digital asset markets, but the message was clear: innovation was not welcome. That chapter is over.” The announcement has triggered euphoria on social media as crypto natives expect further clarity and increased adoption as a result of the collaboration. CFTC will allow spot crypto contracts on federally regulated exchanges The joint statement from the SEC and CFTC comes weeks after it revealed a program that would let established exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which are CFTC-registered Designated Contract Markets, to list and trade spot contracts for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. 🚨 The NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE, CME, etc, will soon have spot trading for BTC, ETH, and more. https://t.co/qZo3YsYDQA — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) September 2, 2025 Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, commented on the statement, highlighting that “the NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE, CME, etc, will soon have spot trading for BTC, ETH, and more.” By settling in the actual token rather than cash and reflecting the current price of the underlying cryptocurrency asset, these contracts have the potential to improve market integrity and price transparency. These established exchanges listing crypto would also signal mainstream acceptance of crypto. They are venues known to be highly regulated and trusted by institutional and retail investors, which means BTC, ETH, and other assets will be more accessible to traditional investors who may have been hesitant to engage with crypto-specific platforms like Coinbase or Binance.

With Wall Street recognition, real-world use, and better approval odds, experts believe the XRP ETF could be one of the most successful crypto ETF launches yet. Expert Expectations Rise For XRP ETF Launch Canary Capital has shared some of the boldest expectations for the XRP product. Steven McClurg, a leading executive at the firm, states that XRP is now the second-most recognized cryptocurrency on Wall Street, after Bitcoin. The Wall Street status is essential because institutional investors would often prefer assets with which they are already familiar and have a clear understanding. McClurg, the CEO of Canary Capital, predicts that XRP ETFs could generate $5 billion in inflows within the first 30 days. That is more than the $3.26 billion Bitcoin ETFs got in their first month. It is also much stronger than Ethereum ETFs, which had a very weak start. McClurg says this shows the trust and interest that professional investors already have in XRP. The strength of XRP in the EFT market, he explains, comes from its real-world utility. Financial institutions and banks have utilized the digital asset for a long time to transfer money across countries faster and at lower costs. In this context, he notes that XRP differs from many digital assets that serve solely speculative purposes. Because the token already integrates into parts of the existing payment system, experts argue that investors will view it as a more reliable option for long-term exposure, backed by an ETF. Expert Points To Catalysts For XRP ETF Success Another reason the expert is hopeful is the strong XRP community, also known as the “XRP Army.” This community could generate substantial trading volumes immediately after launch. Its strength may also protect the ETF from problems that other products have faced. For example, Ethereum ETFs had a very tough start in July 2024. They lost $483 million in the first month alone. Significant withdrawals from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust exacerbated the problem, and investor confidence declined. The Canary CEO believes that the XRP ETF will perform better due to its real-world utility, rather than speculation . Regulation is also moving in a positive direction . The chances of approval for the XRP ETF have gone up from 86% to 87%. While it may not seem like a significant leap, experts believe it is still progress and anticipate that more assets, such as Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin, could receive ETF approval by the end of 2025. Futures-based XRP products already exist, which makes it easier for regulators to approve a spot ETF . With strong community support and rising approval chances, the XRP ETF could outperform earlier crypto ETF products.",XRP|XRP ETF|XRP ETFs|XRP experts|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 23:00:10

After years of uncertainty, sentiment around adoption and real-world payments is improving. The core question for traders and long-term holders is simple: can XRP finally make a run to 10 dollars in 2025? While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to pull most of the institutional flow, some investors are diversifying beyond the leaders. That’s why early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting attention as potential high-upside complements to a portfolio built around top assets. Why XRP Could Target $10 The path to double digits needs three things to line up: stronger liquidity, rising utility in payment corridors, and a supportive macro environment. If capital keeps rotating from majors into high-cap altcoins, XRP could benefit from deeper order books and tighter spreads, which historically supports larger price moves. More banks and fintechs testing tokenization and instant settlement can also lift on-chain activity, a key signal for sustained rallies. What must go right First, momentum from Bitcoin staying strong above six figures tends to expand risk appetite for altcoins. Second, steady growth in cross-border volume would reinforce XRP’s use case and help market price in future demand. Third, cleaner global rules around digital assets would encourage bigger participants to step in, improving liquidity and helping price discovery. The Rising Crypto Star In the middle of all this market action, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by early adopters as a high-potential bet. Presale allocations have been moving quickly, with growing wallet participation and a community focused on long-term utility, not just hype. The appeal is straightforward: limited early access , ongoing development, and a push to reward holders as the ecosystem expands. For investors building a barbell strategy – established large caps on one side, carefully chosen early-stage tokens on the other – MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched as a possible breakout . XRP Price Scenarios for 2025 Bullish case: a strong altcoin season, rising payment volumes, and improved exchange liquidity could create the conditions for a breakout toward $10. This would likely need persistent weekly closes at higher highs, consistent volume expansion, and supportive macro headlines. Base case: if adoption and liquidity improve at a steady pace but the market rotates more slowly, XRP could grind into the $6 to $8 range, setting the stage for a later attempt at double digits. Bearish case: if Bitcoin dominance stays elevated or macro risk flares up, XRP might top out between $3 and $5 and wait for a better window. Sharp pullbacks are common in bull markets, so managing entries and avoiding heavy leverage near resistance becomes important. Conclusion A run to $10 is not guaranteed, but for the first time in years the setup looks achievable if utility, liquidity, and market conditions align. For investors who want both stability and shot-at-moon potential, combining a core position in large caps like XRP with a selective early-stage pick such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is one way to play 2025’s bull market.

Analyst Outlines Potential For Explosive Growth,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/wlfi-the-next-cult-coin-analyst-outlines-potential-for-explosive-growth/,"The recent debut of the World Liberty Financial token (WLFI) in the cryptocurrency market has generated considerable buzz, despite facing notable price retracements within just 24 hours of trading. Despite WLFI’s 25% price retrace in the 24-hour time frame, one market analyst believes that the cryptocurrency has the potential to emerge as this year’s “cult coin,” with significant price potential for the remainder of the bull cycle. Could WLFI Soar 330% In 2025? In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), analyst Virtual Bacon drew comparisons to previously called cult coins, such as XRP in 2017 and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2021, suggesting that WLFI could follow a similar price trajectory in 2025. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Could Start On September 13, Analyst Predicts The circulating supply of WLFI currently stands at 24.6 billion tokens, with approximately 6.9% actively tradable. A key point raised by Bacon is the transparent unlock schedule for various stakeholder tokens. While 20% of the supply is designated for public sale investors and 2.8% is allocated for liquidity and exchanges, the team and investor tokens remain locked. This contrasts with the circumstances surrounding other tokens which experienced a dramatic crash due to a high fully diluted valuation (FDV) and a limited float. Bacon argues that WLFI’s model is healthier, featuring a fair distribution of liquidity across exchanges and gradual unlocks that mitigate the risks associated with sudden price drops. Notably, the analyst’s price target for WLFI is set at $1, which he believes would bring the token’s fully diluted valuation to $100 billion and its market cap to $24.6 billion. As of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.23. That potential scenario could mean a 330% price increase. That could also propel the token toward 11th place among the top cryptocurrencies, positioning it alongside Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA). Catalysts That Could Drive Token Growth And Market Surge Virtual Bacon also addressed comparisons to the TRUMP memecoin launched earlier this year, acknowledging that while WLFI may eventually face an 80% drop like many altcoins, it is fundamentally different. Unlike TRUMP, which experienced a rapid ascent beyond $70 before entering a major downtrend, the analyst notes that WLFI boasts “real integrations,” ties to US Treasuries, and institutional backing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Historical Pullback Ranges – Healthy Correction Or Trouble Ahead? Virtual Bacon identified key catalysts that could drive WLFI’s growth. These include the development of a retail app for and payment solutions, a lending and borrowing platform, and the anticipation of a social media post from President Donald Trump regarding WLFI, which could significantly boost its visibility and market activity. The analyst also mentioned that interest in the recently launched cryptocurrency has outperformed that of major altcoins, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), which he believes indicates a potential cult following that could drive liquidity. Ultimately, Virtual Bacon argues that WLFI’s fair tokenomics, transparent supply structure, strong institutional support, and growing retail momentum position it favorably for the future and strong performance in the upcoming months.

ETF decisions and technical setups suggest upside may still be on the table. Yet as XRP gears up for its next move, a rising star called MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention, positioning it as one of the most exciting altcoin stories for 2025. XRP Bullish Breakout Targets $5.50 The latest XRP price analysis today points toward a short-term rally in the $4.30–$4.50 range, triggered by a completed cup-and-handle pattern above $3.20. If ETF approval aligns with this setup, analysts expect XRP to ride that momentum higher. A mid-cycle push toward $5.00 becomes increasingly possible with the launch of the leveraged ProShares Ultra XRP ETF. In this case, institutional inflows could act as the spark that transforms the XRP price forecast 2025 into a sustained bull run. From there, the XRP bullish breakout target remains $5.50, with RippleNet adoption and liquid staking support forming the backbone of this projection. For long-term traders, this level is not just psychological—it aligns with the expected benefits of XRP ETF momentum as multiple SEC decisions approach. Grayscale XRP ETF decision: October 18, 2025 21Shares XRP ETF decision: October 19, 2025 Bitwise XRP ETF decision: October 20, 2025 These back-to-back rulings could confirm whether XRP joins the list of the best altcoins with ETF potential , a category investors increasingly track as part of their XRP investment forecast strategies. MAGACOIN FINANCE Targets Major ROI in 2025 While the focus has been on Ripple ETF speculation, traders are also shifting attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has set ambitious projections, with analysts targeting a 1200% ROI . Retail excitement is snowballing, with FOMO levels pushing demand higher week after week. In terms of positioning, MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform many rivals in the crypto ETF momentum 2025 narrative. While XRP has the ETF-driven setup, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers that under-the-radar opportunity that many see as a chance to catch an early wave. For investors asking, “Can XRP reach $5.50 with ETF momentum?” the answer may still be yes—but a portion of capital is now flowing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, where traders see asymmetric upside. The Bigger Market Outlook Ahead The XRP market outlook remains strong with $5.50 on the horizon, but it is not the only token riding the ETF narrative. The push for approvals has expanded across multiple assets, making XRP bullish prediction compared to other ETF-linked cryptos a central debate in the altcoin space. As for XRP price prediction with ETF-driven growth , the technical path looks favorable, with retail and institutional demand aligning. Still, investors searching for explosive growth are finding MAGACOIN FINANCE hard to ignore.

51095852,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81439,1756855938,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Sends September Warning to XRP Holders. Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/expert-sends-september-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-what-to-expect/,"Crypto Jack (@That_CryptoNerd), a crypto enthusiast and multi-millionaire, has issued a cautionary note for crypto investors looking to engage with the market this month. He warned of persistent bearish conditions, suggesting that XRP could decline toward $2. His comment follows a sharp pullback in late August that continued into the start of September , reinforcing concerns that the token might not be immune to broader market weakness this month. The community has often observed September as a difficult period for digital assets, and XRP appears to be following that pattern once again. Market volatility in recent weeks has placed additional pressure on the asset, and some traders are preparing for further downside before any recovery takes place. SEPTEMBER WARNING Expecting bearish markets, $XRP to dip to $2.00~ After that, alt season kicks off in Q4. What is your plan? — Crypto Jack (@That_CryptoNerd) September 1, 2025 Possibility of a Strong Q4 Despite the warning for September, Crypto Jack also expressed optimism for later in the year. Altcoin markets tend to recover strongly toward the end of the year, and suggest that the fourth quarter could mark the start of renewed growth. XRP experienced a major surge in late 2024, rising over 500% between November 2024 and January 2025. One of the major contributors to that surge was the highly anticipated Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts , as the market expects a cut on September 17 . If the Fed cuts rates, it could set the stage for renewed momentum in XRP during Q4. Lower interest rates generally drive investors toward risk assets, and digital currencies often benefit from the resulting liquidity shift. Given that XRP’s last significant rally was closely tied to a similar policy move, many in the market believe another cut could trigger renewed inflows and support a strong Q4 performance, especially if altcoin season materializes . Community Responses The post generated a range of reactions from the XRP community. One user dismissed the $2 outlook, arguing that the asset would hold closer to $1.3 or $1.5 instead, and expressed frustration at repeated predictions of steep drops. He also called XRP a scam and stated that the community would have to wait four years, tying XRP’s performance to the post-halving bullish cycle. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member took a different perspective, noting that while September has historically been a bearish month, last year’s performance suggested the pattern may be changing. Data from CryptoRank shows that XRP has closed September on a positive note every year since 2022. With interest rate cuts on the horizon, the asset could maintain this streak in 2025.

The price of Solana is still close to $200, but technical resistance could stop it from going up any more. SUI crypto is having a hard time with supply unlock pressure, even though the ecosystem is growing. Analysts say that in this situation, the new project Remittix (RTX ) is stealing the show and is the best altcoin to buy right now because it is being used in the real world and has huge upside potential. The price of Solana stays at $200, but there are still risks The price of Solana is currently holding steady between $198 and $200, which is in the middle of a rising channel that has been guiding gains since spring. Last week, buyers defended the $190–$195 zone. On-chain data showed that $86.9 million worth of coins left exchanges, which meant that people were buying more coins. The recent launch of stablecoin USD1 on Solana could make liquidity even better and increase DeFi activity. But technicals say to be careful. If this area isn’t cleared, the price could go back down to $185 or even $195. A daily close above $202 to $205 would give bulls back control and set targets at $212 to $222. Analysts say that the Solana price is still good for the next few months, but if momentum doesn’t pick up, the price could be very volatile in September, which could test investors’ patience. SUI Crypto Faces Supply Pressure Amid Growth After a year of ups and downs, SUI crypto is now trading near $3.27. It went up to over $5 before going back down. Monthly token unlocks are still a big deal because they add new supply and often cause short-term sell-offs. For example, in August 2025, a planned release caused the token to drop sharply, showing how easily SUI crypto can be diluted. Despite these problems, Sui’s DeFi ecosystem has grown slowly but surely, drawing in users through connections with Bitcoin-related products and decentralized exchanges. SUI crypto is popular with developers because its flexible architecture is made for games, payments, and tokenizing assets. But there is a lot of competition from Solana and Ethereum, and analysts say that demand needs to grow quickly to make up for the pressure on supply. If adoption picks up, SUI crypto could test its early-2025 highs again. On the other hand, a bearish case says it could fall back to early-2024 levels. Why Remittix Leads As Best Altcoin To Buy Today There is a lot of talk among traders about the future of the Solana price and SUI crypto, but many analysts are saying that Remittix (RTX) is the best altcoin to buy right now for the best return on investment. Remittix is different from speculative tokens because it is building in the PayFi sector. It lets you send money directly from one cryptocurrency to a bank in more than 30 countries with flat fees, real-time FX quotes, and a Pay API that merchants can use. Remittix has already raised more than $23.2 million and sold more than 639 million tokens. Right now, the price is only $0.103. It has been listed on BitMart and LBANK, and a beta version of its wallet is set to come out in the third quarter of 2025. It will support more than 40 cryptocurrencies and more than 30 fiat currencies. These milestones in adoption, along with its payments-first strategy, give it a real-world use case that Solana price action and SUI crypto volatility can’t match in terms of risk and reward. Key Highlights Driving Remittix Momentum $23.2 million raised BitMart and LBANK listings confirmed Q3 2025 wallet beta with 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiats Transparent fees with real-time FX quotes Merchant-ready Pay API for freelancers and businesses Conclusion The price of Solana looks good, but it is being held back by resistance near $210. On the other hand, SUI crypto is still at risk of dilution even though the ecosystem is growing. Remittix, on the other hand, is becoming known as the best altcoin to buy right now because it has exchange listings, adoption milestones, and a clear roadmap. Analysts say that RTX offers the kind of early-stage upside that Solana and Sui no longer do, making it a good choice for investors looking for the best return on investment in 2025.

A rare divergence pattern is fueling speculation of a massive reversal, with analysts eyeing a potential rally that could stretch as high as $0.000081. But can SHIB really sustain the momentum for such an explosive rally? Bullish Divergence Sparks Hopes Of A Reversal In a recent update shared on X, Javon Marks revealed that Shiba Inu has confirmed a bullish pattern through a regular bullish divergence on the MACD histogram. This technical development signals a notable shift in momentum that could mark the beginning of a major reversal for SHIB, with buyers slowly regaining control of the market structure. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Forms Double Bottom At Demand Zone — What To Expect Javon Marks further explained that this signal points to a possible 163% surge, which could lift SHIB back into the $0.00003 range. Such a move would not only signal renewed bullish strength but also mark an important recovery from the recent periods of consolidation and price weakness that have kept the token under pressure. The analyst also stressed that this projection may represent only the first leg of a much larger rally, suggesting that the token is preparing for a sustained upward move rather than a short-lived bounce. Looking further ahead, Javon Marks outlined an even more ambitious scenario for SHIB. If bullish momentum continues to build, the breakout pattern could fuel an extraordinary 570% run, potentially driving the price toward the $0.000081 target. Such a move would dramatically reshape SHIB’s long-term outlook, establishing it as one of the most aggressive rebound moments in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Key Technical Outlook Presently, the first significant resistance sits near $0.000017, a level that has acted as a barrier in recent sessions. A successful close above this zone could open the door toward $0.0000204, and potentially drive SHIB toward the $0.0000263 mark. Breaking through these levels would confirm renewed bullish momentum and could encourage further accumulation by buyers. Related Reading: How High Can Shiba Inu Climb In 2025? Analyst Gives Candid Outlook On the downside, SHIB has immediate support around $0.0000080, which aligns with recent lows. A deeper pullback could test the $0.0000065 region, where the 100-day moving average currently provides backup. If bears manage to push the price below this level, SHIB risks revisiting the $0.00000534 support area, which would likely increase selling pressure. For now, Shiba Inu remains in a wait-and-see zone. A decisive break above resistance could spark a bullish continuation, while failure to hold above near-term support might expose the token to further downside.

At the same time, an early-stage altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is catching attention from investors searching for the next high-growth opportunity. This move highlights how the market narrative is changing from Bitcoin dominance to a broader focus on yield, utility, and scarcity plays. Bitcoin Correction Sparks Rotation Bitcoin recently fell from highs above $124,000 to the $108,000 – $114,000 range. Analysts note that this wasn’t caused by one single event but by a combination of weak macroeconomic data, stock market declines, and whale sell-offs. On-chain data showed one long-time holder unloading over 100,000 BTC, sparking further selling and exposing just how powerful these players remain in driving short-term price action. Ethereum Gains Whale Confidence Ethereum has become the key winner in this shift. With the approval of spot ETFs and greater clarity under the CLARITY Act, ETH has grown far more accessible for institutions. Its staking yields also attract investors seeking passive income, while its robust DeFi and smart contract ecosystem provide clear growth potential. A single whale transaction of $217 million from BTC into ETH emphasized just how much conviction big players now have in Ethereum’s future. The Hidden Gem of 2025 Beyond Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout option for those looking to get in early. Presale rounds have been selling out at record speed, and early buyers have already seen returns surpassing 7,800% . With limited allocations left and growing demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a reputation as one of the rare altcoins offering both scarcity and exponential upside potential . Analysts suggest it could mirror the kind of breakout growth only seen in the earliest days of past market leaders. The Road Ahead Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but its role is changing. Whales and institutions are clearly diversifying into assets that offer yields, utility, and room for explosive growth. Ethereum’s strength and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity play show how investor strategies are shifting, signaling that the next phase of the bull run may be defined less by Bitcoin dominance and more by high-growth alternatives.

Each coin has strong community backing, ongoing upgrades, or breakout potential, making them attractive to traders searching for affordable entries. These names dominate retail sentiment, though some analysts argue that newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are starting to attract the kind of attention that previously powered Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. SHIBA INU (SHIBA) — Burn Events and Breakout Potential Shiba Inu is maintaining its place as one of the most visible meme coins, thanks to a combination of supply reduction strategies and sustained community energy. Priced near $0.00001322, SHIBA has delivered bullish chart patterns in recent weeks that analysts view as precursors to another breakout run. The introduction of Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, has added to this optimism by enabling faster transactions and strengthening Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. With increased use cases and ongoing development, the project is positioning itself as more than just a meme-driven token. Market forecasts point toward the possibility of SHIBA reaching $0.000081 in the coming cycle. This kind of upside, combined with large-scale token burns and retail accumulation, keeps it firmly on the list of best cryptos under $10. Its established brand power and improving fundamentals make it a candidate for sustained growth if momentum carries forward. ADA (Cardano) — Network Expansion and Institutional Interest Cardano, trading under $1 at around $0.87, continues to attract attention as a top-tier blockchain platform. Often compared to Ethereum, ADA benefits from its emphasis on scalability, governance, and academic-driven development. Analysts say this disciplined approach has given Cardano one of the strongest foundations among altcoins under $10. Institutional interest has risen throughout 2025, as upgrades to the network have expanded Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. Notably, hundreds of millions in value are now locked across its DeFi applications, and developer activity continues to trend upward. This growth is building confidence that Cardano can remain competitive in the next cycle. Undoubtedly, ADA’s appeal lies in accessibility for retail investors. The crypto token’s relatively low price point, combined with consistent ecosystem progress, makes it an affordable way to gain exposure to smart contract adoption. Analysts highlight that its blend of institutional support and grassroots developer engagement keeps ADA attractive for both long-term holders and active traders. BONK — Solana’s Meme Coin Power Play Among Solana-based tokens, BONK has emerged as a standout. Priced below $0.01, it has gained traction as one of the most liquid meme coins tied to the network. Whale-driven trading has helped it sustain high activity, while liquidity support has prevented the extreme volatility seen in some smaller meme assets. BONK’s strength also comes from its integration into Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins that exist in isolation, BONK has been connected to lending, trading, and liquidity platforms across Solana. This level of use-case integration makes it more resilient than meme coins built purely on hype. Investors see BONK as a high-beta way to track Solana’s overall expansion. If Solana continues to secure institutional flows and DeFi adoption, BONK is well-positioned to capture that momentum. BONK remains one of the most promising options for traders seeking sub-$10 assets with both meme appeal and network relevance. PEPE — High-Risk, High-Reward Momentum PEPE has solidified its reputation as a high-risk, high-reward play. Still priced under $0.01, the meme coin thrives on viral attention and waves of speculative buying. Its growth this year has been tied closely to social sentiment, with rallies often sparked by retail campaigns on social media platforms. Analysts caution that volatility is the defining trait of PEPE, making it a coin that can deliver explosive upside or sharp reversals. For many traders, that risk is precisely what makes it attractive, particularly as they seek meme-driven cycles capable of producing outsized returns. Despite the risks, PEPE’s growing holder base and consistent trading volume highlight continued interest. Its place among the best cryptos under $10 is secured by its role as one of the most active meme coins in 2025, even if it appeals mainly to investors with a higher tolerance for uncertainty. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Best Crypto to Buy Under $10 Among the crowded field of low-cost tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being singled out by analysts as the best crypto to buy under $10 in 2025. Still priced around fractions of a cent, it offers investors a chance to secure exposure at levels that could multiply dramatically once exchange listings arrive. What is driving the excitement is the scale of its forecasted upside. Analysts project potential gains of up to 12,000% in the next cycle, a figure that has fueled comparisons to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Retail investors are rushing to lock in allocations, while whales have also begun rotating into the project, signaling growing conviction in its breakout potential. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the rare combination of low entry point and high forecasted return that defines life-changing crypto opportunities. With momentum building fast, it has become the sub-$10 token attracting the strongest FOMO across the market this year. Conclusion — Retail Favorites and Newcomer Opportunities The best cryptos under $10 in August 2025 continue to be led by SHIBA, ADA, BONK, and PEPE, each offering unique appeal through community support, institutional adoption, or meme-driven speculation. They remain accessible entry points for investors looking to participate in the market without the high costs of Bitcoin or Ethereum. At the same time, newer meme projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are beginning to command attention, offering the kind of exponential upside that established names may no longer provide. So, the focus is no longer on the known names within the crypto community as only projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE can produce the life-changing returns.

51097100,572160,1756857658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51097100.jpeg,"Banks Won’t Trust Ripple And XRP, SWIFT CIO Says",https://bitcoinist.com/banks-wont-trust-ripple-and-xrp-swift-cio-says/,"Ripple and XRP were thrust into the spotlight after SWIFT chief innovation officer (CIO) Tom Zschach delivered a pointed critique on LinkedIn—widely read as a jab at the company and its XRP token—over what actually constitutes “resilience” for banks and how institutional trust is earned. The exchange began under a comment praising Ripple’s regulatory endurance, where Zschach countered bluntly: “Surviving lawsuits isn’t resilience. Neutral, shared governance is. Institutions don’t want to live on a competitor’s rails.” He followed by rejecting the notion that a single firm’s rapport with watchdogs equals compliance, writing: “And compliance isn’t about one company convincing regulators it should be allowed to operate. It’s about an entire industry agreeing on shared standards that no single balance sheet controls.” Ripple Vs. SWIFT Zschach then broadened the frame in a longer post about how banks actually adopt technology. “Every major shift in finance begins the same way. Technology lays the foundation but trust decides when the building opens.” He recalled that previous “next big things” in finance stalled not on throughput, but on the absence of compliance and security. The parallel he drew to public blockchains in 2025 was explicit: they are becoming too consequential to ignore—“Tokenized treasuries. Collateral on-chain. Cross-border payments that actually settle”—yet raw technical performance is not the finish line. They think the public chain itself is the solution. It isn’t,” he argued, calling public networks “the base environment for execution,” powerful for deterministic, programmable settlement but insufficient without the “trust layer” of legal enforceability, compliance, and privacy. Without that layer, he warned, a public chain is “a fast engine with no cockpit.” Crucially, Zschach’s critique drew a governance boundary that cuts to the heart of Ripple’s pitch to banks without naming the company. He re-centered the conversation on neutrality and shared control, rather than on the courtroom durability or regulatory narratives of any single firm. In his words, institutions want “shared standards that no single balance sheet controls,” and they will resist depending on “a competitor’s rails.” He extended the caution to consortia as well: “If a bank joins a chain owned or controlled by another bank then they are accepting someone else’s governance, incentives and rules of the game. In today’s environment is that a form of dependency that banks will be comfortable with?” The throughline is that institutional adoption hinges less on whether one vendor has outlasted enforcement actions and more on whether the infrastructure is credibly neutral, co-governed, and enforceable in law. Zschach’s taxonomy of public chains as “substrate” underscores how he expects the industry to evolve. In biology, computing, and construction, a substrate is foundational; what matters for banks is what gets layered above it. He urged builders not to “fight the public chains” but to harness them while solving for compliance from day one and for privacy “without killing transparency.” That is where he believes the “opportunity lies,” with finance ultimately “absorbing the best of public chains on its own terms.” The open question he posed back to the market—“When will banks and financial institutions truly trust public blockchains and at what pace will that trust build?”—puts the burden of proof on governance design and standards alignment, not on marketing milestones. For Ripple and XRP, the implication is clear even if Zschach never typed the name in his critique: the bar for bank adoption isn’t surviving litigation or securing green lights for a specific product stack; it is convincing the industry that the rails they ride are neutral, shared, and not controlled by any single company’s balance sheet (like Ripple’s escrow still controlling more than 35% of all XRP). In that lens, resilience is measured in how power is distributed, how rules are enforced, and how privacy and compliance are engineered—precisely the dimensions Zschach says decide “when the building opens.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.77.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|Ripple vs SWIFT|SWIFT|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 00:00:58

While the XRP Ledger (XRPL) already has a built-in burn mechanism, projections suggest that a more substantial burn event, such as eliminating 10% of the total tokens, could lead to a notable shift in XRP’s price trajectory. How the Burn Mechanism Works Every transaction on the XRPL requires a small fee, which is permanently destroyed rather than redistributed. This process was introduced not as a method of creating scarcity, but as a measure to discourage spam transactions. Since the ledger went live more than 13 years ago, just 14.19 million XRP have been burned. This figure represents only about 0.014% of the total maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. At the current burn rate , which averages around 600 tokens per day due to reduced network activity, it would take more than a millennium to destroy even 1% of the supply. This slow pace has led some community members to argue for accelerated methods of removing tokens. However, the broader impact of a larger-scale burn remains a subject of debate. XRP Projected Price if 10% of Supply Burned To examine the potential outcome of a more aggressive burn scenario, Google Gemini modeled what might happen if 10 billion XRP, equivalent to 10% of the total supply, were removed from circulation. At the time of press, XRP trades around $2.79 with a circulating supply of approximately 59.48 billion tokens, giving it a market capitalisation of roughly $166 billion. If the supply were reduced to 49.48 billion tokens while the market cap remained constant, the price would increase to $3.25. Market Reactions and Short-Term Effects Google Gemini emphasized that markets are unlikely to respond mechanically to such a major event. A sudden burn of this magnitude could attract investor attention, drive buying interest, and increase speculative activity. In that case, XRP might initially rally toward the $4 to $5 range as traders respond to the deflationary shock. The AI model further suggested that breaking past XRP’s historical peak of $3.84 would be probable under these circumstances. This could establish a new baseline for the asset and generate stronger momentum in the medium term. XRP Long-Term Projections In a sustained scenario of higher demand combined with a reduced circulating supply, Gemini projected that XRP could stabilize within the $10 to $15 range . At those levels, the market capitalization would stand between $495 billion and $742 billion. Such a valuation would place XRP among the top global digital assets. However, achieving and maintaining these levels would require consistent adoption and liquidity growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While XRP’s current burn mechanism has only removed a fraction of the token supply over more than a decade, the idea of a large-scale burn continues to attract interest. Modeling by Google Gemini indicates that a 10% reduction could initially push XRP above $5 and potentially position it for a longer-term range between $10 and $15. Still, the actual impact would depend heavily on investor behaviour, market conditions, and the broader adoption of Ripple’s technology.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7256 Market cap $766.95M Trading volume (24-hour) $21.87M Circulating supply 1.057B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.7283 24-hour low $0.7049 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.69% 50-day SMA $0.8267 14-Day RSI 38.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6600 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is still trending down on the daily chart. The 4-hour chart shows a bounce attempt but capped by $0.73–$0.75. XTZ’s key support zone remains at $0.69–$0.70. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos ($XTZ) remains in a clear downtrend as of September 3, with lower highs and lower lows pressing price toward the lower Bollinger Band near $0.69. Today’s candle shows hesitation after a small relief bounce, but momentum remains weak as the MACD stays negative and RSI lingers around 45, below neutral. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Immediate resistance is stacked at $0.79–$0.89, while $0.69 is the nearest support level. Unless XTZ reclaims $0.79, the structure favors further downside or sideways consolidation. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, XTZ has shown a short-term bounce off $0.69–$0.70 support, pushing back toward the $0.72–$0.73 area where the 21 SMA is also pressing down. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume picked up on the move higher, but the rejection just below $0.73 highlights resistance, with stronger supply likely around $0.74–$0.75. Losing $0.70 would reopen downside to $0.69 or lower, while clearing $0.74 would start shifting momentum in favor of buyers. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6986 BUY SMA 5 $0.7457 SELL SMA 10 $0.7825 SELL SMA 21 $0.8168 SELL SMA 50 $0.8267 SELL SMA 100 $0.7036 BUY SMA 200 $0.6600 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7985 SELL EMA 5 $0.7789 SELL EMA 10 $0.7272 SELL EMA 21 $0.6863 BUY EMA 50 $0.7122 BUY EMA 100 $0.8034 SELL EMA 200 $0.8751 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Unless buyers reclaim the $0.74 price level with positive volume momentum, XTZ is more likely to stay range-bound or revisit $0.70, with $0.69 acting as the decisive support level. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos XTZ August Roundup 🌟 August was a big month for Tezos.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before correcting to an average of $0.72 in February, then consolidated below $0.70 from March through May with a combined average of about $0.66. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it saw an average price of $0.7232. The coin kicked off August at $0.7605 and maintained an average price of $0.8212 throughout the month.

The AI company, backed by Amazon and run by ex-OpenAI execs, confirmed on Tuesday that it raised $13 billion in funding, putting its valuation at $183 billion. That’s three times what it was worth in March, making this one of the fastest valuation surges Silicon Valley has seen so far in 2025. The funding round was led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Heavyweights like Altimeter, General Catalyst, and Coatue also threw money in. Anthropic’s finance chief, Krishna Rao, said the raise showed how tightly the company’s working with investors. “This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth,” Krishna said. Claude’s launch lights a fire under growth Since Claude was announced in March 2023, Anthropic’s valuation has gone vertical. The company now says it has more than 300,000 business customers and a run-rate revenue of $5 billion as of August, up from just $1 billion at the start of the year. That’s a 5x jump in less than twelve months. Anthropic was built by people who used to work at OpenAI, including its CEO Dario Amodei. That matters, because the rivalry between the two companies is heating up fast. OpenAI has been making headlines ever since it launched ChatGPT in late 2022. It’s preparing a stock sale that would value it at $500 billion, as reported by CNBC. In March, OpenAI locked in a $40 billion raise at a $300 billion valuation, the biggest ever for a private tech firm. Just last month, it collected another $8.3 billion tied to that same round. Meanwhile, it rolled out GPT-5, which OpenAI calls faster and “a lot more useful” than earlier models. But not everyone’s happy. Some users complained that features from GPT-4o were missing. “We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on X. Anthropic says the new funding will support AI safety research, help scale to meet demand from large enterprises, and push international expansion. Those are the three priorities. Anthropic changes its data policy and gives users a deadline Another big change is happening behind the scenes. Anthropic is making major changes to how it collects and stores user data, and people using Claude have until September 28 to decide if their conversations can be used to train the company’s AI models. That’s a full reversal from their old policy. Before this update, Claude users were told their data would be wiped after 30 days—unless it broke a rule or had to be kept longer due to legal reasons, in which case it might stick around for up to two years. That’s now history. If users don’t opt out, Anthropic will keep their conversations and coding sessions for five years and use that info to train future Claude models. The policy affects all individual users on Claude Free, Claude Pro, Claude Max, and Claude Code. Business customers using Claude Gov, Claude for Work, Claude for Education, or accessing via API won’t be affected. This is similar to how OpenAI protects its enterprise customers by not using their data for training either. Anthropic hasn’t given a full explanation beyond a blog post. But the company says the new policy is about “user choice.” If people don’t opt out, they’ll be helping improve the AI. The company says this will make Claude better at things like coding and reasoning, and also help reduce the number of times harmless messages are flagged as harmful. Still, the real reason is clear. Every AI company right now needs massive amounts of real-world data. Claude’s chats offer that. Training large models isn’t possible without millions of quality conversations. So this gives Anthropic what it needs to compete with OpenAI and Google; data at scale, straight from users.

The two filings, revealed on Tuesday, suggest a tentative revival in investor appetite for high-growth fintech and crypto firms, with Wall Street banks betting that revived risk appetite and steadier market conditions can draw investors back to the listings market. Their debuts will follow the successful debuts of stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish, which drew robust demand earlier this year.

It grew rapidly during the e-commerce boom of 2020 and 2021, when successive funding rounds boosted its private valuation to $45 billion. However, by mid-2022, it recalibrated its valuation, dropping it to $6.7 billion. It initially had plans for a direct listing in 2021. However, that plan did not materialize. The fintech took another go at it earlier this year but was forced to put it on hold in April after the volatility that hit the market following US tariffs on major trading partners. Now, with a relatively stable market and the demand for technology stocks returning, Klarna is preparing to sell 34.3 million shares at a range of $35 to $37, raising up to $1.27 billion. If successful, the flotation would mark one of the largest fintech listings since the pandemic. Blockchain lender Figure joins queue While Klarna embodies Europe’s push into the US market, San Francisco-based Figure highlights how blockchain finance is moving into the mainstream. The company, co-founded in 2018 by former SoFi chief Mike Cagney, operates a blockchain-native platform for lending, trading and investing in consumer credit and digital assets. Figure plans to sell 26.3 million shares between $18 and $20, seeking to raise as much as $526 million at a valuation of just over $4 billion. The offering will be led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies and Bank of America, with the shares set to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker “FIGR”. The lender has distinguished itself by reducing approval times for home equity loans to around 10 days, compared with an industry average of more than 40. It also turned profitable in the first half of 2025, reporting a $29 million gain compared to a $13 million loss it recorded a year earlier. Supporters argue that Figure reflects a maturing stage in blockchain adoption, underpinned by stronger regulation and rising institutional demand. “Investors in this space tend to be patient because they see the long-term potential,” said Jeff Zell, senior analyst at IPO Boutique. IPO revival gathers pace The listings by Klarna and Figure are part of an increasing pipeline. On the same day, cryptocurrency exchange Gemini , backed by the Winklevoss twins, began its own roadshow for a New York IPO that could value it at $2.2 billion. Josef Schuster, chief executive of IPO research group IPOX, said: “With the current administration strongly supportive of the space, the (IPO) pipeline is likely to remain active for well-structured, compliance-forward players.” For investors, the current wave offers both opportunity and caution. Klarna’s model depends on consumer spending resilience, while Figure’s fortunes are tied to the pace of blockchain adoption and regulatory stability. Market sentiment may swing on whether these offerings trade strongly in the aftermarket.

The surge followed Judge Amit Mehta’s decision to reject the U.S. Department of Justice’s demand to break up Google’s core tech products. According to CNBC, investors celebrated the ruling because the court backed away from the most aggressive penalties that were being considered. The DOJ had asked for extreme actions, including forcing Google to sell off Chrome, because of the way it links search behavior to ads. But Mehta said those proposals were too much. In his ruling, Mehta said: “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment. Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints.” Mehta also ordered both parties to meet and finalize the judgment by September 10. Judge orders limited restrictions on google, avoids full breakup The antitrust trial started in September 2023, and by August 2024, Mehta found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, confirming it held monopoly power in search and related advertising. The focus of the DOJ’s case had changed from proving guilt to proposing what to do about it, and that’s where things got messy. The DOJ wanted Google to open up access to its search data, ban default search engine payments, and share what users click on across the web. Some of that made it into the ruling. Mehta ruled that Google must share certain datasets, including search index information and user interaction data. However, the company won’t be required to share any ads data. The court also said any data-sharing must be done “on ordinary commercial terms that are consistent with Google’s current syndication services,” which means Google won’t be giving away any trade secrets for free. In response, Google posted a blog saying: “Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals. We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we’re reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case’s focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.” The Justice Department also pushed to stop Google from paying device makers to become the default search engine. One of the biggest targets? The multibillion-dollar deal with Apple, which puts Google as the default search engine on Safari across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Mehta rejected that too. The court ruled that Alphabet can keep making those payments to Apple. This triggered a 3% spike in Apple’s stock in after-hours trading. Apple stays out of trial but benefits from ruling Even though Apple wasn’t a defendant in the case, its close relationship with Google became a central issue in the remedies discussion. If the court had ruled against the search payments, Apple would’ve had to rethink how Safari works, and that would’ve created a domino effect across the tech industry. Analysts have said it might take years for Apple to implement changes if that ever happens. For now, no changes are required. In testimony earlier this year, Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, defended the deal. Cue told the court that Apple chose Google because “it’s the best search engine,” and that the company is always looking for “the best tools for customers.” He also said Apple is considering new options, including adding AI search engines to future versions of its software, in case things shift down the line. Meanwhile, Google isn’t done fighting. The company said it plans to appeal the ruling, and legal analysts say any further trial over these remedies could last up to two years. After that, if appeals are exhausted, the Supreme Court could step in. So even though the ruling looks like a win for Google and Apple for now, the battle isn’t technically over. The DOJ also wanted the court to force Google to release more information about how it builds its search engine. That didn’t happen. Mehta agreed to make Google share some specific user and index data, but not everything. Most importantly, he refused to make Google share advertising-related data, which is the backbone of its money machine.

Japan Post Bank Taps Into Blockchain For Digital Yen As reported by Reuters , Japan Post Bank is planning to launch a digital yen in the coming year. Japan Post Bank is a Tokyo-headquartered bank that originally started as a postal savings system back in 1875 and today manages around 190 trillion (nearly $1.3 trillion in US dollars) in deposits. Historically fully owned by the Japanese government, the institution opened up to private shareholders in 2007, but still counts the Japanese state among its backers. Now, it seems the bank wants to bring its massive depositor base into the blockchain era. The new currency, known as “DCJPY,” will be developed by DeCurret DCP, a Japanese digital currencies platform, and will be backed 1:1 by fiat yen. The two companies plan to issue the digital yen by the end of fiscal year 2026. After its launch, the bank’s users will be able to convert their funds into DCJPY and participate in blockchain-based transactions. While DCJPY will use blockchain technology, it will be different from a stablecoin . Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency that are typically available for trading on public exchanges and other platforms. Meanwhile, DCJPY will be a deposit-based token available within the financial system of Japan Post Bank. The bank isn’t the first financial institution in the country to launch a blockchain product like this. Last year, GMO Aozora Net Bank also started a similar digital yen offering. Speaking of stablecoins, these cryptocurrencies have been witnessing a legislative push in Asia lately, with Hong Kong releasing its stablecoin bill at the start of August and South Korea expected to launch its framework in October. Japan introduced its stablecoin legislation back in 2022. So far, no yen-backed stablecoins have been approved, but according to a report , one could gain the green light from regulators as soon as October. The fiat-tied digital assets have recently been observing some notable growth and exploring new all-time highs (ATHs), according to data from MacroMicro . From the chart, it’s visible that the stablecoin market cap saw a slump in 2022-23, but 2024 brought a reversal as growth returned in the space. The end of the year then witnessed acceleration in the metric, which has continued into 2025. Today, the combined stablecoin market cap sits at about $282.6 billion, a fresh record.

51099032,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81300,1756861222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dogecoin Reclaims $0.22 — Will BONK and SHIBA Follow With 40% Pops?,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-reclaims-0-22-will-bonk-and-shiba-follow-with-40-pops/,"As the cryptocurrency market navigates a prolonged slowdown, investors and traders have turned their spotlight to Dogecoin. Following multiple price swings this year, the prevailing question is whether the meme coin can still push upwards to its all-time high price. Amidst the volatility, Dogecoin briefly climbed above $0.22 before it succumbed to bearish pressure. With the leading meme coin showing signs of recovery, many are asking if Shiba Inu and BONK can replicate the upward push too and deliver 40% gains to holders. As the conversation continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE has slipped in as a cheap early-stage meme token, offering investors a high upside potential in the coming bull cycles. Dogecoin’s Short-Term Path For now, Dogecoin seems stuck in a holding pattern. Analysts see the coin trading between $0.21 and $0.27 through September, with forecasts averaging around $0.26. That may not sound like fireworks, but given DOGE’s reputation for sharp swings, even small moves keep it on traders’ radar. However, whales are still making waves. A single 900 million DOGE transfer last month sent prices sliding 5% in just 24 hours. That said, network health looks solid, with mining hashrates sitting near all-time highs — a sign the backbone of DOGE remains strong. Year-End Targets Looking ahead to December, predictions are all over the map. Conservative models peg DOGE between $0.20 and $0.25, basically keeping it flat. On the other hand, bullish scenarios stretch as high as $0.70, hinging on ETF approvals and wider adoption for payments. Most forecasts settle somewhere in the middle, around $0.28, which suggests modest growth with plenty of volatility along the way. And with companies like Bit Origin pledging up to $500 million in Dogecoin treasuries, institutional demand may prove to be a wild card. Will SHIB and BONK Tag Along? Shiba Inu is grinding in a tight range, but the technical picture is starting to look brighter. A Golden Cross on the charts—where the 50-day average crosses above the 200-day—has bulls watching for a potential breakout. If SHIB clears resistance near $0.0000145, history suggests the move could run 30–40%. BONK, meanwhile, is buzzing again in Solana circles. While still a speculative play, analysts think it could ride the same meme-coin tide if DOGE keeps its momentum. In other words, if Dogecoin runs, BONK could sprint. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Low Entry, Clock Ticking As the three dominant meme coins navigate the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting early traction from a growing number of investors. Historically, every market cycle produces an early-stage token that explodes beyond estimation . Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the next. Already, thousands of investors have taken advantage of its low price to position themselves. On-chain data shows that even whale investors joined in the buying frenzy, and analysts say retail investors will soon follow. Outlook Dogecoin reclaiming $0.22 has breathed life back into the meme-coin market. Whether SHIB and BONK can deliver the same kind of gains remains to be seen, but technical setups suggest the potential is there. And with new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE catching early interest, it is clear the appetite for high-reward tokens isn’t fading anytime soon. The next few weeks will tell if this bounce is just a blip — or the start of another meme-coin rally.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said the appeal of the ruling that blocked his tariff authority needs to be resolved fast. “We’re going to be going to the Supreme Court, we think tomorrow, because we need an early decision,” he said. He added that he’ll be asking for “early admittance” and “an expedited ruling.” This is all tied to a decision handed down Friday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In a 7–4 split, the court said Trump didn’t have the power to roll out most of the tariffs he’s been using, especially the ones imposed through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judges said only Congress has the power to tax imports, and that Trump’s moves went beyond the limits of presidential authority. The ruling is paused until October 14 to give the administration a shot at getting the Supreme Court to reverse it. “If you take away tariffs, we could end up being a third-world country,” Trump said . He claimed the entire financial structure of the U.S. economy could collapse if the court doesn’t act quickly. “The financial fabric of our country is at stake,” he said. Trump claims the market is reacting to the court ruling Speaking just hours after market indexes dipped, Trump blamed the drop on the court’s decision. “The stock market’s down because of that, because the stock market needs the tariffs,” he told reporters. “They want the tariffs.” He offered no market data to back that claim, but said the ruling spooked traders and investors who’ve come to expect tariff protections as part of his economic agenda. The tariffs under fire were pushed earlier this year using the 1977 emergency law. Some of the duties reached as high as 50% on imports from countries Trump accused of failing to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. The list included China, Mexico, and Canada; all of them top trade partners. The administration argued that fentanyl was enough of a national security threat to justify the tariffs. The court disagreed. In its opinion, the Federal Circuit wrote that “the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution. Judges said Congress never gave presidents the right to act unilaterally on tariffs unless very specific conditions were met, conditions they said weren’t present in Trump’s case. “Tariffs are a core Congressional power,” the court added. Administration braces for legal fallout while Trump slams India trade Trump’s officials aren’t sitting around waiting. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that while the administration is confident the Supreme Court will support the tariffs, a fallback plan is already in the works. He didn’t say what Plan B looks like, but made it clear the administration expects a fight. Meanwhile, the web of reciprocal tariffs Trump placed on dozens of countries is now legally unstable. The White House hasn’t said what will happen if the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case, or rules against them. But if Friday’s decision stands, it could instantly shrink the scope of U.S. tariffs. Before the ruling, the Tax Foundation estimated that nearly 70% of imports were affected by Trump’s tariffs. That number would fall to just 16% if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court’s ruling. On top of all that, Trump zeroed in on India in a post, accusing the country of taking advantage of the U.S. “They sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest ‘client,’ but we sell them very little. Until now a totally one-sided relationship, and it has been for many decades,” he wrote. Everything now rides on whether the Supreme Court agrees to take the case, and whether it’s willing to fast-track a ruling. Trump is betting they will.

51099144,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81448,1756861327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Outlines 3 Key Factors Saying XRP Is Still Poised for Major Rally,https://timestabloid.com/expert-outlines-3-key-factors-saying-xrp-is-still-poised-for-major-rally/,"XRP has recently experienced notable volatility, falling to $2.69 before stabilizing around $2.79. This marked its lowest level since July, prompting uncertainty within the community. Some long-term investors have openly questioned whether the token can sustain its value, with a few even signaling that they may reduce their positions if prices fail to improve. Despite these concerns, market analyst EGRAG maintains that the broader bullish trend has not been invalidated. In a recent update, he presented three technical arguments supporting the view that XRP remains positioned for further gains. Three Technical Signals Supporting the Bullish Case According to EGRAG , XRP’s structure on the monthly chart continues to show strength. First, he stressed that the token’s candle formations remain intact, suggesting that the market has not broken down on a structural level. Second, he noted that the price has consistently held above significant Fibonacci retracement levels. The $1.99 zone, in particular, has acted as a reliable base and has not been breached, reinforcing its role as strong support. Third, EGRAG Crypto pointed to XRP’s position relative to the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA). Remaining above this long-term indicator is often considered a positive sign for sustaining momentum, and XRP has so far maintained this level. Unless these three conditions fail, the analyst argues that declaring the end of the bull run would be premature. #XRP – No Wicks, No Price Noise! Did we lose any body candle structures? No. Did we fall below any Fibonacci targets? No. Did we drop below the 21 EMA on the monthly timeframe? No. Unless we see all of the above happen, I refuse to declare that the #BullRun … pic.twitter.com/9ihMgKniWb — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 1, 2025 XRP Price Targets and Long-Term Expectations Furthermore, EGRAG projects several potential upside levels for XRP. In the near term, he expects the token to test $3.90, which would represent a new all-time high and align with the 1.272 Fibonacci extension. From current levels, this move would require an advance of about 40%. Beyond this, he identifies $9.22 as another target, corresponding with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension , which would imply a gain of over 200%. For the current cycle peak, however, his projections are significantly higher. He has suggested possible price zones at $18, $23, and $46, representing increases of 542%, 721%, and 1,543%, respectively. Broader Market Perspectives Other analysts have shared similar optimism. Market commentator Matt Hughes (The Great Mattsby) has highlighted XRP’s performance within a Gann Fan pattern on the weekly timeframe, noting that the asset has successfully flipped previous resistance zones, such as $0.50 to $1.00 and the 2021 high of $1.96, into strong support. He also emphasized the importance of the $3.00 level, describing it as a critical threshold that could pave the way for a stronger breakout once firmly established. Additionally, macro investor Raoul Pal has described XRP as being in the process of moving capital inflows away from Bitcoin, reinforcing the view that the asset could continue its upward momentum. Mixed Investor Sentiment Despite the technical optimism, community sentiment remains divided. Influencer Crypto Bitlord recently expressed frustration, stating that he might liquidate his holdings if the price returns to $2. His comments reflect broader concerns among holders who feel the asset has not yet fulfilled its long-standing promises of significant wealth creation.

At its current price of $2.80, the token has appreciated by more than 410% year-over-year, placing it among the top-performing altcoins during the same period. While short-term fluctuations have led to uncertainty, analysts such as EGRAG and Hughes continue to argue that XRP retains a constructive technical outlook. As long as the asset maintains key support levels and remains above critical indicators, they believe the conditions for a continued rally are in place .

Expert Presents Simple Math Based on Global Market Volume",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-9438-expert-presents-simple-math-based-on-global-market-volume/,"XRP analyst XRP PhantomX shared a post urging holders to carefully consider the potential scale of XRP’s future role in global finance. In the tweet, he wrote: “Tell me why I shouldn’t be loading up on XRP right now?! Let’s break it down with some simple math. XRP Holders… YOU NEED TO SEE THIS!!” He attached a video presentation that outlined projected volumes from major global financial institutions and industries, linking them to possible market capitalization and price scenarios for XRP. Referenced Figures in the Video In the attached video, the speaker detailed a wide range of institutions and markets along with their estimated transaction or settlement volumes. He stated that Japanese banks collectively could represent 25 trillion, while the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation was cited with three quadrillion. SWIFT was attributed with one and a half quadrillion, and the top ten U.S. banks were listed at $12.5 trillion. Tokenization was assigned $2 trillion, Mastercard $9 trillion, Visa $16 trillion, and American Express $1 trillion. In addition, the global derivatives market was cited as one quadrillion, and a new partnership with Hidden Road was said to account for three trillion. These figures were then summed to reach approximately $5.53 quadrillion, which the speaker suggested could potentially flow through the XRP Ledger under an expansive adoption scenario. Calculations of Market Cap and Token Price The video then applied simple calculations to show how different adoption levels might translate into market capitalization and token prices. The speaker explained that if XRP captured just one percent of the total estimated volume, the market cap would be about $55 trillion. Dividing that by the cited circulating supply of 58 billion tokens gave a hypothetical price of $943 per XRP. The speaker then extended the scenario to a ten percent share, which would imply a market cap of 550 trillion and a resulting price of $9,438 per XRP. A midpoint assumption of five percent produced an estimated price of $4,719. These examples were presented as hypothetical outcomes based on straightforward arithmetic rather than predictions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Demand and Adoption In conclusion, the video stressed that while the volume numbers referenced are based on industry-scale markets, the actual impact on XRP depends on adoption levels and demand. The speaker underlined that factors such as integration by institutions, the role of liquidity, and real-world use cases would determine whether XRP could capture even a small portion of the markets discussed. He described demand as the key factor in shaping XRP’s future value, reinforcing that the exercise was designed to illustrate scale and possibility rather than certainty.

The components are: Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT) Alphabet (GOOGL) Amazon (AMZN) Nvidia (NVDA) Meta (META) Tesla (TSLA) Coinbase (COIN) iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) Each component will carry the same weight, which is 10% of the total index. No single stock or ETF dominates the mix. Coinbase said this will help investors avoid being overexposed to any one company or asset. However, weights can move above or below 10% between quarterly rebalances. Every three months, all weights will reset back to 10% each. The official index provider is MarketVector, which will maintain and rebalance the product. Coinbase said the index is designed for investors who want “thematic exposure to tech and crypto combined,” “diversification in a single product,” and “tools to manage multi-asset risk,” The exchange called the launch “a new era of multi-asset derivatives” and said this is part of a larger strategy to expand access across asset classes. The Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures will settle monthly. Right now, the product is only available through partner platforms, but Coinbase stated they plan to roll out access to retail investors “in the coming months.” Coinbase has already added its own equity (COIN) into the mix, along with two BlackRock-linked ETF, IBIT for Bitcoin and ETHA for Ethereum.

MUTM is in the sixth stage of its presale and is expected to rise by 14.29% to $0.04 in the next stage. The project has already raised over $15.25 million and onboarded more than 15950 investors, positioning itself for a strong performance in the next altcoin season. Bitcoin Wavers as DeFi Gathers Steam Bitcoin is trading around $108,414, showing a modest pullback amid rising market volatility. Analysts note a growing rotation of capital from BTC to altcoins and DeFi projects, with Bitcoin’s dominance slipping below 60%, a signal of shifting investor interest. Recent whale activity indicates significant Bitcoin-to-Ethereum rotations, highlighting a broader move toward decentralized finance coins. Mutuum Finance is doing well in the DeFi market. It has attracted a great deal of loyal investors in just months. The project provides a secure platform for DeFi transactions, introducing proven lending functionalities within a trusted environment. Analysts identify this is crypto with strong rally potential when the bull market takes off. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance’s presale is gaining strong traction. Stage 6 tokens are available at $0.035, with Stage 7 set to increase the price by 14.29% to $0.04. Investor demand continues to grow, with over $15.25 million raised and more than 15,950 token holders already onboard, making MUTM a prominent contender in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance has started a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 users will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. There’s also a leaderboard for the top 50 token holders, which rewards them with additional tokens. The team is also running a $50,000 bug bounty program in partnership with CertiK. To share in the reward, all users need to do is identify bugs within one of the preset levels: critical, major, minor, and low. A secure and Efficient Platform for Lending The platform uses smart contracts that enable a Peer-to-Contract model for lending, which automates the process. There is also Peer-to-Peer. Here the borrower in communication with the lender. This model helps make the lending process faster and more efficient. Price Discovery Mutuum relies on robust oracle infrastructure to determine fair market values. Chainlink data feeds are anticipated to provide reliable prices across USD and native assets (e.g., ETH, MATIC, AVAX). Fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and on-chain DEX metrics (like time-weighted average prices) enhance reliability and ensure accurate, timely valuations critical for collateral management and liquidations. As Bitcoin (BTC) shows signs of slowing momentum around $108,000 and its market dominance slips, attention is steadily moving toward emerging DeFi contenders like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has already raised more than $15.25 million and attracted over 15,950 investors, signaling strong early confidence in its ecosystem. Currently priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6, MUTM is set to climb by 14.29% to $0.04 in stage 7, offering a limited-time window for investors to enter before the next price jump. With a 95/100 CertiK trust score, an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin in development, and dual lending models designed to enhance decentralized borrowing and lending efficiency, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a focal point in the DeFi market. Add to this a $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 bug bounty program, and it’s clear the project is positioning itself for sustained growth.

51100128,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81403,1756863037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"$0.00001242 Entry Secures 42,000% ROI: BullZilla Presale Leads Best Meme Coin Presales to Join Now, Pepe and SUI Fumble",https://timestabloid.com/0-00001242-entry-secures-42000-roi-bullzilla-presale-leads/,"What if waiting just a few hours meant losing a life-changing gain? In the crypto world, especially with meme assets, that scenario plays out daily. Investors scan the markets for the best meme coin presale to join now, knowing that hesitation often comes with steep opportunity costs. The past 24 hours have been brutal reminders of volatility. Pepe fell 1.98% to $0.000009683, and SUI slid 2.46% to $3.47. Both remain popular tokens with sizable communities, but their declines highlight the fragile nature of assets without strong presale mechanics or deflationary frameworks. Meanwhile, BullZilla ($BZIL) has raced ahead. With over $100,000 raised, more than 7 billion tokens sold on opening day, and ROI already locked at 116% for the earliest buyers, it’s drawing headlines. With its presale roadmap indicating a potential 42,000% ROI, it has become a centerpiece for those seeking the best meme coin presale to join now. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Investor’s Dream With Deflationary Precision BullZilla’s presale has been carefully engineered to generate momentum. Its Progressive Presale Price Engine ensures automatic climbs every $100,000 raised or 48 hours elapsed. Launched at $0.00000575, it has already advanced to $0.00001242 in Stage 1, Phase 2. That alone has delivered 116% ROI before listing. Projections magnify the opportunity. At its target listing price of $0.008, today’s entry implies more than 42,000% ROI. A $5,000 allocation now would secure about 403 million tokens. At listing, that holding could be worth $3.22 million. However, waiting until the next hike to $0.00001908 reduces that same investment to 262 million tokens, resulting in a loss of 141 million tokens due to hesitation. This is why BullZilla dominates as the best meme coin presale to join now. Momentum data reinforces urgency. Within 50 minutes, $10,000 was raised. Within two hours, 2 billion tokens were sold. By the end of day one, $39,000 was in the books. Today, the tally exceeds $100,000, with another 53.62% programmed jump only hours away. Scarcity, speed, and design are driving a frenzy. Staking Rewards and Passive Income: Built-In Loyalty Engine Bull Zilla isn’t solely about explosive presale math. It fosters sustainability through staking rewards, allowing holders to lock their tokens in the HODL Furnace to earn yields while reducing the supply. Compared to Ethereum’s staking range of 4–7% annually (Ethereum Foundation), BullZilla’s projections promise higher returns that keep participants engaged beyond speculation. This system creates dual benefits: passive income for holders and stronger supply-side pressure in the market. Messari’s 2024 tokenomics study confirms that projects with layered incentive mechanisms outperform those that rely solely on hype. BullZilla’s staking design supports its presale mechanics, framing it as both the best crypto to buy today and a credible BullZilla next 1000x candidate. Steps to Buy $BZIL Tokens Visit the Official Presale Page: Go directly to the verified BullZilla Presale site. Always confirm the link through trusted sources to avoid phishing attempts. Connect Your Wallet: Use a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Ensure you have Ethereum (ETH) ready for the purchase and network fees. Choose Investment Amount: Enter the amount you want to allocate. The presale dashboard displays the exact number of tokens you’ll receive at the current stage. Confirm and Buy: Approve the transaction in your wallet. Once confirmed, your $BZIL tokens will be allocated instantly in the presale contract. Track Presale Progress: Monitor the live dashboard to see how close the project is to the next price hike, which occurs every $100K raised or 48 hours. Pepe: Popularity Under Pressure Pepe has remained a mainstay among meme coins, but its 1.98% dip to $0.000009683 underscores its fragility. While its community remains strong, its reliance on cultural branding leaves it exposed during corrections. According to CoinGecko data, Pepe has experienced cycles of rapid highs followed by sharp declines, driven more by sentiment than mechanics. For traders, Pepe’s liquidity ensures it remains active. Yet for analysts and long-term investors, its lack of engineered scarcity, progressive pricing, or staking means it competes at a disadvantage. Compared to BullZilla Presale, which ties growth directly to presale momentum, Pepe’s trajectory looks increasingly uncertain. SUI: Ecosystem Growth Meets Market Weakness SUI has emerged as one of the most talked-about Layer-1 ecosystems, with explosive growth in developer activity and DeFi traction. Its value has surged over 400% in the past year, and its ecosystem includes fast-rising DeFi protocols and social apps. Yet despite strong fundamentals, SUI fell 2.46% to $3.47 in the past 24 hours, showing the market’s unforgiving volatility. Analysts note that SUI’s long-term trajectory remains bullish thanks to institutional inflows, ETF listings, and its developer-focused ecosystem. Still, compared to BullZilla’s presale dynamics, SUI’s current pullback demonstrates why presale tokens with engineered scarcity often outshine Layer-1 plays in short-term ROI. Conclusion: Countdown Before the Next Price Wall Based on our research and market trends, BullZilla stands out as the best meme coin presale to join now. With more than $100,000 raised, 7 billion tokens sold, and 116% ROI already secured, it has transformed urgency into structured gains. Its potential upside of 42,000% at listing is reinforced by staking rewards, engineered scarcity, and presale mechanics that force price appreciation. With the next 53.62% increase only hours away, the window is rapidly narrowing. Pepe’s cultural strength and SUI’s developer ecosystem keep them relevant, but neither delivers BullZilla’s precision design. For investors eyeing the best crypto to buy today, the choice is clear: join BullZilla Presale now or risk entering after the next programmed surge. The BullZilla 1000x narrative is unfolding, and hesitation could cost millions in tokens.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. While traders fixated on Jerome Powell’s latest rate signals, the more consequential story may be playing out in stablecoins. The sector has nearly doubled in a year to $280 billion, with most issuers holding short-term Treasuries as collateral. That ties crypto liquidity more directly to Federal Reserve policy than ever before, according to OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin. ""While markets are still digesting Powell’s latest comments on rates, a more consequential long-term shift is happening beyond the charts and headlines. It's in the so-called 'boring' stablecoins that we're seeing better long-term price signals,"" Lin told CoinDesk in a note. ""The next step is unification - stablecoins have built the rails, now they need a unified market that delivers liquidity, efficiency and true utility for investors,"" Lin continued. Coinbase analysts project the market could swell to $1.2 trillion by 2028, forcing $5.3 billion of new Treasury purchases each week. The inflows may marginally lower yields, but the risk runs in reverse: redemption surges could trigger forced selling of bills, draining liquidity. The debate continued in a recent episode of Goldman Sachs' Exchanges podcast, where UC Berkeley’s Barry Eichengreen warned that stablecoins could replicate the money-market fund panic of 2008. “When a dollar money market share fell to 97 cents in 2008, chaos broke out, contagion fears spread, and the government stepped in to guarantee funds,” he said. Former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks countered on the podcast that the new GENIUS Act, which requires one-to-one Treasury backing, mirrors the national banking reforms that ended America’s “wildcat banking” era. “Supervision equals safety,” he said. “Every time a new token is issued, another dollar of Treasury securities has to be bought.” This tug-of-war captures the macro dilemma. Coinbase’s model shows stablecoins shaving basis points off Treasury yields, Brooks calls it a new engine of global dollar demand, and Eichengreen warns of a 2008-style liquidity crunch. Lin, meanwhile, argues the rails are already there — and the question is whether they unify into a market that steadies the system or fracture into instruments that amplify shocks. Market Movements BTC: BTC is currently trading above $111,300. CoinDesk market data shows that the world's largest digital asset is trading within a tight intraday range, which suggests consolidating sentiment. Markets appear cautious amid macro uncertainty, with investors patiently waiting for further momentum or directional cues. ETH: ETH is tading at $4,320, showing modest upside (+0.6%) intraday, hinting at renewed investor interest following recent gains. The broader crypto recovery, particularly in altcoins, seems to be bolstering demand. Gold: Gold recently crossed $3,540 an ounce, putting it at a fresh all-time closing high. The rally is being driven by surging expectations for an upcoming Fed rate cut as well as heightened uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and political pressure on the Fed. Investors are flocking to gold as a safe‑haven asset amid these risks. Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 remains steady within its current range, reflecting cautious optimism among investors. The rise follows a broader “ninja stealth rally” in Japanese equities, driven by strong foreign inflows, reforms, and shifting global capital trends toward Japan.

The decision comes as competitors such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares aggressively pursue XRP ETF approvals, with market analysts projecting inflows between $4.3 billion and $8.4 billion by year-end. Instead, BlackRock remains focused on its dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products, citing limited institutional demand for altcoins. While the firm stresses caution, critics warn that hesitation could cost BlackRock market share as rival funds attract institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure. Cardano ETF Rumors Drive Market Optimism Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of September. Grayscale filed an updated S-1 with the SEC for its proposed Cardano ETF, boosting approval odds on prediction market Polymarket to 87%, up from 63–75%. The proposed fund would trade on NYSE Arca, holding ADA directly with Coinbase Custody providing security. Analysts believe an approval could propel ADA’s price well above $1.00, with potential gains of 40–55% if institutional inflows materialize. Beyond ETF speculation, Cardano continues to build fundamentals with ecosystem upgrades such as smart contract enhancements and the Midnight privacy protocol. Polkadot and Chainlink Join the Rally Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK) have also captured investor attention amid ETF buzz and ecosystem progress. DOT, trading around $3.76, has been resilient, with analysts forecasting steady growth toward $4.20 this year and $6.99–$8.45 in 2026 as adoption of its cross-chain technology expands. Chainlink, on the other hand, surged past $23 in late August after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would publish official economic data on-chain using Chainlink’s oracle network. Bitwise also filed for a Chainlink spot ETF, further fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts see potential for LINK to retest highs near $30 if momentum holds. With ETF speculation filling the market, BlackRock’s conservative stance on XRP contrasts sharply with the aggressive push by rivals into Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink. As SEC decisions approach this fall, the outcome could redefine institutional participation in the broader crypto market.

But while BTC remains the anchor of the market, institutional money is shifting into Ethereum and Solana, where analysts see stronger percentage gains. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as the low-entry token that traders see as an early accumulation play. Bitcoin Bulls Defend Key Levels In late August, Bitcoin moved between $110,000 and $118,000. Bulls defended the $114K level despite short-term pressure. Over $2.5 billion in inflows poured into Bitcoin products last month. Analysts now expect year-end targets between $125K and $160K, with aggressive calls near $190K–$200K. Volatility remains elevated, with 30-day implied levels near 45%. Still, open interest above $82 billion shows institutions are committed to building exposure. Ethereum Strengthens Its Case Ethereum is trading between $4,327 and $4,487. Analysts project a run toward $4,900–$5,200 in September if flows remain strong. Bullish calls stretch as high as $6,000–$8,000 later this cycle. The driver is not just ETF demand but also key upgrades. With EIP-4844 and sharding on the roadmap, Ethereum aims to slash fees and boost speeds, supporting DeFi, gaming, and NFT growth. Solana Keeps Momentum Solana is holding around $210 after a 14% monthly gain. Institutions are reportedly targeting $1 billion in purchases, underscoring confidence. ETF filings from Fidelity, Bitwise, and 21Shares are also awaiting SEC review. Approval could significantly expand access and liquidity. The Firedancer upgrade is another catalyst. Expected to boost Solana’s throughput and stability, it positions the network for broader adoption. Analysts now see targets of $225–$300. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Low Entry Window MAGACOIN FINANCE is the early-stage altcoin gaining traction as the hidden gem to accumulate before the next market cycle. Still under a cent, the project offers investors and traders a low entry point that is fast closing. Based on its momentum, analysts estimate that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 50x return to investors who get in early. As whale interest and community strength grow, analysts say the low price window is closing. For investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the wildcard in the altcoin conversations for 2025 . Outlook Bitcoin bulls are still anticipating a BTC push to higher six-figure territory. Institutional adoption and ETF demands are factors that can support that climb. However, the bigger catch is in the rotation. Ethereum’s ETF frenzy places it in the middle of the cryptocurrency spotlight. Likewise, Solana’s institutional backers are pulling in capital and giving the token’s price the much-needed support. Beyond the big names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a spot as the altcoin primed to lead the market in future bull cycles.

A decisive break above this level could open the door for a surge toward $225 and beyond. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Historical Pullback Ranges – Healthy Correction Or Trouble Ahead? Analysts highlight that technical signals are aligning with renewed buying pressure from whales and “shark” wallets, suggesting confidence in Solana’s medium-term trajectory. Despite volatility in August, Solana’s price has held above the critical $183–$190 range, forming a base for potential upside. Futures trading volumes exceeding $50 billion further underscore the renewed investor interest. Analysts argue that if momentum continues, Solana could push toward $250 before testing the psychological $300 mark. Alpenglow Upgrade Fuels Institutional Confidence The biggest catalyst behind Solana’s bullish narrative is its Alpenglow upgrade, a game-changing overhaul that has transformed network performance. Block finality has been slashed to 100–150 milliseconds, while throughput now exceeds 107,000 transactions per second (TPS), outpacing Ethereum and even legacy systems like Visa. Key innovations include Votor, an off-chain validation process that reduces bottlenecks, and Rotor, a stake-weighted relay system that cuts latency by 40%. Together, they solve long-standing institutional pain points around speed and reliability. Validator costs have also dropped dramatically, from $60,000 annually to just $1,000, improving decentralization while opening the door for high-frequency trading, tokenized settlements, and real-time DeFi applications. For institutions, the 20+20 resilience model, ensuring operations continue even with 40% validator failures, cements Solana’s reputation as a Nasdaq-grade blockchain infrastructure. With 99.6% validator approval, the upgrade positions Solana as one of the most robust and cost-efficient blockchains available. SOL's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Whale Accumulation and Solana Path to $300 Institutional flows are echoing the bullish momentum. Galaxy Digital recently moved $103 million worth of SOL to Coinbase, sparking speculation about shifting strategies. Meanwhile, hedge funds like Pantera Capital are preparing fresh allocations into Solana’s ecosystem, reinforcing confidence in its long-term growth. At the same time, “shark” wallets have quietly accumulated at key support levels, reflecting strong conviction in Solana’s long-term growth. Analysts caution that failure to clear the $215 resistance could trigger a retest of the $190 zone, but consensus remains that a breakout is likely if accumulation continues.

XRP Makes a Lower Low XRP ended August in a downtrend that took the price to the key support at $2.7, which became a multi-week low. With a lower low confirmed, the current downtrend is likely to continue. However, buyers still have a chance to stop the price at this crucial support since they showed interest when this level was tested on Tuesday. Chart by TradingView 2. Momentum Remains Bearish With volume falling, only a strong return from buyers can reverse the existing bearish momentum. In the past few weeks, sellers have dominated on volume and price, which has created a large descending triangle with a base at $2.7. By mid-September, XRP will likely decide where it will go next. If lower, there is strong support at $2.5. Chart by TradingView 3. MACD Lower Highs On the weekly timeframe, the MACD shows a clear bearish trend with lower highs and falling momentum.

For the first time, a federal agency has published official GDP data to public blockchains, demonstrating how decentralized technology can safeguard transparency and provide global access to critical economic indicators. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported a Q2 2025 GDP growth rate of 3.3 percent on an annualized basis, with the data hash recorded immutably on TRON with the transaction hash: 3f05633fb894aa6d6610c980975cca732a051edbbf5d8667799782cf2ae04040. TRON’s Role in Securing U.S. Economic Data The Department of Commerce recorded the SHA256 hash of the official GDP release on TRON, acknowledging the network’s proven ability to deliver scale, speed, efficiency, and global accessibility. Processing over $22 billion in daily settlement and more than 8.8 million daily transactions, TRON has emerged as a trusted layer of infrastructure not only for financial markets but also for the secure publication of government data worldwide. “Publishing GDP data on chain is a powerful statement about the role TRON now plays as public infrastructure, not only for payments but for safeguarding some of the world’s most important information,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “This initiative shows how blockchain can advance transparency and trust in ways that strengthen both traditional institutions and decentralized systems. It is only the beginning of how public blockchains like TRON will redefine global access to data and finance.” Publishing the GDP data hash on TRON highlights the role of decentralized networks in preserving data integrity, strengthening accountability, and ensuring open access for citizens, researchers, and policymakers worldwide. It also reflects the United States government’s commitment to leadership in blockchain innovation and to advancing America’s position as the global hub for digital trust and transparency. In August 2025, TRON’s community governance approved a 60 percent reduction in energy fees, sharply lowering transaction costs and immediately driving adoption. Within days, TRON surpassed 2.5 million daily active users, overtaking both BNB Chain and Solana in activity, according to DeFiLlama data. The move was designed to preserve accessibility, particularly for stablecoin transfers, where TRON leads globally with more than $79 billion in USDT circulating on the network. Through its continued commitment to affordability and accessibility, TRON is establishing the foundation for enduring growth and securing its position as a vital infrastructure for the future of the global digital economy. About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $79 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 329 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.” TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | X | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum Media Contact Yeweon Park press@tron.network",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-03 04:47:46

Sellers Took ADA to the Key Support Cardano’s native token tried to hold above the support at $0.90 in late August, but sellers were too strong and the price turned this level into a resistance again. At the time of this post, ADA found good support just above $0.77, and buyers could return here to push it into a relief rally. Chart by TradingView 2. Lower Highs Indicate Weakness If we zoom out on ADA’s price action, we can see that since the end of 2024, the asset has been making lower highs. This is a sign of weakness, even if the price always found strong support above $0.50. The attempts to reclaim a price tag of $1 were rejected every time, and until buyers secure that level, it’s unlikely for ADA to rally higher. Chart by TradingView 3. Volume Dries Up After the spike in buy volume in mid-August, sellers returned and kept the pressure up, with only six daily candles closing in green since then.

The SEC and CFTC released a joint statement Tuesday, saying exchanges registered with either regulator are not prohibited from enabling the trading of certain spot crypto products. The effort shows both agencies working together to expand venue choice and competition in digital markets. “Today’s joint staff statement represents a significant step forward in bringing innovation in the crypto asset markets back to America,” SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said. “Market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets.” Today the SEC and @CFTC issued a Joint Statement clarifying staff’s views that SEC- and CFTC- registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot commodity products: https://t.co/stsgiQTXjf — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) September 2, 2025 Agencies Vow To Work Together On Spot Crypto Oversight CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said the new approach marked a break from the past. “Under the prior administration, our agencies sent mixed signals about regulation and compliance in digital asset markets, but the message was clear: innovation was not welcome. That chapter is over,” she said. The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets and the CFTC’s Divisions of Market Oversight and Clearing and Risk will coordinate efforts to enable spot crypto trading on registered platforms. The initiative forms part of the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint and builds on recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Regulated Platforms Could Reduce Fraud And Manipulation Risks For everyday investors, spot trading means buying and selling cryptocurrencies directly, rather than trading futures contracts or other derivatives linked to their price. If you purchase Bitcoin on a spot exchange, you own the Bitcoin outright, unlike with futures where you only speculate on its value. This form of trading is popular because it is straightforward, immediate and mirrors the way investors already buy and sell stocks. By giving registered exchanges the green light, regulators are aiming to make the process safer. Licensed platforms must follow strict rules, which could reduce risks of fraud or market manipulation that have plagued unregulated crypto exchanges. This could make crypto trading more appealing to both retail and institutional investors. The joint statement also signals that Washington is keen to bring crypto activity back within its borders. Policymakers believe that stronger regulatory clarity will encourage innovation in the United States, rather than push projects overseas. The agencies stressed that they remain open to engaging with market participants. Spot crypto trading already dominates global digital asset markets, with billions of dollars in daily volume. Allowing US-registered exchanges to participate could strengthen the country’s role in the fast-growing sector while offering investors more trusted venues to trade.

Nobel Economics Laureate Warns Of Potential Financial Crisis,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-nobel-laureate-warns-financial-crisis/,"As stablecoin’s momentum continues to surge worldwide, 2014 Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole recently warned about the risks of a potential financial crisis due to the “insufficient supervision” in the sector. Economist Warns Of Multibillion-Dollar Crisis On Monday, Jean Tirole shared his concerns about inadequate stablecoin oversight amid the recent momentum in the sector, affirming that he was “very, very worried” about the lack of sufficient supervision and the potential hidden risks that it could entail. In an interview with the Financial Times (FT), the professor at the Toulouse School of Economics warned of the possibility that governments could be forced into “multibillion-dollar bailouts” if the digital assets, which are considered “a perfectly safe deposit” by retail traders, unravel in a future financial crisis. He also cautioned that backing stablecoins with US government bonds could become unpopular due to the underlying assets’ relatively low yields, noting previous cases when the returns of Treasury debt were negative for several years and payouts after inflation were even lower. Notably, digital assets pegged to the US dollar are required to be backed on a one-to-one basis by US dollars or Treasury bills after the enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in July. As reported by Bitcoinist, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is allegedly “betting” on the crypto industry to become a key buyer of US Treasuries in the coming years. According to a previous FT report, Bessent has signaled to Wall Street that he expects the industry to “become an important source of demand for US government bonds” as Washington seeks to bolster demand for a surge of new US government debt. The Treasury Secretary has reportedly contacted leading stablecoin issuers, like Circle and Tether , for information, signaling the Treasury Department’s alleged plans to increase sales of short-term bills for the coming quarters. Nonetheless, the Global Chief Economist at financial services firm UBS, Paul Donovan, doesn’t believe that the sector will boost the demand for US government bonds. Donovan considers that “stablecoins are more about redistributing the money supply,” adding that “someone selling Treasury bills to buy stablecoins, which invest the money in Treasury bills, does not change demand for U.S. debt instruments.” Better Stablecoin Oversight Required Following the global push for the sector, the stablecoin market has risen to over $280 billion. Last month, Goldman Sachs affirmed that the industry is “at the beginning of a stablecoin gold rush,” which could potentially bring the global market to trillions of dollars. Tirole considers that stablecoin issuers could be “lured into the temptation” to invest in other assets that “carry higher returns and are riskier.” The higher risk would increase the chance of a potential crisis, triggering a run on the tokens. “If it is held by retail or institutional depositors who thought it was a perfectly safe deposit, then the government will be under a lot of pressure to rescue the depositors so they don’t lose their money,” he detailed, adding that only a few uninsured depositors of traditional banks ever faced losses over the past decades. The economist explained that the potential risks could be managed if global supervisors had enough resources and were incentivized to act carefully. However, he warned this was a “big if,” citing personal and political interests of members of “some key members of the [US] administration.” Nonetheless, the US Treasury Secretary considers that the recent regulatory advancements are sufficient to drive the sector’s growth. “The GENIUS Act provides the fast-growing market with the regulatory clarity it needs to grow into a multitrillion-dollar industry,” Bessent said in July.",Crypto News|award-winning economists|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto adoption|crypto oversight|GENIUS Act|Jean Tirole|Nobel Prize|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoin market|Stablecoin regulation|US Treasury bonds,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 05:00:42

The metric in focus blends the short-term holder market-value-to-realized-value (STH-MVRV) ratio with Bollinger Bands to capture when newer coins trade at statistically depressed valuations versus their cost basis. In the chart Frank shared, the STH-MVRV Bollinger oscillator probed the oversold threshold that previously aligned with local exhaustion of selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Historical Pullback Ranges – Healthy Correction Or Trouble Ahead? More Reasons To Be Bullish For Bitcoin On a companion panel, the STH-SOPR gauge—spent-output profit ratio for coins younger than roughly 155 days—remains below 1.0, signaling that recent buyers are realizing losses into the tape rather than profits. “Short-term holders (top buyers) are in pain & realizing losses,” Frank noted, emphasizing that “STH-SOPR is not high!” Positioning has also turned cleaner in derivatives. “Longs got ‘delevered’ every day last week—that’s seven straight days of magic blue dots,” he said, describing persistent long liquidations and balance-sheet shrinkage among leveraged bulls. He is now “watching for the flip: when they give up and start shorting with leverage (exactly at the wrong time), providing fuel for a potential relief squeeze.” Macro context may be additive, in his view. “Gold hit new highs last week. ‘Gold leads, bitcoin follows.’ The yellow metal often looks around corners, and it might be sniffing out the debasement trade headed into 2026 as the administration stokes the economy for mid-terms,” he wrote, suggesting a potential catch-up dynamic if Bitcoin lags the move in bullion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Dumps Billions For ETH, But $5 Billion Selloff Still Looms Risk markers remain clearly defined. Frank pegs the short-term holder realized price—an aggregate cost basis for recent coins—at $108,800. “If BTC breaks down below the short-term holder cost basis of $108.8k, it may want to investigate demand at the 200-day moving average, which sits at $101k.” That layered support map frames the oversold print as a tactical signal inside a still-intact longer-term uptrend, but it also acknowledges that violations of STH cost basis can extend tests toward the cycle’s primary trend gauge. Taken together, the confluence of these signals presents a strong confluence, according to Frank. Whether history rhymes again will hinge on spot demand emerging above short-term cost basis and on whether any shift toward aggressive shorting provides the fuel for a squeeze. As Frank summarized, “If we are in a bull market—and I believe we are—this is the kind of behavior that typically sets the stage for the next leg higher.” At press time, BTC traded at $111,382.

He noted that the continued dominance of SWIFT, a messaging system launched in 1977, is not simply a matter of preference but rather a reflection of the outdated infrastructure underpinning the financial sector. According to Vincent, most major banks operate on IBM z/OS mainframes and decades-old COBOL-based systems, which remain at the core of their daily operations. Van Code pointed out that large vendors, including FIS, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, maintain control over more than 70 percent of U.S. core banking systems. While these platforms are capable of processing billions of dollars in transactions every day, they are characterized by rigidity, high maintenance costs, and entrenched silos. Attempting to replace them is viewed as extremely risky, with core system overhauls typically requiring between five and seven years and involving expenditures in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Most Banks Are Running on 1970s and 1980s Technology—No Wonder SWIFT Hasn’t Been Replaced So why hasn’t Ripple been adopted yet? Why is SWIFT’s market share so protected? Behind polished banking apps, the global financial system runs on mainframes and COBOL code from the… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) September 2, 2025 The Role of SWIFT in Cross-Border Payments In this context, SWIFT has maintained its position as the standard for cross-border payments because it is already universally adopted within the banking sector. Van Code stated that while many banks present polished digital applications to their customers, their back-end systems are still rooted in outdated code. Instead of replacing core systems, institutions generally rely on layering APIs, middleware, and digital interfaces over their legacy frameworks. This approach allows them to continue using SWIFT as the most stable and cost-effective option available. Even enhancements such as SWIFT GPI , which promise faster and more transparent payments, are described by Van Code as temporary fixes rather than a fundamental transformation of the infrastructure. In his view, these updates are patches on a nearly fifty-year-old foundation that continues to dominate due to its universality and entrenched presence in global finance. Ripple as an Alternative Model Van Code contrasted SWIFT’s traditional approach with Ripple’s modern offering. He explained that Ripple represents a fundamentally different model, one that provides instant settlement, transparency, and the ability to free up trillions in trapped liquidity through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. The blockchain-based transparency offered by Ripple reduces reconciliation costs and enables real-time traceability. Furthermore, Ripple has built a regulatory presence across multiple jurisdictions, reinforcing its position as a serious contender in the payments space. Despite these strengths, Van Code highlighted the complexity of adoption. Ripple would need to integrate with thousands of outdated banking cores, navigate an inconsistent regulatory landscape, and overcome skepticism within a highly risk-averse industry. While XRP’s liquidity continues to grow, he added that perceptions surrounding the asset also remain an obstacle to broader adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Road Ahead for Ripple and Global Finance According to Van Code, SWIFT’s ubiquity remains its strongest advantage, as the network effect of its universal adoption continues to shield it from replacement. Breaking this barrier, he argued, will not happen quickly. Instead, Ripple’s best path forward may lie in acting as a bridge technology, complementing SWIFT while gradually proving its resilience and capabilities. He concluded by stating that the technology behind Ripple is ready to support global finance. Still, the critical question is whether banks are prepared to transition from systems that have been in place for half a century. In his assessment, the banking industry’s reluctance to overhaul its core technology remains the central obstacle to meaningful adoption of new payment infrastructures, such as Ripple.

ADA is now rising and might attempt a clear move above the $0.840 zone. ADA price started a decent upward move from the $0.780 support zone. The price is trading above $0.8120 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.8250 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $0.840 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Steady Increase After a sharp decline, Cardano found support near the $0.780 zone and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to surpass the $0.80 and $0.8250 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.8250 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Finally, the price traded close to the $0.840 level. A high was formed at $0.0.8395 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.7822 swing low to the $0.8395 high. Cardano price is now trading above $0.8250 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.840 zone. The first resistance is near $0.860. The next key resistance might be $0.90. If there is a close above the $0.90 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.980 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.00 in the near term. Another Decline In ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.840 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.0.8250 level. The next major support is near the $0.0.8180 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.7822 swing low to the $0.8395 high. A downside break below the $0.8180 level could open the doors for a test of $0.780. The next major support is near the $0.750 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already surged 300% from its starting price of $0.01, quickly becoming one of the standout success stories of the year. Traders are paying attention not just because of the impressive price growth, but also because the project is delivering what many presales fail to achieve: strong adoption, a clear product, and early signs of market confidence. As anticipation builds ahead of its launch, analysts are noting that MUTM isn’t just another hype-driven token; it’s a DeFi protocol with utility applications. This combination of fast presale growth and long-term fundamentals is why traders are rushing to accumulate the token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The presale journey of Mutuum Finance has been nothing short of remarkable. Starting at $0.01, the token has advanced to its current $0.035 in Phase 6, already handing early participants 300% gains. With the next phase set at $0.04 and a confirmed $0.06 launch price, the incentive for early entry is obvious. So far, Mutuum Finance has raised over $15.25 million and attracted more than 15,950 holders, a clear sign of investor confidence. Presales often struggle to maintain momentum beyond their initial phases, yet MUTM’s consistent growth suggests strong conviction in the project’s potential. By the time the token launches, Phase 6 participants will already have a near double gain, setting the stage for further upside as liquidity expands. Why investors are buying early The appeal of entering early is simple: it maximizes potential returns while minimizing entry cost. A $750 investment at $0.035 secures 21,400 tokens, which would already be worth $1,300 at launch ($0.06). When MUTM meets analyst predictions of climbing toward $0.30–$1 by 2026, that same holding could be valued between $6,430 and $21,430. Whale activity has also been notable. Several large wallets have been tracked entering the presale, providing additional confidence that experienced investors see the token’s upside. In crypto, whale inflows often act as a signal of future momentum, and their presence in Mutuum Finance has reinforced investor sentiment that this is one presale worth accumulating. Beta platform and lending markets The protocol is built around dual lending markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Investors supply assets such as ETH or USDC into liquidity pools, earning interest based on utilization. Borrowers access these funds by providing collateral worth more than their loan, ensuring system stability. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Lenders and borrowers can create direct agreements with customized loan terms. For example, a DAI lender could negotiate directly with a USDT borrower, securing better rates than standardized pools. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens (e.g., mtETH for ETH), which increase in redemption value as interest accrues. These tokens can later be redeemed for the underlying asset plus yield or staked in the safety module to earn MUTM rewards. Importantly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its beta platform as token listing begins. This means that from day one, investors will be able to lend, borrow, and stake on a working protocol. The presence of a live product from the outset also increases the likelihood of listings on top-tier exchanges, as platforms like Binance and Coinbase typically prioritize tokens that demonstrate immediate functionality and user traction. Such listings would not only expand MUTM’s visibility but also drive trading momentum and liquidity, potentially accelerating the token’s value growth in its early stages. Long-term drivers The long-term appeal of Mutuum Finance lies not just in its presale success, but in its forward-looking roadmap: Stablecoin Development: Mutuum Finance is building an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. Dollar, minted when users supply collateral into the protocol and burned when loans are repaid. This ensures every unit in circulation is fully backed, maintaining transparency and trust. Beyond stability, it creates new use cases such as trading pairs, liquidity pools, and stable borrowing options, while also reinforcing the platform’s treasury and supporting long-term adoption. Buy-and-Distribute Model: Instead of relying on inflationary rewards, Mutuum Finance uses platform fees to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This process creates ongoing buy pressure tied directly to platform usage, helping support token demand while rewarding committed participants. By linking value growth to actual activity, the model promotes sustainability and long-term holder confidence. Together, these growth drivers create a self-sustaining ecosystem where lending demand, stablecoin issuance, and staking rewards all contribute to token value. High-growth coin With a 300% surge in presale price, more than $15.25 million raised, and a community of 15,950+ holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already established itself as one of the most successful token launches of 2025. Its combination of early investor gains, whale inflows, immediate product utility, and ambitious roadmap explains why traders are eager to accumulate before exchange listings. While established tokens like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana continue to dominate headlines, their growth is limited compared to newer projects with greater upside potential. For traders seeking the next big cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance offers a rare blend of affordability, utility, and momentum. If history is any guide, projects that launch with strong presale support and real functionality often become the market’s breakout performers. MUTM appears to be following that path, making it one of the top cryptos to buy now before the wider market catches on.

Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies is the largest corporate ETH holder with close to 1.9 million ETH, which is valued at more than $8.1 billion, alongside $635 million in cash and Bitcoin holdings. The news boosted BitMine’s stock, which has gained over 40% in the past month. ARK Invest also expanded its stake in the company and chairman Tom Lee recently reiterated his bullish views on Ethereum’s long-term outlook. Ethereum Foundation to Trim Holdings Again The Ethereum Foundation (EF) revealed plans to sell roughly $43 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) as part of its strategy to fund ecosystem growth, research, development, and donations. In a post on X , the foundation said it will convert 10,000 ETH, which was valued at around $4,342 per token at the time of the announcement, using centralized exchanges over several weeks. EF clarified that the sale would be executed through multiple smaller orders rather than a single large transaction to limit any potential market disruption. This move was announced shortly after EF temporarily paused its open grant applications to revamp the process. By the first quarter of 2025, the foundation already distributed over $32 million in grants, with allocations spanning education, community initiatives, and research. The group also implemented a treasury policy in June that outlined its approach to Ethereum sales, including periodic evaluations of fiat reserves and calculated decisions on how much ETH should be sold in a given quarter. Since then, EF has sold about $25 million in Ethereum to SharpLink Gaming and conducted additional sales totaling $12.7 million across two separate transactions. The foundation’s history of ETH sales includes a big December 2020 liquidation of 100,000 ETH, which coincided with Ethereum’s run to new all-time highs in the following months. While EF is trimming its holdings to sustain its operations, other players are making moves in the opposite direction. Yunfeng Financial Group disclosed that it bought 10,000 ETH in the open market on the same day, while Ether Machine announced it secured 150,000 ETH to build a corporate treasury ahead of a planned Nasdaq listing. Ether Machine’s total ETH holdings now includes more than 345,000 tokens, valued at around $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, bullish sentiment around Ethereum is also building. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin suggested that Wall Street’s adoption of staking and decentralized infrastructure could push ETH to surpass Bitcoin as a monetary base. Additionally, after hints from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about adjusting US interest rate policy, ETH surged more than 23% in the last month, and was trading hands at $4,334 at the time of writing.

BitMine treasury holdings growth (Source: BitMine ) Altogether, BitMine’s capital amounts to roughly $8.98 billion, giving it a commanding lead over other corporate Ethereum holders. According to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve , the second-largest corporate treasury is SharpLink Gaming, which currently holds around 837.23K ETH, worth approximately $3.64 billion. Top ETH reserve companies ( Source: Strategic ETH Reserve ) The market reacted positively to BitMine’s announcement, with shares trading at $44.13 after a 1.12% increase on the day, according to Google Finance. The company’s stock also surged by close to 41% in the past month, climbing from $31.13 on Aug. 4. The strong performance comes on the back of aggressive treasury-building by the firm. Earlier in August, BitMine added 373,000 ETH to its holdings in just one week, even as its shares dipped by more than 14% during that period. BitMine’s momentum also attracted the attention of major institutional investors. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest added another $15.6 million worth of BitMine shares last month, bringing its total investment in the company to more than $300 million. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who also serves as BitMine’s chairman, said in late August that Ethereum’s price was approaching a bottom, even though the token slipped about 2.5% since then.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MACROECONOMICS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-03 05:30:00

While meme tokens like DOGE and SHIB continue to enjoy large communities and cultural relevance, traders are shifting toward projects that offer both affordability and real-world utility. This transition has placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly in the spotlight as analysts highlight it as one of the most promising tokens to watch heading into the next market cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is no stranger to the spotlight. Launched as a meme token, it became a global phenomenon during the 2021 bull run, fueled by viral hype and endorsements from high-profile figures. Back then, early investors saw astronomical gains as DOGE skyrocketed from fractions of a cent to over $0.70. Today, however, Dogecoin trades near $0.22, far below its all-time high. Despite maintaining a loyal community and occasional bursts of excitement, its lack of structural utility has limited its ability to sustain momentum. DOGE still holds a top position by market cap, but traders who once looked to it for life-changing returns are now seeking projects that combine narrative strength with meaningful technological innovation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) During the meme coin boom, Shiba Inu trailed Dogecoin’s rise, moving from obscurity to becoming one of the market’s most discussed tokens. Its community-driven movement was powerful, and initiatives like Shibarium, its layer-2 scaling solution, were designed to extend its utility beyond memes. Currently, SHIB trades at fractions of a cent, and while it remains an active player in the meme token space, its performance has slowed significantly. The sheer size of its supply makes large price moves more difficult, and its catalysts have struggled to match the excitement of its breakout years. For many traders, SHIB remains stable but no longer offers the kind of explosive growth potential that early holders enjoyed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Against this backdrop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a powerful alternative for investors seeking early entry into a project with real upside. As a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, Mutuum Finance unites lending, borrowing, and liquidation within one platform. What sets it apart is its dual lending structure. Through peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, users can supply assets into liquidity pools, while peer-to-peer (P2P) lending allows borrowers and lenders to directly agree on terms. This combination ensures both deep liquidity and flexibility for participants. Lenders in the system receive mtTokens, interest-bearing tokens that increase in redemption value over time. Unlike traditional deposit receipts, mtTokens remain transferable ERC-20 tokens, allowing holders to trade them on secondary markets while still earning interest. This feature creates utility beyond simple staking, turning mtTokens into versatile yield-generating assets. To support long-term growth, Mutuum Finance also employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of protocol fees is used to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This system creates sustained buy pressure, ensuring that demand for the token continues to grow as the platform scales. The presale has already attracted significant attention. Mutuum Finance has raised over $15.3 million and built a base of more than 15,950 holders. At its current presale price of $0.035, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, early investors are positioned to secure nearly a 100% upside before trading begins. For those aiming to maximize returns, getting in early has become a crucial advantage. Growth catalysts driving analyst predictions Several features in Mutuum Finance’s roadmap strengthen its long-term case. At the top of the list is the beta launch of the platform, which is scheduled to go live as soon as the token lists. Unlike many projects that debut without utility, MUTM will enter the market with fully functioning lending and borrowing features from day one. The protocol also plans to introduce a stable interest rate model, giving borrowers predictable repayment options alongside variable rates. This flexibility appeals to a wider user base and supports sustainable adoption. Beyond its core protocol, Mutuum Finance is creating an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed by ecosystem assets and designed to maintain a US Dollar peg. This stablecoin will expand the protocol’s utility while strengthening reserves. Together, these catalysts provide Mutuum Finance with multiple growth drivers that extend well beyond the initial presale hype, making it a project positioned for lasting relevance. Why MUTM outshines DOGE and SHIB When compared directly, the differences are clear. Dogecoin is still primarily driven by community hype, while Shiba Inu, despite its ecosystem efforts, continues to struggle under the weight of its massive supply. Both remain popular but have limited ability to replicate their earlier explosive runs. Mutuum Finance stands out by offering investors both cost-effective entry and practical utility. At just $0.035, it represents a low-cost entry point with the potential to deliver significant returns. For example, an investor allocating $900 at $0.035 would secure approximately 25,700 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.75 in a future bull run, that position would be worth around $19,300. Gains of this magnitude are far less likely to be achieved with DOGE or SHIB at their current stages of maturity. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain staples of the crypto conversation, but their growth momentum has slowed, and their upside is increasingly limited. Investors preparing for the next bull run are turning toward tokens that combine affordability with functionality. With its presale momentum, $15.3 million raised, over 15,950 holders, innovative lending system, and upcoming beta launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the strongest contenders for 2025. Analysts are clear: for those asking what is the best cryptocurrency to buy before the bull run, the answer may very well be Mutuum Finance.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly capturing the attention of whales seeking DeFi projects with real-world application, sticky usage, and controlled risk mechanisms. Its $1-peg stablecoin, precise oracle-driven valuations, and structured lending environment offer a combination of security and growth potential that contrasts sharply with meme-driven speculation. $1-peg stablecoin and lending mechanics that drive growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) revolves around a decentralized stablecoin designed to stay close to $1. The minting process only occurs when users borrow against overcollateralized assets such as ETH, BNB, or other approved tokens, while burning happens automatically when loans are repaid or liquidated. Only approved issuers are allowed to mint, each with a capped allocation to manage systemic risk. Governance actively adjusts borrowing rates to maintain the peg, while arbitrage opportunities ensure the stablecoin price stays aligned near $1. The combination of borrowing demand and stablecoin usage ensures continuous platform activity, positioning MUTM as a utility-first DeFi project. The protocol supports both variable and stable interest rates. Variable rates adjust dynamically based on pool utilization, while stable rates provide predictable repayment costs. These stable rates start higher than variable rates to compensate for predictability and are subject to rebalancing whenever the current supply rate drops below 90% of what would apply under a fully variable model. Not all tokens qualify for stable borrowing, ensuring that only assets with sufficient liquidity and low volatility participate, protecting platform solvency. On the lending side, P2C pools allow users to deposit blue-chip assets like BNB or ETH. Borrowers can take advantage of risk-tiered LTVs; posting $3,500 in MATIC at 55% LTV enables borrowing $1,925 in a supported asset, with repayments following the chosen rate structure and liquidation thresholds strictly enforced. P2P arrangements cater to higher-risk assets such as SHIB, DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP, and PEPE, allowing isolated contracts with elevated returns while shielding core liquidity from volatility. The presale is currently in Phase 6, with a current price of $0.035. Around $15.24 million has been raised so far, with over 15,950 holders and 32% of the 170 million tokens already sold. The next presale phase will increase the price by 15% to $0.040, representing the last discounted entry before the token gains broader exposure. Early participation allows investors to benefit from the stablecoin-driven platform growth, structured risk management, and eventual listing liquidity. Risk management, price discovery, and strategic roadmap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) applies rigorous risk controls to balance growth and security. Stable assets like USDT and ETH are eligible for up to 75% LTV with liquidation thresholds around 80%, while higher-volatility tokens carry more conservative caps, generally 35–40% LTV with a 65% liquidation threshold. Deposit and borrow caps, Restricted Collateralization Mode, and reserve factor scaling further protect the protocol during extreme market events. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency improves borrowing capacity for correlated stable assets without overexposing the system. Price discovery is anchored in Chainlink oracle feeds for USD and native asset pairs, with fallback or aggregated feeds and DEX TWAPs providing redundancy. This ensures fair valuations and smooth liquidation execution during volatility spikes, keeping the lending ecosystem robust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap spans four phases: Phase 1 covers presale, marketing, helpdesk, audit requests, and giveaways; Phase 2 focuses on building the core smart contracts and infrastructure; Phase 3 finalizes beta testing and exchange listing preparations; Phase 4 delivers the live platform, multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and additional feature enhancements. The beta launch will coincide with the token’s live event, allowing users to engage with the platform before broader exchange activity. Security Security and community trust are reinforced through a CertiK audit, which includes Manual Review and Static Analysis, earning a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a CertiK Skynet score of 78.00, with the audit timeline requested on 2/25/2025 and revised on 5/20/2025. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program rewards issues by severity—Critical up to $2,000, Major up to $1,000, Medium up to $500, and Low up to $200. A $100K giveaway awards ten participants $10,000 worth of MUTM each, while 12K+ Twitter followers indicate strong social engagement. Investment examples highlight MUTM’s upside potential. A Phase 1 participant who rotated $1,200 from BTC is already positioned with strong paper gains at $0.035 and sees a straightforward path toward the $1 milestone, underpinned by stablecoin usage, oracle-backed liquidations, and beta platform activity. A new buyer entering at $0.035 before the 15% uplift is similarly positioned to ride the utility-driven growth story. As traders consider why crypto is down and watch traditional crypto ETFs for stability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a utility-driven DeFi opportunity. Phase 6 is 32% sold, and the next 15% price increase signals the last window to enter at a discounted rate. Unlike DOGE, the $1 narrative for MUTM is anchored in real usage, robust risk management, and strategic beta deployment, giving investors a practical path toward substantial returns.

That history has inspired a constant hunt for the “next ETH moment,” where an emerging project delivers both disruptive technology and exponential upside. In the midst of volatile crypto prices today, whispers among retail communities are pointing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the token with the ingredients to follow that legendary path. Retail traders seek the next ETH moment What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its design around stability and efficiency in decentralized finance. A central piece of the project’s ecosystem is its stablecoin, pegged at $1, that will be minted only through overcollateralized loans. This ensures that every unit of stablecoin in circulation is backed by assets worth more than its face value, protecting against under-collateralization risks that have destabilized other protocols. Interest rates will adjust dynamically to maintain the peg. If demand for the stablecoin rises and the price drifts higher than $1, borrowing costs will fall to encourage new supply. If the peg slips below, rates will increase to contract issuance and restore balance. Alongside this, arbitrage opportunities will keep traders incentivized to close the gap quickly, reinforcing the stablecoin’s resilience. For retail traders who watched previous experiments fail during a crypto crash, this type of transparent, rule-based framework inspires confidence. The combination of borrower rate structures, liquidity controls, and oracle-driven transparency is why many see MUTM as more than just another presale—it is a system designed for long-term adoption. Much like ETH once proved with its smart contracts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself with real utility from day one. Presale growth and retail momentum The presale is in Phase 6, with tokens priced at $0.035. Over $15.24 million has already been raised, and one-third of this round is sold out with 15,950 holders onboarded. Once this allocation closes, the price will climb by 15% to $0.040. Retail traders who understand the rhythm of presales know that each stage creates a built-in upside, accelerating momentum before listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not limiting its ambitions to presale fundraising. The team has mapped a four-phase roadmap that outlines development from beta testing to scaled adoption. The beta launch of the platform will go live alongside the token’s launch, ensuring immediate functionality rather than delaying utility. This commitment resonates with traders who have seen too many projects listed without delivering a working product. Compliance is another part of the blueprint, showing that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) understands the importance of trust in DeFi. The protocol has undergone a full audit with CertiK, earning strong technical scores, and is running a $100,000 giveaway to encourage broader retail participation while reinforcing its community-first approach. Security layers like these matter when retail investors weigh new entries, especially after years of market headlines highlighting weakly protected projects. For many traders, the opportunity here is as much about timing as it is about fundamentals. Every presale has a window before listing when discounted entry is still possible, and once tokens shift into public exchange liquidity, that advantage closes. This is where fear of missing out builds. Those who wait too long to secure allocations will be competing in open markets where early investors already hold significant multiples. Conclusion That is why comparisons to ETH’s early cycle are surfacing with increasing frequency in retail circles. Ethereum once offered a simple value proposition that evolved into an unstoppable ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its stablecoin, lending mechanisms, and roadmap aligned with real adoption, is earning the same type of early confidence. While nothing in crypto is ever identical, the structure of MUTM’s growth path makes the parallel hard to ignore. As retail traders search for the project that replicates ETH’s early breakout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a frontrunner. At $0.035 today with a clear trajectory toward higher stages, the decision for many is whether to wait until exchanges take control of price discovery—or join the presale window while it remains open. For those chasing the next big crypto investment, this DeFi project is already shaping up to be one of the most talked-about opportunities in the market.

Regulatory clarity received a boost when the SEC and CFTC issued a joint statement stating that registered exchanges can offer spot cryptocurrency trading, including with margin and leverage. No assets were named, but it’s a more friendly US stance towards digital assets. The announcement follows recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and could pave the way for the NYSE and Nasdaq to list spot Bitcoin and Ethereum products. This shift aligns with broader policy from the Trump administration, which has reduced lawsuits and encouraged growth across the crypto sector. For BTC, the approval adds legitimacy, increases access for U.S. investors, and strengthens institutional confidence. Strategy’s $449M Bitcoin Buy Reinforces Confidence Institutional demand remains a central driver. Last week, Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased 4,048 BTC for $449 million at an average price of $110,981, raising its August total to 7,714 BTC. This figure is smaller than July’s massive 31,000 BTC acquisition but still underscores consistent conviction. Strategy has acquired 4,048 BTC for ~$449.3 million at ~$110,981 per bitcoin. Most shares purchased by issuing an additional 1.2 million $MSTR shares. pic.twitter.com/zPbOBTdSip — FinancialFreedom (@FinFreedom414) September 2, 2025 In total, Strategy now holds 636,505 BTC, worth around $46.95 billion, at an average cost of $73,765 per coin. Saylor has described the company’s equity offerings as a “Bitcoin defense department,” funding large-scale purchases while reinforcing its long-term view of BTC as a reserve asset. Despite raising dividends to 10% in July, Strategy’s stock has fallen 16%, sparking debate over sustainability. Yet its steady accumulation continues to act as a bullish signal, supporting BTC above $110,000. Key takeaways from recent activity: SEC and CFTC authorize spot trading on registered exchanges. Strategy buys $449M in BTC, lifting total holdings above 636K BTC. Retail adoption continues with small businesses and payment products. Small Businesses and Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Adoption is no longer just an institutional story. Tahini’s, the Canadian shawarma chain owned by the Hamam brothers, has been buying Bitcoin since 2020 to hedge against currency debasement. Inspired by the early BTC advocates, the company has grown to 65 locations , added a Bitcoin ATM, and is opening its first US location. They are still buying Bitcoin for its utility and growth potential. Tahinis just purchased Bitcoin. We also just opened our 65th restaurant. We are also opening our first restaurant in the US (Loves Park, Illinois) in a few weeks. Big month for Tahinis — Tahini’s (@TheRealTahinis) September 2, 2025 On the charts, Bitcoin is showing resilience after rebounding from $108,500. The RSI has climbed to 57, signaling improved buying strength, while the MACD histogram has turned positive, indicating a potential bullish crossover. Price action has also produced bullish engulfing candles, reinforcing momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin is pressing resistance near $111,745. A breakout could target $113,435 and $115,475, breaking the descending channel and shifting sentiment toward accumulation. Failure to hold would bring $108,500 and $107,300 back into play. For traders, the outlook leans bullish. If Bitcoin clears $111,745 with conviction, the path toward $130,000 becomes increasingly credible. With regulatory clarity, institutional confidence, and retail adoption aligning, Bitcoin’s consolidation may be less a ceiling and more the base for its next major rally. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $13.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012845—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

Analysts claim a $0.035 gem could beat both on road to $5,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/03/xrp-vs-ada-which-is-stronger-analysts-claim-a-0-035-gem-could-beat-both-on-road-to-5/,"As the crypto market oscillates, investors are constantly comparing legacy tokens like XRP and ADA. Both have seen bursts of momentum in the past, but in recent months, their growth has slowed, leaving traders and long-term holders searching for asymmetric opportunities. Analysts now suggest that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing presale, is positioned to outperform both, with a potential path to $5 in the coming years. Unlike tokens relying on hype cycles, MUTM’s foundation is built on real DeFi utility and structured financial design, which is expected to support sustainable growth and demand. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale will continue to attract attention, having already generated $15.24 million with over 15,950 holders participating. Currently, 32% of this phase’s supply has been claimed, setting the stage for a 15% price increase in the next phase from $0.035 to $0.040. This makes the timing critical for investors seeking early entry into a project with high structural leverage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fully audited by CertiK, earning a Token Scan score of 95, giving participants confidence in the protocol’s security and operational integrity. Stronger fundamentals drive MUTM’s future upside One of the core mechanisms that will increase demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its reserve factor, which will capture a portion of borrower interest to form a strong on-chain safety buffer. This accumulation will provide deployable assets for treasury operations and incentives, effectively creating a channel where growing borrowing activity will translate into higher protocol-backed utility for MUTM. Liquidity-aware liquidation incentives will ensure that undercollateralized positions close efficiently with minimal slippage, maintaining orderly markets and preserving confidence in the system. This approach contrasts sharply with legacy coins that occasionally experience flash crashes and unpredictable liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also employ a robust oracle strategy, combining Chainlink primary feeds with fallback and aggregated sources as well as DEX TWAPs. This design will provide accurate pricing and reliable liquidation triggers, allowing both lenders and borrowers to act with certainty. Caps on deposits and borrowing, along with a restricted collateral mode, will reduce systemic risk and prevent exposure to illiquid assets, further reinforcing trust. Analysts see these risk management structures as a foundation for broader adoption, making MUTM a DeFi gem that can withstand market volatility while supporting predictable revenue streams. Growth catalysts set to propel MUTM to $5 The upcoming beta launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will coincide with the token live event, enabling real users to engage with borrowing, lending, and staking features from day one. This real-world adoption is expected to generate recurring fee revenue and enhance token utility. In addition, Layer-2 integration will dramatically reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, enabling frequent micro-loans and repeated participation in staking programs. Combined with the $1-peg stablecoin that anchors the platform, these features are anticipated to drive liquidity, recurring usage, and long-term demand for MUTM. Expected listings on top-tier exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken, will further amplify the token’s visibility and accessibility to global retail and institutional investors. This exposure will complement the protocol’s internal demand drivers, positioning MUTM as a high-potential token in the DeFi market. Conservative models predict that the combined effect of beta-driven usage, Layer-2 efficiency, and mtToken staking lock-up could materially increase demand while increasing effective demand, reinforcing the trajectory toward a $5 valuation. Memorize that borrowing depends on the LTV ratio, and lending yield depends on pool utilization and the LTV ratio. With Phase 6 already 32% sold and a 15% price increase imminent, investors are encouraged to act decisively. XRP and ADA may stall in the months ahead, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to chart its own path, potentially becoming the $5 breakout story of DeFi in the coming years while offering a robust alternative for disciplined crypto investment and strong portfolio diversification.

(TSMC)’s clearance to freely send key equipment to its biggest chipmaking hub in China, raising the risk of disruptions at the facility. The US has decided to strip the chipmaker of its validated end user (VEU) privileges for its Nanjing facility, a step in line with earlier rollbacks of Samsung and SK Hynix’s China operations. The exemptions will phase out over the next four months. The company stated , “TSMC has received notification from the US government that our VEU authorization for TSMC Nanjing will be revoked effective Dec. 31, 2025.” The company said it is still assessing the situation and engaging with US authorities, though it remains committed to running its Nanjing plant without disruption. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs stated the waiver loss could stir uncertainty on Nanjing’s production Without VEU privileges, TSMC’s vendors must seek individual licenses for each shipment of US-controlled semiconductor tools to Nanjing, rather than relying on automatic authorization. US regulators have assured companies that they will give the necessary approvals to keep operations going. However, companies now face doubt over how quickly permits can be obtained. License requests are already piling up, and officials are reportedly trying to find fixes to simplify the approval process. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs has even argued that scrapping the US waiver would create uncertainty around the Nanjing factory’s output. Even so, the Nanjing plant makes up about 3% of TSMC’s total production capacity, and thus, the ministry expects little impact on Taiwan’s overall chip competitiveness. Still, TSMC’s US-listed American depositary receipts fell as much as 2.3% on Tuesday. Currently, per Bloomberg’s data, Applied Materials, ASML, Tokyo Electron, and KLA are TSMC’s biggest suppliers. Though their stocks slid on Tuesday, Applied Materials and KLA in New York trading and ASML and Tokyo Electron through their ADRs posted steeper losses than the market overall. The companies were already operating under US curbs on China shipments, and the loss of the waiver could introduce further complications for their work with TSMC. The BIS revoked Samsung and SK Hynix VEU licenses Last week, US regulators stripped Samsung and SK Hynix of their validated end-user designations, saying the change was aimed at plugging “export control loopholes” that exposed US companies to unfair competition. The federal register was updated to reflect the removals and Intel’s former status for its Dalian factory, which SK Hynix later bought. Officials said the action would add roughly 1,000 new license reviews annually. TSMC’s VEU status was never published in the Federal Register, leaving BIS nothing to formally amend. However, the practical impact doesn’t differ—suppliers to the chipmakers’ Chinese facilities will soon need US approval for restricted tool shipments. The US has rolled out broad export restrictions to keep China from securing American chipmaking tools that could be used for advanced semiconductors and AI. Those curbs affect not only Chinese companies but also facilities owned by Samsung, SK Hynix, and TSMC in the country. Biden’s team allowed TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix to continue shipping gear to their China facilities under an indefinite waiver, provided they adhered to security conditions and transparency requirements. The VEU designation, made public through US announcements for the Korean firms and in TSMC’s filings, was considered a key safeguard for their governments, since fabs depend on frequent imports.

Recent whale flows into altcoins suggest that the hunt for projects capable of delivering multiples beyond 40x is intensifying. Unlike speculative bets, these rotations are increasingly guided by fundamentals, risk frameworks, and transparent mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a project that meets this checklist, combining stablecoin utility, disciplined lending mechanics, and oracle-driven price discovery to offer traders a structured path to outsized gains. BTC whales rotate $1B into alts Bitcoin (BTC) whales shifted $1 billion into altcoins over the past week, ending August 31, 2025, contributing to BTC’s dominance dropping to ~59%. BTC trades at ~$113,000, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45 billion, down 2.3% weekly. The rotation, favoring assets like Ethereum and Solana, aligns with $800 million in BTC liquidations amid US tariff concerns and Federal Reserve uncertainty. Technical indicators show BTC testing $112,000 support, with RSI at 46 and resistance at $116,713. Social media reflects growing altcoin enthusiasm, with whale moves signaling a potential altcoin season. Analysts project BTC could hit $121,500 if $116,713 breaks, but a drop below $112,000 risks $110,000, further boosting altcoin momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): utility and risk tooling that appeals to whales Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized borrowing-and-lending protocol designed to balance growth with safety. Borrowers will be required to overcollateralize positions, with LTV ratios dynamically adjusted based on asset volatility. Liquidation triggers are carefully calibrated, ensuring undercollateralized positions are flagged for corrective action, while liquidation penalties reward liquidators and feed the protocol’s reserve factor. The reserve factor itself varies by asset, with stablecoins carrying lower rates and high-volatility tokens carrying higher allocations to offset systemic risk. Deposit caps and borrow caps prevent excessive exposure to any single token, while Restricted Collateralization Mode isolates high-risk or illiquid assets, preventing contagion across pools. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency allows correlated assets, such as stablecoins, to achieve higher LTVs, improving capital efficiency without jeopardizing protocol solvency. Collectively, these features create an environment where whales can deploy significant capital without unnecessary exposure to extreme price swings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stable interest-rate model adds another layer of predictability. The initial rate is locked at a weighted average of the variable rate plus market indicators, starting higher to compensate for future predictability. A rebalancing condition is triggered when the current supply rate falls below 90% of the hypothetical all-variable scenario, allowing the protocol to adjust stable rates to maintain liquidity integrity. Not all tokens qualify for this model, ensuring volatile or low-liquidity assets do not undermine system stability. P2C, P2P lending, and presale momentum Lending on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer compelling yields. For example, depositing $20,000 USDT into a P2C pool with a utilization-driven 13% APY generates $2,600 annually. A borrower posting $14,000 in BTC at 70% LTV can borrow $9,800, with repayments following the variable rate path. For higher-risk tokens like PEPE, FLOKI, DOGE, SHIB, and TRUMP, P2P arrangements allow direct negotiation between lenders and borrowers, isolating risk while providing opportunities for higher returns. The presale is currently in Phase 6, priced at $0.035. Around $15.24 million has been raised so far, with 32% of the 170 million allocated tokens already sold and over 15,950 holders onboard. The next presale stage will increase the price by 15% to $0.040, presenting the last discounted entry for new participants. This timing aligns with the platform’s roadmap, which progresses from initial presale and marketing in Phase 1, to core development in Phase 2, final beta testing in Phase 3, and a multi-chain live launch with token listings and institutional partnerships in Phase 4. The beta will go live alongside the token, providing early users the opportunity to interact with the platform before exchange liquidity takes over. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures precise price discovery through Chainlink oracles, with fallback and aggregated feeds, and DEX TWAPs as backup. Borrow interest rates adjust dynamically according to pool utilization, maintaining healthy liquidity even in volatile conditions. Security and community trust are reinforced through a CertiK audit (Manual Review and Static Analysis), with a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, alongside a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program that rewards critical issues up to $2,000. A $100K giveaway rewards ten early participants with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, while 12K+ Twitter followers reflect a growing and engaged community. Final words Early investment examples highlight the potential for outsized returns. A Phase 2 allocator who rotated $5,000 from ETH now sits with projected gains toward a 43x target, driven by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin minting and burning activity, disciplined rate models, and oracle-backed liquidation safeguards. New entrants at $0.035 before the 15% step-up similarly position themselves for substantial upside, benefiting from structured risk frameworks and beta exposure. As BTC continues to anchor institutions and broader crypto ETFs, traders searching for asymmetric returns see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a disciplined opportunity with 43x growth potential.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Dalio described crypto as an “alternative currency” with limited supply. He argued that if the supply of dollars rises or demand for them falls, investors may increasingly view crypto as a better option. Dalio, who built Bridgewater Associates into the world’s largest hedge fund, wrote to clarify comments he made in a recent Financial Times interview. He said most fiat currencies, particularly those burdened with large debts, will struggle to maintain value. History, he noted, offers parallels, with similar dynamics playing out between 1930 and 1940 and again from 1970 to 1980. https://t.co/TNyPpZYTmZ — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) September 2, 2025 Mounting Debt Loads Weigh On Appeal Of Reserve Currencies He added that deregulation does not threaten the dollar’s reserve currency status. Instead, he pointed to the mounting debt loads of the US and other reserve-currency issuers as the real danger, arguing that these conditions undermine their appeal as both reserve assets and stores of wealth. This, he said, has contributed to rising prices for gold and cryptocurrencies. Dalio also dismissed concerns that stablecoins , many of which are backed by US Treasuries, pose systemic risks. The bigger issue, he said, lies in the falling purchasing power of Treasuries themselves. “That shouldn’t produce any systemic risk in stablecoins if they are well-regulated,” he wrote. Investor Warns US Faces ‘Classic Devaluation’ Of Its Currency In July, Dalio advised investors to allocate about 15% of their portfolios to Bitcoin or gold . He warned that the US is heading toward a “classic devaluation” of its currency, similar to the episodes of the 1930s and 1970s, as the country approaches what he called a “point of no return” in its debt crisis. Billionaire Ray Dalio recommends 15% Bitcoin allocation warning of 'classic fiat currency devaluation' as US debt reaches unsustainable point of no return. #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/L9BnkbqT0H — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 28, 2025 He laid out stark figures to make his case. The US government spends about $7 trillion annually while raising only $5 trillion in revenue, leaving a $2 trillion deficit. To cover its obligations, Washington must sell an estimated $12 trillion in new debt in the coming year. Interest payments alone have reached $1 trillion annually, representing half the budget deficit. Gold’s Role As Second-Largest Reserve Asset Drives Dalio’s Preference Dalio has consistently shown a preference for gold over Bitcoin, citing gold’s role as the world’s second-largest reserve asset. While he sees potential in digital currencies, he continues to view the precious metal as a stronger hedge. Earlier this year, Dalio cautioned that the US could face a crisis deeper than a recession if President Donald Trump mismanages tariffs and broader economic policy. Dalio’s latest remarks reflect a growing chorus of concern among investors who see ballooning debt as the biggest threat to the dollar’s dominance.

The sales development company has acquired 500 BTC with the sale proceeds, a company release said. CIMG’s board noted that the Bitcoin purchase aligns with the firm’s financial management strategy and long-term Bitcoin holding agenda. “Moving forward, the company intends to continue to increase its digital asset reserves and pursue collaborations across AI and crypto ecosystems, such as Merlin Chain,” said Wang Jianshuang, CEO of CIMG. CIMG, which also focuses on digital health, sold the shares via a private placement pursuant to Regulation S. This means that the transaction is exempt from the US SEC Securities Act registration requirements. Nasdaq-listed CIMG Inc. announced the completion of the sale of 220 million common shares, raising a total of $55 million in exchange for 500 Bitcoin, as part of its long-term Bitcoin holding strategy to establish a Bitcoin reserve. https://t.co/Qqp5bFAV8m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 3, 2025 Bitcoin Reserves Quickly Become New Corporate Strategy Playbook Several companies have established corporate crypto treasuries, following the successful accumulation of Bitcoin by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. There are over 170 Bitcoin Treasury Companies in operation, where the majority have dissolved their original business plan to instead focus on raising equity to buy Bitcoin. Thomas Fecker-Boxler, Interim CEO of the Web3 Foundation, believes the recent wave of corporate treasuries moving into Bitcoin is less a surprise and more a predictable outcome of capital chasing easy gains. Speaking to Cryptonews, he said that the trend is “double-edged,” carrying the risk of instability. “The silver lining is that a new segment of capital is entering the market, potentially broadening adoption and deepening liquidity,” he noted. “But this is less a sign of structural maturity than opportunistic allocation. Ultimately, the trend is double-edged: it brings fresh capital and visibility, but also carries the risk of instability if approached purely as a financial play.” Further, he compared the dynamics with those of traditional markets, “where momentum builds, balance sheets stretch, and structures eventually unwind in a disorderly fashion.” “The sustainability of corporate crypto treasuries will depend less on short-term enthusiasm and more on the leverage and balance sheet structures behind them—especially where convertibles and convexity are involved.” CIMG Stock Tumbles 3.53% CIMG’s pivot to Bitcoin treasury comes at a time when the firm is facing significant financial challenges, with declining revenue, negative profit margins, and financial instability. The company’s income statement shows a substantial downturn. Following the BTC accumulation plan announcement, CIMG stock fell 3.53% on Tuesday, closing at $0.2543.

CBD Data Shows Divergence In Spot Activity For Bitcoin & Ethereum In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) has diverged between Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The CBD refers to an indicator that tells us about the amount of a given asset that addresses or investors on the network last purchased at each of the price levels visited by the cryptocurrency in its history. This metric is useful because investors put special emphasis on their break-even level and tend to make some kind of move when a retest of it occurs. The more amount of the asset that the holders purchased at a particular level, the stronger is their reaction to a retest. Now, first, here is a chart that shows the trend in the CBD for Bitcoin over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin CBD acquired a large “air gap” when Bitcoin saw its explosive rally back in July. This happened because BTC moved through price levels too fast for buying and selling to occur at them, so very few coins were able to receive a cost basis at them. As BTC consolidated after the rally cooling off, levels started being filled up with supply. The same has followed during the latest phase of decline and now, the previous air gap has disappeared. This shows that demand for spot trading has maintained for the cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin has seen this trend, the CBD has behaved differently for the second largest asset in the sector, Ethereum. From the chart, it’s apparent that Ethereum’s rallies have also created air gaps, but unlike Bitcoin, its phases of slowdown haven’t resulted in any levels filling up to a notable degree. “This suggests ETH price dynamics may be more influenced by off-chain markets such as derivatives,” notes Glassnode. Historically, price action built on products like derivatives has often proven to be more volatile. Given that Ethereum is currently not observing any high levels of spot buying, it only remains to be seen what the fate of its bull run would be. In some other news, Bitcoin has been trading near an important on-chain cost basis level after the recent price decline, as CryptoQuant author Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . The level in question is the average cost basis of the short-term holders , investors who purchased their Bitcoin within the past 155 days. In the past, losing the level often resulted in short-term shifts to bearish phases. ETH Price Ethereum has been on the way down recently with its price falling to $4,270 after a 6% weekly pullback.",Ethereum|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum Derivatives|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 06:00:31

This move comes as the firm’s co-founder, Michael Saylor, remains optimistic about the digital asset’s long-term potential, even in the face of recent price corrections that have seen Bitcoin dip over 10% below its all-time highs. Strategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Spree In a recent update shared on X (formerly Twitter), Saylor revealed that Strategy acquired 6,048 Bitcoin for a total price of $449.3 million between August 26 and September 1, 2025. This latest purchase adds to the firm’s substantial holdings, which now total 636,505 BTC, acquired at an average cost of approximately $73,765 per Bitcoin, amounting to an investment of around $46.95 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Could Start On September 13, Analyst Predicts Saylor also highlighted that Strategy has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 25.7% year-to-date (YTD). Additionally, the firm provided updates on its at-the-market offering programs, which included the sale of various preferred shares and common stock, generating significant net proceeds. This includes 199,509 shares of 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike preferred stock for $19 million, 237,931 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Strife preferred stock for $26.5 million, and 1,237,000 shares of MSTR for $425.3 million. The aggressive investment strategy employed by Saylor’s firm has inspired other public companies to explore similar avenues. Strategy has been a trailblazer in this space, being one of the first publicly traded companies to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. This growing trend is bolstered by favorable regulations and initiatives stemming from President Donald Trump’s administration, which have facilitated broader adoption of these assets, including altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP. Metaplanet Becomes Seventh-Largest BTC Holder A notable example of this investment shift by public companies is Metaplanet, often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy.” The company has approved a plan to sell up to 550 million new shares overseas, aiming to raise approximately 130.3 billion yen ($884.41 million) to finance additional Bitcoin purchases. Once a hotel operator, Metaplanet has pivoted to focus on cryptocurrencies, inspired by Saylor’s approach. Founder and CEO Simon Gerovich liquidated most of the company’s hotel assets, which had been struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, redirecting those funds into Bitcoin starting in April 2024. Related Reading: Is XRP A Meme Coin? Analyst Reveals How Whales Are Playing The Game Metaplanet’s strategy has proven effective, as it has become the seventh-largest holder of Bitcoin among public treasuries globally, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data. The company recently announced on Monday the addition of 1,009 BTC to its total, bringing its holdings to 20,000. Its stock, MTPLF, has experienced a surge of about 740% YTD, currently valued at $5.82 per share. Strategy’s stock, under the ticker symbol MSTR, is trading at $343 as of this writing, up 2.5% from Monday’s price. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades at $111,630, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-buy-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi has issued a direct call to investors to purchase XRP immediately, emphasizing the potential for sharp market movements in the coming days. In a video posted alongside his tweet, which displayed the message “BUY XRP ASAP,” Levi analyzed the current liquidation heat map for XRP, pointing out a significant concentration of liquidations at higher levels. He stated that if an investor holds any amount of XRP, they should prepare for a substantial market reaction. According to Levi, the chart data clearly shows a high number of short liquidations at elevated price levels. He attributed this imbalance to the trading behaviors of retail participants, who are more likely to use extreme levels of leverage compared to institutional investors . Levi explained that retail traders often attempt to generate fast returns from limited capital, which leads them to rely heavily on borrowing at what he described as “crazy leverages.” BUY #XRP ASAP pic.twitter.com/dAW2JNHulZ — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 1, 2025 Retail Traders Versus Institutional Strategies Levi contrasted the approach of retail traders with that of institutions, highlighting the difference in risk tolerance and capital resources. He noted that institutions, armed with “billions and billions of dollars,” do not rely on high leverage to profit from price swings. Instead, they analyze liquidation heat maps and spot opportunities to force liquidations by moving the market toward vulnerable price levels. He emphasized that institutional traders can intentionally push prices upward to trigger these liquidations. Levi specifically mentioned the level of $2.92 for XRP, suggesting that institutions could target this price point as an area of concentrated short positions. He explained that this type of move would result in a sudden spike, referred to as a “massive wick” on the chart, as leveraged traders are liquidated. Parallels With Bitcoin and Ethereum Levi also drew attention to similar patterns forming across other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum . He suggested that the same dynamic of retail over-leverage and institutional targeting is currently in play within these markets. The observation indicates that the anticipated movement in XRP could coincide with broader volatility in the cryptocurrency sector. The timing of these developments, according to Levi, is imminent. He stated that the market could intensify as early as next week, predicting that conditions will become “absolutely insane.” His remarks suggest expectations of both rapid price increases and sudden corrections as liquidations unfold across different assets. Market Outlook Levi’s video commentary underscores his view that XRP is poised for significant price activity driven by the interplay between retail leverage and institutional trading strategies. His urgent recommendation to “BUY XRP ASAP” is rooted in his interpretation of liquidation heat map data and his belief that institutions will exploit current market positioning.

Traders say the combination of macro uncertainty, fragile sentiment, and thinning volumes leaves little room for error heading into what has historically been the toughest month on the calendar. The technicals don’t inspire much confidence either. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, noted that the broader capitalization chart “continues to record a series of lower lows, signaling a downward trend.” He pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to hold $112,000 and warned of “further decline toward the $105,000 area,” a level that has long acted as support before the psychological $100,000 barrier. The crypto fear index has slipped back toward 40, its lowest since April, suggesting nerves are rising before they’ve fully broken. In 2017, bitcoin dropped nearly 8% in September despite the euphoric rally that carried it to $20,000 later that year. In 2019, the token lost almost 14% in September, foreshadowing months of sideways action. Even in the latest cycle, September 2021 and 2022 both saw steep drawdowns, reminding traders that liquidity drains and macro jitters often coincide with the end of summer. This year, those headwinds are visible in ETF flows. After steady accumulation through much of August, spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded net outflows of $440 million last week. Ether ETFs, which launched just last year, posted more than $1 billion in inflows, marking a rare bright spot but also a sign that capital may be rotating rather than growing overall. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows spot ETFs have now absorbed more than 1.3 million BTC, nearly 6% of total supply, putting them on par with the largest exchanges for market share. The risk is that support levels break before macro relief arrives. Non-farm payrolls due Friday are expected to show just 45,000 new jobs, confirming a slowing U.S. labor market. A soft print would strengthen the case for a September rate cut from the Fed, a catalyst that could flip sentiment back to risk-on. Until then, traders are paying up for downside hedges. Options data shows the strongest demand for puts in weeks, with skew leaning firmly bearish, FxPro’s Kuptsikevich noted, calling for caution among intra-day traders.",Markets|Bitcoin|Solana|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|SOL|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-03 06:21:14

51113239,572607,1756882832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51113239.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.19 May Be Imminent If This Happens,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-crash-0-19/,"Unlike larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Dogecoin price remains low and is still a long way from its all-time high that was reached back in 2021. Now, especially with the crypto market seeing intense selling pressure all around, the Dogecoin price is still at risk of a massive decline, and this decline could trigger the next wave of losses. A 10% loss from here will already break the support at $0.2, and a crypto analyst has predicted more downside. Why Dogecoin Price Is At Risk Of Decline Crypto analyst MadWhale presented an analysis of the Dogecoin price chart that shows a possible price decline from here. This is attributed to both broader development on the Dogecoin network, as well as technical analysis that continues to point toward heightened weakness on the chart. The first of these is that Dogecoin could be seeing a cut in its issuance. The DOGE supply is unlimited, meaning that the possibilities for inflation are endless. However, if there is a cut in issuance, i.e, how much miners are paid for confirming transactions on the blockchain, then the DOGE inflation rate could be greatly reduced. This would mean less supply to the demand. But in this case, the crypto analyst does see it as a signal that would cause investors to exist. A reason for this could be that as miner rewards reduce, then exits from the miners to other, more profitable blockchains would mean that the network security of the Dogecoin network weakens. Thus, it could mount short-term pressure on price, leading to price declines, rather than gains. On the technical side of things, the Dogecoin price has also continued to move inside a descending channel . This has cut across several sessions, and the decline has put it on a path to testing a key support level. If the support above $0.2 fails, then a quick 15% decline could follow. As the crypto analyst explains, there is the possibility that the crash goes deeper than expected. In any case, a 15% crash would push the Dogecoin price back below $0.19, signaling a takeover by the bears, with the next major support level sitting at $0.1845. Other Things To Know About DOGE One bullish development that has emerged for the Dogecoin price is the proposed Dogecoin treasury . Alex Spiro, popularly known for being Elon Musk’s personal attorney, plans to raise $200 million to buy DOGE, suggesting that a lot of demand could be headed DOGE’s way, which could drive the price higher. However, looking at the on-chain activity for Dogecoin , the prospects are not too good. Data from Santiment shows that development on the network has screeched to a halt. Trading volume has also remained muted for the meme coin, with Coinglass showing an average of less than $3 billion daily across all credits.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 07:00:32

Exchange Reserve Spikes To Highest In Months,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-trouble-exchange-reserve-spikes-highest/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve has witnessed a spike recently, a sign that could be bearish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Has Hit A Multi-Month High In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Reserve of Bitcoin. The “Exchange Reserve” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that is sitting on the wallets attached to centralized exchanges. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are making net deposits of the asset to these platforms. Generally, one of the main reasons why holders would transfer their coins into the custody of exchanges is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can have bearish consequences for the BTC price. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Heading For A 50% Price Move, Analyst Explains Why On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline suggests investors are taking out a net number of tokens from the exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the holders want to hold their BTC into the long term, which can naturally be bullish for the asset’s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve over the history of the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve peaked in late 2024 and saw a reversal to a downtrend, indicating that investors switched to net withdrawals. The decline in the metric was persistent, but very recently, another turnaround has finally occurred, with the indicator shooting up instead. Its value has now reached the 3.383 million BTC mark, which is the highest that it has been in a few months. “This signals a shift in trader behavior,” notes Maartunn. “More coins moving to exchanges often precedes increased selling pressure.” The deposit spree from the investors has come alongside a period of bearish action in the Bitcoin price. It now remains to be seen whether these exchange inflows would extend the drawdown. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At Short-Term Holder Cost Basis, But For How Long? Speaking of the price decline, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how this plunge compares against past ones in terms of the BTC supply in loss. As displayed in the chart, only 9% of the Bitcoin supply is in loss following the price drawdown. The maximum loss among these underwater coins is also currently just 10%. As Glassnode explains, In contrast, the local bottom of this cycle saw >25% of supply at up to 23% losses, and global bear markets have reached >50% supply with up to 78% losses. This dip remains relatively shallow. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $111,200, up 2% over the last 24 hours.

The passage he posted comes from research prepared for the United Nations, identifying Ripple as relevant to the development of a financial system that is both green and inclusive. This positioning reflects both Ripple’s technological role and its alignment with broader economic and environmental goals. RIPPLE HIGHLIGHTED BY UNITED NATIONS RESEARCH AS A MODEL FOR A GREEN & INCLUSIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEM Documented. https://t.co/zH40xdOD8q pic.twitter.com/uft0JClmUK — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 2, 2025 United Nations Research and Ripple The excerpt stated that “Ripple protocol contains main trends that are relevant for designing a Green and inclusive financial system.” According to Ripple President Monica Long, XRP is 120,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin due to its consensus mechanism. The XRP ledger holds numerous advantages. It’s said to be more decentralized than proof-of-work blockchains , significantly faster, and cheaper. The research also highlighted Ripple’s framework in connection with definitions of virtual currencies, distinguishing between convertible and non-convertible types, as well as centralized and non-centralized systems. These definitions have been crucial for international institutions in understanding the categories and risks of emerging digital assets. The same research further linked Ripple to considerations of compliance and regulation, noting that these definitions help address concerns raised by global bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Ripple’s desire for compliance is in its handling of RLUSD’s launch and its attempts to secure licenses worldwide, including a banking license in the U.S. In doing so, Ripple is situated within a policy framework that prioritizes innovation and places XRP at the forefront in the push for global financial stability. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance According to the document, Ripple supports existing financial institutions by enabling them to integrate digital gateways without being displaced. This integration opportunity aids the adoption of XRP and increases its demand as a bridge currency . The document observed that through capital and transaction intermediation, Ripple enables institutions, merchants, and consumers to benefit from both established financial systems and newer digital technologies. This balance was described as helping stakeholders achieve “the best benefit of both worlds,” capturing how XRP and Ripple fit into an evolving financial ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shifts in Global Payments The research placed Ripple within the broader framework of virtual currencies, outlining its relevance for future financial design. Crucially, it also described Ripple’s XRP-powered technology as a better version of SWIFT and Bitcoin, and highlighted its potential use by institutions. This highlighted XRP’s capacity to function within existing structures while advancing more inclusive financial objectives. Its recognition in United Nations-linked research positions it as more than a cryptocurrency, aligning it with sustainable and inclusive goals in the financial sector.

The derivatives market, however, is showing resilience despite recent price weakness. In its latest post, CryptoQuant noted that Binance’s ETH open interest (OI) has continued to hold above $8.4 billion, even after the asset dipped below $4,400 this week. On August 30, open interest was recorded at the $8.4 billion threshold, and while price action has since turned lower, OI has not broken decisively below that level. Bulls Gearing Up for a Counterattack? Typically, sharp price declines are accompanied by a proportional drop in OI, which hints at liquidations or broader risk-off sentiment. The current pattern means that traders are maintaining positions, and are possibly anticipating a rebound or showing a lack of conviction in further downside. Data also shows that the momentum of OI contraction has eased. The 24-hour percentage change in Binance’s ETH OI now stands at -3.4%, compared with a sharper -6.25% drop observed just two days earlier. This moderation indicates that the aggressive deleveraging phase may be losing steam, as the derivatives market appears less inclined to amplify the sell-off. At the same time, Binance Net Taker Volume has consistently remained negative and has ranged between -1.08 billion and -1.11 billion, which reflects a market environment still dominated by aggressive sellers. Yet the stability in open interest implies that buyers are absorbing at least part of this pressure rather than fully retreating. Spot market data further added bullish context as CryptoQuant found that daily Ethereum withdrawals from exchanges such as Binance and Kraken often surpassed 120,000 ETH. These steady outflows reduce exchange reserves and tighten liquidity, thereby limiting the depth of future sell-side pressure. Whether this trend reflects accumulation or custodial reallocation, it introduces a structural bullish undertone to an otherwise cautious derivatives market. This essentially suggests that the market is still balancing between bearish short-term flows and longer-term accumulation. Greatest Bear Trap Ethereum’s latest pullback has some traders bracing for deeper losses, but technical analysts warn against reading too much into September’s weakness. The current price structure appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. According to crypto analyst Johnny Woo, this setup could prove misleading. Woo described this trajectory as one of the market’s “biggest bear traps” in the making. If the pattern breaks down, ETH risks further declines; however, if it fails to materialize, sidelined traders could be forced to re-enter at higher levels. Woo flagged the $3,800-$4,100 range as a critical support area. Strength above it may validate bullish sentiment heading into October, dubbed “Uptober” by traders for its history of reversals and rallies. While September looks shaky, analysts argue Ethereum’s chart may be primed to catch the market off guard.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum’s staking queue has surged to 860,000 ETH, its highest level since 2023. Institutional demand and rising prices are driving renewed confidence in long-term ETH staking. Over 70 treasury participants now hold 4.7 million ETH, most of it earmarked for yield-generating strategies. It marks the longest wait time since the Shanghai upgrade in 2023, which allowed for withdrawals and briefly triggered large-scale validator exits. Institutional Influx Drives Renewed Confidence in Ethereum Staking: Everstake According to staking protocol Everstake, the sudden rise reflects renewed confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and an influx of institutional capital. “We haven’t seen queues of this size since 2023. It’s a strong signal that more people trust Ethereum and want to participate in securing it,” the firm noted. The combination of rising Ether prices, currently hovering around $4,321, and relatively low gas fees has made staking more attractive to both retail users and corporate treasuries. The increased staking activity also helps calm recent concerns about mass exits, which spiked when the staking exit queue briefly topped 1 million ETH on Aug. 29 before falling back by 20%. Ethereum currently has 35.7 million ETH locked in staking contracts—around 31% of the total supply, according to Ultrasound.Money. 3/ We believe the growth in the validator queue comes down to a mix of things: • Increase in network confidence: More people trust Ethereum’s long-term value and want to participate in securing it. • Great market conditions: Rising ETH prices and historically low gas fees… — everstake.eth ( , ) (@eth_everstake) September 2, 2025 Notably, corporate treasury funds now hold 4.7 million ETH, worth over $20 billion, with the majority earmarked for staking. StrategicEtherReserve data shows more than 70 treasury participants have already begun deploying long-term staking strategies. The convergence of market conditions, price levels, and institutional involvement has pushed the staking entry and exit queues closer to balance for the first time since July. That equilibrium suggests a healthier staking environment and growing demand for yield generation on Ethereum’s base layer. While ETH has slipped 12.4% from its Aug. 24 all-time high, long-term holders appear to be undeterred. Instead of exiting, many are doubling down, waiting in line to earn yield on-chain. Joseph Lubin Predicts 100x ETH Surge Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin believes ETH could rally 100x or more over time , calling it Wall Street’s future infrastructure as TradFi shifts toward decentralized finance. In an X post, Lubin said Ethereum will replace many siloed systems at institutions like JPMorgan and become the backbone for financial services, staking, and smart contract execution. Backing the bullish stance of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, Lubin stated he’s “100% aligned” with Lee’s view that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in network value. He compared the moment to 1971 when the U.S. dollar left the gold standard, signaling a tectonic shift in financial architecture led by Ethereum. Lubin emphasized that ETH represents a new kind of virtual commodity — “decentralized trust” — that institutions will be forced to adopt. He sees Ethereum’s decentralized rails powering everything from traditional finance operations to smart contract-based agreements, with massive upside as adoption scales globally. Likewise, Lee has predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500 , with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000. During his August 26 guest appearance on the Amitis Investing program, Lee disclosed that institutional Wall Street sentiment toward Ethereum has shifted dramatically following the U.S. Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Stablecoin legislation . Lee emphasized that Ethereum is the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $145 billion in stablecoin supply.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,443 and $15,841 with an average expected price of $13,824. In 2031, ETH could trade between $38,150 and $49,492 with an average price of $39,609. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $4,321 Market cap $521.58B Trading volume (24-hour) $39.78B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $4,414.93 24-hour low $4,260.46 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.14% 50-day SMA $ 4,003 200-day SMA $ 2,803 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis Ethereum is consolidating around 4469 on the 1-day chart, with RSI showing neutral momentum The 4-hour chart reflects compressed Bollinger Bands between 4277 and 4566, suggesting indecision Next move depends on whether buyers defend support or sellers push for a breakdown Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum holds steady as market awaits next move On the daily chart on September 3, Ethereum is moving sideways after its recent climb, trading around $4,308. The price is sitting just under $4,437, which is acting as resistance, while support is close to $4,067. The RSI is near 50, showing a balanced market without strong buying or selling pressure. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The MACD still leans bearish, but momentum looks weaker than before. If ETH can push above $4,437, it could head back toward $4,800. On the other hand, if sellers take control, the price may test the $4,100 zone again. For now, ETH seems to be in a quiet, waiting phase and current ethereum price is $4,308. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum awaits breakout as 4-Hour chart shows tight range On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is showing weak momentum, trading around $4,308. The price is stuck between resistance at $4,368 and support near $4,257. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, signaling a possible breakout soon. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The MACD is slightly bearish, with the histogram showing mild selling pressure, while the Balance of Power is negative, suggesting sellers still have an edge. For ETH to regain strength, it needs to push above $4,368 to target $4,500. If the price slips below $4,257, the next downside move could head toward $4,100. Right now, ETH looks indecisive, waiting for a stronger catalyst.

Ethereum’s daily chart shows sideways movement near $4,308, with resistance at $4,437 and support at $4,067. Momentum is weak, and the market looks cautious, waiting for a breakout. On the 4-hour chart, ETH is trading in a narrow range between $4,368 and $4,257, with Bollinger Bands tightening, hinting at an upcoming move. MACD and Balance of Power lean slightly bearish, signaling seller pressure, but the consolidation phase could lead to volatility ahead. If ETH breaks above $4,437 on the daily or $4,368 on the 4-hour, it may retest $4,500–$4,800. A breakdown, however, risks a fall toward $4,100 support. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $4,800 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $33,171 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with a potential high of $10,700. Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029. By 2029, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $23,496. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $49,492 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $49,492 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Analyst Says 2017 Pattern Is Repeating,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-to-4-50-and-beyond-analyst-says-2017-pattern-is-repeating/,"TL;DR Analysts see XRP repeating 2017’s structure, projecting a parabolic rally toward $4.50 and beyond. Key $2.47 support and $2.94 resistance determine XRP’s potential path toward $4.80 targets. Gemini launches XRP cashback card, adding utility as analysts anticipate major bullish continuation. Déjà Vu? XRP Echoes Its 2017 Breakout Pattern Crypto trader CRYPTOWZRD has pointed out that XRP’s current price action looks similar to its 2017 breakout structure. A chart shared shows a repeating pattern of accumulation, consolidation, and upward movement. This sequence previously led to XRP’s run toward $3.30. XRP’S BULL RUN The only chart you need.. $XRP is following the 2017 Bull Run Structure.. after this consolidation phase we will see a parabolic rally to $4.50 and higher Patience Pays pic.twitter.com/Bf9Buut2bZ — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) September 2, 2025 Notably, the chart suggests XRP has already moved through an accumulation phase from 2023 into early 2025. After that, the price broke out and is now consolidating below $3. The analyst claims that if the pattern continues, XRP may be preparing for another rally. “After this consolidation phase we will see a parabolic rally to $4.50 and higher,” the post reads. Key Levels at $2.47 and $2.94 Hold Importance XRP was trading above $2.8 at press time, with a 24-hour volume of over $7.2 billion. The daily price has risen by just over 1%, though it remains down more than 5% over the past week. Another chart shared by Javon Marks shows XRP holding above a key level at $2.47. This zone is considered important for maintaining market structure. “As long as this level holds, prices may only be prepping for another +66% upside,” the analyst noted. His chart marks targets at $4.80 and $7.18, pointing to the possibility of further movement if momentum returns. Source: X Meanwhile, the $2.94 resistance is also being watched. A clean move above this level could open up space for stronger buying interest. If price fails to stay above support, the outlook could shift to short-term sideways movement. Short-Term Chart Remains Volatile In a technical update, CRYPTOWZRD reported a bullish daily close for XRP. However, he added that more confirmation is needed. “We should see more bullish pressure from here. However, one more healthy candle is necessary,” they posted. Moreover, the $3.65 level has been marked as a possible resistance zone. The intraday chart was described as volatile, mostly driven by Bitcoin’s recent movement. If XRP retests the $2.94 level and fails, sideways movement could continue. A break above that level, however, could signal the start of a new move. Separately, crypto exchange Gemini rolled out a credit card product offering cashback in XRP. Users can receive rewards directly in the token when making purchases. The exchange also added support for RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin, which can now be used for spot trading on Gemini’s U.S. platform. This rollout places XRP at the center of new consumer-facing products and increases its exposure across trading and payments. The post XRP to $4.50 and Beyond?

The Mutuum Finance presale is now live at stage 6, offering tokens at a price of $0.035, which could generate substantial returns for investors, with estimates of up to 45x growth in the near future. The project has already sold more than $15.3 million and attracted more than 16,000 token holders. With its cutting-edge approach to decentralized finance and ambitious roadmap, analysts are already speculating about whether MUTM could deliver the kind of breakout performance that defines the next bull cycle. Meanwhile, established memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to maintain their presence in the meme-coin sector, but the focus is now shifting towards projects that offer both utility and growth potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Limited Upside Medium-Term, Ecosystem Activity Persists Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is currently trading at $0.00001215 with a slight volatility as the overall meme coin hype sobers down. Projections for 2025 are relatively flat, with year end averages between $0.0000129 and $0.0000172, which translates to a 5%-70% upside potential should market conditions improve. While Shiba Inu will likely continue to expand its ecosystem with projects like Shibarium, the most critical pathway for SHIB to decouple from its uninspiring price cycle and stand out among emerging stories in the modern market is for the fundamental to take flight. Stage 6 Presale Live with Mutuum Finance (MUTM), $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty There are substantial profits to be made in the early stages of an investment before the price is raised in subsequent phases. Mutuum Finance has already made a name in the DeFi market by securing more than 16,000 investors and raising more than $15.3 million in its presale. The project is also operating a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, which aims to fortify security on the platform and further encourage community involvement, with awards divided into four risk levels: critical, major, minor and low. Interest Rate Models When funds are abundant, the interest rates are kept low in MUTM so as to make borrowing more affordable; but when there is not enough money available, the rates become higher, so as to make it less attractive to borrow, and in turn more attractive to borrowers to pay off loans or increase deposits. Stable rates are typically higher than variable rates but do not change significantly unless there is a significant amount of volatility on the market, making them a good option for borrowers who prefer predictable repayment costs. Only tokens with high liquidity can get a stable rate. Mutuum Finance Reveals $100k Community Giveaway and Dual Lending Solution Ten individuals will receive $100,000 community giveaway in $10K MUTM tokens, making it more fun for existing and new investors to get involved in the platform. Mutuum Finance has a bilateral lending framework for more flexibility and efficiency. A Peer-to-Contract model uses smart contracts to facilitate the automation of the lending process without the need for human intervention, utilizing market dynamics to determine rates while keeping the rate structure fixed. The Peer-to-Peer model ensures that lenders and borrowers connect directly without intermediaries, which is suitable for meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a promising contender in the hunt for big returns, shining a light in comparison to more established names like Shiba Inu (SHIB). With over $15.3 million raised so far, 16,000 holders onboard and Stage 6 presale tokens priced at $0.035, early participants are already experiencing significant momentum and the possibility of up to 500% growth before the full market launch. In contrast, SHIB faces only minor medium-term upside potential of 5%-70% by 2025, and depends strongly on ecosystem expansion to maintain relevance. For investors looking for the biggest upside and exposure to an actively-developed project, security incentives such as a $50,000 bug bounty, and clear path to a $3 price target, Mutuum Finance offers the more attractive option. Buy now to lock in Stage 6 pricing before it goes up again.

In a post on X, the foundation said it will split the sale into smaller orders over the next few weeks. The sale will happen through centralized exchanges . EF noted the gradual approach will limit market disruption, and the funds will support development and community growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. The Ethereum Foundation to fund research In an effort to maintain a reliable source of funding for the Ethereum ecosystem amidst an unstable market, the Ethereum Foundation announced plans to sell 10,000 ETH (around $43 million). It will be changed into fiat rather than treating each sale as an isolated event, to create steady funding for grants, operational expenses, and strategic donations. EF gave over $32 million in grants in the first quarter of 2025 for developers, researchers, and educators, all working on improving the technology and creating awareness. The foundation also paused open grant applications to improve the quality of its projects and focus on long-term progress instead of worrying about the coin’s short-term volatility. Selling 10,000 ETH is just part of EF’s bigger treasury management strategy, as seen in several transactions in the past and earlier this year. The foundation sold $25 million worth of ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July and made two other transactions totaling $12.7 million under the guidelines of its treasury policy introduced in June. The policy aims to set rules on how much ETH the foundation can convert into fiat over specific periods to fund its mission. Treasury policy guides ETH sales and shapes market activity The policy set a maximum of 15% annually for operational expenses and demands that the foundation create a multi-year reserve buffer to ensure there is always enough money for operations and commitments. The guidelines also require regular reviews of the foundation’s assets in fiat terms to know how much Ether can be sold in the next three months. ETH rose more than 23% in the past month and currently trades around $4,326. This shows that investors have confidence in the coin’s potential. When the foundation announced plans to sell 10,000 ETH, Yunfeng Financial Group said it bought a similar amount from the open market that same day. Ether Machine also announced that it bought 150,000 ETH to build a corporate treasury ahead of its anticipated Nasdaq listing. The company now holds over 345,000 ETH, which is valued at around $1.5 billion. These transactions show how traditional financial institutions and big companies outside the crypto-native world treat ETH as a strategic reserve asset. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin also said that Ether can potentially beat Bitcoin as the leading global “monetary base if Wall Street fully adopts the coin. His comments came after ETH hit its highest value of over $4,870 in August. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also had a hand in this surge after he commented about possible changes to monetary policy, which gave investors more confidence in risk assets. The treasury policy, growing interest from institutional investors, and comments by key figures like Lubin show that Ethereum is maturing into a more useful asset in the crypto industry. More importantly, such influence could shape ETH’s market performance at different points, as seen in the December 2020 sale of 100,000 ETH, which drove Ether’s price to record highs in the following months.

Here’s What SEC and CFTC Just Did,https://timestabloid.com/sec-is-about-to-approve-xrp-spot-etfs-heres-what-sec-and-cftc-just-did/,"Bale (@AltcoinBale), a crypto enthusiast, recently stated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is about to approve all pending spot XRP ETFs based on the latest SEC-CFTC joint statement. In August 2025, the SEC extended decision deadlines on several filings, including those from Grayscale , 21Shares, Bitwise, CoinShares, and WisdomTree, pushing most rulings into October. Franklin Templeton’s filing is scheduled for mid-November. Despite these postponements, regulatory clarity around XRP has improved significantly, especially after Ripple and the SEC dismissed their appeals and ended the legal battle. The Joint SEC-CFTC Statement The image shared shows an official SEC publication titled “SEC-CFTC Joint Staff Statement (Project Crypto-Crypto Sprint),” dated September 2, 2025. The document represents a coordinated effort between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC is about to approve all of the XRP Spot ETFs pic.twitter.com/Mt5gP8j9Sg — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 2, 2025 It states that the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets and the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight and Division of Clearing and Risk are working together to address the process for enabling trading of certain spot crypto asset products. The statement builds on recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which emphasized strengthening U.S. leadership in digital financial technology and blockchain innovation. The agencies highlighted their intent to issue guidance on listing leveraged, margined, or financed spot retail commodity transactions on digital assets. Importantly, the joint statement affirms the view that current law does not prohibit SEC- or CFTC-registered exchanges from facilitating trading of spot crypto asset products. What This Could Mean for Spot XRP ETFs This joint approach could accelerate the regulatory framework for approving spot XRP ETFs . By aligning on authority and scope, the SEC and CFTC appear to be laying the groundwork for smoother consideration of pending applications. If the SEC and CFTC succeed in finalizing clear procedures, the probability of approval for multiple XRP spot ETFs may rise sharply. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has raised the probability of XRP ETF approval to 95% , and applicants such as Grayscale, which expect decisions in October, would benefit from an established framework that reduces uncertainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The SEC-CFTC statement represents a pivotal step in unifying cryptocurrency oversight. With deadlines approaching and agencies signaling readiness, XRP could soon see its long-awaited spot ETFs approved, setting the stage for wider adoption and stronger market performance.

Traders will be able to continue trading the underlying assets of these tokens on other trading pairs available on Binance. Additionally, the Spot Trading Bots service will also be suspended for these trading pairs on the same date and time.

The move enables automatic crypto transactions data sharing, tighter compliance and better regulatory transparency. India will be implementing CARF rules, effective April 2027, Business Standard reported . If you think holding your crypto in offshore/foreign exchanges keeps you safe from the Indian tax net, you should read this… India is adopting the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and will be live by April 2027! pic.twitter.com/C6Nsg2sojJ — KoinX (@getkoinx) September 2, 2025 India’s announcement to officially join OECD’s Crypto Reporting Framework comes in parallel with South Korea’s plans to log and share crypto transactions globally. “It means your foreign exchange accounts, wallets, and offshore trades won’t stay invisible,” KoinX wrote. “They’ll be automatically reported back to India through international data-sharing agreements.” India to Sign Multilateral Agreement for Exchange of Crypto Transactions Tax Info Per a senior finance ministry official, India is expected to sign the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) next year. The pact will provide the legal structure for the automatic exchange of tax-related information. India entered into the MCAA in 2015 for financial account data; however, the upcoming agreement is an extension to include digital assets. “This is the same global system that already exposes hidden foreign bank accounts. Now, it’s crypto’s turn,” KoinX stated . Further, the ministry official noted that the legislative changes and system preparations are already underway to meet the 2027 deadline. India to Expose Investors’ ‘Invisible’ Crypto Assets The global crypto reporting agenda means that investors’ coins held in overseas exchanges will be flagged. Further, offshore centralized exchange (CEX) trades will be reported. “Once the system is live, the reporting will be done not just for the current year but for past years as well,” the tax firm wrote, adding that the government can issue notices under multiple sections for previously undisclosed income. As a result, KoinX has urged crypto investors to get compliant now by reporting their holdings honestly and filing accurately. “If you’ve hidden offshore trades in the past, CARF gives the govt a time machine. Your “invisible” assets will suddenly light up,” it added.

Building on a collaboration first established in 2020, the companies said the latest agreement will improve payout speed and predictability for financial institutions and enterprises while extending coverage into new currencies and markets. Thunes Taps Ripple To Power 7 Billion Wallets Thunes, which describes its infrastructure as a “Smart Superhighway” for moving money globally, has integrated blockchain and digital-asset rails to enhance its proprietary Direct Global Network. By combining that network with Ripple’s blockchain-powered payments stack, the firms say banks, fintechs and crypto companies gain more efficient on/off-ramps and deeper local connectivity. Ripple’s enterprise customers, in particular, will be able to withdraw funds more easily in additional currencies and jurisdictions, tightening last-mile delivery in regions with limited banking infrastructure. The companies framed the deal as both a scale and a quality upgrade. Ripple said its Payments product now spans 90-plus payout markets representing “more than 90% coverage of the daily FX markets,” with a remit to provide fast, transparent and reliable cross-border transfers as well as compliant fiat–crypto on/off ramps. Thunes emphasized its role in dependable real-time local-currency payouts and said it is adopting Ripple Payments to bolster Thunes’ in-house SmartX Treasury System. “Members across both the traditional finance space and the digital assets ecosystem connect with Thunes,” said Chloe Mayenobe, President and COO at Thunes. “We are in a prime position to bridge these two worlds and drive the future of digital assets, and our alliance with Ripple underscores this. By supporting real-time settlement, and deep local integrations, we are enabling digital asset companies to deliver seamless, compliant, and accessible cross-border payments at scale.” Fiona Murray, Managing Director, Asia Pacific at Ripple, positioned the expansion as a continuation of the company’s enterprise push . “We are committed to reshaping the future of global payments through blockchain technology. Our partnership with Thunes accelerates our shared mission to improve the efficiency, speed, and security of global payments,” she said, adding that the combination of Thunes’ “extensive and trusted Direct Global Network” with Ripple’s digital-asset infrastructure is designed to enhance “payment speed, accessibility, and compliance across regions” while facilitating “seamless, low-cost transactions.” Thunes says its Direct Global Network reaches more than 130 countries and 80-plus currencies, connecting to over 7 billion mobile wallets and bank accounts as well as 15 billion cards through more than 320 payment methods, including super-apps and mobile money services such as GCash, M-Pesa, Airtel, MTN, Orange, AliPay and WeChat Pay. Network members span gig-economy platforms, super-apps, MTOs, PSPs, fintechs and banks. Ripple, described in the announcement as a leading provider of digital-asset infrastructure for financial institutions, is supplying the blockchain rails and enterprise tooling intended to standardize compliance and liquidity management across the expanded footprint. Beyond reach, both firms highlighted operational mechanics that have historically constrained cross-border payments : settlement speed, transparency of fees and FX, and local disbursement. The partners promise real-time or near-real-time payouts in local currencies, “deep local integrations” to reduce friction at the endpoint, and on/off-ramp optionality for clients that operate across fiat and digital-asset domains. Thunes’ Fortress Compliance Platform and treasury tooling are positioned as control layers that complement Ripple’s enterprise infrastructure in high-throughput corridors. While neither company disclosed new corridors or currencies by name nor the use of the XRP token, the expansion centers on distribution and payout depth as much as front-end coverage.

Despite this downturn, many remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s potential for further gains in the coming months. David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine and a crypto advisor to President Donald Trump, has attributed the recent price fluctuations to the activities of large investors, commonly referred to as “whales.” Bitcoin Sell-Off Triggered By Whales? In a recent social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Bailey pointed out that two prominent whales are responsible for the recent sell-off, having reportedly liquidated 80,000 and 120,000 BTC, respectively. Interestingly, NewsBTC reported last week that despite record inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing interest from public companies, Binance may be one of these whales orchestrating the sell-off. DeFitracer suggested that Binance might be utilizing a market maker, Wintermute, to strategically execute trades, thereby creating a bearish trend that retail investors might follow. This strategy could allow Binance to profit from liquidations in the futures market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stuck In ‘Loading Phase’, What This Means For The Campaign For $5,000 Adding another layer to the current market dynamics, data analysis firm Arkham recently disclosed that a whale with over $5 billion in Bitcoin has begun purchasing Ethereum (ETH), moving $1.1 billion worth of BTC to a new wallet to facilitate these transactions. Although Bailey did not disclose the identities of the whales involved, he indicated that one is already “down,” while the other is halfway to a similar fate. This could suggest that once these sell-offs conclude, the Bitcoin price could regain its momentum, potentially reaching Bailey’s target of $150,000 per coin, which would signify a substantial 36% increase from current price levels. Public Companies Now Hold Over 6% Of BTC’s Supply In addition to the alleged whale activity that has suppressed Bitcoin’s uptrend, the growing involvement of publicly traded companies in the cryptocurrency market is impacting its price stability. According to JPMorgan global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, corporate treasuries now hold over 6% of Bitcoin’s total supply, acting as a form of private sector quantitative easing for the crypto markets. The analyst noted that the surge in Bitcoin purchases by corporate treasuries has led to a decrease in the cryptocurrency’s volatility, which could ultimately make the asset more appealing to investors. Related Reading: WLFI Slides 15% After Launch As Trump Token Team Eyes Burn Strategy Panigirtzoglou highlighted that in July alone, public companies like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), accounted for nearly two-thirds of Bitcoin purchases among major buyers, including exchange-traded funds and government entities. He suggests that this influx of institutional investment may reshape the landscape of Bitcoin ownership and trading, as reduced volatility can enhance BTC’s attractiveness as an investment alternative, particularly in comparison to gold. As of this writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $110,900. This represents a slight 2% surge in the last 24 hours and a 90% increase year-to-date.

He remarked that September may not deliver much excitement for holders, suggesting instead that October could bring “fireworks” for the digital asset. His view adds to the ongoing anticipation within the XRP community regarding whether the asset can rebound from its recent bearish performance . I think September will be a boring month for #XRP . Fireworks in October! — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 1, 2025 XRP Army Debates XRP’s Performance CryptoBull’s comments drew a wide range of responses from the community. Some community members noted that September is still worth watching, suggesting that the community should not dismiss the entire month because of early underperformance. Others emphasized that predictions of major moves have been repeated for years, and investors have often been left waiting for developments that never fully materialize. XRP’s tendency to experience prolonged consolidation periods can be discouraging for investors, but its 500% surge in late 2024 and early 2025 shows that the breakouts are always worth it. Several replies focused on specific dates. EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), another well-respected analyst who recently confirmed XRP’s current consolidation phase , suggested something big could happen on September 7 or 8. Another user pointed to September 22 as a date of interest. Market Conditions and External Factors Beyond individual opinions, broader market conditions may also influence XRP’s path. With inflation showing signs of easing, markets are watching closely for potential interest rate adjustments. Markets have set the chances of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on September 17 at around 90% . If such a move occurs, it could provide a lift to risk-on assets, including digital currencies like XRP. Rate cuts generally reduce the cost of borrowing and can encourage more capital to flow into speculative markets. For XRP, this environment might offset the expectation of a subdued September and help generate upward momentum earlier than anticipated. While CryptoBull and several community members pointed to October as the more likely window for growth, one commenter predicted that lower interest rates combined with momentum from the Clarity Act could help XRP reach $3.5 to $4 this month and $8 to $10 by the end of October.

Some believe September could pass without meaningful developments, while others remain convinced that specific dates or early-month activity could be significant. With voices like EGRAG CRYPTO highlighting targeted timeframes and broader economic trends aligning toward potential policy easing, XRP investors face a month of mixed expectations.

Today the SEC and @CFTC issued a Joint Statement clarifying staff’s views that SEC- and CFTC- registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot commodity products: https://t.co/stsgiQTXjf — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) September 2, 2025 Crypto Trading Going Mainstream NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci said that the main takeaway was “crypto trading going mainstream,” because it will be on the “world’s largest venues,” such as the NYSE and Nasdaq. “Next stop after that? Every major traditional brokerage. I know you’re paying attention now.” Atkins went on to state that market participants should have the “freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets,” adding that the Commission is committed to working with the CFTC to “ensure that our regulatory frameworks support innovation and competition in these rapidly evolving markets.” Meanwhile, CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham emphasized that this marks a departure from previous “mixed signals” that discouraged innovation. “The message was clear: innovation was not welcome,” she said before adding, “That chapter is over.” “Today’s joint agency statement is the latest demonstration of our mutual objective of supporting growth and development in these markets, but it will not be the last.” The statement builds on the SEC’s Project Crypto and CFTC’s Crypto Sprint programs, with both agencies inviting market participants to engage with staff on implementation questions. Last week, the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight issued an advisory stating that U.S.-based users can now trade on non-U.S. crypto exchanges. No Reaction From Markets There was a minor spike in crypto markets with total capitalization up marginally to $3.91 trillion. However, these overwhelming bullish statements from US regulators have failed to make much of an impact recently. Bitcoin had reclaimed $111,000 as it continues to recover this week, but Ethereum had declined further , falling to $4,300 as it cools from its epic rally. Altcoins were generally in the green today with larger gains for Solana and Bitcoin Cash. Most analysts agree that markets are also cooling from recent highs and resetting before the bull market continues in the fourth quarter of this year, partly driven by a Federal Reserve rate cut, which is now highly expected.
