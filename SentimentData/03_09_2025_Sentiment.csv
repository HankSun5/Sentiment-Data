According to CNBC, Warren Buffett, who led the merger that created the food giant in 2015, said on Tuesday that he’s “disappointed” in the breakup. He also said the merger itself was “not a brilliant idea” and that splitting Kraft Heinz apart won’t fix the real issues. The new move divides Kraft Heinz into two separate businesses. One now handles sauces, spreads, and shelf-stable meals. The other is left with U.S. household brands like Kraft Singles, Lunchables, and Oscar Mayer. The announcement was made early Tuesday, and Warren’s comments came later that day in an interview with Becky Quick. Shares dropped more than 7% after his interview aired. Berkshire stays put as Kraft Heinz breaks apart Warren has kept Berkshire Hathaway’s 27.5% stake untouched since the merger. The company hasn’t trimmed or added to the position at all since teaming up with 3G Capital a decade ago to form Kraft Heinz. But now, with 3G already out, having quietly exited in 2023, Warren and his incoming successor, Greg Abel, are left holding the investment solo. Abel, who will take over from Warren at the end of this year, has also expressed his disappointment in how Kraft Heinz is being handled. Since the merger, Kraft Heinz has lost serious ground. Its shares have collapsed nearly 70% since 2015, shrinking its market value to just $33 billion. The decline came after U.S. sales dropped and consumer behavior changed. Shoppers started avoiding processed foods, opting instead for fresh items around the outer edges of grocery stores. The brands under Kraft Heinz, despite being household names like Velveeta and Oscar Mayer, started to lose relevance. Analysts blame some of the collapse on 3G Capital’s aggressive cost-cutting, which prevented the company from investing in its brands at the time they needed it most. Kraft Heinz ended up selling off big pieces of its portfolio, including its Planters nuts and parts of its cheese business. At the same time, it tried to revive a few brands like Capri Sun and Lunchables by investing more heavily in them. Back in May, executives at Kraft Heinz admitted they were thinking about strategic changes and even possible deals. This split is the result of that process. The company didn’t say if more breakups or asset sales are coming, but it’s clear the structure from 2015 isn’t working anymore. Despite the mess, Warren hasn’t walked away. He told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway will do whatever is best for the firm. He also made one thing clear: if anyone comes forward to buy their stake, Berkshire won’t accept a private block deal unless every other shareholder is offered the same exact terms. That means no backroom discounts or side deals. Warren also admitted during a rough quarter back in 2019 that Berkshire “overpaid” for Kraft. Still, unlike other investors who bailed out years ago, he hasn’t sold. Whether that patience pays off after this new split remains to be seen. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Its Hydra upgrade and steady improvements have made it one of the most respected blockchains. But as markets gear up for the next cycle, many traders see ADA as slow-moving compared to other projects. Analysts suggest that while ADA could climb in 2025, bigger returns may come from alternatives such as Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), and the meme-fueled newcomer Layer Brett (LBRETT). Hedera (HBAR) and real-world adoption Hedera has been marketed less as a retail coin and more as an enterprise solution. Its hashgraph consensus allows for high throughput, low cost, and strong security. Instead of promising ideas on paper, Hedera has already signed major companies as governing council members. Brands in tech, telecom, and finance are helping shape the network, a sign of real-world interest. Developers are turning to Hedera for tokenization, payment rails, and supply chain tracking. Cardano also pushes innovation but takes a more academic route. For investors, the contrast is clear: ADA has credibility in theory, while HBAR is gaining credibility through use cases. If enterprise blockchain adoption grows, Hedera could easily outpace ADA’s growth rate. Stellar (XLM) and global payments Stellar was designed with a simple purpose: to make moving money across borders faster and cheaper. With financial institutions, fintech firms, and even central banks testing its rails, XLM continues to build relevance in payments. Its low-cost transactions and partnership activity make it a candidate to benefit from the rise of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Cardano has leaned on a vision of slow but steady upgrades. Stellar, by comparison, has aimed straight at the money-transfer industry. This clear focus on payments has given XLM a path to adoption that ADA doesn’t directly address. If blockchain-powered remittances expand in 2025, Stellar could see the kind of growth that makes it one of the top alternatives to Cardano. Layer Brett (LBRETT) and speculative momentum Then there’s Layer Brett , the newcomer drawing buzz. Unlike most meme coins, it isn’t built on hype alone. It runs on Ethereum Layer 2, giving it fast speeds, low fees, and the ability to connect with Ethereum dApps. This makes it practical for actual use while still carrying the viral appeal of a meme token. The presale has caught fire, thanks in part to staking rewards reported in the thousands of percent APY. That has pulled in both small buyers and early whales. A clear roadmap adds to the interest: NFT tie-ins, gamified staking, and plans for cross-chain features. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is locked in, giving traders another reason to stay interested. Compared to ADA, which is already a large-cap coin, Layer Brett starts from a tiny market base. Even moderate demand could produce outsized multiples. Analysts speculate that if momentum continues, it could rival past meme coin stories, with returns far beyond what ADA might deliver. Final thoughts Cardano remains a cornerstone project, respected for its security and research-driven approach. But in 2025, alternatives may offer more upside. Hedera could capture enterprise clients. Stellar is pushing into global payments. And Layer Brett brings meme energy backed by real infrastructure. For investors, it comes down to risk preference. ADA looks set for steady gains, but those chasing bigger multiples may find opportunities in HBAR, XLM, or LBRETT. Each offers a different path, and together they highlight where capital may flow as the next cycle takes shape.

The first investors will receive a guaranteed minimum return of 300% when MUTM token goes live. The project has already raised over $15.25 million and over 15,950 investors on board. As traders look forward to a potentially bullish Q4, Mutuum Finance stands out as a next-generation decentralised finance (DeFi) protocol that is building a real-world use case and ecosystem all in one. Shiba Inu Resist Market Volatility The current market price of SHIB is close to $0.00001245 with a slight negative weekly impact of 6-7%. Despite this impact on the sentiments in the meme coin world, the SHIB ecosystem is continuing to grow through projects such as token burning and Shibarium. At the same time, DeFi projects related to utilities such as Mutuum Finance are gaining more and more attention from investors. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at presale Stage 6 for $0.035 per token. Cost will go up 14.29% to $0.04 in next phase. With more than 15,950 investors involved and having successfully raised over $15.25 million, the presale is off to an incredible start, and enjoys significant confidence from early adopters. USDT Stablecoin on Ether Mutuum Finance will release an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum The stablecoin is intended for daily use, for decentralised applications and for long-term portfolio stability, increasing usability and trust in the platform. Dual-Lending: DeFi Infrastructure Future-Proof Mutuum Finance is a dual-lending protocol that may be run with automation and user interaction for maximum efficiency. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending smart contracts dynamically change their interest rates (in real time) based on market supply and demand using self-executing smart contracts. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending: This form of lending allows lenders and borrowers to transact directly, eliminating intermediaries and offering more flexibility and transparency. This dual approach positions Mutuum Finance as a secure, future-resistant infrastructure that ensures financial inclusion, high returns, and opportunities for both retail and institutional investors. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability forms the foundation for a sustainable and expansion-ready DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Protocol Overview Mutuum’s dynamic interest rate another smart contract solution for liquidity management. Borrow rates are determined by utilisation, with low rates providing incentives to borrow (and enhance capital efficiency) when capital is plentiful, and higher rates (with accompanying deposit incentives) promoting repayment and drawing deposits during times of scarcity. Stable rates can be used for resource borrowers who are looking for predictability. These fees will usually be higher than variable ones but can be tweaked if the market conditions change to a drastic extent. Only sufficiently liquid assets can be used as collateral to obtain stable-rate borrowing. The protocol promotes a strong risk management based on parameterised assets. Borrowers must over-collateralize and liquidators are rewarded for smoothing under-collateralized loans. Secondary markets enforce limits, including restrictions such as collateral requirements (expressed in terms of high-risk tokens), deposit and borrow constraints to limit exposure to volatile or illiquid asset classes. Improved Borrowing Capacity: Correlated assets predict even greater borrowing capacity, and LTVs limit borrowing based on collateral themselves. Liquidation thresholds and penalties are necessary to keep the protocol solvent and reserve factors are there to generate some interest (so it doesn’t default and causes market extreme conditions). Price discovery is based on solid oracle infrastructure. Permissions data stream will provide reliable pricing for USD and native assets like, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX on a chainlink data feed. Aggregated feeds, oracle standards/fallbacks, and on-chain DEX metrics serve to further sanitise, ensuring valuations are reliable and arrive in a prompt and accurate fashion for downstream collateral management & liquidation operations. Stability and Security Measures Mutuum Finance has established an official Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward pool, rating vulnerabilities as critical, major, minor, and low in severity. The project is also running a $100,000 community giveaway , where 10 investors will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. While SHIB struggles near $0.00001245, Mutuum Finance is attracting significant attention from early adopters. The project is already taking the lead as the next big player in the crypto market.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $111,170 (+2%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $111,564 24-hour low $109,147 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 111,170 Price Prediction $ 117,109 (+6.56%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.01% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 116,091 200-Day SMA $ 95,954 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces bullish surge above $111K Resistance for BTC is at $113,624 Support for BTC/USD is at $107,078 The BTC price analysis for 2 September confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price moves above $111K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bullish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces a move above $111K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bullish pressure as it hovers above $111K. Currently, the market is facing buying domination around resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.41 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $111,391, surging by over 2% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 45.98, hinting that a correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $112K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.84, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $113,624, it will fuel a bullish rally to $121,729. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,078, beginning a bearish trend to $99,908. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as buyers pushed the price above Fib levels. The recent lows triggered strong accumulation. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Metaplanet announced that it purchased 1,009 BTC, worth around $112 million. Its total holdings reached 20,000 BTC, making the company the sixth largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin price prediction September 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $125,000, making August its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction September 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-02 22:00:00
51092254,572057,1756850402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51092254.jpeg,Here’s How Much The TRUMP Meme Coin Will Be With The Market Cap Of Dogecoin,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-with-doge-market-cap/,"The Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin stormed into the crypto scene in January 2025 with a rally that pushed its price from below $1 to a $73.43 peak in a matter of days. This rally placed it among the top twenty digital assets, but today, it is trading far below those heights. Nonetheless, Official Trump is still one of the biggest n ames among meme coins, and investors are still looking towards another rally. A way to measure the potential rally is by asking what would happen if TRUMP reached the same market capitalization as Dogecoin, the leading meme coin. What If TRUMP Reached Dogecoin’s Market Cap? At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading at $8.41, down by 7.2% in the past 24 hours but up by 1.4% in a seven-day timeframe. The meme coin has a market cap of about $1.683 billion. Dogecoin, the most established meme coin and the benchmark of the category, is currently valued at $0.2135 per token, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The leading meme coin has a market cap of about $31.85 billion. When comparing the two side by side, TRUMP’s market cap is just a fraction of Dogecoin’s size. According to calculations from the MarketCapOf tool, TRUMP’s current market value is only about 0.05× that of Dogecoin. Therefore, if TRUMP were to achieve the same market capitalization as the current price of Dogecoin, its price would have to climb to about $160.99 per token, which would represent a 19.21x increase from where it stands today. Dogecoin’s All-Time High The comparison is even more different when considering Dogecoin’s all-time high. At its all-time high of $0.7316 in May 2021, Dogecoin’s market capitalization reached roughly $88.79 billion on the back of the meme coin mania at the time. If TRUMP were ever to match that market cap high, its price would need to increase to about $444.23 per token. That would equate to an extraordinary 53.01x increase from its current price. However, these calculations only take into account the current circulating supply of these cryptocurrencies. TRUMP currently has a circulating supply of 199,999,973 tokens out of a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. Dogecoin, on the other hand, currently has a circulating supply of 150.748 billion tokens with an uncapped maximum supply. TRUMP has arguably had the best meme coin performance this cycle. Its astonishing run in January was reminiscent of similar meme coin rallies in 2021, which the market has been missing this cycle. After its launch on January 17, 2025, the TRUMP meme coin’s value soared by over 300% in under a day, reaching approximately $64 per token on the same day. By January 19, the meme coin had reached a peak of $73.43.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Marketcapof|Trump,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 22:00:02

Analysts say the cryptocurrency’s recent rally is largely driven by Binance whales. Ethereum Rally Driven By Large-Scale Binance Orders According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, Ethereum whales are now dominating order flows on the Binance exchange. The analyst highlighted the average ETH order size on the platform as evidence. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Stays Strong As Exchange Reserves Keep Falling – Details Crazzyblockk shared the following chart showing different phases of average ETH order size on Binance. Retail-driven phases, highlighted in red, dominated much of 2023–24, when small orders drove up ETH’s price but left it vulnerable to corrections. These retail-driven periods were followed by neutral phases, shown in gray, which reflected indecision among ETH investors. This phase was characterized by fragmented participation and sideways trading behavior. Fast-forward to mid-2025, whale orders – highlighted in green – are firmly in control. Average order sizes have now surged past $3,000 per trade, signaling accumulation by institutional and large-scale investors. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that this whale dominance reflects renewed institutional confidence in ETH, aligning with its rapid price appreciation in recent months. Larger average orders suggest fewer fragmented trades and stronger directional conviction. Binance was chosen for the analysis not only as the world’s largest exchange but also because it is the “epicenter of ETH capital flow.” Crazzyblockk concluded: ETH’s latest rally isn’t just retail speculation – it’s being powered by whales on Binance. With large-scale players setting the tone, Ethereum’s market structure looks increasingly robust, and Binance remains the hub where these decisive flows shape price performance. Is ETH Getting Ready For A Rally? While Bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled 4.1% over the past 30 days, ETH is up 23.4% in the same period, indicating that large-scale investors may be in the middle of capital rotation from BTC to ETH over the past month. Related Reading: Ethereum Will ‘Likely 100x From Here,’ Says Joe Lubin Analysts predict ETH may have further room to grow for the remainder of 2025. Ethereum contracts are seeing a sharp resurgence in 2025, setting the stage for a potential rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $5,000 towards the end of the year. Ethereum fundamentals are also strengthening, with as much as 36 million ETH staked on the blockchain, raising the possibility of a supply crunch. That said, despite whale accumulation, some analysts caution that ETH could dip to $4,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,316, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours.

With Bitcoin consolidating around key levels, attention is shifting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns before the next big pump. Analysts say a handful of tokens are attracting both retail and institutional demand, and for good reason. One of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a hot topic after its presale nearly sold out, reminding investors of the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin when those who moved quickly saw exponential gains. XRP Eyes a Return to Strength Ripple’s XRP remains a favorite for investors betting on utility and adoption. Its cross-border payment network continues to expand, with growing partnerships in Asia and the Middle East. After recent price pressure, traders are watching whether XRP can reclaim momentum, with forecasts suggesting it could push toward new yearly highs if the market turns risk-on. Solana’s Speed Still a Major Draw Solana (SOL) has recovered from multiple setbacks, proving its resilience in the competitive Layer-1 space. With transaction speeds that rival traditional financial systems and a growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL is seen as one of the strongest contenders for long-term growth. If institutional flows extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana could be one of the top beneficiaries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Heating Up While established names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building one of the strongest early-stage communities of 2025. Its presale is moving at record speed, with allocations vanishing quickly as whales and retail buyers compete for a spot. Analysts point out that early investors could see as much as 40x returns if MAGACOIN FINANCE mirrors past breakout performances from other meme-powered projects. With a countdown now live and the presale almost sold out, this could be one of the last chances to enter before the next pump phase begins. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Gains Serious Traction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quickly become a favorite in the decentralized trading space. With near-zero fees and growing daily volumes, the project is winning over traders who demand performance and scalability. As its ecosystem develops, many see HYPE as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the market today. Dogecoin Refuses to Fade Despite new meme coins popping up every week, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to command loyalty. Its massive community, strong branding, and new use cases in payments keep it relevant. DOGE has historically surprised skeptics, and if history repeats itself, another major rally could be around the corner. Cardano Pushes Toward Long-Term Adoption Cardano (ADA) has taken a slower but steady path, focusing on peer-reviewed development and scalability. With Hydra scaling technology rolling out, ADA is preparing to handle thousands of transactions per second. This foundation could power new adoption in DeFi, identity solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. Analysts suggest ADA could benefit from the next wave of institutional attention, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion As Bitcoin holds its ground, the real action could soon shift to altcoins. XRP and Solana are positioning for institutional inflows, Dogecoin and HYPE keep expanding their reach, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting records with its fast-selling presale. With the countdown nearly finished, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity may not want to wait much longer.

Solana (SOL) whales are not only fueling Solana’s own rally but also rotating into Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) , signaling a broader appetite for high-utility altcoins ahead of October. Alongside Ethereum (ETH) and XRP , a new player, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is capturing attention as investors look for early-stage opportunities with breakout potential. Together, these five tokens stand out as the top altcoins to watch into October . Solana Whales Drive Market Rotation Despite a surge to $215, Solana has seen 2 million SOL ($432M) deposited onto exchanges in just three days, creating caution about sell pressure. Still, whales remain active, and analysts point to critical levels: Support: $200, aligned with the on-chain MVRV mean. Next Resistance: $280, marked by the +0.5σ MVRV band. Upside Potential: Sustained whale demand could lift Solana toward $300 and beyond . The fact that whales are also loading up on AVAX and DOT suggests Solana whales are positioning broadly across Layer-1 ecosystems. Avalanche (AVAX) Gains Momentum With Government Adoption Avalanche posted 66% transaction growth in a week , surpassing 11.9 million transactions across 181,300 active addresses. Government Catalyst: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced it will publish GDP data directly on Avalanche, among other blockchains — a historic step for decentralized data. ETF Progress: Grayscale has updated its filing for an AVAX spot ETF , potentially unlocking new institutional inflows. These developments are driving renewed demand, with AVAX trading around $23.64 and investors eyeing further growth as adoption widens. Polkadot (DOT) Gains ETF Tailwinds Polkadot (DOT) has joined the growing list of tokens with ETF applications. Grayscale filed registration statements for both DOT and ADA trusts, signaling institutional interest is spreading beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ticker Plans: DOT would list on Nasdaq as a single-asset ETF. Market Impact: ETF filings validate DOT’s role as a next-gen blockchain for cross-chain applications and scalability. As whales rotate into DOT, the token could benefit from heightened visibility and new flows from traditional finance. Ethereum (ETH) Remains a Whale Favorite Whales continue to rotate billions from Bitcoin into Ethereum. $2.59B Rotation: A single whale shifted BTC into a $2.2B ETH spot and a $577M perpetual long. $456M Purchases: Nine addresses added hundreds of millions more. Validator Concerns: Over 1M ETH ($5B) is queued for withdrawal, but institutional inflows are absorbing supply. Trading near $4,300 , ETH remains a top pick among whales betting on DeFi and enterprise adoption. XRP Eyes ETF-Driven Breakthrough XRP is riding speculation that an XRP ETF could attract $5B in inflows during its first month if approved. Price: Currently trading near $3.00. Impact: ETF approval would bring hedge funds, pensions, and sovereign investors into XRP. Outlook: Analysts see potential for XRP to push into double-digit territory. Institutional adoption could cement XRP’s role as a utility-driven digital asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Emerging Altcoin to Watch Whales are now quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE as its transparent team and audited contracts give confidence. With limited tokens available in its early-access stage and significant upside, early investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to get in before it gets listed by exchanges. XRP and Solana investors are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE’s breakout, seeking early exposure before wider adoption, exchange listings, and institutional attention ignite massive growth potential. As whales diversify into Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot, smaller but promising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the surprise outperformers in October . Analysts now expect 51x gains in the coming months of 2025. Final Thoughts Whales are reshaping the altcoin landscape by driving liquidity not just into Solana, but also into Avalanche and Polkadot. Alongside Ethereum’s continued dominance and XRP’s ETF-driven momentum, these tokens represent the top five altcoins to watch as October approaches. But the story isn’t only about large caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a unique early-stage opportunity with strong community backing and growing utility — making it a wildcard that could join the ranks of the top-performing altcoins in the next cycle.

According to the analysis, a large portion of the supply of many popular altcoins is held by just the top 10 wallets. According to the data, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the highest centralization rate. The top 10 wallets control 62.3% of SHIB's total supply, followed by Uniswap (UNI) with 52.2% and Ethereum (ETH) with 51.0%. The situation for other prominent altcoins is as follows: Tether (USDT): 40.5% Pepe (PEPE): 39.4% Chainlink (LINK): 31.5% Dai (DAI): 31.0% USD Coin (USDC): 28.6% Related News: Another Altcoin Launches Token Sale Project for Companies in the US and China Santiment stated that this data has revived discussions about “centralization,” particularly for investors. The intense dominance of large wallets over supply is considered a risk factor, as it could lead to sharper price fluctuations. It's also noteworthy that three of the seven altcoins on the list are stablecoins. However, it's important to note that the list only includes altcoins from the Ethereum ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

According to CoinMarketCap , the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X . The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy , shared earlier in June, that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multi-year reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The Foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making it the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. Tuesday’s announcement comes as ETH price has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high in late August at $4,866.

European Union regulators have postponed the antitrust fine that was expected to be imposed on Alphabet’s Google due to concerns about the United States’ tariff actions. The European Union’s fine against Alphabet’s Google has been delayed Three sources reported that the European Commission , which is responsible for antitrust enforcement, has chosen not to move forward with its penalty against Google. The Commission has decided to stay the fine while waiting on the United States to follow through on its promised reduction of tariffs on European cars. Car duties have been one of the most debated issues in the trade talks between the two sides. Brussels has so far been pushing for the duties to be eased in exchange for concessions on industrial goods. Just last week, the Commission proposed eliminating tariffs on imported U.S. industrial goods. It now expects Washington to announce a cut in tariffs on European cars, reducing duties from 27.5% to 15%. The timing of the delayed fine has raised questions about whether the EU’s competition enforcement is being used as a bargaining chip in economic talks. According to one of the sources , the postponement is not expected to exceed a month. The three sources named the EU’s Trade Commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, who reportedly sought clarifications on the antitrust decision taken by EU competition chief Teresa Ribera, as a factor in the delay. The postponement was announced days after Google was told to expect the fine announcement on Monday. Independence of enforcement The potential link between the EU’s antitrust enforcement to trade talks with the United States has drawn criticism. Germany’s Monopolies Commission, an independent advisory body, stated that the delay sets a worrying precedent. Tomaso Duso, the chairman of the Commission, warned against letting the protection of competition become a “pawn of the Trump administration” in a statement. President Donald Trump has previously threatened retaliation against European authorities if they move too aggressively against American tech companies. The Commission’s decision to delay the fine is being viewed by some analysts as a strategic step to avoid triggering tensions during sensitive trade negotiations. People familiar with the matter also said the fine would be modest compared with earlier penalties levied on the company. The European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podesta told reporters at a daily briefing that the Google investigation is still ongoing and declined to provide further details. Google itself also hasn’t commented on the matter. The fine is a result of a four-year investigation into Google’s advertising technology practices, which started after a complaint from the European Publishers Council. Google has been accused of unfairly favoring its own services over those of rivals in the online advertising market. The eventual decision of the U.S. government concerning the duties on the automotive sector is important as the sector employs millions across the bloc and is central to the economies of Germany, France, and Italy. The fine against Google is symbolically important, but it does not carry the same economic weight as the duties. It is expected that once trade talks are concluded, the Commission will proceed with its decision. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Bitcoin has managed a modest 1.5% gain in the past 24 hours, yet other major tokens have either slipped or failed to move today. However, there are some very good trading opportunities in the market, including several presale and new tokens that could rally very strongly in the coming weeks. These are Maxi Doge, PEPENODE and Wall Street Pepe, which are among the best meme coins to buy now, and we’ll explain why in this article. Best Meme Coins to Buy Now Under $1 Maxi Doge (MAXI) Updating the Dogecoin template with a new, hyper-bullish attitude, Maxi Doge (MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme token that has raised $1.7 million in its presale. This is a hugely encouraging number, especially given that Maxi Doge opened its presale only a few weeks ago. Caffeine in the veins, $MAXI in the wallet. pic.twitter.com/WMBH0v5SSa — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) September 1, 2025 It suggests that the token is quickly attracting new investors and supporters, something we also see from its follower count on X , which recently rose above 10,000. The reason for Maxi Doge’s growing popularity is that it has taken the whole meme token paradigm to a new level. It’s doing this in two ways, with the first being that it’s building an online community focused on trading. To this end, its Telegram and Discord channels will host regular trading competitions, inviting community members to outperform each other and post the biggest returns. Winners of these contests will earn prizes, something which will encourage greater encouragement with Maxi Doge and its ecosystem. Secondly, Maxi Doge extends the meme coin formula via its use of a Maxi Fund, which will equal 25% of its max supply (150.24 billion MAXI). It will use this fund to finance new partnerships and ad campaigns, which together will raise awareness of the project and help attract new investment. Holders of MAXI will also be able to stake the token, earning staking yields on top of any price appreciation. Investors can buy it now by going to its official website , where MAXI currently costs $0.000255. Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE (PEPENODE) One of the newest meme tokens in the market, PEPENODE (PEPENODE) is a ‘mine-to-earn’ coin that opened its presale at the beginning of last month. It has already raised just over $500,000, with the ‘mine-to-earn’ meme coin turning heads by virtue of its unique approach to staking. Instead of offering an entirely passive system, PEPENODE is gamifying staking, enabling holders to participate in a mining game whereby they building virtual mining nodes and facilities. The idea is to encourage engagement, with users who participate more fully in PEPENODE’s gamified staking system receiving greater staking rewards. Other interesting features include tiered node incentives, in that the earliest adopters receive the most powerful virtual mining rigs, thereby enabling them to receive more staking rewards. There’s also a referral system, whereby community members can earn greater rewards by recruiting more users. This all has the potential to make PEPENODE one of the most profitable new projects for investors. They can get in early by going to the official PEPENODE website and joining its presale. PEPENODE is currently available at a price of $0.0010407, but this will rise in just under three days. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Having had one of the biggest presales of 2024, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is in the process of undergoing a major revamp. Launching on Solana You can buy early Every dollar buy on $SOL = burns $WEPE on ETH Once ETH $WEPE hits $0.001 → $SOL Peg goes 1:1 Sol buy = Eth burn New site, new plans, the Solana expansion begins pic.twitter.com/c3GBYJZliX — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) August 19, 2025 Namely, it will be launching a Solana-based version of its WEPE coin, having already launched its Ethereum-based version after the closure of its presale last year. The idea is to take advantage of Solana’s superior scalability, with the coin inviting holders of its ERC-20 token to replace their holdings with Solana-based equivalents. In fact, its protocol will burn Ethereum-based WEPE at a 1:1 ratio whenever investors buy the new Solana-based version, ensuring a stable supply of the coin. More generally, Wall Street Pepe is another trading-focused meme coin that has built a community of cryptocurrency traders, who share tips and strategies on the coin’s channels. Yet Wall Street Pepe’s platform also provides trading signals and insights, helping community members to stay ahead of the market. It has grown considerably since its launch late last year, with its X account now having more than 67,000 followers. The Ethereum-based WEPE token has risen by 275% since late May, with its current price of $0.00005602 also representing a 14% gain in a fortnight. Such momentum is why WEPE is one of the best meme coins to buy at the moment, and the launch of its Solana version should only help its cause. Investors can buy the Solana-based WEPE at the Wall Street Pepe website for a price of $0.001.

The plunge came during a brutal four-day losing streak, cutting Nvidia’s market value by more than $340 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. That dip happened as investors started walking away from big AI names, and Nvidia is right at the center of that exit. The company’s four-day decline now totals over 7%, and this comes right after it delivered a soft revenue forecast last week, raising fresh doubts about how fast the AI boom is actually growing. Even with the sharp selloff, Nvidia’s still up 78% from its April low, holding on to a $4.1 trillion market cap, still ahead of Microsoft, which sits at $3.72 trillion. But that’s not helping calm nerves. Traders now worry the hype has peaked at least for now. Traders eye $160 as next key level for Nvidia Buff Dormeier, the chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners, said Tuesday’s close below the 50-day average is a clear sign things are slowing down. “This shows how the momentum has broken down, and it makes me concerned about the stock over the short term,” Buff said . He’s now watching $160 as the next support, and if that fails, it’s $145, the same level where Nvidia bounced back in June. “If it breaks under $145, I’d be really concerned about its prospects,” Buff added. The selloff didn’t just hit Nvidia. The entire equity market came under pressure, with investors worrying about global tension and bloated tech valuations. That combination made it easier for fund managers to rotate out of high-flying AI stocks. Nvidia was a natural target. Despite recent gains, the stock has gone nearly vertical this year, making it vulnerable to even the slightest negative trigger. And that trigger came fast. Last week’s earnings guidance didn’t deliver the confidence Wall Street was hoping for. Analysts didn’t panic, but the tone definitely changed. Many are still forecasting over 25% upside based on average price targets, but no one’s pretending like the next leg up is guaranteed. As Buff put it, “There’s still long-term opportunity, but it seems like it has peaked for the short or intermediate term.” China builds its own AI chips as Nvidia faces pressure from both sides While Nvidia struggles to hold investor trust amid the rapidly growing AI market, China is pushing hard on its AI Plus plan, which will supposedly embed artificial intelligence across nearly every industry by 2030. This is backed by massive investment into homegrown chips, high-bandwidth memory, and a nationwide supercomputing buildout. Leading that effort is Cambricon, a local chipmaker that’s calling itself China’s Nvidia alternative, but Beijing doesn’t need Cambricon’s Siyuan chips to beat Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra. What it wants is “good enough” tech that can support the country’s AI ambitions without relying on U.S. suppliers. The country’s political class isn’t chasing performance. It wants control. And Cambricon gives it just that. That puts Nvidia in a nasty spot. The company is caught between Washington’s export restrictions and China’s push for chip independence. Trying to keep both sides happy is backfiring. Nvidia’s now serving two masters and satisfying neither, a problem that’s only going to get harder as the tech war and geopolitical pressure continue.

Data revealed that just 1,127 NFTs were recorded on August 1, 2025. This figure is the lowest in the network’s history. Ethereum NFT Collapses In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant noted that this sharp decline demonstrated how far the sector has fallen since the 2021-2022 boom, when NFTs dominated headlines and trading volumes soared. Even as crypto markets showed signs of recovery in 2024 and 2025, NFTs remained unable to capture the same momentum. Analysts attribute the collapse to several factors, such as fading investor enthusiasm, an oversupply of low-quality collections, and a decisive liquidity shift toward newer narratives such as Layer 2 DeFi innovations and real-world asset tokenization. Ethereum is long considered the central hub for NFTs. Hence, the consequence of this historic low could be significant, which could affect not only Ethereum’s fee generation but also the sustainability of NFT marketplaces and the outlook for long-term holders. The bleak August figures follow a surprisingly positive July. NFT July Resurgence DappRadar had recently revealed that NFT activity levels surpassed DeFi in July for the first time in months. Trading volume within the sector jumped 96%, and climbed to $530 million, although the total number of sales slipped by 4% to 5 million. Interestingly, the average price of an NFT increased significantly, more than doubling from $52 in June to $105 in July, as demand for established, high-value collections intensified. On Ethereum, Blur accounted for as much as 80% of daily trading activity during the same period, owing to professional traders and lending services through its Blend platform. On the other hand, OpenSea strengthened its position as the go-to platform for broader participation, as it averaged 27,000 daily traders and maintained strong cross-chain support. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, Base has also emerged as one of the hottest ecosystems for NFTs since its launch two years ago. Since January, Base NFTs have amassed $122 million in trading volume across 6.7 million sales.

Both agencies have had tensions in the past, primarily due to overlapping jurisdictions and opposing regulatory approaches, particularly where cryptocurrencies are concerned. Regulators encourage more crypto listing markets The SEC and CFTC shared their proposed collaboration on Tuesday in a joint statement released via official channels. The effort is to be carried out in furtherance of the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint. It was reportedly facilitated by the President’s Working Group, which urged both agencies to coordinate oversight in order to promote regulatory clarity and keep blockchain innovation within the United States. As part of this mandate, the SEC and CFTC divisions plan to issue guidance on the listing of leveraged, margined or financed spot retail commodity transactions involving digital assets. According to the joint statement, the divisions will collaborate to provide regulatory clarity while reducing jurisdictional overlap. The statement pointed out that the current law allows SEC- or CFTC-registered exchanges to facilitate the trading of certain spot crypto asset products, and invited market participants to engage directly with staff via filings, registrations or requests for relief. The coordination is founded on prior guidance, including the SEC’s digital asset framework and the CFTC’s market advisories. However, it differs in that it focuses on the harmonization of regulatory approaches rather than enforcement actions alone. In the statement, the clearing and settlement, market surveillance, and public dissemination of trading data as priorities for joint attention was also highlighted. This plan to work together is proof that the agencies are now ready to provide clearer compliance pathways. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said: “Market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets.” CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham said: “Under the prior administration, our agencies sent mixed signals about regulation and compliance in digital asset markets, but the message was clear: innovation was not welcome. That chapter is over.” The announcement has triggered euphoria on social media as crypto natives expect further clarity and increased adoption as a result of the collaboration. CFTC will allow spot crypto contracts on federally regulated exchanges The joint statement from the SEC and CFTC comes weeks after it revealed a program that would let established exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which are CFTC-registered Designated Contract Markets, to list and trade spot contracts for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. 🚨 The NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE, CME, etc, will soon have spot trading for BTC, ETH, and more. https://t.co/qZo3YsYDQA — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) September 2, 2025 Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, commented on the statement, highlighting that “the NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE, CME, etc, will soon have spot trading for BTC, ETH, and more.” By settling in the actual token rather than cash and reflecting the current price of the underlying cryptocurrency asset, these contracts have the potential to improve market integrity and price transparency. These established exchanges listing crypto would also signal mainstream acceptance of crypto. They are venues known to be highly regulated and trusted by institutional and retail investors, which means BTC, ETH, and other assets will be more accessible to traditional investors who may have been hesitant to engage with crypto-specific platforms like Coinbase or Binance.

With Wall Street recognition, real-world use, and better approval odds, experts believe the XRP ETF could be one of the most successful crypto ETF launches yet. Expert Expectations Rise For XRP ETF Launch Canary Capital has shared some of the boldest expectations for the XRP product. Steven McClurg, a leading executive at the firm, states that XRP is now the second-most recognized cryptocurrency on Wall Street, after Bitcoin. The Wall Street status is essential because institutional investors would often prefer assets with which they are already familiar and have a clear understanding. McClurg, the CEO of Canary Capital, predicts that XRP ETFs could generate $5 billion in inflows within the first 30 days. That is more than the $3.26 billion Bitcoin ETFs got in their first month. It is also much stronger than Ethereum ETFs, which had a very weak start. McClurg says this shows the trust and interest that professional investors already have in XRP. The strength of XRP in the EFT market, he explains, comes from its real-world utility. Financial institutions and banks have utilized the digital asset for a long time to transfer money across countries faster and at lower costs. In this context, he notes that XRP differs from many digital assets that serve solely speculative purposes. Because the token already integrates into parts of the existing payment system, experts argue that investors will view it as a more reliable option for long-term exposure, backed by an ETF. Expert Points To Catalysts For XRP ETF Success Another reason the expert is hopeful is the strong XRP community, also known as the “XRP Army.” This community could generate substantial trading volumes immediately after launch. Its strength may also protect the ETF from problems that other products have faced. For example, Ethereum ETFs had a very tough start in July 2024. They lost $483 million in the first month alone. Significant withdrawals from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust exacerbated the problem, and investor confidence declined. The Canary CEO believes that the XRP ETF will perform better due to its real-world utility, rather than speculation . Regulation is also moving in a positive direction . The chances of approval for the XRP ETF have gone up from 86% to 87%. While it may not seem like a significant leap, experts believe it is still progress and anticipate that more assets, such as Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin, could receive ETF approval by the end of 2025. Futures-based XRP products already exist, which makes it easier for regulators to approve a spot ETF . With strong community support and rising approval chances, the XRP ETF could outperform earlier crypto ETF products.",XRP|XRP ETF|XRP ETFs|XRP experts|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 23:00:10

After years of uncertainty, sentiment around adoption and real-world payments is improving. The core question for traders and long-term holders is simple: can XRP finally make a run to 10 dollars in 2025? While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to pull most of the institutional flow, some investors are diversifying beyond the leaders. That’s why early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting attention as potential high-upside complements to a portfolio built around top assets. Why XRP Could Target $10 The path to double digits needs three things to line up: stronger liquidity, rising utility in payment corridors, and a supportive macro environment. If capital keeps rotating from majors into high-cap altcoins, XRP could benefit from deeper order books and tighter spreads, which historically supports larger price moves. More banks and fintechs testing tokenization and instant settlement can also lift on-chain activity, a key signal for sustained rallies. What must go right First, momentum from Bitcoin staying strong above six figures tends to expand risk appetite for altcoins. Second, steady growth in cross-border volume would reinforce XRP’s use case and help market price in future demand. Third, cleaner global rules around digital assets would encourage bigger participants to step in, improving liquidity and helping price discovery. The Rising Crypto Star In the middle of all this market action, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by early adopters as a high-potential bet. Presale allocations have been moving quickly, with growing wallet participation and a community focused on long-term utility, not just hype. The appeal is straightforward: limited early access , ongoing development, and a push to reward holders as the ecosystem expands. For investors building a barbell strategy – established large caps on one side, carefully chosen early-stage tokens on the other – MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched as a possible breakout . XRP Price Scenarios for 2025 Bullish case: a strong altcoin season, rising payment volumes, and improved exchange liquidity could create the conditions for a breakout toward $10. This would likely need persistent weekly closes at higher highs, consistent volume expansion, and supportive macro headlines. Base case: if adoption and liquidity improve at a steady pace but the market rotates more slowly, XRP could grind into the $6 to $8 range, setting the stage for a later attempt at double digits. Bearish case: if Bitcoin dominance stays elevated or macro risk flares up, XRP might top out between $3 and $5 and wait for a better window. Sharp pullbacks are common in bull markets, so managing entries and avoiding heavy leverage near resistance becomes important. Conclusion A run to $10 is not guaranteed, but for the first time in years the setup looks achievable if utility, liquidity, and market conditions align. For investors who want both stability and shot-at-moon potential, combining a core position in large caps like XRP with a selective early-stage pick such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is one way to play 2025’s bull market.

Analyst Outlines Potential For Explosive Growth,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/wlfi-the-next-cult-coin-analyst-outlines-potential-for-explosive-growth/,"The recent debut of the World Liberty Financial token (WLFI) in the cryptocurrency market has generated considerable buzz, despite facing notable price retracements within just 24 hours of trading. Despite WLFI’s 25% price retrace in the 24-hour time frame, one market analyst believes that the cryptocurrency has the potential to emerge as this year’s “cult coin,” with significant price potential for the remainder of the bull cycle. Could WLFI Soar 330% In 2025? In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), analyst Virtual Bacon drew comparisons to previously called cult coins, such as XRP in 2017 and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2021, suggesting that WLFI could follow a similar price trajectory in 2025. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Could Start On September 13, Analyst Predicts The circulating supply of WLFI currently stands at 24.6 billion tokens, with approximately 6.9% actively tradable. A key point raised by Bacon is the transparent unlock schedule for various stakeholder tokens. While 20% of the supply is designated for public sale investors and 2.8% is allocated for liquidity and exchanges, the team and investor tokens remain locked. This contrasts with the circumstances surrounding other tokens which experienced a dramatic crash due to a high fully diluted valuation (FDV) and a limited float. Bacon argues that WLFI’s model is healthier, featuring a fair distribution of liquidity across exchanges and gradual unlocks that mitigate the risks associated with sudden price drops. Notably, the analyst’s price target for WLFI is set at $1, which he believes would bring the token’s fully diluted valuation to $100 billion and its market cap to $24.6 billion. As of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.23. That potential scenario could mean a 330% price increase. That could also propel the token toward 11th place among the top cryptocurrencies, positioning it alongside Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA). Catalysts That Could Drive Token Growth And Market Surge Virtual Bacon also addressed comparisons to the TRUMP memecoin launched earlier this year, acknowledging that while WLFI may eventually face an 80% drop like many altcoins, it is fundamentally different. Unlike TRUMP, which experienced a rapid ascent beyond $70 before entering a major downtrend, the analyst notes that WLFI boasts “real integrations,” ties to US Treasuries, and institutional backing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Historical Pullback Ranges – Healthy Correction Or Trouble Ahead? Virtual Bacon identified key catalysts that could drive WLFI’s growth. These include the development of a retail app for and payment solutions, a lending and borrowing platform, and the anticipation of a social media post from President Donald Trump regarding WLFI, which could significantly boost its visibility and market activity. The analyst also mentioned that interest in the recently launched cryptocurrency has outperformed that of major altcoins, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), which he believes indicates a potential cult following that could drive liquidity. Ultimately, Virtual Bacon argues that WLFI’s fair tokenomics, transparent supply structure, strong institutional support, and growing retail momentum position it favorably for the future and strong performance in the upcoming months.

ETF decisions and technical setups suggest upside may still be on the table. Yet as XRP gears up for its next move, a rising star called MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention, positioning it as one of the most exciting altcoin stories for 2025. XRP Bullish Breakout Targets $5.50 The latest XRP price analysis today points toward a short-term rally in the $4.30–$4.50 range, triggered by a completed cup-and-handle pattern above $3.20. If ETF approval aligns with this setup, analysts expect XRP to ride that momentum higher. A mid-cycle push toward $5.00 becomes increasingly possible with the launch of the leveraged ProShares Ultra XRP ETF. In this case, institutional inflows could act as the spark that transforms the XRP price forecast 2025 into a sustained bull run. From there, the XRP bullish breakout target remains $5.50, with RippleNet adoption and liquid staking support forming the backbone of this projection. For long-term traders, this level is not just psychological—it aligns with the expected benefits of XRP ETF momentum as multiple SEC decisions approach. Grayscale XRP ETF decision: October 18, 2025 21Shares XRP ETF decision: October 19, 2025 Bitwise XRP ETF decision: October 20, 2025 These back-to-back rulings could confirm whether XRP joins the list of the best altcoins with ETF potential , a category investors increasingly track as part of their XRP investment forecast strategies. MAGACOIN FINANCE Targets Major ROI in 2025 While the focus has been on Ripple ETF speculation, traders are also shifting attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has set ambitious projections, with analysts targeting a 1200% ROI . Retail excitement is snowballing, with FOMO levels pushing demand higher week after week. In terms of positioning, MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform many rivals in the crypto ETF momentum 2025 narrative. While XRP has the ETF-driven setup, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers that under-the-radar opportunity that many see as a chance to catch an early wave. For investors asking, “Can XRP reach $5.50 with ETF momentum?” the answer may still be yes—but a portion of capital is now flowing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, where traders see asymmetric upside. The Bigger Market Outlook Ahead The XRP market outlook remains strong with $5.50 on the horizon, but it is not the only token riding the ETF narrative. The push for approvals has expanded across multiple assets, making XRP bullish prediction compared to other ETF-linked cryptos a central debate in the altcoin space. As for XRP price prediction with ETF-driven growth , the technical path looks favorable, with retail and institutional demand aligning. Still, investors searching for explosive growth are finding MAGACOIN FINANCE hard to ignore.

51095852,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81439,1756855938,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Sends September Warning to XRP Holders. Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/expert-sends-september-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-what-to-expect/,"Crypto Jack (@That_CryptoNerd), a crypto enthusiast and multi-millionaire, has issued a cautionary note for crypto investors looking to engage with the market this month. He warned of persistent bearish conditions, suggesting that XRP could decline toward $2. His comment follows a sharp pullback in late August that continued into the start of September , reinforcing concerns that the token might not be immune to broader market weakness this month. The community has often observed September as a difficult period for digital assets, and XRP appears to be following that pattern once again. Market volatility in recent weeks has placed additional pressure on the asset, and some traders are preparing for further downside before any recovery takes place. SEPTEMBER WARNING Expecting bearish markets, $XRP to dip to $2.00~ After that, alt season kicks off in Q4. What is your plan? — Crypto Jack (@That_CryptoNerd) September 1, 2025 Possibility of a Strong Q4 Despite the warning for September, Crypto Jack also expressed optimism for later in the year. Altcoin markets tend to recover strongly toward the end of the year, and suggest that the fourth quarter could mark the start of renewed growth. XRP experienced a major surge in late 2024, rising over 500% between November 2024 and January 2025. One of the major contributors to that surge was the highly anticipated Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts , as the market expects a cut on September 17 . If the Fed cuts rates, it could set the stage for renewed momentum in XRP during Q4. Lower interest rates generally drive investors toward risk assets, and digital currencies often benefit from the resulting liquidity shift. Given that XRP’s last significant rally was closely tied to a similar policy move, many in the market believe another cut could trigger renewed inflows and support a strong Q4 performance, especially if altcoin season materializes . Community Responses The post generated a range of reactions from the XRP community. One user dismissed the $2 outlook, arguing that the asset would hold closer to $1.3 or $1.5 instead, and expressed frustration at repeated predictions of steep drops. He also called XRP a scam and stated that the community would have to wait four years, tying XRP’s performance to the post-halving bullish cycle. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member took a different perspective, noting that while September has historically been a bearish month, last year’s performance suggested the pattern may be changing. Data from CryptoRank shows that XRP has closed September on a positive note every year since 2022. With interest rate cuts on the horizon, the asset could maintain this streak in 2025.

The price of Solana is still close to $200, but technical resistance could stop it from going up any more. SUI crypto is having a hard time with supply unlock pressure, even though the ecosystem is growing. Analysts say that in this situation, the new project Remittix (RTX ) is stealing the show and is the best altcoin to buy right now because it is being used in the real world and has huge upside potential. The price of Solana stays at $200, but there are still risks The price of Solana is currently holding steady between $198 and $200, which is in the middle of a rising channel that has been guiding gains since spring. Last week, buyers defended the $190–$195 zone. On-chain data showed that $86.9 million worth of coins left exchanges, which meant that people were buying more coins. The recent launch of stablecoin USD1 on Solana could make liquidity even better and increase DeFi activity. But technicals say to be careful. If this area isn’t cleared, the price could go back down to $185 or even $195. A daily close above $202 to $205 would give bulls back control and set targets at $212 to $222. Analysts say that the Solana price is still good for the next few months, but if momentum doesn’t pick up, the price could be very volatile in September, which could test investors’ patience. SUI Crypto Faces Supply Pressure Amid Growth After a year of ups and downs, SUI crypto is now trading near $3.27. It went up to over $5 before going back down. Monthly token unlocks are still a big deal because they add new supply and often cause short-term sell-offs. For example, in August 2025, a planned release caused the token to drop sharply, showing how easily SUI crypto can be diluted. Despite these problems, Sui’s DeFi ecosystem has grown slowly but surely, drawing in users through connections with Bitcoin-related products and decentralized exchanges. SUI crypto is popular with developers because its flexible architecture is made for games, payments, and tokenizing assets. But there is a lot of competition from Solana and Ethereum, and analysts say that demand needs to grow quickly to make up for the pressure on supply. If adoption picks up, SUI crypto could test its early-2025 highs again. On the other hand, a bearish case says it could fall back to early-2024 levels. Why Remittix Leads As Best Altcoin To Buy Today There is a lot of talk among traders about the future of the Solana price and SUI crypto, but many analysts are saying that Remittix (RTX) is the best altcoin to buy right now for the best return on investment. Remittix is different from speculative tokens because it is building in the PayFi sector. It lets you send money directly from one cryptocurrency to a bank in more than 30 countries with flat fees, real-time FX quotes, and a Pay API that merchants can use. Remittix has already raised more than $23.2 million and sold more than 639 million tokens. Right now, the price is only $0.103. It has been listed on BitMart and LBANK, and a beta version of its wallet is set to come out in the third quarter of 2025. It will support more than 40 cryptocurrencies and more than 30 fiat currencies. These milestones in adoption, along with its payments-first strategy, give it a real-world use case that Solana price action and SUI crypto volatility can’t match in terms of risk and reward. Key Highlights Driving Remittix Momentum $23.2 million raised BitMart and LBANK listings confirmed Q3 2025 wallet beta with 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiats Transparent fees with real-time FX quotes Merchant-ready Pay API for freelancers and businesses Conclusion The price of Solana looks good, but it is being held back by resistance near $210. On the other hand, SUI crypto is still at risk of dilution even though the ecosystem is growing. Remittix, on the other hand, is becoming known as the best altcoin to buy right now because it has exchange listings, adoption milestones, and a clear roadmap. Analysts say that RTX offers the kind of early-stage upside that Solana and Sui no longer do, making it a good choice for investors looking for the best return on investment in 2025.

A rare divergence pattern is fueling speculation of a massive reversal, with analysts eyeing a potential rally that could stretch as high as $0.000081. But can SHIB really sustain the momentum for such an explosive rally? Bullish Divergence Sparks Hopes Of A Reversal In a recent update shared on X, Javon Marks revealed that Shiba Inu has confirmed a bullish pattern through a regular bullish divergence on the MACD histogram. This technical development signals a notable shift in momentum that could mark the beginning of a major reversal for SHIB, with buyers slowly regaining control of the market structure. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Forms Double Bottom At Demand Zone — What To Expect Javon Marks further explained that this signal points to a possible 163% surge, which could lift SHIB back into the $0.00003 range. Such a move would not only signal renewed bullish strength but also mark an important recovery from the recent periods of consolidation and price weakness that have kept the token under pressure. The analyst also stressed that this projection may represent only the first leg of a much larger rally, suggesting that the token is preparing for a sustained upward move rather than a short-lived bounce. Looking further ahead, Javon Marks outlined an even more ambitious scenario for SHIB. If bullish momentum continues to build, the breakout pattern could fuel an extraordinary 570% run, potentially driving the price toward the $0.000081 target. Such a move would dramatically reshape SHIB’s long-term outlook, establishing it as one of the most aggressive rebound moments in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Key Technical Outlook Presently, the first significant resistance sits near $0.000017, a level that has acted as a barrier in recent sessions. A successful close above this zone could open the door toward $0.0000204, and potentially drive SHIB toward the $0.0000263 mark. Breaking through these levels would confirm renewed bullish momentum and could encourage further accumulation by buyers. Related Reading: How High Can Shiba Inu Climb In 2025? Analyst Gives Candid Outlook On the downside, SHIB has immediate support around $0.0000080, which aligns with recent lows. A deeper pullback could test the $0.0000065 region, where the 100-day moving average currently provides backup. If bears manage to push the price below this level, SHIB risks revisiting the $0.00000534 support area, which would likely increase selling pressure. For now, Shiba Inu remains in a wait-and-see zone. A decisive break above resistance could spark a bullish continuation, while failure to hold above near-term support might expose the token to further downside.

At the same time, an early-stage altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is catching attention from investors searching for the next high-growth opportunity. This move highlights how the market narrative is changing from Bitcoin dominance to a broader focus on yield, utility, and scarcity plays. Bitcoin Correction Sparks Rotation Bitcoin recently fell from highs above $124,000 to the $108,000 – $114,000 range. Analysts note that this wasn’t caused by one single event but by a combination of weak macroeconomic data, stock market declines, and whale sell-offs. On-chain data showed one long-time holder unloading over 100,000 BTC, sparking further selling and exposing just how powerful these players remain in driving short-term price action. Ethereum Gains Whale Confidence Ethereum has become the key winner in this shift. With the approval of spot ETFs and greater clarity under the CLARITY Act, ETH has grown far more accessible for institutions. Its staking yields also attract investors seeking passive income, while its robust DeFi and smart contract ecosystem provide clear growth potential. A single whale transaction of $217 million from BTC into ETH emphasized just how much conviction big players now have in Ethereum’s future. The Hidden Gem of 2025 Beyond Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout option for those looking to get in early. Presale rounds have been selling out at record speed, and early buyers have already seen returns surpassing 7,800% . With limited allocations left and growing demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a reputation as one of the rare altcoins offering both scarcity and exponential upside potential . Analysts suggest it could mirror the kind of breakout growth only seen in the earliest days of past market leaders. The Road Ahead Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but its role is changing. Whales and institutions are clearly diversifying into assets that offer yields, utility, and room for explosive growth. Ethereum’s strength and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity play show how investor strategies are shifting, signaling that the next phase of the bull run may be defined less by Bitcoin dominance and more by high-growth alternatives.

Each coin has strong community backing, ongoing upgrades, or breakout potential, making them attractive to traders searching for affordable entries. These names dominate retail sentiment, though some analysts argue that newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are starting to attract the kind of attention that previously powered Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. SHIBA INU (SHIBA) — Burn Events and Breakout Potential Shiba Inu is maintaining its place as one of the most visible meme coins, thanks to a combination of supply reduction strategies and sustained community energy. Priced near $0.00001322, SHIBA has delivered bullish chart patterns in recent weeks that analysts view as precursors to another breakout run. The introduction of Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, has added to this optimism by enabling faster transactions and strengthening Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. With increased use cases and ongoing development, the project is positioning itself as more than just a meme-driven token. Market forecasts point toward the possibility of SHIBA reaching $0.000081 in the coming cycle. This kind of upside, combined with large-scale token burns and retail accumulation, keeps it firmly on the list of best cryptos under $10. Its established brand power and improving fundamentals make it a candidate for sustained growth if momentum carries forward. ADA (Cardano) — Network Expansion and Institutional Interest Cardano, trading under $1 at around $0.87, continues to attract attention as a top-tier blockchain platform. Often compared to Ethereum, ADA benefits from its emphasis on scalability, governance, and academic-driven development. Analysts say this disciplined approach has given Cardano one of the strongest foundations among altcoins under $10. Institutional interest has risen throughout 2025, as upgrades to the network have expanded Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. Notably, hundreds of millions in value are now locked across its DeFi applications, and developer activity continues to trend upward. This growth is building confidence that Cardano can remain competitive in the next cycle. Undoubtedly, ADA’s appeal lies in accessibility for retail investors. The crypto token’s relatively low price point, combined with consistent ecosystem progress, makes it an affordable way to gain exposure to smart contract adoption. Analysts highlight that its blend of institutional support and grassroots developer engagement keeps ADA attractive for both long-term holders and active traders. BONK — Solana’s Meme Coin Power Play Among Solana-based tokens, BONK has emerged as a standout. Priced below $0.01, it has gained traction as one of the most liquid meme coins tied to the network. Whale-driven trading has helped it sustain high activity, while liquidity support has prevented the extreme volatility seen in some smaller meme assets. BONK’s strength also comes from its integration into Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins that exist in isolation, BONK has been connected to lending, trading, and liquidity platforms across Solana. This level of use-case integration makes it more resilient than meme coins built purely on hype. Investors see BONK as a high-beta way to track Solana’s overall expansion. If Solana continues to secure institutional flows and DeFi adoption, BONK is well-positioned to capture that momentum. BONK remains one of the most promising options for traders seeking sub-$10 assets with both meme appeal and network relevance. PEPE — High-Risk, High-Reward Momentum PEPE has solidified its reputation as a high-risk, high-reward play. Still priced under $0.01, the meme coin thrives on viral attention and waves of speculative buying. Its growth this year has been tied closely to social sentiment, with rallies often sparked by retail campaigns on social media platforms. Analysts caution that volatility is the defining trait of PEPE, making it a coin that can deliver explosive upside or sharp reversals. For many traders, that risk is precisely what makes it attractive, particularly as they seek meme-driven cycles capable of producing outsized returns. Despite the risks, PEPE’s growing holder base and consistent trading volume highlight continued interest. Its place among the best cryptos under $10 is secured by its role as one of the most active meme coins in 2025, even if it appeals mainly to investors with a higher tolerance for uncertainty. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Best Crypto to Buy Under $10 Among the crowded field of low-cost tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being singled out by analysts as the best crypto to buy under $10 in 2025. Still priced around fractions of a cent, it offers investors a chance to secure exposure at levels that could multiply dramatically once exchange listings arrive. What is driving the excitement is the scale of its forecasted upside. Analysts project potential gains of up to 12,000% in the next cycle, a figure that has fueled comparisons to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Retail investors are rushing to lock in allocations, while whales have also begun rotating into the project, signaling growing conviction in its breakout potential. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the rare combination of low entry point and high forecasted return that defines life-changing crypto opportunities. With momentum building fast, it has become the sub-$10 token attracting the strongest FOMO across the market this year. Conclusion — Retail Favorites and Newcomer Opportunities The best cryptos under $10 in August 2025 continue to be led by SHIBA, ADA, BONK, and PEPE, each offering unique appeal through community support, institutional adoption, or meme-driven speculation. They remain accessible entry points for investors looking to participate in the market without the high costs of Bitcoin or Ethereum. At the same time, newer meme projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are beginning to command attention, offering the kind of exponential upside that established names may no longer provide. So, the focus is no longer on the known names within the crypto community as only projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE can produce the life-changing returns.

51097100,572160,1756857658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51097100.jpeg,"Banks Won’t Trust Ripple And XRP, SWIFT CIO Says",https://bitcoinist.com/banks-wont-trust-ripple-and-xrp-swift-cio-says/,"Ripple and XRP were thrust into the spotlight after SWIFT chief innovation officer (CIO) Tom Zschach delivered a pointed critique on LinkedIn—widely read as a jab at the company and its XRP token—over what actually constitutes “resilience” for banks and how institutional trust is earned. The exchange began under a comment praising Ripple’s regulatory endurance, where Zschach countered bluntly: “Surviving lawsuits isn’t resilience. Neutral, shared governance is. Institutions don’t want to live on a competitor’s rails.” He followed by rejecting the notion that a single firm’s rapport with watchdogs equals compliance, writing: “And compliance isn’t about one company convincing regulators it should be allowed to operate. It’s about an entire industry agreeing on shared standards that no single balance sheet controls.” Ripple Vs. SWIFT Zschach then broadened the frame in a longer post about how banks actually adopt technology. “Every major shift in finance begins the same way. Technology lays the foundation but trust decides when the building opens.” He recalled that previous “next big things” in finance stalled not on throughput, but on the absence of compliance and security. The parallel he drew to public blockchains in 2025 was explicit: they are becoming too consequential to ignore—“Tokenized treasuries. Collateral on-chain. Cross-border payments that actually settle”—yet raw technical performance is not the finish line. They think the public chain itself is the solution. It isn’t,” he argued, calling public networks “the base environment for execution,” powerful for deterministic, programmable settlement but insufficient without the “trust layer” of legal enforceability, compliance, and privacy. Without that layer, he warned, a public chain is “a fast engine with no cockpit.” Crucially, Zschach’s critique drew a governance boundary that cuts to the heart of Ripple’s pitch to banks without naming the company. He re-centered the conversation on neutrality and shared control, rather than on the courtroom durability or regulatory narratives of any single firm. In his words, institutions want “shared standards that no single balance sheet controls,” and they will resist depending on “a competitor’s rails.” He extended the caution to consortia as well: “If a bank joins a chain owned or controlled by another bank then they are accepting someone else’s governance, incentives and rules of the game. In today’s environment is that a form of dependency that banks will be comfortable with?” The throughline is that institutional adoption hinges less on whether one vendor has outlasted enforcement actions and more on whether the infrastructure is credibly neutral, co-governed, and enforceable in law. Zschach’s taxonomy of public chains as “substrate” underscores how he expects the industry to evolve. In biology, computing, and construction, a substrate is foundational; what matters for banks is what gets layered above it. He urged builders not to “fight the public chains” but to harness them while solving for compliance from day one and for privacy “without killing transparency.” That is where he believes the “opportunity lies,” with finance ultimately “absorbing the best of public chains on its own terms.” The open question he posed back to the market—“When will banks and financial institutions truly trust public blockchains and at what pace will that trust build?”—puts the burden of proof on governance design and standards alignment, not on marketing milestones. For Ripple and XRP, the implication is clear even if Zschach never typed the name in his critique: the bar for bank adoption isn’t surviving litigation or securing green lights for a specific product stack; it is convincing the industry that the rails they ride are neutral, shared, and not controlled by any single company’s balance sheet (like Ripple’s escrow still controlling more than 35% of all XRP). In that lens, resilience is measured in how power is distributed, how rules are enforced, and how privacy and compliance are engineered—precisely the dimensions Zschach says decide “when the building opens.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.77.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|Ripple vs SWIFT|SWIFT|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 00:00:58

While the XRP Ledger (XRPL) already has a built-in burn mechanism, projections suggest that a more substantial burn event, such as eliminating 10% of the total tokens, could lead to a notable shift in XRP’s price trajectory. How the Burn Mechanism Works Every transaction on the XRPL requires a small fee, which is permanently destroyed rather than redistributed. This process was introduced not as a method of creating scarcity, but as a measure to discourage spam transactions. Since the ledger went live more than 13 years ago, just 14.19 million XRP have been burned. This figure represents only about 0.014% of the total maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. At the current burn rate , which averages around 600 tokens per day due to reduced network activity, it would take more than a millennium to destroy even 1% of the supply. This slow pace has led some community members to argue for accelerated methods of removing tokens. However, the broader impact of a larger-scale burn remains a subject of debate. XRP Projected Price if 10% of Supply Burned To examine the potential outcome of a more aggressive burn scenario, Google Gemini modeled what might happen if 10 billion XRP, equivalent to 10% of the total supply, were removed from circulation. At the time of press, XRP trades around $2.79 with a circulating supply of approximately 59.48 billion tokens, giving it a market capitalisation of roughly $166 billion. If the supply were reduced to 49.48 billion tokens while the market cap remained constant, the price would increase to $3.25. Market Reactions and Short-Term Effects Google Gemini emphasized that markets are unlikely to respond mechanically to such a major event. A sudden burn of this magnitude could attract investor attention, drive buying interest, and increase speculative activity. In that case, XRP might initially rally toward the $4 to $5 range as traders respond to the deflationary shock. The AI model further suggested that breaking past XRP’s historical peak of $3.84 would be probable under these circumstances. This could establish a new baseline for the asset and generate stronger momentum in the medium term. XRP Long-Term Projections In a sustained scenario of higher demand combined with a reduced circulating supply, Gemini projected that XRP could stabilize within the $10 to $15 range . At those levels, the market capitalization would stand between $495 billion and $742 billion. Such a valuation would place XRP among the top global digital assets. However, achieving and maintaining these levels would require consistent adoption and liquidity growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While XRP’s current burn mechanism has only removed a fraction of the token supply over more than a decade, the idea of a large-scale burn continues to attract interest. Modeling by Google Gemini indicates that a 10% reduction could initially push XRP above $5 and potentially position it for a longer-term range between $10 and $15. Still, the actual impact would depend heavily on investor behaviour, market conditions, and the broader adoption of Ripple’s technology.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7256 Market cap $766.95M Trading volume (24-hour) $21.87M Circulating supply 1.057B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.7283 24-hour low $0.7049 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.69% 50-day SMA $0.8267 14-Day RSI 38.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6600 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is still trending down on the daily chart. The 4-hour chart shows a bounce attempt but capped by $0.73–$0.75. XTZ’s key support zone remains at $0.69–$0.70. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos ($XTZ) remains in a clear downtrend as of September 3, with lower highs and lower lows pressing price toward the lower Bollinger Band near $0.69. Today’s candle shows hesitation after a small relief bounce, but momentum remains weak as the MACD stays negative and RSI lingers around 45, below neutral. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Immediate resistance is stacked at $0.79–$0.89, while $0.69 is the nearest support level. Unless XTZ reclaims $0.79, the structure favors further downside or sideways consolidation. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, XTZ has shown a short-term bounce off $0.69–$0.70 support, pushing back toward the $0.72–$0.73 area where the 21 SMA is also pressing down. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume picked up on the move higher, but the rejection just below $0.73 highlights resistance, with stronger supply likely around $0.74–$0.75. Losing $0.70 would reopen downside to $0.69 or lower, while clearing $0.74 would start shifting momentum in favor of buyers. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6986 BUY SMA 5 $0.7457 SELL SMA 10 $0.7825 SELL SMA 21 $0.8168 SELL SMA 50 $0.8267 SELL SMA 100 $0.7036 BUY SMA 200 $0.6600 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7985 SELL EMA 5 $0.7789 SELL EMA 10 $0.7272 SELL EMA 21 $0.6863 BUY EMA 50 $0.7122 BUY EMA 100 $0.8034 SELL EMA 200 $0.8751 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Unless buyers reclaim the $0.74 price level with positive volume momentum, XTZ is more likely to stay range-bound or revisit $0.70, with $0.69 acting as the decisive support level. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos XTZ August Roundup 🌟 August was a big month for Tezos.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before correcting to an average of $0.72 in February, then consolidated below $0.70 from March through May with a combined average of about $0.66. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it saw an average price of $0.7232. The coin kicked off August at $0.7605 and maintained an average price of $0.8212 throughout the month.

The AI company, backed by Amazon and run by ex-OpenAI execs, confirmed on Tuesday that it raised $13 billion in funding, putting its valuation at $183 billion. That’s three times what it was worth in March, making this one of the fastest valuation surges Silicon Valley has seen so far in 2025. The funding round was led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Heavyweights like Altimeter, General Catalyst, and Coatue also threw money in. Anthropic’s finance chief, Krishna Rao, said the raise showed how tightly the company’s working with investors. “This financing demonstrates investors’ extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth,” Krishna said. Claude’s launch lights a fire under growth Since Claude was announced in March 2023, Anthropic’s valuation has gone vertical. The company now says it has more than 300,000 business customers and a run-rate revenue of $5 billion as of August, up from just $1 billion at the start of the year. That’s a 5x jump in less than twelve months. Anthropic was built by people who used to work at OpenAI, including its CEO Dario Amodei. That matters, because the rivalry between the two companies is heating up fast. OpenAI has been making headlines ever since it launched ChatGPT in late 2022. It’s preparing a stock sale that would value it at $500 billion, as reported by CNBC. In March, OpenAI locked in a $40 billion raise at a $300 billion valuation, the biggest ever for a private tech firm. Just last month, it collected another $8.3 billion tied to that same round. Meanwhile, it rolled out GPT-5, which OpenAI calls faster and “a lot more useful” than earlier models. But not everyone’s happy. Some users complained that features from GPT-4o were missing. “We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on X. Anthropic says the new funding will support AI safety research, help scale to meet demand from large enterprises, and push international expansion. Those are the three priorities. Anthropic changes its data policy and gives users a deadline Another big change is happening behind the scenes. Anthropic is making major changes to how it collects and stores user data, and people using Claude have until September 28 to decide if their conversations can be used to train the company’s AI models. That’s a full reversal from their old policy. Before this update, Claude users were told their data would be wiped after 30 days—unless it broke a rule or had to be kept longer due to legal reasons, in which case it might stick around for up to two years. That’s now history. If users don’t opt out, Anthropic will keep their conversations and coding sessions for five years and use that info to train future Claude models. The policy affects all individual users on Claude Free, Claude Pro, Claude Max, and Claude Code. Business customers using Claude Gov, Claude for Work, Claude for Education, or accessing via API won’t be affected. This is similar to how OpenAI protects its enterprise customers by not using their data for training either. Anthropic hasn’t given a full explanation beyond a blog post. But the company says the new policy is about “user choice.” If people don’t opt out, they’ll be helping improve the AI. The company says this will make Claude better at things like coding and reasoning, and also help reduce the number of times harmless messages are flagged as harmful. Still, the real reason is clear. Every AI company right now needs massive amounts of real-world data. Claude’s chats offer that. Training large models isn’t possible without millions of quality conversations. So this gives Anthropic what it needs to compete with OpenAI and Google; data at scale, straight from users.

The two filings, revealed on Tuesday, suggest a tentative revival in investor appetite for high-growth fintech and crypto firms, with Wall Street banks betting that revived risk appetite and steadier market conditions can draw investors back to the listings market. Their debuts will follow the successful debuts of stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish, which drew robust demand earlier this year.

It grew rapidly during the e-commerce boom of 2020 and 2021, when successive funding rounds boosted its private valuation to $45 billion. However, by mid-2022, it recalibrated its valuation, dropping it to $6.7 billion. It initially had plans for a direct listing in 2021. However, that plan did not materialize. The fintech took another go at it earlier this year but was forced to put it on hold in April after the volatility that hit the market following US tariffs on major trading partners. Now, with a relatively stable market and the demand for technology stocks returning, Klarna is preparing to sell 34.3 million shares at a range of $35 to $37, raising up to $1.27 billion. If successful, the flotation would mark one of the largest fintech listings since the pandemic. Blockchain lender Figure joins queue While Klarna embodies Europe’s push into the US market, San Francisco-based Figure highlights how blockchain finance is moving into the mainstream. The company, co-founded in 2018 by former SoFi chief Mike Cagney, operates a blockchain-native platform for lending, trading and investing in consumer credit and digital assets. Figure plans to sell 26.3 million shares between $18 and $20, seeking to raise as much as $526 million at a valuation of just over $4 billion. The offering will be led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies and Bank of America, with the shares set to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker “FIGR”. The lender has distinguished itself by reducing approval times for home equity loans to around 10 days, compared with an industry average of more than 40. It also turned profitable in the first half of 2025, reporting a $29 million gain compared to a $13 million loss it recorded a year earlier. Supporters argue that Figure reflects a maturing stage in blockchain adoption, underpinned by stronger regulation and rising institutional demand. “Investors in this space tend to be patient because they see the long-term potential,” said Jeff Zell, senior analyst at IPO Boutique. IPO revival gathers pace The listings by Klarna and Figure are part of an increasing pipeline. On the same day, cryptocurrency exchange Gemini , backed by the Winklevoss twins, began its own roadshow for a New York IPO that could value it at $2.2 billion. Josef Schuster, chief executive of IPO research group IPOX, said: “With the current administration strongly supportive of the space, the (IPO) pipeline is likely to remain active for well-structured, compliance-forward players.” For investors, the current wave offers both opportunity and caution. Klarna’s model depends on consumer spending resilience, while Figure’s fortunes are tied to the pace of blockchain adoption and regulatory stability. Market sentiment may swing on whether these offerings trade strongly in the aftermarket.

The surge followed Judge Amit Mehta’s decision to reject the U.S. Department of Justice’s demand to break up Google’s core tech products. According to CNBC, investors celebrated the ruling because the court backed away from the most aggressive penalties that were being considered. The DOJ had asked for extreme actions, including forcing Google to sell off Chrome, because of the way it links search behavior to ads. But Mehta said those proposals were too much. In his ruling, Mehta said: “Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment. Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints.” Mehta also ordered both parties to meet and finalize the judgment by September 10. Judge orders limited restrictions on google, avoids full breakup The antitrust trial started in September 2023, and by August 2024, Mehta found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, confirming it held monopoly power in search and related advertising. The focus of the DOJ’s case had changed from proving guilt to proposing what to do about it, and that’s where things got messy. The DOJ wanted Google to open up access to its search data, ban default search engine payments, and share what users click on across the web. Some of that made it into the ruling. Mehta ruled that Google must share certain datasets, including search index information and user interaction data. However, the company won’t be required to share any ads data. The court also said any data-sharing must be done “on ordinary commercial terms that are consistent with Google’s current syndication services,” which means Google won’t be giving away any trade secrets for free. In response, Google posted a blog saying: “Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals. We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we’re reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case’s focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.” The Justice Department also pushed to stop Google from paying device makers to become the default search engine. One of the biggest targets? The multibillion-dollar deal with Apple, which puts Google as the default search engine on Safari across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Mehta rejected that too. The court ruled that Alphabet can keep making those payments to Apple. This triggered a 3% spike in Apple’s stock in after-hours trading. Apple stays out of trial but benefits from ruling Even though Apple wasn’t a defendant in the case, its close relationship with Google became a central issue in the remedies discussion. If the court had ruled against the search payments, Apple would’ve had to rethink how Safari works, and that would’ve created a domino effect across the tech industry. Analysts have said it might take years for Apple to implement changes if that ever happens. For now, no changes are required. In testimony earlier this year, Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, defended the deal. Cue told the court that Apple chose Google because “it’s the best search engine,” and that the company is always looking for “the best tools for customers.” He also said Apple is considering new options, including adding AI search engines to future versions of its software, in case things shift down the line. Meanwhile, Google isn’t done fighting. The company said it plans to appeal the ruling, and legal analysts say any further trial over these remedies could last up to two years. After that, if appeals are exhausted, the Supreme Court could step in. So even though the ruling looks like a win for Google and Apple for now, the battle isn’t technically over. The DOJ also wanted the court to force Google to release more information about how it builds its search engine. That didn’t happen. Mehta agreed to make Google share some specific user and index data, but not everything. Most importantly, he refused to make Google share advertising-related data, which is the backbone of its money machine.

Japan Post Bank Taps Into Blockchain For Digital Yen As reported by Reuters , Japan Post Bank is planning to launch a digital yen in the coming year. Japan Post Bank is a Tokyo-headquartered bank that originally started as a postal savings system back in 1875 and today manages around 190 trillion (nearly $1.3 trillion in US dollars) in deposits. Historically fully owned by the Japanese government, the institution opened up to private shareholders in 2007, but still counts the Japanese state among its backers. Now, it seems the bank wants to bring its massive depositor base into the blockchain era. The new currency, known as “DCJPY,” will be developed by DeCurret DCP, a Japanese digital currencies platform, and will be backed 1:1 by fiat yen. The two companies plan to issue the digital yen by the end of fiscal year 2026. After its launch, the bank’s users will be able to convert their funds into DCJPY and participate in blockchain-based transactions. While DCJPY will use blockchain technology, it will be different from a stablecoin . Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to a fiat currency that are typically available for trading on public exchanges and other platforms. Meanwhile, DCJPY will be a deposit-based token available within the financial system of Japan Post Bank. The bank isn’t the first financial institution in the country to launch a blockchain product like this. Last year, GMO Aozora Net Bank also started a similar digital yen offering. Speaking of stablecoins, these cryptocurrencies have been witnessing a legislative push in Asia lately, with Hong Kong releasing its stablecoin bill at the start of August and South Korea expected to launch its framework in October. Japan introduced its stablecoin legislation back in 2022. So far, no yen-backed stablecoins have been approved, but according to a report , one could gain the green light from regulators as soon as October. The fiat-tied digital assets have recently been observing some notable growth and exploring new all-time highs (ATHs), according to data from MacroMicro . From the chart, it’s visible that the stablecoin market cap saw a slump in 2022-23, but 2024 brought a reversal as growth returned in the space. The end of the year then witnessed acceleration in the metric, which has continued into 2025. Today, the combined stablecoin market cap sits at about $282.6 billion, a fresh record.

51099032,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81300,1756861222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dogecoin Reclaims $0.22 — Will BONK and SHIBA Follow With 40% Pops?,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-reclaims-0-22-will-bonk-and-shiba-follow-with-40-pops/,"As the cryptocurrency market navigates a prolonged slowdown, investors and traders have turned their spotlight to Dogecoin. Following multiple price swings this year, the prevailing question is whether the meme coin can still push upwards to its all-time high price. Amidst the volatility, Dogecoin briefly climbed above $0.22 before it succumbed to bearish pressure. With the leading meme coin showing signs of recovery, many are asking if Shiba Inu and BONK can replicate the upward push too and deliver 40% gains to holders. As the conversation continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE has slipped in as a cheap early-stage meme token, offering investors a high upside potential in the coming bull cycles. Dogecoin’s Short-Term Path For now, Dogecoin seems stuck in a holding pattern. Analysts see the coin trading between $0.21 and $0.27 through September, with forecasts averaging around $0.26. That may not sound like fireworks, but given DOGE’s reputation for sharp swings, even small moves keep it on traders’ radar. However, whales are still making waves. A single 900 million DOGE transfer last month sent prices sliding 5% in just 24 hours. That said, network health looks solid, with mining hashrates sitting near all-time highs — a sign the backbone of DOGE remains strong. Year-End Targets Looking ahead to December, predictions are all over the map. Conservative models peg DOGE between $0.20 and $0.25, basically keeping it flat. On the other hand, bullish scenarios stretch as high as $0.70, hinging on ETF approvals and wider adoption for payments. Most forecasts settle somewhere in the middle, around $0.28, which suggests modest growth with plenty of volatility along the way. And with companies like Bit Origin pledging up to $500 million in Dogecoin treasuries, institutional demand may prove to be a wild card. Will SHIB and BONK Tag Along? Shiba Inu is grinding in a tight range, but the technical picture is starting to look brighter. A Golden Cross on the charts—where the 50-day average crosses above the 200-day—has bulls watching for a potential breakout. If SHIB clears resistance near $0.0000145, history suggests the move could run 30–40%. BONK, meanwhile, is buzzing again in Solana circles. While still a speculative play, analysts think it could ride the same meme-coin tide if DOGE keeps its momentum. In other words, if Dogecoin runs, BONK could sprint. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Low Entry, Clock Ticking As the three dominant meme coins navigate the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting early traction from a growing number of investors. Historically, every market cycle produces an early-stage token that explodes beyond estimation . Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the next. Already, thousands of investors have taken advantage of its low price to position themselves. On-chain data shows that even whale investors joined in the buying frenzy, and analysts say retail investors will soon follow. Outlook Dogecoin reclaiming $0.22 has breathed life back into the meme-coin market. Whether SHIB and BONK can deliver the same kind of gains remains to be seen, but technical setups suggest the potential is there. And with new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE catching early interest, it is clear the appetite for high-reward tokens isn’t fading anytime soon. The next few weeks will tell if this bounce is just a blip — or the start of another meme-coin rally.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said the appeal of the ruling that blocked his tariff authority needs to be resolved fast. “We’re going to be going to the Supreme Court, we think tomorrow, because we need an early decision,” he said. He added that he’ll be asking for “early admittance” and “an expedited ruling.” This is all tied to a decision handed down Friday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In a 7–4 split, the court said Trump didn’t have the power to roll out most of the tariffs he’s been using, especially the ones imposed through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judges said only Congress has the power to tax imports, and that Trump’s moves went beyond the limits of presidential authority. The ruling is paused until October 14 to give the administration a shot at getting the Supreme Court to reverse it. “If you take away tariffs, we could end up being a third-world country,” Trump said . He claimed the entire financial structure of the U.S. economy could collapse if the court doesn’t act quickly. “The financial fabric of our country is at stake,” he said. Trump claims the market is reacting to the court ruling Speaking just hours after market indexes dipped, Trump blamed the drop on the court’s decision. “The stock market’s down because of that, because the stock market needs the tariffs,” he told reporters. “They want the tariffs.” He offered no market data to back that claim, but said the ruling spooked traders and investors who’ve come to expect tariff protections as part of his economic agenda. The tariffs under fire were pushed earlier this year using the 1977 emergency law. Some of the duties reached as high as 50% on imports from countries Trump accused of failing to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. The list included China, Mexico, and Canada; all of them top trade partners. The administration argued that fentanyl was enough of a national security threat to justify the tariffs. The court disagreed. In its opinion, the Federal Circuit wrote that “the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution. Judges said Congress never gave presidents the right to act unilaterally on tariffs unless very specific conditions were met, conditions they said weren’t present in Trump’s case. “Tariffs are a core Congressional power,” the court added. Administration braces for legal fallout while Trump slams India trade Trump’s officials aren’t sitting around waiting. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that while the administration is confident the Supreme Court will support the tariffs, a fallback plan is already in the works. He didn’t say what Plan B looks like, but made it clear the administration expects a fight. Meanwhile, the web of reciprocal tariffs Trump placed on dozens of countries is now legally unstable. The White House hasn’t said what will happen if the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case, or rules against them. But if Friday’s decision stands, it could instantly shrink the scope of U.S. tariffs. Before the ruling, the Tax Foundation estimated that nearly 70% of imports were affected by Trump’s tariffs. That number would fall to just 16% if the Supreme Court upholds the lower court’s ruling. On top of all that, Trump zeroed in on India in a post, accusing the country of taking advantage of the U.S. “They sell us massive amounts of goods, their biggest ‘client,’ but we sell them very little. Until now a totally one-sided relationship, and it has been for many decades,” he wrote. Everything now rides on whether the Supreme Court agrees to take the case, and whether it’s willing to fast-track a ruling. Trump is betting they will.

51099144,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81448,1756861327,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Outlines 3 Key Factors Saying XRP Is Still Poised for Major Rally,https://timestabloid.com/expert-outlines-3-key-factors-saying-xrp-is-still-poised-for-major-rally/,"XRP has recently experienced notable volatility, falling to $2.69 before stabilizing around $2.79. This marked its lowest level since July, prompting uncertainty within the community. Some long-term investors have openly questioned whether the token can sustain its value, with a few even signaling that they may reduce their positions if prices fail to improve. Despite these concerns, market analyst EGRAG maintains that the broader bullish trend has not been invalidated. In a recent update, he presented three technical arguments supporting the view that XRP remains positioned for further gains. Three Technical Signals Supporting the Bullish Case According to EGRAG , XRP’s structure on the monthly chart continues to show strength. First, he stressed that the token’s candle formations remain intact, suggesting that the market has not broken down on a structural level. Second, he noted that the price has consistently held above significant Fibonacci retracement levels. The $1.99 zone, in particular, has acted as a reliable base and has not been breached, reinforcing its role as strong support. Third, EGRAG Crypto pointed to XRP’s position relative to the 21-period exponential moving average (EMA). Remaining above this long-term indicator is often considered a positive sign for sustaining momentum, and XRP has so far maintained this level. Unless these three conditions fail, the analyst argues that declaring the end of the bull run would be premature. #XRP – No Wicks, No Price Noise! Did we lose any body candle structures? No. Did we fall below any Fibonacci targets? No. Did we drop below the 21 EMA on the monthly timeframe? No. Unless we see all of the above happen, I refuse to declare that the #BullRun … pic.twitter.com/9ihMgKniWb — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 1, 2025 XRP Price Targets and Long-Term Expectations Furthermore, EGRAG projects several potential upside levels for XRP. In the near term, he expects the token to test $3.90, which would represent a new all-time high and align with the 1.272 Fibonacci extension. From current levels, this move would require an advance of about 40%. Beyond this, he identifies $9.22 as another target, corresponding with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension , which would imply a gain of over 200%. For the current cycle peak, however, his projections are significantly higher. He has suggested possible price zones at $18, $23, and $46, representing increases of 542%, 721%, and 1,543%, respectively. Broader Market Perspectives Other analysts have shared similar optimism. Market commentator Matt Hughes (The Great Mattsby) has highlighted XRP’s performance within a Gann Fan pattern on the weekly timeframe, noting that the asset has successfully flipped previous resistance zones, such as $0.50 to $1.00 and the 2021 high of $1.96, into strong support. He also emphasized the importance of the $3.00 level, describing it as a critical threshold that could pave the way for a stronger breakout once firmly established. Additionally, macro investor Raoul Pal has described XRP as being in the process of moving capital inflows away from Bitcoin, reinforcing the view that the asset could continue its upward momentum. Mixed Investor Sentiment Despite the technical optimism, community sentiment remains divided. Influencer Crypto Bitlord recently expressed frustration, stating that he might liquidate his holdings if the price returns to $2. His comments reflect broader concerns among holders who feel the asset has not yet fulfilled its long-standing promises of significant wealth creation.

At its current price of $2.80, the token has appreciated by more than 410% year-over-year, placing it among the top-performing altcoins during the same period. While short-term fluctuations have led to uncertainty, analysts such as EGRAG and Hughes continue to argue that XRP retains a constructive technical outlook. As long as the asset maintains key support levels and remains above critical indicators, they believe the conditions for a continued rally are in place .

Expert Presents Simple Math Based on Global Market Volume",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-9438-expert-presents-simple-math-based-on-global-market-volume/,"XRP analyst XRP PhantomX shared a post urging holders to carefully consider the potential scale of XRP’s future role in global finance. In the tweet, he wrote: “Tell me why I shouldn’t be loading up on XRP right now?! Let’s break it down with some simple math. XRP Holders… YOU NEED TO SEE THIS!!” He attached a video presentation that outlined projected volumes from major global financial institutions and industries, linking them to possible market capitalization and price scenarios for XRP. Referenced Figures in the Video In the attached video, the speaker detailed a wide range of institutions and markets along with their estimated transaction or settlement volumes. He stated that Japanese banks collectively could represent 25 trillion, while the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation was cited with three quadrillion. SWIFT was attributed with one and a half quadrillion, and the top ten U.S. banks were listed at $12.5 trillion. Tokenization was assigned $2 trillion, Mastercard $9 trillion, Visa $16 trillion, and American Express $1 trillion. In addition, the global derivatives market was cited as one quadrillion, and a new partnership with Hidden Road was said to account for three trillion. These figures were then summed to reach approximately $5.53 quadrillion, which the speaker suggested could potentially flow through the XRP Ledger under an expansive adoption scenario. Calculations of Market Cap and Token Price The video then applied simple calculations to show how different adoption levels might translate into market capitalization and token prices. The speaker explained that if XRP captured just one percent of the total estimated volume, the market cap would be about $55 trillion. Dividing that by the cited circulating supply of 58 billion tokens gave a hypothetical price of $943 per XRP. The speaker then extended the scenario to a ten percent share, which would imply a market cap of 550 trillion and a resulting price of $9,438 per XRP. A midpoint assumption of five percent produced an estimated price of $4,719. These examples were presented as hypothetical outcomes based on straightforward arithmetic rather than predictions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Emphasis on Demand and Adoption In conclusion, the video stressed that while the volume numbers referenced are based on industry-scale markets, the actual impact on XRP depends on adoption levels and demand. The speaker underlined that factors such as integration by institutions, the role of liquidity, and real-world use cases would determine whether XRP could capture even a small portion of the markets discussed. He described demand as the key factor in shaping XRP’s future value, reinforcing that the exercise was designed to illustrate scale and possibility rather than certainty.

The components are: Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT) Alphabet (GOOGL) Amazon (AMZN) Nvidia (NVDA) Meta (META) Tesla (TSLA) Coinbase (COIN) iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) Each component will carry the same weight, which is 10% of the total index. No single stock or ETF dominates the mix. Coinbase said this will help investors avoid being overexposed to any one company or asset. However, weights can move above or below 10% between quarterly rebalances. Every three months, all weights will reset back to 10% each. The official index provider is MarketVector, which will maintain and rebalance the product. Coinbase said the index is designed for investors who want “thematic exposure to tech and crypto combined,” “diversification in a single product,” and “tools to manage multi-asset risk,” The exchange called the launch “a new era of multi-asset derivatives” and said this is part of a larger strategy to expand access across asset classes. The Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures will settle monthly. Right now, the product is only available through partner platforms, but Coinbase stated they plan to roll out access to retail investors “in the coming months.” Coinbase has already added its own equity (COIN) into the mix, along with two BlackRock-linked ETF, IBIT for Bitcoin and ETHA for Ethereum.

MUTM is in the sixth stage of its presale and is expected to rise by 14.29% to $0.04 in the next stage. The project has already raised over $15.25 million and onboarded more than 15950 investors, positioning itself for a strong performance in the next altcoin season. Bitcoin Wavers as DeFi Gathers Steam Bitcoin is trading around $108,414, showing a modest pullback amid rising market volatility. Analysts note a growing rotation of capital from BTC to altcoins and DeFi projects, with Bitcoin’s dominance slipping below 60%, a signal of shifting investor interest. Recent whale activity indicates significant Bitcoin-to-Ethereum rotations, highlighting a broader move toward decentralized finance coins. Mutuum Finance is doing well in the DeFi market. It has attracted a great deal of loyal investors in just months. The project provides a secure platform for DeFi transactions, introducing proven lending functionalities within a trusted environment. Analysts identify this is crypto with strong rally potential when the bull market takes off. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance’s presale is gaining strong traction. Stage 6 tokens are available at $0.035, with Stage 7 set to increase the price by 14.29% to $0.04. Investor demand continues to grow, with over $15.25 million raised and more than 15,950 token holders already onboard, making MUTM a prominent contender in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance has started a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 users will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. There’s also a leaderboard for the top 50 token holders, which rewards them with additional tokens. The team is also running a $50,000 bug bounty program in partnership with CertiK. To share in the reward, all users need to do is identify bugs within one of the preset levels: critical, major, minor, and low. A secure and Efficient Platform for Lending The platform uses smart contracts that enable a Peer-to-Contract model for lending, which automates the process. There is also Peer-to-Peer. Here the borrower in communication with the lender. This model helps make the lending process faster and more efficient. Price Discovery Mutuum relies on robust oracle infrastructure to determine fair market values. Chainlink data feeds are anticipated to provide reliable prices across USD and native assets (e.g., ETH, MATIC, AVAX). Fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and on-chain DEX metrics (like time-weighted average prices) enhance reliability and ensure accurate, timely valuations critical for collateral management and liquidations. As Bitcoin (BTC) shows signs of slowing momentum around $108,000 and its market dominance slips, attention is steadily moving toward emerging DeFi contenders like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has already raised more than $15.25 million and attracted over 15,950 investors, signaling strong early confidence in its ecosystem. Currently priced at $0.035 in presale stage 6, MUTM is set to climb by 14.29% to $0.04 in stage 7, offering a limited-time window for investors to enter before the next price jump. With a 95/100 CertiK trust score, an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin in development, and dual lending models designed to enhance decentralized borrowing and lending efficiency, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a focal point in the DeFi market. Add to this a $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 bug bounty program, and it’s clear the project is positioning itself for sustained growth.

51100128,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81403,1756863037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"$0.00001242 Entry Secures 42,000% ROI: BullZilla Presale Leads Best Meme Coin Presales to Join Now, Pepe and SUI Fumble",https://timestabloid.com/0-00001242-entry-secures-42000-roi-bullzilla-presale-leads/,"What if waiting just a few hours meant losing a life-changing gain? In the crypto world, especially with meme assets, that scenario plays out daily. Investors scan the markets for the best meme coin presale to join now, knowing that hesitation often comes with steep opportunity costs. The past 24 hours have been brutal reminders of volatility. Pepe fell 1.98% to $0.000009683, and SUI slid 2.46% to $3.47. Both remain popular tokens with sizable communities, but their declines highlight the fragile nature of assets without strong presale mechanics or deflationary frameworks. Meanwhile, BullZilla ($BZIL) has raced ahead. With over $100,000 raised, more than 7 billion tokens sold on opening day, and ROI already locked at 116% for the earliest buyers, it’s drawing headlines. With its presale roadmap indicating a potential 42,000% ROI, it has become a centerpiece for those seeking the best meme coin presale to join now. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Investor’s Dream With Deflationary Precision BullZilla’s presale has been carefully engineered to generate momentum. Its Progressive Presale Price Engine ensures automatic climbs every $100,000 raised or 48 hours elapsed. Launched at $0.00000575, it has already advanced to $0.00001242 in Stage 1, Phase 2. That alone has delivered 116% ROI before listing. Projections magnify the opportunity. At its target listing price of $0.008, today’s entry implies more than 42,000% ROI. A $5,000 allocation now would secure about 403 million tokens. At listing, that holding could be worth $3.22 million. However, waiting until the next hike to $0.00001908 reduces that same investment to 262 million tokens, resulting in a loss of 141 million tokens due to hesitation. This is why BullZilla dominates as the best meme coin presale to join now. Momentum data reinforces urgency. Within 50 minutes, $10,000 was raised. Within two hours, 2 billion tokens were sold. By the end of day one, $39,000 was in the books. Today, the tally exceeds $100,000, with another 53.62% programmed jump only hours away. Scarcity, speed, and design are driving a frenzy. Staking Rewards and Passive Income: Built-In Loyalty Engine Bull Zilla isn’t solely about explosive presale math. It fosters sustainability through staking rewards, allowing holders to lock their tokens in the HODL Furnace to earn yields while reducing the supply. Compared to Ethereum’s staking range of 4–7% annually (Ethereum Foundation), BullZilla’s projections promise higher returns that keep participants engaged beyond speculation. This system creates dual benefits: passive income for holders and stronger supply-side pressure in the market. Messari’s 2024 tokenomics study confirms that projects with layered incentive mechanisms outperform those that rely solely on hype. BullZilla’s staking design supports its presale mechanics, framing it as both the best crypto to buy today and a credible BullZilla next 1000x candidate. Steps to Buy $BZIL Tokens Visit the Official Presale Page: Go directly to the verified BullZilla Presale site. Always confirm the link through trusted sources to avoid phishing attempts. Connect Your Wallet: Use a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Ensure you have Ethereum (ETH) ready for the purchase and network fees. Choose Investment Amount: Enter the amount you want to allocate. The presale dashboard displays the exact number of tokens you’ll receive at the current stage. Confirm and Buy: Approve the transaction in your wallet. Once confirmed, your $BZIL tokens will be allocated instantly in the presale contract. Track Presale Progress: Monitor the live dashboard to see how close the project is to the next price hike, which occurs every $100K raised or 48 hours. Pepe: Popularity Under Pressure Pepe has remained a mainstay among meme coins, but its 1.98% dip to $0.000009683 underscores its fragility. While its community remains strong, its reliance on cultural branding leaves it exposed during corrections. According to CoinGecko data, Pepe has experienced cycles of rapid highs followed by sharp declines, driven more by sentiment than mechanics. For traders, Pepe’s liquidity ensures it remains active. Yet for analysts and long-term investors, its lack of engineered scarcity, progressive pricing, or staking means it competes at a disadvantage. Compared to BullZilla Presale, which ties growth directly to presale momentum, Pepe’s trajectory looks increasingly uncertain. SUI: Ecosystem Growth Meets Market Weakness SUI has emerged as one of the most talked-about Layer-1 ecosystems, with explosive growth in developer activity and DeFi traction. Its value has surged over 400% in the past year, and its ecosystem includes fast-rising DeFi protocols and social apps. Yet despite strong fundamentals, SUI fell 2.46% to $3.47 in the past 24 hours, showing the market’s unforgiving volatility. Analysts note that SUI’s long-term trajectory remains bullish thanks to institutional inflows, ETF listings, and its developer-focused ecosystem. Still, compared to BullZilla’s presale dynamics, SUI’s current pullback demonstrates why presale tokens with engineered scarcity often outshine Layer-1 plays in short-term ROI. Conclusion: Countdown Before the Next Price Wall Based on our research and market trends, BullZilla stands out as the best meme coin presale to join now. With more than $100,000 raised, 7 billion tokens sold, and 116% ROI already secured, it has transformed urgency into structured gains. Its potential upside of 42,000% at listing is reinforced by staking rewards, engineered scarcity, and presale mechanics that force price appreciation. With the next 53.62% increase only hours away, the window is rapidly narrowing. Pepe’s cultural strength and SUI’s developer ecosystem keep them relevant, but neither delivers BullZilla’s precision design. For investors eyeing the best crypto to buy today, the choice is clear: join BullZilla Presale now or risk entering after the next programmed surge. The BullZilla 1000x narrative is unfolding, and hesitation could cost millions in tokens.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. While traders fixated on Jerome Powell’s latest rate signals, the more consequential story may be playing out in stablecoins. The sector has nearly doubled in a year to $280 billion, with most issuers holding short-term Treasuries as collateral. That ties crypto liquidity more directly to Federal Reserve policy than ever before, according to OKX Singapore CEO Gracie Lin. ""While markets are still digesting Powell’s latest comments on rates, a more consequential long-term shift is happening beyond the charts and headlines. It's in the so-called 'boring' stablecoins that we're seeing better long-term price signals,"" Lin told CoinDesk in a note. ""The next step is unification - stablecoins have built the rails, now they need a unified market that delivers liquidity, efficiency and true utility for investors,"" Lin continued. Coinbase analysts project the market could swell to $1.2 trillion by 2028, forcing $5.3 billion of new Treasury purchases each week. The inflows may marginally lower yields, but the risk runs in reverse: redemption surges could trigger forced selling of bills, draining liquidity. The debate continued in a recent episode of Goldman Sachs' Exchanges podcast, where UC Berkeley’s Barry Eichengreen warned that stablecoins could replicate the money-market fund panic of 2008. “When a dollar money market share fell to 97 cents in 2008, chaos broke out, contagion fears spread, and the government stepped in to guarantee funds,” he said. Former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks countered on the podcast that the new GENIUS Act, which requires one-to-one Treasury backing, mirrors the national banking reforms that ended America’s “wildcat banking” era. “Supervision equals safety,” he said. “Every time a new token is issued, another dollar of Treasury securities has to be bought.” This tug-of-war captures the macro dilemma. Coinbase’s model shows stablecoins shaving basis points off Treasury yields, Brooks calls it a new engine of global dollar demand, and Eichengreen warns of a 2008-style liquidity crunch. Lin, meanwhile, argues the rails are already there — and the question is whether they unify into a market that steadies the system or fracture into instruments that amplify shocks. Market Movements BTC: BTC is currently trading above $111,300. CoinDesk market data shows that the world's largest digital asset is trading within a tight intraday range, which suggests consolidating sentiment. Markets appear cautious amid macro uncertainty, with investors patiently waiting for further momentum or directional cues. ETH: ETH is tading at $4,320, showing modest upside (+0.6%) intraday, hinting at renewed investor interest following recent gains. The broader crypto recovery, particularly in altcoins, seems to be bolstering demand. Gold: Gold recently crossed $3,540 an ounce, putting it at a fresh all-time closing high. The rally is being driven by surging expectations for an upcoming Fed rate cut as well as heightened uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and political pressure on the Fed. Investors are flocking to gold as a safe‑haven asset amid these risks. Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 remains steady within its current range, reflecting cautious optimism among investors. The rise follows a broader “ninja stealth rally” in Japanese equities, driven by strong foreign inflows, reforms, and shifting global capital trends toward Japan.

The decision comes as competitors such as Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares aggressively pursue XRP ETF approvals, with market analysts projecting inflows between $4.3 billion and $8.4 billion by year-end. Instead, BlackRock remains focused on its dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products, citing limited institutional demand for altcoins. While the firm stresses caution, critics warn that hesitation could cost BlackRock market share as rival funds attract institutional investors seeking diversified crypto exposure. Cardano ETF Rumors Drive Market Optimism Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is becoming one of the hottest altcoin stories of September. Grayscale filed an updated S-1 with the SEC for its proposed Cardano ETF, boosting approval odds on prediction market Polymarket to 87%, up from 63–75%. The proposed fund would trade on NYSE Arca, holding ADA directly with Coinbase Custody providing security. Analysts believe an approval could propel ADA’s price well above $1.00, with potential gains of 40–55% if institutional inflows materialize. Beyond ETF speculation, Cardano continues to build fundamentals with ecosystem upgrades such as smart contract enhancements and the Midnight privacy protocol. Polkadot and Chainlink Join the Rally Polkadot (DOT) and Chainlink (LINK) have also captured investor attention amid ETF buzz and ecosystem progress. DOT, trading around $3.76, has been resilient, with analysts forecasting steady growth toward $4.20 this year and $6.99–$8.45 in 2026 as adoption of its cross-chain technology expands. Chainlink, on the other hand, surged past $23 in late August after the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would publish official economic data on-chain using Chainlink’s oracle network. Bitwise also filed for a Chainlink spot ETF, further fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts see potential for LINK to retest highs near $30 if momentum holds. With ETF speculation filling the market, BlackRock’s conservative stance on XRP contrasts sharply with the aggressive push by rivals into Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink. As SEC decisions approach this fall, the outcome could redefine institutional participation in the broader crypto market.

But while BTC remains the anchor of the market, institutional money is shifting into Ethereum and Solana, where analysts see stronger percentage gains. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining attention as the low-entry token that traders see as an early accumulation play. Bitcoin Bulls Defend Key Levels In late August, Bitcoin moved between $110,000 and $118,000. Bulls defended the $114K level despite short-term pressure. Over $2.5 billion in inflows poured into Bitcoin products last month. Analysts now expect year-end targets between $125K and $160K, with aggressive calls near $190K–$200K. Volatility remains elevated, with 30-day implied levels near 45%. Still, open interest above $82 billion shows institutions are committed to building exposure. Ethereum Strengthens Its Case Ethereum is trading between $4,327 and $4,487. Analysts project a run toward $4,900–$5,200 in September if flows remain strong. Bullish calls stretch as high as $6,000–$8,000 later this cycle. The driver is not just ETF demand but also key upgrades. With EIP-4844 and sharding on the roadmap, Ethereum aims to slash fees and boost speeds, supporting DeFi, gaming, and NFT growth. Solana Keeps Momentum Solana is holding around $210 after a 14% monthly gain. Institutions are reportedly targeting $1 billion in purchases, underscoring confidence. ETF filings from Fidelity, Bitwise, and 21Shares are also awaiting SEC review. Approval could significantly expand access and liquidity. The Firedancer upgrade is another catalyst. Expected to boost Solana’s throughput and stability, it positions the network for broader adoption. Analysts now see targets of $225–$300. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Low Entry Window MAGACOIN FINANCE is the early-stage altcoin gaining traction as the hidden gem to accumulate before the next market cycle. Still under a cent, the project offers investors and traders a low entry point that is fast closing. Based on its momentum, analysts estimate that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a 50x return to investors who get in early. As whale interest and community strength grow, analysts say the low price window is closing. For investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the wildcard in the altcoin conversations for 2025 . Outlook Bitcoin bulls are still anticipating a BTC push to higher six-figure territory. Institutional adoption and ETF demands are factors that can support that climb. However, the bigger catch is in the rotation. Ethereum’s ETF frenzy places it in the middle of the cryptocurrency spotlight. Likewise, Solana’s institutional backers are pulling in capital and giving the token’s price the much-needed support. Beyond the big names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a spot as the altcoin primed to lead the market in future bull cycles.

A decisive break above this level could open the door for a surge toward $225 and beyond. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Historical Pullback Ranges – Healthy Correction Or Trouble Ahead? Analysts highlight that technical signals are aligning with renewed buying pressure from whales and “shark” wallets, suggesting confidence in Solana’s medium-term trajectory. Despite volatility in August, Solana’s price has held above the critical $183–$190 range, forming a base for potential upside. Futures trading volumes exceeding $50 billion further underscore the renewed investor interest. Analysts argue that if momentum continues, Solana could push toward $250 before testing the psychological $300 mark. Alpenglow Upgrade Fuels Institutional Confidence The biggest catalyst behind Solana’s bullish narrative is its Alpenglow upgrade, a game-changing overhaul that has transformed network performance. Block finality has been slashed to 100–150 milliseconds, while throughput now exceeds 107,000 transactions per second (TPS), outpacing Ethereum and even legacy systems like Visa. Key innovations include Votor, an off-chain validation process that reduces bottlenecks, and Rotor, a stake-weighted relay system that cuts latency by 40%. Together, they solve long-standing institutional pain points around speed and reliability. Validator costs have also dropped dramatically, from $60,000 annually to just $1,000, improving decentralization while opening the door for high-frequency trading, tokenized settlements, and real-time DeFi applications. For institutions, the 20+20 resilience model, ensuring operations continue even with 40% validator failures, cements Solana’s reputation as a Nasdaq-grade blockchain infrastructure. With 99.6% validator approval, the upgrade positions Solana as one of the most robust and cost-efficient blockchains available. SOL's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Whale Accumulation and Solana Path to $300 Institutional flows are echoing the bullish momentum. Galaxy Digital recently moved $103 million worth of SOL to Coinbase, sparking speculation about shifting strategies. Meanwhile, hedge funds like Pantera Capital are preparing fresh allocations into Solana’s ecosystem, reinforcing confidence in its long-term growth. At the same time, “shark” wallets have quietly accumulated at key support levels, reflecting strong conviction in Solana’s long-term growth. Analysts caution that failure to clear the $215 resistance could trigger a retest of the $190 zone, but consensus remains that a breakout is likely if accumulation continues.

XRP Makes a Lower Low XRP ended August in a downtrend that took the price to the key support at $2.7, which became a multi-week low. With a lower low confirmed, the current downtrend is likely to continue. However, buyers still have a chance to stop the price at this crucial support since they showed interest when this level was tested on Tuesday. Chart by TradingView 2. Momentum Remains Bearish With volume falling, only a strong return from buyers can reverse the existing bearish momentum. In the past few weeks, sellers have dominated on volume and price, which has created a large descending triangle with a base at $2.7. By mid-September, XRP will likely decide where it will go next. If lower, there is strong support at $2.5. Chart by TradingView 3. MACD Lower Highs On the weekly timeframe, the MACD shows a clear bearish trend with lower highs and falling momentum.

For the first time, a federal agency has published official GDP data to public blockchains, demonstrating how decentralized technology can safeguard transparency and provide global access to critical economic indicators. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported a Q2 2025 GDP growth rate of 3.3 percent on an annualized basis, with the data hash recorded immutably on TRON with the transaction hash: 3f05633fb894aa6d6610c980975cca732a051edbbf5d8667799782cf2ae04040. TRON’s Role in Securing U.S. Economic Data The Department of Commerce recorded the SHA256 hash of the official GDP release on TRON, acknowledging the network’s proven ability to deliver scale, speed, efficiency, and global accessibility. Processing over $22 billion in daily settlement and more than 8.8 million daily transactions, TRON has emerged as a trusted layer of infrastructure not only for financial markets but also for the secure publication of government data worldwide. “Publishing GDP data on chain is a powerful statement about the role TRON now plays as public infrastructure, not only for payments but for safeguarding some of the world’s most important information,” said Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. “This initiative shows how blockchain can advance transparency and trust in ways that strengthen both traditional institutions and decentralized systems. It is only the beginning of how public blockchains like TRON will redefine global access to data and finance.” Publishing the GDP data hash on TRON highlights the role of decentralized networks in preserving data integrity, strengthening accountability, and ensuring open access for citizens, researchers, and policymakers worldwide. It also reflects the United States government’s commitment to leadership in blockchain innovation and to advancing America’s position as the global hub for digital trust and transparency. In August 2025, TRON’s community governance approved a 60 percent reduction in energy fees, sharply lowering transaction costs and immediately driving adoption. Within days, TRON surpassed 2.5 million daily active users, overtaking both BNB Chain and Solana in activity, according to DeFiLlama data. The move was designed to preserve accessibility, particularly for stablecoin transfers, where TRON leads globally with more than $79 billion in USDT circulating on the network. Through its continued commitment to affordability and accessibility, TRON is establishing the foundation for enduring growth and securing its position as a vital infrastructure for the future of the global digital economy. About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018. Until recently, TRON hosted the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin, which currently exceeds $79 billion. As of September 2025, the TRON blockchain has recorded over 329 million in total user accounts, more than 11 billion in total transactions, and over $28 billion in total value locked (TVL), based on TRONSCAN. Recognized as the global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success, TRON is “Moving Trillions, Empowering Billions.” TRONNetwork | TRONDAO | X | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum Media Contact Yeweon Park press@tron.network",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-03 04:47:46

Sellers Took ADA to the Key Support Cardano’s native token tried to hold above the support at $0.90 in late August, but sellers were too strong and the price turned this level into a resistance again. At the time of this post, ADA found good support just above $0.77, and buyers could return here to push it into a relief rally. Chart by TradingView 2. Lower Highs Indicate Weakness If we zoom out on ADA’s price action, we can see that since the end of 2024, the asset has been making lower highs. This is a sign of weakness, even if the price always found strong support above $0.50. The attempts to reclaim a price tag of $1 were rejected every time, and until buyers secure that level, it’s unlikely for ADA to rally higher. Chart by TradingView 3. Volume Dries Up After the spike in buy volume in mid-August, sellers returned and kept the pressure up, with only six daily candles closing in green since then.

The SEC and CFTC released a joint statement Tuesday, saying exchanges registered with either regulator are not prohibited from enabling the trading of certain spot crypto products. The effort shows both agencies working together to expand venue choice and competition in digital markets. “Today’s joint staff statement represents a significant step forward in bringing innovation in the crypto asset markets back to America,” SEC Chairman Paul Atkins said. “Market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets.” Today the SEC and @CFTC issued a Joint Statement clarifying staff’s views that SEC- and CFTC- registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot commodity products: https://t.co/stsgiQTXjf — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) September 2, 2025 Agencies Vow To Work Together On Spot Crypto Oversight CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said the new approach marked a break from the past. “Under the prior administration, our agencies sent mixed signals about regulation and compliance in digital asset markets, but the message was clear: innovation was not welcome. That chapter is over,” she said. The SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets and the CFTC’s Divisions of Market Oversight and Clearing and Risk will coordinate efforts to enable spot crypto trading on registered platforms. The initiative forms part of the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint and builds on recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Regulated Platforms Could Reduce Fraud And Manipulation Risks For everyday investors, spot trading means buying and selling cryptocurrencies directly, rather than trading futures contracts or other derivatives linked to their price. If you purchase Bitcoin on a spot exchange, you own the Bitcoin outright, unlike with futures where you only speculate on its value. This form of trading is popular because it is straightforward, immediate and mirrors the way investors already buy and sell stocks. By giving registered exchanges the green light, regulators are aiming to make the process safer. Licensed platforms must follow strict rules, which could reduce risks of fraud or market manipulation that have plagued unregulated crypto exchanges. This could make crypto trading more appealing to both retail and institutional investors. The joint statement also signals that Washington is keen to bring crypto activity back within its borders. Policymakers believe that stronger regulatory clarity will encourage innovation in the United States, rather than push projects overseas. The agencies stressed that they remain open to engaging with market participants. Spot crypto trading already dominates global digital asset markets, with billions of dollars in daily volume. Allowing US-registered exchanges to participate could strengthen the country’s role in the fast-growing sector while offering investors more trusted venues to trade.

Nobel Economics Laureate Warns Of Potential Financial Crisis,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-nobel-laureate-warns-financial-crisis/,"As stablecoin’s momentum continues to surge worldwide, 2014 Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole recently warned about the risks of a potential financial crisis due to the “insufficient supervision” in the sector. Economist Warns Of Multibillion-Dollar Crisis On Monday, Jean Tirole shared his concerns about inadequate stablecoin oversight amid the recent momentum in the sector, affirming that he was “very, very worried” about the lack of sufficient supervision and the potential hidden risks that it could entail. In an interview with the Financial Times (FT), the professor at the Toulouse School of Economics warned of the possibility that governments could be forced into “multibillion-dollar bailouts” if the digital assets, which are considered “a perfectly safe deposit” by retail traders, unravel in a future financial crisis. He also cautioned that backing stablecoins with US government bonds could become unpopular due to the underlying assets’ relatively low yields, noting previous cases when the returns of Treasury debt were negative for several years and payouts after inflation were even lower. Notably, digital assets pegged to the US dollar are required to be backed on a one-to-one basis by US dollars or Treasury bills after the enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in July. As reported by Bitcoinist, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is allegedly “betting” on the crypto industry to become a key buyer of US Treasuries in the coming years. According to a previous FT report, Bessent has signaled to Wall Street that he expects the industry to “become an important source of demand for US government bonds” as Washington seeks to bolster demand for a surge of new US government debt. The Treasury Secretary has reportedly contacted leading stablecoin issuers, like Circle and Tether , for information, signaling the Treasury Department’s alleged plans to increase sales of short-term bills for the coming quarters. Nonetheless, the Global Chief Economist at financial services firm UBS, Paul Donovan, doesn’t believe that the sector will boost the demand for US government bonds. Donovan considers that “stablecoins are more about redistributing the money supply,” adding that “someone selling Treasury bills to buy stablecoins, which invest the money in Treasury bills, does not change demand for U.S. debt instruments.” Better Stablecoin Oversight Required Following the global push for the sector, the stablecoin market has risen to over $280 billion. Last month, Goldman Sachs affirmed that the industry is “at the beginning of a stablecoin gold rush,” which could potentially bring the global market to trillions of dollars. Tirole considers that stablecoin issuers could be “lured into the temptation” to invest in other assets that “carry higher returns and are riskier.” The higher risk would increase the chance of a potential crisis, triggering a run on the tokens. “If it is held by retail or institutional depositors who thought it was a perfectly safe deposit, then the government will be under a lot of pressure to rescue the depositors so they don’t lose their money,” he detailed, adding that only a few uninsured depositors of traditional banks ever faced losses over the past decades. The economist explained that the potential risks could be managed if global supervisors had enough resources and were incentivized to act carefully. However, he warned this was a “big if,” citing personal and political interests of members of “some key members of the [US] administration.” Nonetheless, the US Treasury Secretary considers that the recent regulatory advancements are sufficient to drive the sector’s growth. “The GENIUS Act provides the fast-growing market with the regulatory clarity it needs to grow into a multitrillion-dollar industry,” Bessent said in July.",Crypto News|award-winning economists|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto adoption|crypto oversight|GENIUS Act|Jean Tirole|Nobel Prize|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoin market|Stablecoin regulation|US Treasury bonds,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 05:00:42

The metric in focus blends the short-term holder market-value-to-realized-value (STH-MVRV) ratio with Bollinger Bands to capture when newer coins trade at statistically depressed valuations versus their cost basis. In the chart Frank shared, the STH-MVRV Bollinger oscillator probed the oversold threshold that previously aligned with local exhaustion of selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Historical Pullback Ranges – Healthy Correction Or Trouble Ahead? More Reasons To Be Bullish For Bitcoin On a companion panel, the STH-SOPR gauge—spent-output profit ratio for coins younger than roughly 155 days—remains below 1.0, signaling that recent buyers are realizing losses into the tape rather than profits. “Short-term holders (top buyers) are in pain & realizing losses,” Frank noted, emphasizing that “STH-SOPR is not high!” Positioning has also turned cleaner in derivatives. “Longs got ‘delevered’ every day last week—that’s seven straight days of magic blue dots,” he said, describing persistent long liquidations and balance-sheet shrinkage among leveraged bulls. He is now “watching for the flip: when they give up and start shorting with leverage (exactly at the wrong time), providing fuel for a potential relief squeeze.” Macro context may be additive, in his view. “Gold hit new highs last week. ‘Gold leads, bitcoin follows.’ The yellow metal often looks around corners, and it might be sniffing out the debasement trade headed into 2026 as the administration stokes the economy for mid-terms,” he wrote, suggesting a potential catch-up dynamic if Bitcoin lags the move in bullion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Dumps Billions For ETH, But $5 Billion Selloff Still Looms Risk markers remain clearly defined. Frank pegs the short-term holder realized price—an aggregate cost basis for recent coins—at $108,800. “If BTC breaks down below the short-term holder cost basis of $108.8k, it may want to investigate demand at the 200-day moving average, which sits at $101k.” That layered support map frames the oversold print as a tactical signal inside a still-intact longer-term uptrend, but it also acknowledges that violations of STH cost basis can extend tests toward the cycle’s primary trend gauge. Taken together, the confluence of these signals presents a strong confluence, according to Frank. Whether history rhymes again will hinge on spot demand emerging above short-term cost basis and on whether any shift toward aggressive shorting provides the fuel for a squeeze. As Frank summarized, “If we are in a bull market—and I believe we are—this is the kind of behavior that typically sets the stage for the next leg higher.” At press time, BTC traded at $111,382.

He noted that the continued dominance of SWIFT, a messaging system launched in 1977, is not simply a matter of preference but rather a reflection of the outdated infrastructure underpinning the financial sector. According to Vincent, most major banks operate on IBM z/OS mainframes and decades-old COBOL-based systems, which remain at the core of their daily operations. Van Code pointed out that large vendors, including FIS, Fiserv, and Jack Henry, maintain control over more than 70 percent of U.S. core banking systems. While these platforms are capable of processing billions of dollars in transactions every day, they are characterized by rigidity, high maintenance costs, and entrenched silos. Attempting to replace them is viewed as extremely risky, with core system overhauls typically requiring between five and seven years and involving expenditures in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Most Banks Are Running on 1970s and 1980s Technology—No Wonder SWIFT Hasn’t Been Replaced So why hasn’t Ripple been adopted yet? Why is SWIFT’s market share so protected? Behind polished banking apps, the global financial system runs on mainframes and COBOL code from the… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) September 2, 2025 The Role of SWIFT in Cross-Border Payments In this context, SWIFT has maintained its position as the standard for cross-border payments because it is already universally adopted within the banking sector. Van Code stated that while many banks present polished digital applications to their customers, their back-end systems are still rooted in outdated code. Instead of replacing core systems, institutions generally rely on layering APIs, middleware, and digital interfaces over their legacy frameworks. This approach allows them to continue using SWIFT as the most stable and cost-effective option available. Even enhancements such as SWIFT GPI , which promise faster and more transparent payments, are described by Van Code as temporary fixes rather than a fundamental transformation of the infrastructure. In his view, these updates are patches on a nearly fifty-year-old foundation that continues to dominate due to its universality and entrenched presence in global finance. Ripple as an Alternative Model Van Code contrasted SWIFT’s traditional approach with Ripple’s modern offering. He explained that Ripple represents a fundamentally different model, one that provides instant settlement, transparency, and the ability to free up trillions in trapped liquidity through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. The blockchain-based transparency offered by Ripple reduces reconciliation costs and enables real-time traceability. Furthermore, Ripple has built a regulatory presence across multiple jurisdictions, reinforcing its position as a serious contender in the payments space. Despite these strengths, Van Code highlighted the complexity of adoption. Ripple would need to integrate with thousands of outdated banking cores, navigate an inconsistent regulatory landscape, and overcome skepticism within a highly risk-averse industry. While XRP’s liquidity continues to grow, he added that perceptions surrounding the asset also remain an obstacle to broader adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Road Ahead for Ripple and Global Finance According to Van Code, SWIFT’s ubiquity remains its strongest advantage, as the network effect of its universal adoption continues to shield it from replacement. Breaking this barrier, he argued, will not happen quickly. Instead, Ripple’s best path forward may lie in acting as a bridge technology, complementing SWIFT while gradually proving its resilience and capabilities. He concluded by stating that the technology behind Ripple is ready to support global finance. Still, the critical question is whether banks are prepared to transition from systems that have been in place for half a century. In his assessment, the banking industry’s reluctance to overhaul its core technology remains the central obstacle to meaningful adoption of new payment infrastructures, such as Ripple.

ADA is now rising and might attempt a clear move above the $0.840 zone. ADA price started a decent upward move from the $0.780 support zone. The price is trading above $0.8120 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.8250 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $0.840 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Steady Increase After a sharp decline, Cardano found support near the $0.780 zone and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to surpass the $0.80 and $0.8250 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a short-term contracting triangle with resistance at $0.8250 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. Finally, the price traded close to the $0.840 level. A high was formed at $0.0.8395 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.7822 swing low to the $0.8395 high. Cardano price is now trading above $0.8250 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.840 zone. The first resistance is near $0.860. The next key resistance might be $0.90. If there is a close above the $0.90 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.980 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.00 in the near term. Another Decline In ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.840 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.0.8250 level. The next major support is near the $0.0.8180 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.7822 swing low to the $0.8395 high. A downside break below the $0.8180 level could open the doors for a test of $0.780. The next major support is near the $0.750 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now above the 50 level.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already surged 300% from its starting price of $0.01, quickly becoming one of the standout success stories of the year. Traders are paying attention not just because of the impressive price growth, but also because the project is delivering what many presales fail to achieve: strong adoption, a clear product, and early signs of market confidence. As anticipation builds ahead of its launch, analysts are noting that MUTM isn’t just another hype-driven token; it’s a DeFi protocol with utility applications. This combination of fast presale growth and long-term fundamentals is why traders are rushing to accumulate the token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The presale journey of Mutuum Finance has been nothing short of remarkable. Starting at $0.01, the token has advanced to its current $0.035 in Phase 6, already handing early participants 300% gains. With the next phase set at $0.04 and a confirmed $0.06 launch price, the incentive for early entry is obvious. So far, Mutuum Finance has raised over $15.25 million and attracted more than 15,950 holders, a clear sign of investor confidence. Presales often struggle to maintain momentum beyond their initial phases, yet MUTM’s consistent growth suggests strong conviction in the project’s potential. By the time the token launches, Phase 6 participants will already have a near double gain, setting the stage for further upside as liquidity expands. Why investors are buying early The appeal of entering early is simple: it maximizes potential returns while minimizing entry cost. A $750 investment at $0.035 secures 21,400 tokens, which would already be worth $1,300 at launch ($0.06). When MUTM meets analyst predictions of climbing toward $0.30–$1 by 2026, that same holding could be valued between $6,430 and $21,430. Whale activity has also been notable. Several large wallets have been tracked entering the presale, providing additional confidence that experienced investors see the token’s upside. In crypto, whale inflows often act as a signal of future momentum, and their presence in Mutuum Finance has reinforced investor sentiment that this is one presale worth accumulating. Beta platform and lending markets The protocol is built around dual lending markets: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Investors supply assets such as ETH or USDC into liquidity pools, earning interest based on utilization. Borrowers access these funds by providing collateral worth more than their loan, ensuring system stability. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Lenders and borrowers can create direct agreements with customized loan terms. For example, a DAI lender could negotiate directly with a USDT borrower, securing better rates than standardized pools. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens (e.g., mtETH for ETH), which increase in redemption value as interest accrues. These tokens can later be redeemed for the underlying asset plus yield or staked in the safety module to earn MUTM rewards. Importantly, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its beta platform as token listing begins. This means that from day one, investors will be able to lend, borrow, and stake on a working protocol. The presence of a live product from the outset also increases the likelihood of listings on top-tier exchanges, as platforms like Binance and Coinbase typically prioritize tokens that demonstrate immediate functionality and user traction. Such listings would not only expand MUTM’s visibility but also drive trading momentum and liquidity, potentially accelerating the token’s value growth in its early stages. Long-term drivers The long-term appeal of Mutuum Finance lies not just in its presale success, but in its forward-looking roadmap: Stablecoin Development: Mutuum Finance is building an overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. Dollar, minted when users supply collateral into the protocol and burned when loans are repaid. This ensures every unit in circulation is fully backed, maintaining transparency and trust. Beyond stability, it creates new use cases such as trading pairs, liquidity pools, and stable borrowing options, while also reinforcing the platform’s treasury and supporting long-term adoption. Buy-and-Distribute Model: Instead of relying on inflationary rewards, Mutuum Finance uses platform fees to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This process creates ongoing buy pressure tied directly to platform usage, helping support token demand while rewarding committed participants. By linking value growth to actual activity, the model promotes sustainability and long-term holder confidence. Together, these growth drivers create a self-sustaining ecosystem where lending demand, stablecoin issuance, and staking rewards all contribute to token value. High-growth coin With a 300% surge in presale price, more than $15.25 million raised, and a community of 15,950+ holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already established itself as one of the most successful token launches of 2025. Its combination of early investor gains, whale inflows, immediate product utility, and ambitious roadmap explains why traders are eager to accumulate before exchange listings. While established tokens like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana continue to dominate headlines, their growth is limited compared to newer projects with greater upside potential. For traders seeking the next big cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance offers a rare blend of affordability, utility, and momentum. If history is any guide, projects that launch with strong presale support and real functionality often become the market’s breakout performers. MUTM appears to be following that path, making it one of the top cryptos to buy now before the wider market catches on.

Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies is the largest corporate ETH holder with close to 1.9 million ETH, which is valued at more than $8.1 billion, alongside $635 million in cash and Bitcoin holdings. The news boosted BitMine’s stock, which has gained over 40% in the past month. ARK Invest also expanded its stake in the company and chairman Tom Lee recently reiterated his bullish views on Ethereum’s long-term outlook. Ethereum Foundation to Trim Holdings Again The Ethereum Foundation (EF) revealed plans to sell roughly $43 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) as part of its strategy to fund ecosystem growth, research, development, and donations. In a post on X , the foundation said it will convert 10,000 ETH, which was valued at around $4,342 per token at the time of the announcement, using centralized exchanges over several weeks. EF clarified that the sale would be executed through multiple smaller orders rather than a single large transaction to limit any potential market disruption. This move was announced shortly after EF temporarily paused its open grant applications to revamp the process. By the first quarter of 2025, the foundation already distributed over $32 million in grants, with allocations spanning education, community initiatives, and research. The group also implemented a treasury policy in June that outlined its approach to Ethereum sales, including periodic evaluations of fiat reserves and calculated decisions on how much ETH should be sold in a given quarter. Since then, EF has sold about $25 million in Ethereum to SharpLink Gaming and conducted additional sales totaling $12.7 million across two separate transactions. The foundation’s history of ETH sales includes a big December 2020 liquidation of 100,000 ETH, which coincided with Ethereum’s run to new all-time highs in the following months. While EF is trimming its holdings to sustain its operations, other players are making moves in the opposite direction. Yunfeng Financial Group disclosed that it bought 10,000 ETH in the open market on the same day, while Ether Machine announced it secured 150,000 ETH to build a corporate treasury ahead of a planned Nasdaq listing. Ether Machine’s total ETH holdings now includes more than 345,000 tokens, valued at around $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, bullish sentiment around Ethereum is also building. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin suggested that Wall Street’s adoption of staking and decentralized infrastructure could push ETH to surpass Bitcoin as a monetary base. Additionally, after hints from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about adjusting US interest rate policy, ETH surged more than 23% in the last month, and was trading hands at $4,334 at the time of writing.

BitMine treasury holdings growth (Source: BitMine ) Altogether, BitMine’s capital amounts to roughly $8.98 billion, giving it a commanding lead over other corporate Ethereum holders. According to data from the Strategic ETH Reserve , the second-largest corporate treasury is SharpLink Gaming, which currently holds around 837.23K ETH, worth approximately $3.64 billion. Top ETH reserve companies ( Source: Strategic ETH Reserve ) The market reacted positively to BitMine’s announcement, with shares trading at $44.13 after a 1.12% increase on the day, according to Google Finance. The company’s stock also surged by close to 41% in the past month, climbing from $31.13 on Aug. 4. The strong performance comes on the back of aggressive treasury-building by the firm. Earlier in August, BitMine added 373,000 ETH to its holdings in just one week, even as its shares dipped by more than 14% during that period. BitMine’s momentum also attracted the attention of major institutional investors. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest added another $15.6 million worth of BitMine shares last month, bringing its total investment in the company to more than $300 million. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who also serves as BitMine’s chairman, said in late August that Ethereum’s price was approaching a bottom, even though the token slipped about 2.5% since then.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MACROECONOMICS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-03 05:30:00

While meme tokens like DOGE and SHIB continue to enjoy large communities and cultural relevance, traders are shifting toward projects that offer both affordability and real-world utility. This transition has placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly in the spotlight as analysts highlight it as one of the most promising tokens to watch heading into the next market cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is no stranger to the spotlight. Launched as a meme token, it became a global phenomenon during the 2021 bull run, fueled by viral hype and endorsements from high-profile figures. Back then, early investors saw astronomical gains as DOGE skyrocketed from fractions of a cent to over $0.70. Today, however, Dogecoin trades near $0.22, far below its all-time high. Despite maintaining a loyal community and occasional bursts of excitement, its lack of structural utility has limited its ability to sustain momentum. DOGE still holds a top position by market cap, but traders who once looked to it for life-changing returns are now seeking projects that combine narrative strength with meaningful technological innovation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) During the meme coin boom, Shiba Inu trailed Dogecoin’s rise, moving from obscurity to becoming one of the market’s most discussed tokens. Its community-driven movement was powerful, and initiatives like Shibarium, its layer-2 scaling solution, were designed to extend its utility beyond memes. Currently, SHIB trades at fractions of a cent, and while it remains an active player in the meme token space, its performance has slowed significantly. The sheer size of its supply makes large price moves more difficult, and its catalysts have struggled to match the excitement of its breakout years. For many traders, SHIB remains stable but no longer offers the kind of explosive growth potential that early holders enjoyed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Against this backdrop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a powerful alternative for investors seeking early entry into a project with real upside. As a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol, Mutuum Finance unites lending, borrowing, and liquidation within one platform. What sets it apart is its dual lending structure. Through peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, users can supply assets into liquidity pools, while peer-to-peer (P2P) lending allows borrowers and lenders to directly agree on terms. This combination ensures both deep liquidity and flexibility for participants. Lenders in the system receive mtTokens, interest-bearing tokens that increase in redemption value over time. Unlike traditional deposit receipts, mtTokens remain transferable ERC-20 tokens, allowing holders to trade them on secondary markets while still earning interest. This feature creates utility beyond simple staking, turning mtTokens into versatile yield-generating assets. To support long-term growth, Mutuum Finance also employs a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of protocol fees is used to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This system creates sustained buy pressure, ensuring that demand for the token continues to grow as the platform scales. The presale has already attracted significant attention. Mutuum Finance has raised over $15.3 million and built a base of more than 15,950 holders. At its current presale price of $0.035, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, early investors are positioned to secure nearly a 100% upside before trading begins. For those aiming to maximize returns, getting in early has become a crucial advantage. Growth catalysts driving analyst predictions Several features in Mutuum Finance’s roadmap strengthen its long-term case. At the top of the list is the beta launch of the platform, which is scheduled to go live as soon as the token lists. Unlike many projects that debut without utility, MUTM will enter the market with fully functioning lending and borrowing features from day one. The protocol also plans to introduce a stable interest rate model, giving borrowers predictable repayment options alongside variable rates. This flexibility appeals to a wider user base and supports sustainable adoption. Beyond its core protocol, Mutuum Finance is creating an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed by ecosystem assets and designed to maintain a US Dollar peg. This stablecoin will expand the protocol’s utility while strengthening reserves. Together, these catalysts provide Mutuum Finance with multiple growth drivers that extend well beyond the initial presale hype, making it a project positioned for lasting relevance. Why MUTM outshines DOGE and SHIB When compared directly, the differences are clear. Dogecoin is still primarily driven by community hype, while Shiba Inu, despite its ecosystem efforts, continues to struggle under the weight of its massive supply. Both remain popular but have limited ability to replicate their earlier explosive runs. Mutuum Finance stands out by offering investors both cost-effective entry and practical utility. At just $0.035, it represents a low-cost entry point with the potential to deliver significant returns. For example, an investor allocating $900 at $0.035 would secure approximately 25,700 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.75 in a future bull run, that position would be worth around $19,300. Gains of this magnitude are far less likely to be achieved with DOGE or SHIB at their current stages of maturity. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain staples of the crypto conversation, but their growth momentum has slowed, and their upside is increasingly limited. Investors preparing for the next bull run are turning toward tokens that combine affordability with functionality. With its presale momentum, $15.3 million raised, over 15,950 holders, innovative lending system, and upcoming beta launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the strongest contenders for 2025. Analysts are clear: for those asking what is the best cryptocurrency to buy before the bull run, the answer may very well be Mutuum Finance.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly capturing the attention of whales seeking DeFi projects with real-world application, sticky usage, and controlled risk mechanisms. Its $1-peg stablecoin, precise oracle-driven valuations, and structured lending environment offer a combination of security and growth potential that contrasts sharply with meme-driven speculation. $1-peg stablecoin and lending mechanics that drive growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) revolves around a decentralized stablecoin designed to stay close to $1. The minting process only occurs when users borrow against overcollateralized assets such as ETH, BNB, or other approved tokens, while burning happens automatically when loans are repaid or liquidated. Only approved issuers are allowed to mint, each with a capped allocation to manage systemic risk. Governance actively adjusts borrowing rates to maintain the peg, while arbitrage opportunities ensure the stablecoin price stays aligned near $1. The combination of borrowing demand and stablecoin usage ensures continuous platform activity, positioning MUTM as a utility-first DeFi project. The protocol supports both variable and stable interest rates. Variable rates adjust dynamically based on pool utilization, while stable rates provide predictable repayment costs. These stable rates start higher than variable rates to compensate for predictability and are subject to rebalancing whenever the current supply rate drops below 90% of what would apply under a fully variable model. Not all tokens qualify for stable borrowing, ensuring that only assets with sufficient liquidity and low volatility participate, protecting platform solvency. On the lending side, P2C pools allow users to deposit blue-chip assets like BNB or ETH. Borrowers can take advantage of risk-tiered LTVs; posting $3,500 in MATIC at 55% LTV enables borrowing $1,925 in a supported asset, with repayments following the chosen rate structure and liquidation thresholds strictly enforced. P2P arrangements cater to higher-risk assets such as SHIB, DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP, and PEPE, allowing isolated contracts with elevated returns while shielding core liquidity from volatility. The presale is currently in Phase 6, with a current price of $0.035. Around $15.24 million has been raised so far, with over 15,950 holders and 32% of the 170 million tokens already sold. The next presale phase will increase the price by 15% to $0.040, representing the last discounted entry before the token gains broader exposure. Early participation allows investors to benefit from the stablecoin-driven platform growth, structured risk management, and eventual listing liquidity. Risk management, price discovery, and strategic roadmap Mutuum Finance (MUTM) applies rigorous risk controls to balance growth and security. Stable assets like USDT and ETH are eligible for up to 75% LTV with liquidation thresholds around 80%, while higher-volatility tokens carry more conservative caps, generally 35–40% LTV with a 65% liquidation threshold. Deposit and borrow caps, Restricted Collateralization Mode, and reserve factor scaling further protect the protocol during extreme market events. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency improves borrowing capacity for correlated stable assets without overexposing the system. Price discovery is anchored in Chainlink oracle feeds for USD and native asset pairs, with fallback or aggregated feeds and DEX TWAPs providing redundancy. This ensures fair valuations and smooth liquidation execution during volatility spikes, keeping the lending ecosystem robust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap spans four phases: Phase 1 covers presale, marketing, helpdesk, audit requests, and giveaways; Phase 2 focuses on building the core smart contracts and infrastructure; Phase 3 finalizes beta testing and exchange listing preparations; Phase 4 delivers the live platform, multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and additional feature enhancements. The beta launch will coincide with the token’s live event, allowing users to engage with the platform before broader exchange activity. Security Security and community trust are reinforced through a CertiK audit, which includes Manual Review and Static Analysis, earning a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a CertiK Skynet score of 78.00, with the audit timeline requested on 2/25/2025 and revised on 5/20/2025. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program rewards issues by severity—Critical up to $2,000, Major up to $1,000, Medium up to $500, and Low up to $200. A $100K giveaway awards ten participants $10,000 worth of MUTM each, while 12K+ Twitter followers indicate strong social engagement. Investment examples highlight MUTM’s upside potential. A Phase 1 participant who rotated $1,200 from BTC is already positioned with strong paper gains at $0.035 and sees a straightforward path toward the $1 milestone, underpinned by stablecoin usage, oracle-backed liquidations, and beta platform activity. A new buyer entering at $0.035 before the 15% uplift is similarly positioned to ride the utility-driven growth story. As traders consider why crypto is down and watch traditional crypto ETFs for stability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a utility-driven DeFi opportunity. Phase 6 is 32% sold, and the next 15% price increase signals the last window to enter at a discounted rate. Unlike DOGE, the $1 narrative for MUTM is anchored in real usage, robust risk management, and strategic beta deployment, giving investors a practical path toward substantial returns.

That history has inspired a constant hunt for the “next ETH moment,” where an emerging project delivers both disruptive technology and exponential upside. In the midst of volatile crypto prices today, whispers among retail communities are pointing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the token with the ingredients to follow that legendary path. Retail traders seek the next ETH moment What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its design around stability and efficiency in decentralized finance. A central piece of the project’s ecosystem is its stablecoin, pegged at $1, that will be minted only through overcollateralized loans. This ensures that every unit of stablecoin in circulation is backed by assets worth more than its face value, protecting against under-collateralization risks that have destabilized other protocols. Interest rates will adjust dynamically to maintain the peg. If demand for the stablecoin rises and the price drifts higher than $1, borrowing costs will fall to encourage new supply. If the peg slips below, rates will increase to contract issuance and restore balance. Alongside this, arbitrage opportunities will keep traders incentivized to close the gap quickly, reinforcing the stablecoin’s resilience. For retail traders who watched previous experiments fail during a crypto crash, this type of transparent, rule-based framework inspires confidence. The combination of borrower rate structures, liquidity controls, and oracle-driven transparency is why many see MUTM as more than just another presale—it is a system designed for long-term adoption. Much like ETH once proved with its smart contracts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself with real utility from day one. Presale growth and retail momentum The presale is in Phase 6, with tokens priced at $0.035. Over $15.24 million has already been raised, and one-third of this round is sold out with 15,950 holders onboarded. Once this allocation closes, the price will climb by 15% to $0.040. Retail traders who understand the rhythm of presales know that each stage creates a built-in upside, accelerating momentum before listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not limiting its ambitions to presale fundraising. The team has mapped a four-phase roadmap that outlines development from beta testing to scaled adoption. The beta launch of the platform will go live alongside the token’s launch, ensuring immediate functionality rather than delaying utility. This commitment resonates with traders who have seen too many projects listed without delivering a working product. Compliance is another part of the blueprint, showing that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) understands the importance of trust in DeFi. The protocol has undergone a full audit with CertiK, earning strong technical scores, and is running a $100,000 giveaway to encourage broader retail participation while reinforcing its community-first approach. Security layers like these matter when retail investors weigh new entries, especially after years of market headlines highlighting weakly protected projects. For many traders, the opportunity here is as much about timing as it is about fundamentals. Every presale has a window before listing when discounted entry is still possible, and once tokens shift into public exchange liquidity, that advantage closes. This is where fear of missing out builds. Those who wait too long to secure allocations will be competing in open markets where early investors already hold significant multiples. Conclusion That is why comparisons to ETH’s early cycle are surfacing with increasing frequency in retail circles. Ethereum once offered a simple value proposition that evolved into an unstoppable ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its stablecoin, lending mechanisms, and roadmap aligned with real adoption, is earning the same type of early confidence. While nothing in crypto is ever identical, the structure of MUTM’s growth path makes the parallel hard to ignore. As retail traders search for the project that replicates ETH’s early breakout, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a frontrunner. At $0.035 today with a clear trajectory toward higher stages, the decision for many is whether to wait until exchanges take control of price discovery—or join the presale window while it remains open. For those chasing the next big crypto investment, this DeFi project is already shaping up to be one of the most talked-about opportunities in the market.

Regulatory clarity received a boost when the SEC and CFTC issued a joint statement stating that registered exchanges can offer spot cryptocurrency trading, including with margin and leverage. No assets were named, but it’s a more friendly US stance towards digital assets. The announcement follows recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets and could pave the way for the NYSE and Nasdaq to list spot Bitcoin and Ethereum products. This shift aligns with broader policy from the Trump administration, which has reduced lawsuits and encouraged growth across the crypto sector. For BTC, the approval adds legitimacy, increases access for U.S. investors, and strengthens institutional confidence. Strategy’s $449M Bitcoin Buy Reinforces Confidence Institutional demand remains a central driver. Last week, Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased 4,048 BTC for $449 million at an average price of $110,981, raising its August total to 7,714 BTC. This figure is smaller than July’s massive 31,000 BTC acquisition but still underscores consistent conviction. Strategy has acquired 4,048 BTC for ~$449.3 million at ~$110,981 per bitcoin. Most shares purchased by issuing an additional 1.2 million $MSTR shares. pic.twitter.com/zPbOBTdSip — FinancialFreedom (@FinFreedom414) September 2, 2025 In total, Strategy now holds 636,505 BTC, worth around $46.95 billion, at an average cost of $73,765 per coin. Saylor has described the company’s equity offerings as a “Bitcoin defense department,” funding large-scale purchases while reinforcing its long-term view of BTC as a reserve asset. Despite raising dividends to 10% in July, Strategy’s stock has fallen 16%, sparking debate over sustainability. Yet its steady accumulation continues to act as a bullish signal, supporting BTC above $110,000. Key takeaways from recent activity: SEC and CFTC authorize spot trading on registered exchanges. Strategy buys $449M in BTC, lifting total holdings above 636K BTC. Retail adoption continues with small businesses and payment products. Small Businesses and Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook Adoption is no longer just an institutional story. Tahini’s, the Canadian shawarma chain owned by the Hamam brothers, has been buying Bitcoin since 2020 to hedge against currency debasement. Inspired by the early BTC advocates, the company has grown to 65 locations , added a Bitcoin ATM, and is opening its first US location. They are still buying Bitcoin for its utility and growth potential. Tahinis just purchased Bitcoin. We also just opened our 65th restaurant. We are also opening our first restaurant in the US (Loves Park, Illinois) in a few weeks. Big month for Tahinis — Tahini’s (@TheRealTahinis) September 2, 2025 On the charts, Bitcoin is showing resilience after rebounding from $108,500. The RSI has climbed to 57, signaling improved buying strength, while the MACD histogram has turned positive, indicating a potential bullish crossover. Price action has also produced bullish engulfing candles, reinforcing momentum. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin is pressing resistance near $111,745. A breakout could target $113,435 and $115,475, breaking the descending channel and shifting sentiment toward accumulation. Failure to hold would bring $108,500 and $107,300 back into play. For traders, the outlook leans bullish. If Bitcoin clears $111,745 with conviction, the path toward $130,000 becomes increasingly credible. With regulatory clarity, institutional confidence, and retail adoption aligning, Bitcoin’s consolidation may be less a ceiling and more the base for its next major rally. Presale Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Combines Bitcoin Security With Solana Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Solana’s high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations. Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $13.4 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today’s stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012845—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses. You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

Analysts claim a $0.035 gem could beat both on road to $5,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/03/xrp-vs-ada-which-is-stronger-analysts-claim-a-0-035-gem-could-beat-both-on-road-to-5/,"As the crypto market oscillates, investors are constantly comparing legacy tokens like XRP and ADA. Both have seen bursts of momentum in the past, but in recent months, their growth has slowed, leaving traders and long-term holders searching for asymmetric opportunities. Analysts now suggest that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing presale, is positioned to outperform both, with a potential path to $5 in the coming years. Unlike tokens relying on hype cycles, MUTM’s foundation is built on real DeFi utility and structured financial design, which is expected to support sustainable growth and demand. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale will continue to attract attention, having already generated $15.24 million with over 15,950 holders participating. Currently, 32% of this phase’s supply has been claimed, setting the stage for a 15% price increase in the next phase from $0.035 to $0.040. This makes the timing critical for investors seeking early entry into a project with high structural leverage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fully audited by CertiK, earning a Token Scan score of 95, giving participants confidence in the protocol’s security and operational integrity. Stronger fundamentals drive MUTM’s future upside One of the core mechanisms that will increase demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its reserve factor, which will capture a portion of borrower interest to form a strong on-chain safety buffer. This accumulation will provide deployable assets for treasury operations and incentives, effectively creating a channel where growing borrowing activity will translate into higher protocol-backed utility for MUTM. Liquidity-aware liquidation incentives will ensure that undercollateralized positions close efficiently with minimal slippage, maintaining orderly markets and preserving confidence in the system. This approach contrasts sharply with legacy coins that occasionally experience flash crashes and unpredictable liquidations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also employ a robust oracle strategy, combining Chainlink primary feeds with fallback and aggregated sources as well as DEX TWAPs. This design will provide accurate pricing and reliable liquidation triggers, allowing both lenders and borrowers to act with certainty. Caps on deposits and borrowing, along with a restricted collateral mode, will reduce systemic risk and prevent exposure to illiquid assets, further reinforcing trust. Analysts see these risk management structures as a foundation for broader adoption, making MUTM a DeFi gem that can withstand market volatility while supporting predictable revenue streams. Growth catalysts set to propel MUTM to $5 The upcoming beta launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will coincide with the token live event, enabling real users to engage with borrowing, lending, and staking features from day one. This real-world adoption is expected to generate recurring fee revenue and enhance token utility. In addition, Layer-2 integration will dramatically reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, enabling frequent micro-loans and repeated participation in staking programs. Combined with the $1-peg stablecoin that anchors the platform, these features are anticipated to drive liquidity, recurring usage, and long-term demand for MUTM. Expected listings on top-tier exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken, will further amplify the token’s visibility and accessibility to global retail and institutional investors. This exposure will complement the protocol’s internal demand drivers, positioning MUTM as a high-potential token in the DeFi market. Conservative models predict that the combined effect of beta-driven usage, Layer-2 efficiency, and mtToken staking lock-up could materially increase demand while increasing effective demand, reinforcing the trajectory toward a $5 valuation. Memorize that borrowing depends on the LTV ratio, and lending yield depends on pool utilization and the LTV ratio. With Phase 6 already 32% sold and a 15% price increase imminent, investors are encouraged to act decisively. XRP and ADA may stall in the months ahead, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to chart its own path, potentially becoming the $5 breakout story of DeFi in the coming years while offering a robust alternative for disciplined crypto investment and strong portfolio diversification.

(TSMC)’s clearance to freely send key equipment to its biggest chipmaking hub in China, raising the risk of disruptions at the facility. The US has decided to strip the chipmaker of its validated end user (VEU) privileges for its Nanjing facility, a step in line with earlier rollbacks of Samsung and SK Hynix’s China operations. The exemptions will phase out over the next four months. The company stated , “TSMC has received notification from the US government that our VEU authorization for TSMC Nanjing will be revoked effective Dec. 31, 2025.” The company said it is still assessing the situation and engaging with US authorities, though it remains committed to running its Nanjing plant without disruption. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs stated the waiver loss could stir uncertainty on Nanjing’s production Without VEU privileges, TSMC’s vendors must seek individual licenses for each shipment of US-controlled semiconductor tools to Nanjing, rather than relying on automatic authorization. US regulators have assured companies that they will give the necessary approvals to keep operations going. However, companies now face doubt over how quickly permits can be obtained. License requests are already piling up, and officials are reportedly trying to find fixes to simplify the approval process. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs has even argued that scrapping the US waiver would create uncertainty around the Nanjing factory’s output. Even so, the Nanjing plant makes up about 3% of TSMC’s total production capacity, and thus, the ministry expects little impact on Taiwan’s overall chip competitiveness. Still, TSMC’s US-listed American depositary receipts fell as much as 2.3% on Tuesday. Currently, per Bloomberg’s data, Applied Materials, ASML, Tokyo Electron, and KLA are TSMC’s biggest suppliers. Though their stocks slid on Tuesday, Applied Materials and KLA in New York trading and ASML and Tokyo Electron through their ADRs posted steeper losses than the market overall. The companies were already operating under US curbs on China shipments, and the loss of the waiver could introduce further complications for their work with TSMC. The BIS revoked Samsung and SK Hynix VEU licenses Last week, US regulators stripped Samsung and SK Hynix of their validated end-user designations, saying the change was aimed at plugging “export control loopholes” that exposed US companies to unfair competition. The federal register was updated to reflect the removals and Intel’s former status for its Dalian factory, which SK Hynix later bought. Officials said the action would add roughly 1,000 new license reviews annually. TSMC’s VEU status was never published in the Federal Register, leaving BIS nothing to formally amend. However, the practical impact doesn’t differ—suppliers to the chipmakers’ Chinese facilities will soon need US approval for restricted tool shipments. The US has rolled out broad export restrictions to keep China from securing American chipmaking tools that could be used for advanced semiconductors and AI. Those curbs affect not only Chinese companies but also facilities owned by Samsung, SK Hynix, and TSMC in the country. Biden’s team allowed TSMC, Samsung, and SK Hynix to continue shipping gear to their China facilities under an indefinite waiver, provided they adhered to security conditions and transparency requirements. The VEU designation, made public through US announcements for the Korean firms and in TSMC’s filings, was considered a key safeguard for their governments, since fabs depend on frequent imports.

Recent whale flows into altcoins suggest that the hunt for projects capable of delivering multiples beyond 40x is intensifying. Unlike speculative bets, these rotations are increasingly guided by fundamentals, risk frameworks, and transparent mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a project that meets this checklist, combining stablecoin utility, disciplined lending mechanics, and oracle-driven price discovery to offer traders a structured path to outsized gains. BTC whales rotate $1B into alts Bitcoin (BTC) whales shifted $1 billion into altcoins over the past week, ending August 31, 2025, contributing to BTC’s dominance dropping to ~59%. BTC trades at ~$113,000, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45 billion, down 2.3% weekly. The rotation, favoring assets like Ethereum and Solana, aligns with $800 million in BTC liquidations amid US tariff concerns and Federal Reserve uncertainty. Technical indicators show BTC testing $112,000 support, with RSI at 46 and resistance at $116,713. Social media reflects growing altcoin enthusiasm, with whale moves signaling a potential altcoin season. Analysts project BTC could hit $121,500 if $116,713 breaks, but a drop below $112,000 risks $110,000, further boosting altcoin momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): utility and risk tooling that appeals to whales Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized borrowing-and-lending protocol designed to balance growth with safety. Borrowers will be required to overcollateralize positions, with LTV ratios dynamically adjusted based on asset volatility. Liquidation triggers are carefully calibrated, ensuring undercollateralized positions are flagged for corrective action, while liquidation penalties reward liquidators and feed the protocol’s reserve factor. The reserve factor itself varies by asset, with stablecoins carrying lower rates and high-volatility tokens carrying higher allocations to offset systemic risk. Deposit caps and borrow caps prevent excessive exposure to any single token, while Restricted Collateralization Mode isolates high-risk or illiquid assets, preventing contagion across pools. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency allows correlated assets, such as stablecoins, to achieve higher LTVs, improving capital efficiency without jeopardizing protocol solvency. Collectively, these features create an environment where whales can deploy significant capital without unnecessary exposure to extreme price swings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stable interest-rate model adds another layer of predictability. The initial rate is locked at a weighted average of the variable rate plus market indicators, starting higher to compensate for future predictability. A rebalancing condition is triggered when the current supply rate falls below 90% of the hypothetical all-variable scenario, allowing the protocol to adjust stable rates to maintain liquidity integrity. Not all tokens qualify for this model, ensuring volatile or low-liquidity assets do not undermine system stability. P2C, P2P lending, and presale momentum Lending on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer compelling yields. For example, depositing $20,000 USDT into a P2C pool with a utilization-driven 13% APY generates $2,600 annually. A borrower posting $14,000 in BTC at 70% LTV can borrow $9,800, with repayments following the variable rate path. For higher-risk tokens like PEPE, FLOKI, DOGE, SHIB, and TRUMP, P2P arrangements allow direct negotiation between lenders and borrowers, isolating risk while providing opportunities for higher returns. The presale is currently in Phase 6, priced at $0.035. Around $15.24 million has been raised so far, with 32% of the 170 million allocated tokens already sold and over 15,950 holders onboard. The next presale stage will increase the price by 15% to $0.040, presenting the last discounted entry for new participants. This timing aligns with the platform’s roadmap, which progresses from initial presale and marketing in Phase 1, to core development in Phase 2, final beta testing in Phase 3, and a multi-chain live launch with token listings and institutional partnerships in Phase 4. The beta will go live alongside the token, providing early users the opportunity to interact with the platform before exchange liquidity takes over. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures precise price discovery through Chainlink oracles, with fallback and aggregated feeds, and DEX TWAPs as backup. Borrow interest rates adjust dynamically according to pool utilization, maintaining healthy liquidity even in volatile conditions. Security and community trust are reinforced through a CertiK audit (Manual Review and Static Analysis), with a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, alongside a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program that rewards critical issues up to $2,000. A $100K giveaway rewards ten early participants with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, while 12K+ Twitter followers reflect a growing and engaged community. Final words Early investment examples highlight the potential for outsized returns. A Phase 2 allocator who rotated $5,000 from ETH now sits with projected gains toward a 43x target, driven by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin minting and burning activity, disciplined rate models, and oracle-backed liquidation safeguards. New entrants at $0.035 before the 15% step-up similarly position themselves for substantial upside, benefiting from structured risk frameworks and beta exposure. As BTC continues to anchor institutions and broader crypto ETFs, traders searching for asymmetric returns see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a disciplined opportunity with 43x growth potential.

In a post on X on Wednesday, Dalio described crypto as an “alternative currency” with limited supply. He argued that if the supply of dollars rises or demand for them falls, investors may increasingly view crypto as a better option. Dalio, who built Bridgewater Associates into the world’s largest hedge fund, wrote to clarify comments he made in a recent Financial Times interview. He said most fiat currencies, particularly those burdened with large debts, will struggle to maintain value. History, he noted, offers parallels, with similar dynamics playing out between 1930 and 1940 and again from 1970 to 1980. https://t.co/TNyPpZYTmZ — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) September 2, 2025 Mounting Debt Loads Weigh On Appeal Of Reserve Currencies He added that deregulation does not threaten the dollar’s reserve currency status. Instead, he pointed to the mounting debt loads of the US and other reserve-currency issuers as the real danger, arguing that these conditions undermine their appeal as both reserve assets and stores of wealth. This, he said, has contributed to rising prices for gold and cryptocurrencies. Dalio also dismissed concerns that stablecoins , many of which are backed by US Treasuries, pose systemic risks. The bigger issue, he said, lies in the falling purchasing power of Treasuries themselves. “That shouldn’t produce any systemic risk in stablecoins if they are well-regulated,” he wrote. Investor Warns US Faces ‘Classic Devaluation’ Of Its Currency In July, Dalio advised investors to allocate about 15% of their portfolios to Bitcoin or gold . He warned that the US is heading toward a “classic devaluation” of its currency, similar to the episodes of the 1930s and 1970s, as the country approaches what he called a “point of no return” in its debt crisis. Billionaire Ray Dalio recommends 15% Bitcoin allocation warning of 'classic fiat currency devaluation' as US debt reaches unsustainable point of no return. #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/L9BnkbqT0H — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 28, 2025 He laid out stark figures to make his case. The US government spends about $7 trillion annually while raising only $5 trillion in revenue, leaving a $2 trillion deficit. To cover its obligations, Washington must sell an estimated $12 trillion in new debt in the coming year. Interest payments alone have reached $1 trillion annually, representing half the budget deficit. Gold’s Role As Second-Largest Reserve Asset Drives Dalio’s Preference Dalio has consistently shown a preference for gold over Bitcoin, citing gold’s role as the world’s second-largest reserve asset. While he sees potential in digital currencies, he continues to view the precious metal as a stronger hedge. Earlier this year, Dalio cautioned that the US could face a crisis deeper than a recession if President Donald Trump mismanages tariffs and broader economic policy. Dalio’s latest remarks reflect a growing chorus of concern among investors who see ballooning debt as the biggest threat to the dollar’s dominance.

The sales development company has acquired 500 BTC with the sale proceeds, a company release said. CIMG’s board noted that the Bitcoin purchase aligns with the firm’s financial management strategy and long-term Bitcoin holding agenda. “Moving forward, the company intends to continue to increase its digital asset reserves and pursue collaborations across AI and crypto ecosystems, such as Merlin Chain,” said Wang Jianshuang, CEO of CIMG. CIMG, which also focuses on digital health, sold the shares via a private placement pursuant to Regulation S. This means that the transaction is exempt from the US SEC Securities Act registration requirements. Nasdaq-listed CIMG Inc. announced the completion of the sale of 220 million common shares, raising a total of $55 million in exchange for 500 Bitcoin, as part of its long-term Bitcoin holding strategy to establish a Bitcoin reserve. https://t.co/Qqp5bFAV8m — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) September 3, 2025 Bitcoin Reserves Quickly Become New Corporate Strategy Playbook Several companies have established corporate crypto treasuries, following the successful accumulation of Bitcoin by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. There are over 170 Bitcoin Treasury Companies in operation, where the majority have dissolved their original business plan to instead focus on raising equity to buy Bitcoin. Thomas Fecker-Boxler, Interim CEO of the Web3 Foundation, believes the recent wave of corporate treasuries moving into Bitcoin is less a surprise and more a predictable outcome of capital chasing easy gains. Speaking to Cryptonews, he said that the trend is “double-edged,” carrying the risk of instability. “The silver lining is that a new segment of capital is entering the market, potentially broadening adoption and deepening liquidity,” he noted. “But this is less a sign of structural maturity than opportunistic allocation. Ultimately, the trend is double-edged: it brings fresh capital and visibility, but also carries the risk of instability if approached purely as a financial play.” Further, he compared the dynamics with those of traditional markets, “where momentum builds, balance sheets stretch, and structures eventually unwind in a disorderly fashion.” “The sustainability of corporate crypto treasuries will depend less on short-term enthusiasm and more on the leverage and balance sheet structures behind them—especially where convertibles and convexity are involved.” CIMG Stock Tumbles 3.53% CIMG’s pivot to Bitcoin treasury comes at a time when the firm is facing significant financial challenges, with declining revenue, negative profit margins, and financial instability. The company’s income statement shows a substantial downturn. Following the BTC accumulation plan announcement, CIMG stock fell 3.53% on Tuesday, closing at $0.2543.

CBD Data Shows Divergence In Spot Activity For Bitcoin & Ethereum In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) has diverged between Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The CBD refers to an indicator that tells us about the amount of a given asset that addresses or investors on the network last purchased at each of the price levels visited by the cryptocurrency in its history. This metric is useful because investors put special emphasis on their break-even level and tend to make some kind of move when a retest of it occurs. The more amount of the asset that the holders purchased at a particular level, the stronger is their reaction to a retest. Now, first, here is a chart that shows the trend in the CBD for Bitcoin over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin CBD acquired a large “air gap” when Bitcoin saw its explosive rally back in July. This happened because BTC moved through price levels too fast for buying and selling to occur at them, so very few coins were able to receive a cost basis at them. As BTC consolidated after the rally cooling off, levels started being filled up with supply. The same has followed during the latest phase of decline and now, the previous air gap has disappeared. This shows that demand for spot trading has maintained for the cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin has seen this trend, the CBD has behaved differently for the second largest asset in the sector, Ethereum. From the chart, it’s apparent that Ethereum’s rallies have also created air gaps, but unlike Bitcoin, its phases of slowdown haven’t resulted in any levels filling up to a notable degree. “This suggests ETH price dynamics may be more influenced by off-chain markets such as derivatives,” notes Glassnode. Historically, price action built on products like derivatives has often proven to be more volatile. Given that Ethereum is currently not observing any high levels of spot buying, it only remains to be seen what the fate of its bull run would be. In some other news, Bitcoin has been trading near an important on-chain cost basis level after the recent price decline, as CryptoQuant author Maartunn has pointed out in an X post . The level in question is the average cost basis of the short-term holders , investors who purchased their Bitcoin within the past 155 days. In the past, losing the level often resulted in short-term shifts to bearish phases. ETH Price Ethereum has been on the way down recently with its price falling to $4,270 after a 6% weekly pullback.",Ethereum|bitcoin|btc|ETH|Ethereum Derivatives|ethereum price|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 06:00:31

This move comes as the firm’s co-founder, Michael Saylor, remains optimistic about the digital asset’s long-term potential, even in the face of recent price corrections that have seen Bitcoin dip over 10% below its all-time highs. Strategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Spree In a recent update shared on X (formerly Twitter), Saylor revealed that Strategy acquired 6,048 Bitcoin for a total price of $449.3 million between August 26 and September 1, 2025. This latest purchase adds to the firm’s substantial holdings, which now total 636,505 BTC, acquired at an average cost of approximately $73,765 per Bitcoin, amounting to an investment of around $46.95 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Could Start On September 13, Analyst Predicts Saylor also highlighted that Strategy has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 25.7% year-to-date (YTD). Additionally, the firm provided updates on its at-the-market offering programs, which included the sale of various preferred shares and common stock, generating significant net proceeds. This includes 199,509 shares of 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike preferred stock for $19 million, 237,931 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Strife preferred stock for $26.5 million, and 1,237,000 shares of MSTR for $425.3 million. The aggressive investment strategy employed by Saylor’s firm has inspired other public companies to explore similar avenues. Strategy has been a trailblazer in this space, being one of the first publicly traded companies to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. This growing trend is bolstered by favorable regulations and initiatives stemming from President Donald Trump’s administration, which have facilitated broader adoption of these assets, including altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP. Metaplanet Becomes Seventh-Largest BTC Holder A notable example of this investment shift by public companies is Metaplanet, often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy.” The company has approved a plan to sell up to 550 million new shares overseas, aiming to raise approximately 130.3 billion yen ($884.41 million) to finance additional Bitcoin purchases. Once a hotel operator, Metaplanet has pivoted to focus on cryptocurrencies, inspired by Saylor’s approach. Founder and CEO Simon Gerovich liquidated most of the company’s hotel assets, which had been struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, redirecting those funds into Bitcoin starting in April 2024. Related Reading: Is XRP A Meme Coin? Analyst Reveals How Whales Are Playing The Game Metaplanet’s strategy has proven effective, as it has become the seventh-largest holder of Bitcoin among public treasuries globally, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data. The company recently announced on Monday the addition of 1,009 BTC to its total, bringing its holdings to 20,000. Its stock, MTPLF, has experienced a surge of about 740% YTD, currently valued at $5.82 per share. Strategy’s stock, under the ticker symbol MSTR, is trading at $343 as of this writing, up 2.5% from Monday’s price. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades at $111,630, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-buy-xrp-asap-heres-why/,"Financial expert Levi has issued a direct call to investors to purchase XRP immediately, emphasizing the potential for sharp market movements in the coming days. In a video posted alongside his tweet, which displayed the message “BUY XRP ASAP,” Levi analyzed the current liquidation heat map for XRP, pointing out a significant concentration of liquidations at higher levels. He stated that if an investor holds any amount of XRP, they should prepare for a substantial market reaction. According to Levi, the chart data clearly shows a high number of short liquidations at elevated price levels. He attributed this imbalance to the trading behaviors of retail participants, who are more likely to use extreme levels of leverage compared to institutional investors . Levi explained that retail traders often attempt to generate fast returns from limited capital, which leads them to rely heavily on borrowing at what he described as “crazy leverages.” BUY #XRP ASAP pic.twitter.com/dAW2JNHulZ — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) September 1, 2025 Retail Traders Versus Institutional Strategies Levi contrasted the approach of retail traders with that of institutions, highlighting the difference in risk tolerance and capital resources. He noted that institutions, armed with “billions and billions of dollars,” do not rely on high leverage to profit from price swings. Instead, they analyze liquidation heat maps and spot opportunities to force liquidations by moving the market toward vulnerable price levels. He emphasized that institutional traders can intentionally push prices upward to trigger these liquidations. Levi specifically mentioned the level of $2.92 for XRP, suggesting that institutions could target this price point as an area of concentrated short positions. He explained that this type of move would result in a sudden spike, referred to as a “massive wick” on the chart, as leveraged traders are liquidated. Parallels With Bitcoin and Ethereum Levi also drew attention to similar patterns forming across other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum . He suggested that the same dynamic of retail over-leverage and institutional targeting is currently in play within these markets. The observation indicates that the anticipated movement in XRP could coincide with broader volatility in the cryptocurrency sector. The timing of these developments, according to Levi, is imminent. He stated that the market could intensify as early as next week, predicting that conditions will become “absolutely insane.” His remarks suggest expectations of both rapid price increases and sudden corrections as liquidations unfold across different assets. Market Outlook Levi’s video commentary underscores his view that XRP is poised for significant price activity driven by the interplay between retail leverage and institutional trading strategies. His urgent recommendation to “BUY XRP ASAP” is rooted in his interpretation of liquidation heat map data and his belief that institutions will exploit current market positioning.

The largest token by market capitalization has declined in nine of the last 14 September months, with an average monthly loss of around 12%. This seasonality looms large again in 2025. Bitcoin opened the week near $110,000, its weakest level in nearly two months, and total crypto market capitalization has slipped to $3.74 trillion, reaching a three-week low. BTC prices have been flat over the past 24 hours, with Solana’s SOL (SOL) leading gains at 4%, XRP (XRP) posting 1% and Cardano’s ADA (ADA) rising 1.5%. Traders say the combination of macro uncertainty, fragile sentiment, and thinning volumes leaves little room for error heading into what has historically been the toughest month on the calendar. The technicals don’t inspire much confidence either. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, noted that the broader capitalization chart “continues to record a series of lower lows, signaling a downward trend.” He pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to hold $112,000 and warned of “further decline toward the $105,000 area,” a level that has long acted as support before the psychological $100,000 barrier. The crypto fear index has slipped back toward 40, its lowest since April, suggesting nerves are rising before they’ve fully broken. In 2017, bitcoin dropped nearly 8% in September despite the euphoric rally that carried it to $20,000 later that year. In 2019, the token lost almost 14% in September, foreshadowing months of sideways action. Even in the latest cycle, September 2021 and 2022 both saw steep drawdowns, reminding traders that liquidity drains and macro jitters often coincide with the end of summer. This year, those headwinds are visible in ETF flows. After steady accumulation through much of August, spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded net outflows of $440 million last week. Ether ETFs, which launched just last year, posted more than $1 billion in inflows, marking a rare bright spot but also a sign that capital may be rotating rather than growing overall. Meanwhile, CryptoQuant data shows spot ETFs have now absorbed more than 1.3 million BTC, nearly 6% of total supply, putting them on par with the largest exchanges for market share. The risk is that support levels break before macro relief arrives. Non-farm payrolls due Friday are expected to show just 45,000 new jobs, confirming a slowing U.S. labor market. A soft print would strengthen the case for a September rate cut from the Fed, a catalyst that could flip sentiment back to risk-on. Until then, traders are paying up for downside hedges.

51113239,572607,1756882832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51113239.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.19 May Be Imminent If This Happens,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-crash-0-19/,"Unlike larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Dogecoin price remains low and is still a long way from its all-time high that was reached back in 2021. Now, especially with the crypto market seeing intense selling pressure all around, the Dogecoin price is still at risk of a massive decline, and this decline could trigger the next wave of losses. A 10% loss from here will already break the support at $0.2, and a crypto analyst has predicted more downside. Why Dogecoin Price Is At Risk Of Decline Crypto analyst MadWhale presented an analysis of the Dogecoin price chart that shows a possible price decline from here. This is attributed to both broader development on the Dogecoin network, as well as technical analysis that continues to point toward heightened weakness on the chart. The first of these is that Dogecoin could be seeing a cut in its issuance. The DOGE supply is unlimited, meaning that the possibilities for inflation are endless. However, if there is a cut in issuance, i.e, how much miners are paid for confirming transactions on the blockchain, then the DOGE inflation rate could be greatly reduced. This would mean less supply to the demand. But in this case, the crypto analyst does see it as a signal that would cause investors to exist. A reason for this could be that as miner rewards reduce, then exits from the miners to other, more profitable blockchains would mean that the network security of the Dogecoin network weakens. Thus, it could mount short-term pressure on price, leading to price declines, rather than gains. On the technical side of things, the Dogecoin price has also continued to move inside a descending channel . This has cut across several sessions, and the decline has put it on a path to testing a key support level. If the support above $0.2 fails, then a quick 15% decline could follow. As the crypto analyst explains, there is the possibility that the crash goes deeper than expected. In any case, a 15% crash would push the Dogecoin price back below $0.19, signaling a takeover by the bears, with the next major support level sitting at $0.1845. Other Things To Know About DOGE One bullish development that has emerged for the Dogecoin price is the proposed Dogecoin treasury . Alex Spiro, popularly known for being Elon Musk’s personal attorney, plans to raise $200 million to buy DOGE, suggesting that a lot of demand could be headed DOGE’s way, which could drive the price higher. However, looking at the on-chain activity for Dogecoin , the prospects are not too good. Data from Santiment shows that development on the network has screeched to a halt. Trading volume has also remained muted for the meme coin, with Coinglass showing an average of less than $3 billion daily across all credits.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 07:00:32

Exchange Reserve Spikes To Highest In Months,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-trouble-exchange-reserve-spikes-highest/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve has witnessed a spike recently, a sign that could be bearish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Has Hit A Multi-Month High In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Reserve of Bitcoin. The “Exchange Reserve” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total amount of the cryptocurrency that is sitting on the wallets attached to centralized exchanges. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are making net deposits of the asset to these platforms. Generally, one of the main reasons why holders would transfer their coins into the custody of exchanges is for selling-related purposes, so this kind of trend can have bearish consequences for the BTC price. Related Reading: Toncoin (TON) Heading For A 50% Price Move, Analyst Explains Why On the other hand, the indicator witnessing a decline suggests investors are taking out a net number of tokens from the exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the holders want to hold their BTC into the long term, which can naturally be bullish for the asset’s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve over the history of the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve peaked in late 2024 and saw a reversal to a downtrend, indicating that investors switched to net withdrawals. The decline in the metric was persistent, but very recently, another turnaround has finally occurred, with the indicator shooting up instead. Its value has now reached the 3.383 million BTC mark, which is the highest that it has been in a few months. “This signals a shift in trader behavior,” notes Maartunn. “More coins moving to exchanges often precedes increased selling pressure.” The deposit spree from the investors has come alongside a period of bearish action in the Bitcoin price. It now remains to be seen whether these exchange inflows would extend the drawdown. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At Short-Term Holder Cost Basis, But For How Long? Speaking of the price decline, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed about how this plunge compares against past ones in terms of the BTC supply in loss. As displayed in the chart, only 9% of the Bitcoin supply is in loss following the price drawdown. The maximum loss among these underwater coins is also currently just 10%. As Glassnode explains, In contrast, the local bottom of this cycle saw >25% of supply at up to 23% losses, and global bear markets have reached >50% supply with up to 78% losses. This dip remains relatively shallow. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $111,200, up 2% over the last 24 hours.

The passage he posted comes from research prepared for the United Nations, identifying Ripple as relevant to the development of a financial system that is both green and inclusive. This positioning reflects both Ripple’s technological role and its alignment with broader economic and environmental goals. RIPPLE HIGHLIGHTED BY UNITED NATIONS RESEARCH AS A MODEL FOR A GREEN & INCLUSIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEM Documented. https://t.co/zH40xdOD8q pic.twitter.com/uft0JClmUK — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 2, 2025 United Nations Research and Ripple The excerpt stated that “Ripple protocol contains main trends that are relevant for designing a Green and inclusive financial system.” According to Ripple President Monica Long, XRP is 120,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin due to its consensus mechanism. The XRP ledger holds numerous advantages. It’s said to be more decentralized than proof-of-work blockchains , significantly faster, and cheaper. The research also highlighted Ripple’s framework in connection with definitions of virtual currencies, distinguishing between convertible and non-convertible types, as well as centralized and non-centralized systems. These definitions have been crucial for international institutions in understanding the categories and risks of emerging digital assets. The same research further linked Ripple to considerations of compliance and regulation, noting that these definitions help address concerns raised by global bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Ripple’s desire for compliance is in its handling of RLUSD’s launch and its attempts to secure licenses worldwide, including a banking license in the U.S. In doing so, Ripple is situated within a policy framework that prioritizes innovation and places XRP at the forefront in the push for global financial stability. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance According to the document, Ripple supports existing financial institutions by enabling them to integrate digital gateways without being displaced. This integration opportunity aids the adoption of XRP and increases its demand as a bridge currency . The document observed that through capital and transaction intermediation, Ripple enables institutions, merchants, and consumers to benefit from both established financial systems and newer digital technologies. This balance was described as helping stakeholders achieve “the best benefit of both worlds,” capturing how XRP and Ripple fit into an evolving financial ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Shifts in Global Payments The research placed Ripple within the broader framework of virtual currencies, outlining its relevance for future financial design. Crucially, it also described Ripple’s XRP-powered technology as a better version of SWIFT and Bitcoin, and highlighted its potential use by institutions. This highlighted XRP’s capacity to function within existing structures while advancing more inclusive financial objectives. Its recognition in United Nations-linked research positions it as more than a cryptocurrency, aligning it with sustainable and inclusive goals in the financial sector.

The derivatives market, however, is showing resilience despite recent price weakness. In its latest post, CryptoQuant noted that Binance’s ETH open interest (OI) has continued to hold above $8.4 billion, even after the asset dipped below $4,400 this week. On August 30, open interest was recorded at the $8.4 billion threshold, and while price action has since turned lower, OI has not broken decisively below that level. Bulls Gearing Up for a Counterattack? Typically, sharp price declines are accompanied by a proportional drop in OI, which hints at liquidations or broader risk-off sentiment. The current pattern means that traders are maintaining positions, and are possibly anticipating a rebound or showing a lack of conviction in further downside. Data also shows that the momentum of OI contraction has eased. The 24-hour percentage change in Binance’s ETH OI now stands at -3.4%, compared with a sharper -6.25% drop observed just two days earlier. This moderation indicates that the aggressive deleveraging phase may be losing steam, as the derivatives market appears less inclined to amplify the sell-off. At the same time, Binance Net Taker Volume has consistently remained negative and has ranged between -1.08 billion and -1.11 billion, which reflects a market environment still dominated by aggressive sellers. Yet the stability in open interest implies that buyers are absorbing at least part of this pressure rather than fully retreating. Spot market data further added bullish context as CryptoQuant found that daily Ethereum withdrawals from exchanges such as Binance and Kraken often surpassed 120,000 ETH. These steady outflows reduce exchange reserves and tighten liquidity, thereby limiting the depth of future sell-side pressure. Whether this trend reflects accumulation or custodial reallocation, it introduces a structural bullish undertone to an otherwise cautious derivatives market. This essentially suggests that the market is still balancing between bearish short-term flows and longer-term accumulation. Greatest Bear Trap Ethereum’s latest pullback has some traders bracing for deeper losses, but technical analysts warn against reading too much into September’s weakness. The current price structure appears to be a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. According to crypto analyst Johnny Woo, this setup could prove misleading. Woo described this trajectory as one of the market’s “biggest bear traps” in the making. If the pattern breaks down, ETH risks further declines; however, if it fails to materialize, sidelined traders could be forced to re-enter at higher levels. Woo flagged the $3,800-$4,100 range as a critical support area. Strength above it may validate bullish sentiment heading into October, dubbed “Uptober” by traders for its history of reversals and rallies.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum’s staking queue has surged to 860,000 ETH, its highest level since 2023. Institutional demand and rising prices are driving renewed confidence in long-term ETH staking. Over 70 treasury participants now hold 4.7 million ETH, most of it earmarked for yield-generating strategies. It marks the longest wait time since the Shanghai upgrade in 2023, which allowed for withdrawals and briefly triggered large-scale validator exits. Institutional Influx Drives Renewed Confidence in Ethereum Staking: Everstake According to staking protocol Everstake, the sudden rise reflects renewed confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and an influx of institutional capital. “We haven’t seen queues of this size since 2023. It’s a strong signal that more people trust Ethereum and want to participate in securing it,” the firm noted. The combination of rising Ether prices, currently hovering around $4,321, and relatively low gas fees has made staking more attractive to both retail users and corporate treasuries. The increased staking activity also helps calm recent concerns about mass exits, which spiked when the staking exit queue briefly topped 1 million ETH on Aug. 29 before falling back by 20%. Ethereum currently has 35.7 million ETH locked in staking contracts—around 31% of the total supply, according to Ultrasound.Money. 3/ We believe the growth in the validator queue comes down to a mix of things: • Increase in network confidence: More people trust Ethereum’s long-term value and want to participate in securing it. • Great market conditions: Rising ETH prices and historically low gas fees… — everstake.eth ( , ) (@eth_everstake) September 2, 2025 Notably, corporate treasury funds now hold 4.7 million ETH, worth over $20 billion, with the majority earmarked for staking. StrategicEtherReserve data shows more than 70 treasury participants have already begun deploying long-term staking strategies. The convergence of market conditions, price levels, and institutional involvement has pushed the staking entry and exit queues closer to balance for the first time since July. That equilibrium suggests a healthier staking environment and growing demand for yield generation on Ethereum’s base layer. While ETH has slipped 12.4% from its Aug. 24 all-time high, long-term holders appear to be undeterred. Instead of exiting, many are doubling down, waiting in line to earn yield on-chain. Joseph Lubin Predicts 100x ETH Surge Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin believes ETH could rally 100x or more over time , calling it Wall Street’s future infrastructure as TradFi shifts toward decentralized finance. In an X post, Lubin said Ethereum will replace many siloed systems at institutions like JPMorgan and become the backbone for financial services, staking, and smart contract execution. Backing the bullish stance of Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, Lubin stated he’s “100% aligned” with Lee’s view that Ethereum could flip Bitcoin in network value. He compared the moment to 1971 when the U.S. dollar left the gold standard, signaling a tectonic shift in financial architecture led by Ethereum. Lubin emphasized that ETH represents a new kind of virtual commodity — “decentralized trust” — that institutions will be forced to adopt. He sees Ethereum’s decentralized rails powering everything from traditional finance operations to smart contract-based agreements, with massive upside as adoption scales globally. Likewise, Lee has predicted that Ethereum will rally in the near term to $5,500 , with an ambitious year-end target of $12,000. During his August 26 guest appearance on the Amitis Investing program, Lee disclosed that institutional Wall Street sentiment toward Ethereum has shifted dramatically following the U.S. Senate’s passage of the GENIUS Stablecoin legislation . Lee emphasized that Ethereum is the foundational blockchain infrastructure for traditional finance (TradFi), currently supporting over $145 billion in stablecoin supply.

In 2028, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $13,443 and $15,841 with an average expected price of $13,824. In 2031, ETH could trade between $38,150 and $49,492 with an average price of $39,609. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps using blockchain technology without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps traders trade Ethereum more easily. So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2025 through 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Symbol ETH Current price $4,321 Market cap $521.58B Trading volume (24-hour) $39.78B Circulating supply 120.7M All-time high $4,891 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time low $0.4209 on Oct 22, 2015 24-hour high $4,414.93 24-hour low $4,260.46 ETH price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 8.14% 50-day SMA $ 4,003 200-day SMA $ 2,803 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) Ethereum (ETH) price analysis Ethereum is consolidating around 4469 on the 1-day chart, with RSI showing neutral momentum The 4-hour chart reflects compressed Bollinger Bands between 4277 and 4566, suggesting indecision Next move depends on whether buyers defend support or sellers push for a breakdown Ethereum price analysis 1-day chart: Ethereum holds steady as market awaits next move On the daily chart on September 3, Ethereum is moving sideways after its recent climb, trading around $4,308. The price is sitting just under $4,437, which is acting as resistance, while support is close to $4,067. The RSI is near 50, showing a balanced market without strong buying or selling pressure. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The MACD still leans bearish, but momentum looks weaker than before. If ETH can push above $4,437, it could head back toward $4,800. On the other hand, if sellers take control, the price may test the $4,100 zone again. For now, ETH seems to be in a quiet, waiting phase and current ethereum price is $4,308. ETH price analysis on the 4-hour chart: Ethereum awaits breakout as 4-Hour chart shows tight range On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is showing weak momentum, trading around $4,308. The price is stuck between resistance at $4,368 and support near $4,257. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, signaling a possible breakout soon. ETHUSD chart by TradingView The MACD is slightly bearish, with the histogram showing mild selling pressure, while the Balance of Power is negative, suggesting sellers still have an edge. For ETH to regain strength, it needs to push above $4,368 to target $4,500. If the price slips below $4,257, the next downside move could head toward $4,100. Right now, ETH looks indecisive, waiting for a stronger catalyst.

Ethereum’s daily chart shows sideways movement near $4,308, with resistance at $4,437 and support at $4,067. Momentum is weak, and the market looks cautious, waiting for a breakout. On the 4-hour chart, ETH is trading in a narrow range between $4,368 and $4,257, with Bollinger Bands tightening, hinting at an upcoming move. MACD and Balance of Power lean slightly bearish, signaling seller pressure, but the consolidation phase could lead to volatility ahead. If ETH breaks above $4,437 on the daily or $4,368 on the 4-hour, it may retest $4,500–$4,800. A breakdown, however, risks a fall toward $4,100 support. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum blockchain is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. However, the opinions expressed are not investment advice; traders should consider researching before investing. What is a realistic price for Ethereum in 2025? The realistic price for Ethereum in 2025 is around $4,800 at the maximum. What will 1 Ethereum be worth in 2030? One Ethereum is expected to be worth $33,171 maximum in 2030. How high can ETH realistically go? Ethereum’s price potential depends on multiple factors, including market trends, institutional adoption, network upgrades, and macroeconomic conditions. Realistically, ETH could reach $5,000 to $7,000 in the next bullish cycle if demand increases and Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions and scalability improvements boost adoption. If institutional interest strengthens, ETH may push past $10,000 over the long term, especially if Ethereum remains the dominant smart contract platform. However, volatility remains a key risk, with price corrections likely along the way. Regulatory clarity and Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS) efficiency could also positively influence its long-term valuation. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2027, with a potential high of $10,700. Will ETH reach $25,000? Based on price predictions, Ethereum is unlikely to surpass the $25,000 level by 2029. By 2029, the ETH’s potential high is expected to be $23,496. This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, so long-term projections should be cautiously approached. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum will likely reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $49,492 in 2031. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $49,492 mark by 2031, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Analyst Says 2017 Pattern Is Repeating,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-to-4-50-and-beyond-analyst-says-2017-pattern-is-repeating/,"TL;DR Analysts see XRP repeating 2017’s structure, projecting a parabolic rally toward $4.50 and beyond. Key $2.47 support and $2.94 resistance determine XRP’s potential path toward $4.80 targets. Gemini launches XRP cashback card, adding utility as analysts anticipate major bullish continuation. Déjà Vu? XRP Echoes Its 2017 Breakout Pattern Crypto trader CRYPTOWZRD has pointed out that XRP’s current price action looks similar to its 2017 breakout structure. A chart shared shows a repeating pattern of accumulation, consolidation, and upward movement. This sequence previously led to XRP’s run toward $3.30. XRP’S BULL RUN The only chart you need.. $XRP is following the 2017 Bull Run Structure.. after this consolidation phase we will see a parabolic rally to $4.50 and higher Patience Pays pic.twitter.com/Bf9Buut2bZ — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) September 2, 2025 Notably, the chart suggests XRP has already moved through an accumulation phase from 2023 into early 2025. After that, the price broke out and is now consolidating below $3. The analyst claims that if the pattern continues, XRP may be preparing for another rally. “After this consolidation phase we will see a parabolic rally to $4.50 and higher,” the post reads. Key Levels at $2.47 and $2.94 Hold Importance XRP was trading above $2.8 at press time, with a 24-hour volume of over $7.2 billion. The daily price has risen by just over 1%, though it remains down more than 5% over the past week. Another chart shared by Javon Marks shows XRP holding above a key level at $2.47. This zone is considered important for maintaining market structure. “As long as this level holds, prices may only be prepping for another +66% upside,” the analyst noted. His chart marks targets at $4.80 and $7.18, pointing to the possibility of further movement if momentum returns. Source: X Meanwhile, the $2.94 resistance is also being watched. A clean move above this level could open up space for stronger buying interest. If price fails to stay above support, the outlook could shift to short-term sideways movement. Short-Term Chart Remains Volatile In a technical update, CRYPTOWZRD reported a bullish daily close for XRP. However, he added that more confirmation is needed. “We should see more bullish pressure from here. However, one more healthy candle is necessary,” they posted. Moreover, the $3.65 level has been marked as a possible resistance zone. The intraday chart was described as volatile, mostly driven by Bitcoin’s recent movement. If XRP retests the $2.94 level and fails, sideways movement could continue. A break above that level, however, could signal the start of a new move. Separately, crypto exchange Gemini rolled out a credit card product offering cashback in XRP. Users can receive rewards directly in the token when making purchases. The exchange also added support for RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin, which can now be used for spot trading on Gemini’s U.S. platform. This rollout places XRP at the center of new consumer-facing products and increases its exposure across trading and payments. The post XRP to $4.50 and Beyond?

The Mutuum Finance presale is now live at stage 6, offering tokens at a price of $0.035, which could generate substantial returns for investors, with estimates of up to 45x growth in the near future. The project has already sold more than $15.3 million and attracted more than 16,000 token holders. With its cutting-edge approach to decentralized finance and ambitious roadmap, analysts are already speculating about whether MUTM could deliver the kind of breakout performance that defines the next bull cycle.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Limited Upside Medium-Term, Ecosystem Activity Persists Shiba Inu (SHIB) price is currently trading at $0.00001215 with a slight volatility as the overall meme coin hype sobers down. Projections for 2025 are relatively flat, with year end averages between $0.0000129 and $0.0000172, which translates to a 5%-70% upside potential should market conditions improve. While Shiba Inu will likely continue to expand its ecosystem with projects like Shibarium, the most critical pathway for SHIB to decouple from its uninspiring price cycle and stand out among emerging stories in the modern market is for the fundamental to take flight. Stage 6 Presale Live with Mutuum Finance (MUTM), $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty There are substantial profits to be made in the early stages of an investment before the price is raised in subsequent phases. Mutuum Finance has already made a name in the DeFi market by securing more than 16,000 investors and raising more than $15.3 million in its presale. The project is also operating a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, which aims to fortify security on the platform and further encourage community involvement, with awards divided into four risk levels: critical, major, minor and low. Interest Rate Models When funds are abundant, the interest rates are kept low in MUTM so as to make borrowing more affordable; but when there is not enough money available, the rates become higher, so as to make it less attractive to borrow, and in turn more attractive to borrowers to pay off loans or increase deposits. Stable rates are typically higher than variable rates but do not change significantly unless there is a significant amount of volatility on the market, making them a good option for borrowers who prefer predictable repayment costs. Only tokens with high liquidity can get a stable rate. Mutuum Finance Reveals $100k Community Giveaway and Dual Lending Solution Ten individuals will receive $100,000 community giveaway in $10K MUTM tokens, making it more fun for existing and new investors to get involved in the platform. Mutuum Finance has a bilateral lending framework for more flexibility and efficiency. A Peer-to-Contract model uses smart contracts to facilitate the automation of the lending process without the need for human intervention, utilizing market dynamics to determine rates while keeping the rate structure fixed. The Peer-to-Peer model ensures that lenders and borrowers connect directly without intermediaries, which is suitable for meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a promising contender in the hunt for big returns, shining a light in comparison to more established names like Shiba Inu (SHIB). With over $15.3 million raised so far, 16,000 holders onboard and Stage 6 presale tokens priced at $0.035, early participants are already experiencing significant momentum and the possibility of up to 500% growth before the full market launch. In contrast, SHIB faces only minor medium-term upside potential of 5%-70% by 2025, and depends strongly on ecosystem expansion to maintain relevance. For investors looking for the biggest upside and exposure to an actively-developed project, security incentives such as a $50,000 bug bounty, and clear path to a $3 price target, Mutuum Finance offers the more attractive option. Buy now to lock in Stage 6 pricing before it goes up again.

In a post on X, the foundation said it will split the sale into smaller orders over the next few weeks. The sale will happen through centralized exchanges . EF noted the gradual approach will limit market disruption, and the funds will support development and community growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. The Ethereum Foundation to fund research In an effort to maintain a reliable source of funding for the Ethereum ecosystem amidst an unstable market, the Ethereum Foundation announced plans to sell 10,000 ETH (around $43 million). It will be changed into fiat rather than treating each sale as an isolated event, to create steady funding for grants, operational expenses, and strategic donations. EF gave over $32 million in grants in the first quarter of 2025 for developers, researchers, and educators, all working on improving the technology and creating awareness. The foundation also paused open grant applications to improve the quality of its projects and focus on long-term progress instead of worrying about the coin’s short-term volatility. Selling 10,000 ETH is just part of EF’s bigger treasury management strategy, as seen in several transactions in the past and earlier this year. The foundation sold $25 million worth of ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July and made two other transactions totaling $12.7 million under the guidelines of its treasury policy introduced in June. The policy aims to set rules on how much ETH the foundation can convert into fiat over specific periods to fund its mission. Treasury policy guides ETH sales and shapes market activity The policy set a maximum of 15% annually for operational expenses and demands that the foundation create a multi-year reserve buffer to ensure there is always enough money for operations and commitments. The guidelines also require regular reviews of the foundation’s assets in fiat terms to know how much Ether can be sold in the next three months. ETH rose more than 23% in the past month and currently trades around $4,326. This shows that investors have confidence in the coin’s potential. When the foundation announced plans to sell 10,000 ETH, Yunfeng Financial Group said it bought a similar amount from the open market that same day. Ether Machine also announced that it bought 150,000 ETH to build a corporate treasury ahead of its anticipated Nasdaq listing. The company now holds over 345,000 ETH, which is valued at around $1.5 billion. These transactions show how traditional financial institutions and big companies outside the crypto-native world treat ETH as a strategic reserve asset. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin also said that Ether can potentially beat Bitcoin as the leading global “monetary base if Wall Street fully adopts the coin. His comments came after ETH hit its highest value of over $4,870 in August. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also had a hand in this surge after he commented about possible changes to monetary policy, which gave investors more confidence in risk assets. The treasury policy, growing interest from institutional investors, and comments by key figures like Lubin show that Ethereum is maturing into a more useful asset in the crypto industry. More importantly, such influence could shape ETH’s market performance at different points, as seen in the December 2020 sale of 100,000 ETH, which drove Ether’s price to record highs in the following months.

Here’s What SEC and CFTC Just Did,https://timestabloid.com/sec-is-about-to-approve-xrp-spot-etfs-heres-what-sec-and-cftc-just-did/,"Bale (@AltcoinBale), a crypto enthusiast, recently stated that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is about to approve all pending spot XRP ETFs based on the latest SEC-CFTC joint statement. In August 2025, the SEC extended decision deadlines on several filings, including those from Grayscale , 21Shares, Bitwise, CoinShares, and WisdomTree, pushing most rulings into October. Franklin Templeton’s filing is scheduled for mid-November. Despite these postponements, regulatory clarity around XRP has improved significantly, especially after Ripple and the SEC dismissed their appeals and ended the legal battle. The Joint SEC-CFTC Statement The image shared shows an official SEC publication titled “SEC-CFTC Joint Staff Statement (Project Crypto-Crypto Sprint),” dated September 2, 2025. The document represents a coordinated effort between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC is about to approve all of the XRP Spot ETFs pic.twitter.com/Mt5gP8j9Sg — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 2, 2025 It states that the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets and the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight and Division of Clearing and Risk are working together to address the process for enabling trading of certain spot crypto asset products. The statement builds on recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which emphasized strengthening U.S. leadership in digital financial technology and blockchain innovation. The agencies highlighted their intent to issue guidance on listing leveraged, margined, or financed spot retail commodity transactions on digital assets. Importantly, the joint statement affirms the view that current law does not prohibit SEC- or CFTC-registered exchanges from facilitating trading of spot crypto asset products. What This Could Mean for Spot XRP ETFs This joint approach could accelerate the regulatory framework for approving spot XRP ETFs . By aligning on authority and scope, the SEC and CFTC appear to be laying the groundwork for smoother consideration of pending applications. If the SEC and CFTC succeed in finalizing clear procedures, the probability of approval for multiple XRP spot ETFs may rise sharply. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has raised the probability of XRP ETF approval to 95% , and applicants such as Grayscale, which expect decisions in October, would benefit from an established framework that reduces uncertainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The SEC-CFTC statement represents a pivotal step in unifying cryptocurrency oversight. With deadlines approaching and agencies signaling readiness, XRP could soon see its long-awaited spot ETFs approved, setting the stage for wider adoption and stronger market performance.

The move enables automatic crypto transactions data sharing, tighter compliance and better regulatory transparency. India will be implementing CARF rules, effective April 2027, Business Standard reported . If you think holding your crypto in offshore/foreign exchanges keeps you safe from the Indian tax net, you should read this… India is adopting the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and will be live by April 2027! pic.twitter.com/C6Nsg2sojJ — KoinX (@getkoinx) September 2, 2025 India’s announcement to officially join OECD’s Crypto Reporting Framework comes in parallel with South Korea’s plans to log and share crypto transactions globally. “It means your foreign exchange accounts, wallets, and offshore trades won’t stay invisible,” KoinX wrote. “They’ll be automatically reported back to India through international data-sharing agreements.” India to Sign Multilateral Agreement for Exchange of Crypto Transactions Tax Info Per a senior finance ministry official, India is expected to sign the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) next year. The pact will provide the legal structure for the automatic exchange of tax-related information. India entered into the MCAA in 2015 for financial account data; however, the upcoming agreement is an extension to include digital assets. “This is the same global system that already exposes hidden foreign bank accounts. Now, it’s crypto’s turn,” KoinX stated . Further, the ministry official noted that the legislative changes and system preparations are already underway to meet the 2027 deadline. India to Expose Investors’ ‘Invisible’ Crypto Assets The global crypto reporting agenda means that investors’ coins held in overseas exchanges will be flagged. Further, offshore centralized exchange (CEX) trades will be reported. “Once the system is live, the reporting will be done not just for the current year but for past years as well,” the tax firm wrote, adding that the government can issue notices under multiple sections for previously undisclosed income. As a result, KoinX has urged crypto investors to get compliant now by reporting their holdings honestly and filing accurately. “If you’ve hidden offshore trades in the past, CARF gives the govt a time machine. Your “invisible” assets will suddenly light up,” it added.

51114838,572855,1756886409,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51114838.jpeg,Ripple–Thunes Deal Targets Faster Payments Across 7 Billion Accounts,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-thunes-deal-payments-7-billion-accounts/,"Ripple and Thunes announced an expansion of their partnership aimed at accelerating cross-border settlement across a network that connects to over 7 billion mobile wallets and bank accounts worldwide on Tuesday, September 2. Building on a collaboration first established in 2020, the companies said the latest agreement will improve payout speed and predictability for financial institutions and enterprises while extending coverage into new currencies and markets. Thunes Taps Ripple To Power 7 Billion Wallets Thunes, which describes its infrastructure as a “Smart Superhighway” for moving money globally, has integrated blockchain and digital-asset rails to enhance its proprietary Direct Global Network. By combining that network with Ripple’s blockchain-powered payments stack, the firms say banks, fintechs and crypto companies gain more efficient on/off-ramps and deeper local connectivity. Ripple’s enterprise customers, in particular, will be able to withdraw funds more easily in additional currencies and jurisdictions, tightening last-mile delivery in regions with limited banking infrastructure. The companies framed the deal as both a scale and a quality upgrade. Ripple said its Payments product now spans 90-plus payout markets representing “more than 90% coverage of the daily FX markets,” with a remit to provide fast, transparent and reliable cross-border transfers as well as compliant fiat–crypto on/off ramps. Thunes emphasized its role in dependable real-time local-currency payouts and said it is adopting Ripple Payments to bolster Thunes’ in-house SmartX Treasury System. “Members across both the traditional finance space and the digital assets ecosystem connect with Thunes,” said Chloe Mayenobe, President and COO at Thunes. “We are in a prime position to bridge these two worlds and drive the future of digital assets, and our alliance with Ripple underscores this. By supporting real-time settlement, and deep local integrations, we are enabling digital asset companies to deliver seamless, compliant, and accessible cross-border payments at scale.” Fiona Murray, Managing Director, Asia Pacific at Ripple, positioned the expansion as a continuation of the company’s enterprise push . “We are committed to reshaping the future of global payments through blockchain technology. Our partnership with Thunes accelerates our shared mission to improve the efficiency, speed, and security of global payments,” she said, adding that the combination of Thunes’ “extensive and trusted Direct Global Network” with Ripple’s digital-asset infrastructure is designed to enhance “payment speed, accessibility, and compliance across regions” while facilitating “seamless, low-cost transactions.” Thunes says its Direct Global Network reaches more than 130 countries and 80-plus currencies, connecting to over 7 billion mobile wallets and bank accounts as well as 15 billion cards through more than 320 payment methods, including super-apps and mobile money services such as GCash, M-Pesa, Airtel, MTN, Orange, AliPay and WeChat Pay. Network members span gig-economy platforms, super-apps, MTOs, PSPs, fintechs and banks. Ripple, described in the announcement as a leading provider of digital-asset infrastructure for financial institutions, is supplying the blockchain rails and enterprise tooling intended to standardize compliance and liquidity management across the expanded footprint. Beyond reach, both firms highlighted operational mechanics that have historically constrained cross-border payments : settlement speed, transparency of fees and FX, and local disbursement. The partners promise real-time or near-real-time payouts in local currencies, “deep local integrations” to reduce friction at the endpoint, and on/off-ramp optionality for clients that operate across fiat and digital-asset domains. Thunes’ Fortress Compliance Platform and treasury tooling are positioned as control layers that complement Ripple’s enterprise infrastructure in high-throughput corridors.

Despite this downturn, many remain optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s potential for further gains in the coming months. David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine and a crypto advisor to President Donald Trump, has attributed the recent price fluctuations to the activities of large investors, commonly referred to as “whales.” Bitcoin Sell-Off Triggered By Whales? In a recent social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Bailey pointed out that two prominent whales are responsible for the recent sell-off, having reportedly liquidated 80,000 and 120,000 BTC, respectively. Interestingly, NewsBTC reported last week that despite record inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing interest from public companies, Binance may be one of these whales orchestrating the sell-off. DeFitracer suggested that Binance might be utilizing a market maker, Wintermute, to strategically execute trades, thereby creating a bearish trend that retail investors might follow. This strategy could allow Binance to profit from liquidations in the futures market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stuck In ‘Loading Phase’, What This Means For The Campaign For $5,000 Adding another layer to the current market dynamics, data analysis firm Arkham recently disclosed that a whale with over $5 billion in Bitcoin has begun purchasing Ethereum (ETH), moving $1.1 billion worth of BTC to a new wallet to facilitate these transactions. Although Bailey did not disclose the identities of the whales involved, he indicated that one is already “down,” while the other is halfway to a similar fate. This could suggest that once these sell-offs conclude, the Bitcoin price could regain its momentum, potentially reaching Bailey’s target of $150,000 per coin, which would signify a substantial 36% increase from current price levels. Public Companies Now Hold Over 6% Of BTC’s Supply In addition to the alleged whale activity that has suppressed Bitcoin’s uptrend, the growing involvement of publicly traded companies in the cryptocurrency market is impacting its price stability. According to JPMorgan global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, corporate treasuries now hold over 6% of Bitcoin’s total supply, acting as a form of private sector quantitative easing for the crypto markets. The analyst noted that the surge in Bitcoin purchases by corporate treasuries has led to a decrease in the cryptocurrency’s volatility, which could ultimately make the asset more appealing to investors. Related Reading: WLFI Slides 15% After Launch As Trump Token Team Eyes Burn Strategy Panigirtzoglou highlighted that in July alone, public companies like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), accounted for nearly two-thirds of Bitcoin purchases among major buyers, including exchange-traded funds and government entities. He suggests that this influx of institutional investment may reshape the landscape of Bitcoin ownership and trading, as reduced volatility can enhance BTC’s attractiveness as an investment alternative, particularly in comparison to gold. As of this writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $110,900. This represents a slight 2% surge in the last 24 hours and a 90% increase year-to-date.

He remarked that September may not deliver much excitement for holders, suggesting instead that October could bring “fireworks” for the digital asset. His view adds to the ongoing anticipation within the XRP community regarding whether the asset can rebound from its recent bearish performance . I think September will be a boring month for #XRP . Fireworks in October! — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 1, 2025 XRP Army Debates XRP’s Performance CryptoBull’s comments drew a wide range of responses from the community. Some community members noted that September is still worth watching, suggesting that the community should not dismiss the entire month because of early underperformance. Others emphasized that predictions of major moves have been repeated for years, and investors have often been left waiting for developments that never fully materialize. XRP’s tendency to experience prolonged consolidation periods can be discouraging for investors, but its 500% surge in late 2024 and early 2025 shows that the breakouts are always worth it. Several replies focused on specific dates. EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), another well-respected analyst who recently confirmed XRP’s current consolidation phase , suggested something big could happen on September 7 or 8. Another user pointed to September 22 as a date of interest. Market Conditions and External Factors Beyond individual opinions, broader market conditions may also influence XRP’s path. With inflation showing signs of easing, markets are watching closely for potential interest rate adjustments. Markets have set the chances of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on September 17 at around 90% . If such a move occurs, it could provide a lift to risk-on assets, including digital currencies like XRP. Rate cuts generally reduce the cost of borrowing and can encourage more capital to flow into speculative markets. For XRP, this environment might offset the expectation of a subdued September and help generate upward momentum earlier than anticipated. While CryptoBull and several community members pointed to October as the more likely window for growth, one commenter predicted that lower interest rates combined with momentum from the Clarity Act could help XRP reach $3.5 to $4 this month and $8 to $10 by the end of October.

Today the SEC and @CFTC issued a Joint Statement clarifying staff’s views that SEC- and CFTC- registered exchanges are not prohibited from facilitating the trading of certain spot commodity products: https://t.co/stsgiQTXjf — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) September 2, 2025 Crypto Trading Going Mainstream NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci said that the main takeaway was “crypto trading going mainstream,” because it will be on the “world’s largest venues,” such as the NYSE and Nasdaq. “Next stop after that? Every major traditional brokerage. I know you’re paying attention now.” Atkins went on to state that market participants should have the “freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets,” adding that the Commission is committed to working with the CFTC to “ensure that our regulatory frameworks support innovation and competition in these rapidly evolving markets.” Meanwhile, CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham emphasized that this marks a departure from previous “mixed signals” that discouraged innovation. “The message was clear: innovation was not welcome,” she said before adding, “That chapter is over.” “Today’s joint agency statement is the latest demonstration of our mutual objective of supporting growth and development in these markets, but it will not be the last.” The statement builds on the SEC’s Project Crypto and CFTC’s Crypto Sprint programs, with both agencies inviting market participants to engage with staff on implementation questions. Last week, the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight issued an advisory stating that U.S.-based users can now trade on non-U.S. crypto exchanges. No Reaction From Markets There was a minor spike in crypto markets with total capitalization up marginally to $3.91 trillion. However, these overwhelming bullish statements from US regulators have failed to make much of an impact recently. Bitcoin had reclaimed $111,000 as it continues to recover this week, but Ethereum had declined further , falling to $4,300 as it cools from its epic rally. Altcoins were generally in the green today with larger gains for Solana and Bitcoin Cash. Most analysts agree that markets are also cooling from recent highs and resetting before the bull market continues in the fourth quarter of this year, partly driven by a Federal Reserve rate cut, which is now highly expected.

Bitcoinsensus projects the next wave rally could send DOGE between $1.00 and $1.40 long-term. Futures open interest steady at $3.32B, while options trading surged as traders prepare positions. Breakdown From Triangle Formation Dogecoin (DOGE) has moved below a symmetrical triangle formation after weeks of sideways action. The move was flagged by market analyst Ali Martinez, who suggested the breakdown could pressure prices lower in the short term. Dogecoin $DOGE breaks out of a triangle, targets $0.17! pic.twitter.com/5rk1IRxZME — Ali (@ali_charts) September 2, 2025 The chart points to resistance near $0.22, while immediate supports are located at $0.20 and $0.19. If the bearish move continues, the next target sits at $0.17, a level that matches the 1.272 Fibonacci extension. According to the analyst, “Dogecoin $DOGE breaks out of a triangle, targets $0.17!” At the time of writing, DOGE was valued at around $0.22 with a 24-hour trading volume of $1.95 billion. The token has gained 1% in the past day, though it has slipped 3% over the week. Opposing Outlooks From Market Analysts While one view suggests a move toward $0.17, another long-term chart shared by Bitcoinsensus shows a potential rally. On the weekly timeframe, DOGE continues to track within a logarithmic uptrend channel. Source: X Notably, the chart highlights a +290% surge from $0.08 to $0.23, followed by a +440% rise to $0.50. Based on this pattern, the next impulsive wave could lift prices between $1.00 and $1.40. The post noted, “This next wave could potentially lead to prices as high as $1.40.” DOGE is consolidating near $0.217 and has been forming higher lows that keep the long-term channel intact. Analysts view this as the base for a larger move , though short-term signals remain mixed. Whale Activity and Futures Market On-chain observations show whales are currently inactive. As Martinez stated , “Dogecoin $DOGE whales are staying on the sidelines. No major buying or selling pressure detected!” Data from Coinglass adds further detail. Open interest in DOGE futures rose slightly by 1% to $3.32 billion, suggesting steady trader participation. At the same time, daily trading volume fell 14% to $5.05 billion, showing lighter participation. Options activity has surged, with volume climbing 1,057% to $1.86K, while open interest increased 132% to $2.76M. These shifts suggest traders are positioning for the next move as DOGE stabilizes near support.

Amidst the recent flurry of headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a notable player, captivating attention with its forward-thinking approach to decentralized liquidity and lending protocols, poised to redefine the broader DeFi ecosystem. The sixth presale stage is now active and the investors can buy the MUTM tokens for a price of $0.035. The participants who have already acquired their tokens will receive a minimum return of 200% when the project MUTM will officially launch. To date, Mutuum Finance has successfully raised over $15.3 million with over 16,000 investors. As analysts continue to forecast the move for XRP, the spotlight increasingly shines on how rising platforms like Mutuum Finance might impact trading volumes and market sentiment. XRP Outlook: ETF Buzz and Whale Activity Define 2025 Trajectory With a surge of renewed interest from institutional players and clearer regulatory guidance, XRP is currently trading at $2.77 with stability. Recent news, like the settlement of Ripple’s SEC case and increased hope for ETF approvals, have led to a slight rally even with technical indicators staying shy. It’s also a time for the whales to get moving: the recent large-scale XRP purchases have helped stabilize the token at current levels and show long-term confidence. Analysts are optimistic about the increasing potential for a move towards the $4 to $5 range for XRP as the cryptocurrency gains momentum, especially if it receives a regulatory and ETF tailwind. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Pre-Sale Phase 6 Ongoing Mutuum Finance’s presale is going into its sixth phase with tokens currently trading at $0.35, up 16.17% from the previous stage. With over 16,000 invested stakeholders and nearly $15.3 million already successfully raised for the project, there is clear market interest and demand. Dollar-Pegged Stablecoin and Security Mutuum Finance is on the verge of launching a US Dollar pegged stablecoin. CertiK certification: The project has been audited and certified by CertiK, ensuring that it is transparent and code audit-proof: To further bolster platform security, Mutuum Finance, in partnership with CertiK, has launched a USDT Bug Bounty Program worth $50,000 USDT. Vulnerabilities reported under this program are classified into four classes: critical, important, minor and occasional. Risk Management & Protocol Security Each asset supported on Mutuum Finance has distinct parameters associated with it that are related to its risk profile, such as supply caps, borrowing requirements, and collateral requirements. As a result, the protocol is designed to be resilient to market volatility by overcollateralizing positions, while liquidators are encouraged to stabilize undercollateralized positions. Deposit and borrowing limits impose constraints on exposure to volatile or illiquid assets and mitigate the risk of insolvency. High-risk tokens can have very low collateral utilization limits, while correlated assets will enjoy better collateral efficiency. Token Giveaway of $100,000 to Build Community Engagement As part of its effort to foster and encourage a community of engaged users, Mutuum Finance has announced a community giveaway of $100,000 . Ten MUTM holders will each receive $10,000 of MUTM tokens, giving newcomers, and established investors alike, the chance to be involved in, and benefit from the growth of the project. As analysts continue to point out its potential alongside Ripple (XRP), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly catching waves as a catalyst for the next generation of DeFi integrators. With over $15.3 million raised and 16,000+ investors on board, early-backers are set for at least 200% estimated returns-at-launch with Phase 6 presale tokens already priced at $0.035. XRP, meanwhile, shows no volatility and is priced at $2.77 with a non-volatile range of $4 and $5 by 2025 if ETF momentum and regulatory clarity persist. With a CertiK certified audit, USD pegged stablecoin plan, and a bug bounty of $50,000, Mutuum Finance emerges as a significant addition to the DeFi ecosystem. One should lock their tokens during Phase 6 before the next price growth and ride the growth wave at the beginning.

Recently, a significant development has emerged from South Korea’s prominent crypto exchanges, Bithumb and Coinone. They have jointly issued a Sonic S crypto warning , urging caution for investors holding or considering the Sonic (S) token. This alert isn’t just a casual heads-up; it’s a critical notice about impending changes that could impact the token’s market dynamics. What’s Triggering the Sonic S Crypto Warning? Bithumb and Coinone, two of South Korea’s leading digital asset platforms, have explicitly stated their concerns regarding Sonic (S). Their primary reason for the Sonic S crypto warning centers on upcoming adjustments to the token’s supply. Specifically, both the total and circulating supply of Sonic (S) are scheduled for a change. Such alterations in supply metrics are not trivial. They inherently carry the potential to significantly increase price volatility. For investors, this means the value of Sonic (S) could experience more rapid and unpredictable fluctuations than usual, presenting both opportunities and heightened risks. Decoding Token Supply Changes: Why Does it Matter for Sonic S? Understanding what “total supply” and “circulating supply” mean is key to grasping the gravity of this Sonic S crypto warning . The total supply refers to the absolute maximum number of tokens that will ever exist. Circulating supply, on the other hand, represents the number of tokens currently available and actively traded in the market. When either of these figures changes, it can disrupt the fundamental supply-demand balance. For instance, an increase in circulating supply without a corresponding rise in demand often leads to price depreciation. Conversely, a decrease in supply could theoretically boost prices, but the market’s reaction is rarely straightforward, especially with other factors at play. This is why the exchanges are highlighting the potential for increased volatility for Sonic S. The Exchanges’ Role: Protecting Investors from Sonic S Risks It is important to recognize that Bithumb and Coinone issuing a Sonic S crypto warning reflects their commitment to investor protection. Major exchanges often monitor tokens for various factors, including liquidity, development activity, and market integrity. When they identify potential risks, like those associated with significant supply changes, issuing an investment warning becomes a responsible action. This warning serves as an official advisory, not necessarily a precursor to delisting. Instead, it aims to empower investors with crucial information, allowing them to make informed decisions. It underscores the exchanges’ role in maintaining a transparent and secure trading environment for their users, especially concerning tokens like Sonic S. Essential Steps for Sonic S Holders Amidst the Warning If you currently hold Sonic (S) tokens, or are considering an investment, this Sonic S crypto warning demands your attention. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio: Assess your current exposure to Sonic (S) and its percentage within your overall investment strategy. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official announcements from Bithumb, Coinone, and the Sonic (S) project team regarding the exact nature and timing of the supply changes. Understand the Risks: Be prepared for potential price swings. Volatility can lead to significant gains or losses. Consider Risk Management: Implement strategies such as setting stop-loss orders or diversifying your portfolio to mitigate potential downside risks. Conduct Due Diligence: Before making any buy or sell decisions, conduct thorough research. Do not rely solely on the warning, but use it as a catalyst for deeper investigation. Making informed choices is paramount in the dynamic crypto market. The current Sonic S crypto warning is a prime example of why active engagement and continuous learning are vital for every investor. In conclusion, the joint Sonic S crypto warning from Bithumb and Coinone is a significant event for holders of the Sonic (S) token. The impending changes to its total and circulating supply are expected to heighten price volatility, necessitating a cautious and informed approach from investors. By understanding the implications of these supply adjustments and taking proactive steps, investors can better navigate the evolving landscape of this particular digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Sonic S crypto warning about? The Sonic S crypto warning is an alert issued by Bithumb and Coinone regarding upcoming changes to the total and circulating supply of the Sonic (S) token, which is expected to increase its price volatility. Which exchanges issued this warning? South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges Bithumb and Coinone jointly issued the investment warning for Sonic (S). What does “supply change” mean for a crypto token? A supply change refers to an alteration in the total number of tokens that will ever exist (total supply) or the number of tokens currently available for trading (circulating supply). These changes can significantly impact a token’s market price due to shifts in supply-demand dynamics. Should I sell my Sonic S tokens immediately? The warning is not a directive to sell. It’s an advisory to exercise caution and conduct your own due diligence. Your decision should be based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and further research into the token’s prospects. Is Sonic S being delisted by Bithumb or Coinone? No, the current announcement is an investment warning, not a delisting notice. It aims to inform investors about potential risks associated with supply changes and increased volatility, specifically for Sonic S. What should investors do now? Investors should review their portfolio, stay updated on official announcements, understand the potential for increased volatility, consider risk management strategies, and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions regarding Sonic S.

Sharing the development on X, he called it a major signal for the digital asset, highlighting Thunes’ scale in powering over three billion wallets and clearing billions in monthly transactions. He shared a link to the official announcement and revealed that he is accumulating tokens now due to this bullish development. This sentiment resonates with many investors who have watched XRP dip below $3 in late August and slide to $2.7 in early September . For those seeking signs of recovery, the expanded integration between Ripple and Thunes adds a fresh argument in favor of XRP’s long-term potential. Source: https://t.co/MW4JtJ3ql2 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 2, 2025 Building on a Five-Year Collaboration Thunes and Ripple first partnered in 2020, and this collaboration has now expanded to strengthen global money movement. At the core is Thunes’ Direct Global Network, which enables real-time payouts in local currencies and supports last-mile delivery in regions with limited banking infrastructure. Ripple’s payments infrastructure makes up this reach, offering faster settlement, broader withdrawal options, and greater access to new currencies. Together, they aim to deliver secure and accessible financial services worldwide, with XRP positioned to benefit directly from the integration. Technology and Market Coverage Thunes has incorporated blockchain into its SmartX Treasury System, while Ripple’s payment infrastructure spans more than 90 markets, covering over 90% of daily FX volume and processing $70 billion to date. The expansion enables Ripple’s clients to leverage Thunes’ payout network, extending the use of XRP solutions and reinforcing XRP’s role in bridging digital assets with global financial systems. Thunes President and COO Chloe Mayenobe said the firm is positioned to connect traditional finance and digital assets, adding that the Ripple partnership enables digital asset companies to deliver “seamless, compliant, and accessible cross-border payments at scale.” Ripple’s Fiona Murray, Managing Director for Asia Pacific, echoed this perspective, noting that the collaboration enhances “payment speed, accessibility, and compliance across regions” while supporting the rising demand for blockchain-powered financial solutions.

As Ripple deepens its integration with Thunes, the asset benefits from new corridors of utility. For investors weighing recent price declines against long-term adoption, the partnership serves as a reminder that Ripple continues to expand XRP’s relevance across global markets . By linking Ripple’s digital asset infrastructure with Thunes’ global payout network, XRP gains additional support as a bridge currency in real-world financial systems. Despite recent volatility, its global role continues to grow , and for many, that is reason enough to stay invested.

According to a Wednesday press release by the Dutch central bank, OKX is being fined for its services between July 2023 and August 2024. At the time, the exchange was officially known as Aux Cayes Fintech Co., and offered crypto services in the Netherlands without registering with local financial watchdogs. To connect the digital asset market with the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, the Dutch government mandated registration for the industry in 2020. Several exchanges have faced sanctions for similar violations, including Crypto.com, which was fined €2.85 million, and Kraken was ordered to pay €4 million for failing to meet the same requirements. “This fine relates to a legacy registration matter that has long since been remediated, with no impact on customers,” an OKX spokesperson said by email. OKX pays fines in 2025 for operational violations The 2017-founded trading platform told reporters the penalty was the smallest ever imposed by the DNB against a major trading platform. Per a company spokesperson, the fines had been reduced because it took corrective measures that included migrating Dutch users to its fully Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)-licensed European entity. However, this is the third instance of rule-breaking-related penalties OKX has found itself entangled in this year. In February, the platform’s Seychelles entity was ordered to pay a $504 million penalty in the United States after authorities identified several compliance violations. Investigators said that between 2018 and early 2024, OKX processed more than $1 trillion in transactions for US customers, despite officially blocking them from its platform. These included more than $5 billion in trades linked to criminal proceeds and suspicious activity. A compliance audit in 2023 uncovered systemic flaws, leading to a sanction of €1.1 million ($1.2 million) in April from the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU). According to the FIAU, some of these failures were “serious and systematic.” OKX responded by promising financial watchdogs it would improve its compliance in the coming years. During the same month, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a criminal complaint against the trading platform alongside nine individuals with the country’s Economic Crime Suppression Division. The SEC alleged that the group ran a digital asset exchange in breach of the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses enacted in 2018. In January, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) imposed a €304,000 penalty on OKX for failing to comply with certain unspecified regulations. In an agreement made during that enforcement, the exchange agreed to appoint an independent third-party service provider to review its governance framework. Beyond fines, Bloomberg News reported in March that European authorities were investigating whether hackers had used the platform’s Web3 tools to launder funds stolen in a $1.5 billion heist from the trading platform Bybit. Netherlands and US team up in illicit crypto use hunt Meanwhile, the Netherlands and US authorities announced on Sunday that they had taken down the VerifTools marketplace, an online store selling fake identification documents. According to a press statement seen by Cryptopolitan, the marketplace accepted digital asset payments for forged documents for as little as $9. Per the investigators, two physical servers in Amsterdam were seized together with 21 virtual servers supporting the operation.

This move signals potential concerns surrounding the virtual asset, prompting investors to exercise caution. When an exchange takes such a step, it’s a clear indicator that something warrants closer inspection and immediate attention from the community. Why Did Coinone Issue a Smart Layer SLN Warning? Coinone’s decision to designate Smart Layer (SLN) as an investment warning item stems from a comprehensive review revealing several critical issues. The exchange has highlighted a two-week period for this designation, allowing time for potential rectification or further action. This isn’t a decision taken lightly; it follows a thorough evaluation of the asset’s standing and operational integrity. The primary reasons cited by Coinone include: Lack of Verifiable Disclosures: There’s an absence of transparent and verifiable information regarding important matters related to the virtual asset. Transparency is paramount in the crypto space, and its absence can raise red flags for investor safety. Absence of a Confirmed White Paper: A white paper serves as a foundational document, outlining a project’s technology, goals, and roadmap. Without a confirmed white paper, the project’s legitimacy and future direction become unclear, making it difficult for investors to assess its value. Operational Shortcomings: Coinone’s review identified multiple deficiencies in Smart Layer (SLN)’s trading and adoption status, as well as the substance of its business operations. This suggests potential issues with the project’s market presence and core functionality. These factors collectively paint a picture of an asset that may not meet the expected standards for investor protection and operational clarity on a major exchange. What Does This Smart Layer SLN Warning Mean for You? For current and prospective investors in Smart Layer (SLN), this warning is a crucial signal. It means that the asset carries an elevated level of risk as identified by a reputable exchange. While it’s not an immediate delisting, it serves as a probationary period where the project is under intense scrutiny. Your investment in Smart Layer (SLN) should be re-evaluated with these concerns in mind. During these two weeks, investors should: Conduct Due Diligence: Re-evaluate your investment in SLN. Look for any new information or responses from the Smart Layer team regarding Coinone’s concerns. Independent research is more important than ever. Monitor Developments: Stay updated on any announcements from Coinone or Smart Layer (SLN). The outcome of this warning period could significantly impact the asset’s future on the exchange and its market value. Consider Risk: Understand that the value of SLN could be volatile during this period. Be prepared for potential price fluctuations or further actions from the exchange, including a possible delisting if the issues are not resolved satisfactorily. It’s always wise to diversify your portfolio and never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially with assets under an investment warning like Smart Layer (SLN). Navigating the Challenges: The Crucial Role of Investment Warnings in Crypto Exchanges like Coinone play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the cryptocurrency market. By issuing investment warnings for assets such as Smart Layer (SLN), they aim to safeguard their users from potentially risky or non-compliant projects. This proactive approach helps to foster a more secure trading environment for everyone involved, enhancing trust in the broader digital asset ecosystem. Such warnings underscore the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto space. While opportunities for innovation abound, so do the challenges related to regulation, transparency, and project viability. Investors must remain vigilant and informed to navigate these complexities successfully, ensuring their financial well-being. What Happens Next for Smart Layer SLN? The next two weeks will be critical for Smart Layer (SLN). The project team will likely be working to address Coinone’s concerns, potentially by providing the missing disclosures or clarifying their business operations. If these issues are adequately resolved, the warning could be lifted. However, if the concerns persist, Coinone may take further action. This further action could include extending the warning period or even delisting SLN from its platform. Delisting would severely limit the asset’s accessibility and liquidity for traders on Coinone, potentially impacting its overall market perception and value. The resolution of the Smart Layer SLN issues remains to be seen. In conclusion, Coinone’s investment warning for Smart Layer (SLN) is a significant event that highlights the ongoing need for transparency and robust project fundamentals in the crypto market. It serves as a potent reminder for all investors to prioritize thorough research and risk assessment before committing to any digital asset. Staying informed and exercising caution are your best tools in this evolving landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an investment warning in cryptocurrency? An investment warning, issued by a cryptocurrency exchange, indicates that a particular digital asset has been identified with significant risks or concerns, such as a lack of transparency, operational issues, or regulatory non-compliance. It’s a signal for investors to exercise extreme caution. How long does Coinone’s Smart Layer SLN warning last? Coinone has initially designated Smart Layer (SLN) as an investment warning item for a period of two weeks. During this time, the exchange will monitor the project and its response to the raised concerns, potentially leading to a resolution or further action. What should I do if I hold Smart Layer (SLN)? If you hold Smart Layer (SLN), it is advisable to closely monitor Coinone’s announcements, conduct your own additional research into the project’s status, and re-evaluate your risk exposure. Consider the potential for price volatility and be prepared for possible further actions by the exchange. Can Smart Layer (SLN) be delisted after this warning? Yes, delisting is a possible outcome if the issues identified by Coinone are not resolved to their satisfaction within the warning period, or if new concerns emerge. An investment warning often precedes a delisting if the project fails to address the underlying problems adequately.

51118620,573045,1756892271,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51118620.jpeg,Crypto Giants Predict BTC to Hit $150K–250K – Bitcoin Hyper the Next 1000x Crypto?,https://bitcoinist.com/btc-to-hit-250k-hyper-next-1000x-crypto/,"Analysts foresee $BTC surging toward $150K–$250K this year, especially if whales start selling the #1 crypto. If that happens, on-chain activity and transaction demand is bound to spike. This could make gas fees skyrocket and slow down confirmation times, making Bitcoin unsuitable for everyday traders. But fear not: The Layer 2 solution Bitcoin Hyper is gearing up to handle the network’s scalability, speed, and fees. Its native token – $HYPER – might even be the next 1000x crypto. Analyst: Two Whale Moves Could Push $BTC to $150K According to Nakamoto CEO David Bailey, $BTC could jump to $150K if two crypto whales (major investors) sell the crypto leader. Whales carry serious weight. Recently, one major $BTC buyer dumped 24K $BTC worth $2.7B. Within minutes, the sale triggered a flash crash that wiped out $500M in leveraged positions . Once they cease to exert selling pressure, $BTC has a greater likelihood of achieving higher values. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg believes $BTC could reach $140K–$150K before the next bear market. Other crypto titans are even more bullish on Bitcoin. Take BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes, for instance. He predicts $BTC to hit as high as $250K before 2026 kicks off. $BTC is anticipated to explode. But there’s a slight hitch: the Bitcoin network is notorious for congestion during bull runs. Thankfully, this is where Bitcoin Hyper steps in. Bitcoin Hyper to Make Bitcoin Faster & dApp Friendly Once launched this quarter, the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 aims to put an end to Bitcoin’s scalability woes for good. It’ll leverage two powerful tools – a Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – to boost the network’s performance standards. The Canonical Bridge will link Bitcoin’s base layer to Hyper’s Layer 2. Doing so will enable you to deposit $BTC and wrap it for DeFi use. Wrapping $BTC means the crypto can be used in ecosystems where it normally can’t (like dApps, DEXs, and lending protocols), while keeping it pegged 1:1 and backed by the real thing. Every wrapped $BTC would count towards Bitcoin’s Total Value Locked, which currently stands at $7.917B . In comparison, Solana’s TVL is $11.624B, whereas Ethereum leads at $90.429B. Bitcoin Hyper has what it takes to close that gap by making Bitcoin an active force in DeFi. Beyond this, the bridge will batch transactions off-chain to slash transaction times. Right now, Bitcoin processes 8.94 transactions per second (tps) , compared to Ethereum’s 18.73 tps. Plus, its max throughput is just 7 tps versus Ethereum’s 119 tps, representing a 17x gap in scalability. Bitcoin Hyper aims to drastically increase throughput and reduce fees, making Bitcoin much more scalable for everyday use. The SVM will also play a key role in propelling Bitcoin’s TVL and transaction speeds. It’ll bring smart contract execution to Solana-level speeds, allowing dApps, DeFi protocols, and even the best meme coins to run on the network easily and seamlessly. Additionally, it’ll help lower Bitcoin’s transaction fees, which currently average $0.93 – nearly double the amount of Ethereum’s $0.55. And all will be achieved without compromising the Bitcoin mainnet’s security, which is widely regarded as the most battle-tested and resilient in the entire blockchain space. Because its Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism relies on a vast decentralized network and miners, it has never suffered a protocol-level breach. The cherry on top? Bitcoin Hyper’s native token – $HYPER – is designed for cross-chain compatibility with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This helps it to drive liquidity and application flows across ecosystems. $HYPER also powers lower transaction fees in the Layer 2, offers staking rewards at a sizable 80% APY, and grants governance rights. A commendable 30% of its total token supply is also set aside for development. So, it’s no wonder that $HYPER has attracted $13.6M+ on presale since going live on May 16, 2025. Whale buyers have high hopes for the Layer-2 tech, as evidenced by a big player purchasing $11.2K worth of $HYPER just yesterday. Join $HYPER Presale for Possible 2,400%+ Gains With crypto bigwigs projecting $BTC to reach $150K–$250K, particularly if whale activity clears, Bitcoin bottlenecks could be tested yet again. But with Bitcoin Hyper launching soon, we need not worry about soaring fees, sluggish confirmations, or scalability limits holding the network back. Reap the Layer 2’s perks and support its development by purchasing $HYPER on presale for just $0.012845. When the network officially goes live, the token’s predicted to jump to $0.32 , so now’s a favorable time to join for returns possibly exceeding 2,400%. We’re not financial advisors. Always do your own research and never invest more than you’d be sad to lose.

They have made a significant move by increasing the annual MicroStrategy STRC dividend rate on their preferred stock. This decision carries crucial implications, not just for shareholders but also for the company’s ambitious Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Understanding the MicroStrategy STRC Dividend Boost MicroStrategy has officially raised the annual dividend rate on its STRC preferred stock. This increase moves the rate from 9% to a more attractive 10%, as reported by CoinDesk. For investors holding STRC preferred stock, this is certainly positive news, promising a higher return on their investment. However, the stock’s current trading price adds an interesting layer to this development. STRC is presently trading around $97, which is notably below its target price of $100. Preferred stock, like STRC, typically offers a fixed dividend payment and often has a par value, which in this case appears to be $100. This dividend hike is a direct benefit for preferred shareholders, who will now receive a greater payout. Yet, the underlying stock performance presents a potential challenge for the company’s broader financial maneuvers. Why Does the MicroStrategy STRC Dividend Matter for Bitcoin? MicroStrategy’s strategy has famously revolved around acquiring Bitcoin (BTC) as a primary treasury reserve asset. A significant method they use for funding these BTC purchases is through at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. This allows them to sell new shares directly into the market over time, raising capital. The current trading price of STRC preferred stock, remaining below the $100 mark, introduces a speculative concern. If the stock continues to trade at these lower levels, it could potentially make it more challenging for MicroStrategy to effectively execute its ATM stock offerings. When a stock trades below its target or par value, issuing new shares might become less appealing or less efficient for raising substantial capital. Consequently, this situation could impact the pace and volume of MicroStrategy’s ongoing Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The company relies on these offerings to fuel its BTC purchases, and a less favorable stock price could slow down that process. This highlights the delicate balance between managing shareholder expectations through a higher MicroStrategy STRC dividend and maintaining the agility of their core business strategy. Navigating the Future: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy and STRC The interplay between the MicroStrategy STRC dividend , the preferred stock’s market price, and the company’s Bitcoin strategy creates a complex scenario. For MicroStrategy, the challenge lies in sustaining its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation while ensuring its financial instruments, like STRC preferred stock, remain attractive and perform optimally in the market. Here are some key aspects to consider: Investor Confidence: A consistent dividend increase can bolster confidence among preferred shareholders, signaling financial health. Capital Generation: The efficiency of ATM offerings is crucial for MicroStrategy’s capital generation, directly impacting their capacity to buy more BTC. Market Perception: How the market perceives STRC’s valuation relative to the dividend increase will be critical. MicroStrategy has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to its Bitcoin-centric vision. However, the current market dynamics for its preferred stock introduce a new variable into this equation. The company will need to navigate these financial waters carefully to maintain its strategic objectives. What’s Next for the MicroStrategy STRC Dividend and BTC Holdings? Moving forward, investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring several factors. The performance of STRC preferred stock relative to its $100 target price will be a key indicator. Any sustained movement above or below this level could influence MicroStrategy’s future financial decisions. Furthermore, MicroStrategy’s future announcements regarding their capital raising activities and Bitcoin purchases will provide insights into how they are adapting to these market conditions. The company’s ability to balance its obligations to preferred shareholders with its ambitious Bitcoin strategy will define its trajectory. In essence, the recent increase in the MicroStrategy STRC dividend is a double-edged sword. While it benefits preferred shareholders, it also casts a spotlight on the potential challenges MicroStrategy faces in funding its Bitcoin acquisitions if its preferred stock continues to trade below par. The coming months will reveal how MicroStrategy manages this crucial balancing act. Conclusion: A Strategic Tightrope Walk MicroStrategy’s decision to raise its STRC preferred stock dividend to 10% is a bold move, reflecting a commitment to its shareholders. However, the prevailing market price of STRC below its target introduces a fascinating challenge for the company’s famed Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The effectiveness of future at-the-market offerings, a vital source of capital for BTC purchases, could be impacted. As MicroStrategy continues its journey as a leading corporate Bitcoin holder, the interplay between its dividend policies and its strategic financial maneuvers will remain a central point of interest for the crypto and traditional financial markets alike. This evolving situation underscores the dynamic nature of corporate finance in the digital asset era. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is STRC preferred stock? STRC preferred stock is a type of equity security issued by MicroStrategy that typically pays a fixed dividend rate. Unlike common stock, preferred stock usually does not carry voting rights but offers more stable income through its dividend payments, often with a par value that influences its trading price. Why did MicroStrategy raise its dividend on STRC preferred stock? MicroStrategy raised the annual dividend rate on its STRC preferred stock from 9% to 10% to provide a higher return to its preferred shareholders. This move can make the stock more attractive to investors seeking income and demonstrates the company’s commitment to rewarding its shareholders. How does the MicroStrategy STRC dividend increase affect its Bitcoin acquisition strategy? While the dividend increase benefits shareholders, the fact that STRC is trading below its target price of $100 could make it harder for MicroStrategy to raise capital efficiently through at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. These offerings are a key funding source for the company’s Bitcoin purchases, so a less efficient fundraising mechanism could potentially slow down its BTC acquisition pace. What are at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings? At-the-market (ATM) stock offerings allow a company to sell new shares of its stock directly into the open market over a period of time, at prevailing market prices. This provides a flexible way to raise capital without the need for a large, single offering, but its effectiveness can be influenced by the stock’s trading price. Should investors be concerned about MicroStrategy’s ability to sustain its Bitcoin strategy? The situation presents a potential challenge rather than an immediate crisis. While the lower STRC trading price might complicate capital raising for Bitcoin purchases, MicroStrategy has demonstrated resilience and strategic acumen. Investors should monitor the stock’s performance and company announcements regarding its financing and Bitcoin acquisition plans to gauge future impacts. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Вокруг звучали предсказания “медвежьего” сценария. Но эксперты и искусственный интеллект Claude AI сохраняют хладнокровие и смотрят в будущее с уверенностью и оптимизмом.Есть и хорошие новости. Bitcoin уверенно взял отметку в 110 000, сейчас торгуясь около $111 000, это чуть ниже максимума августа на $124 000. При этом инвесторы сохраняют позитивный настрой. Почему? Впервые за историю Биткоина регуляторы демонстрируют более благоприятный подход, что обещает стабильность и рост в дальнейшем.Ethereum недавно обновил рекорд, достигнув отметки в $4950, закрепив за собой лидерство среди альткоинов. Этот импульс вдохнул новую жизнь в мем-токены на базе ETH и поддержал общий рост альтернативных монет. Также активизировался и DeFi-сектор: инвесторов заинтересовал проект HYLQ от Hyperliquid, о котором мы подробно рассказали далее. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI предсказывает скорый взлет цены 2025 стал прорывным годом для XRP. Монета обыграла SEC, прорвала доллар и выросла на 400% за двенадцать месяцев. Claude предсказывает, что ралли еще живо и готово к новому этапу. Принятие стремительно растет: все больше пользователей подключается к сети. Также отмечается, что только что запустилась XRP Mastercard, а значит, криптовалютные карты вступают в игру наравне с привычными кредитными. Вероятен также запуск ETF в октябре. Старший аналитик Coinbase сказал, “Если ФРС начнет смягчение, рисковый капитал потечет обратно в крипто. И XRP готов засиять”. На наш взгляд XRP сейчас формируется как первоклассный вариант для инвестиций. Актив стабильно выполняет все требования регуляторов, соблюдает правила и выходит на первый план в трансграничных платежах. Долгосрочные перспективы все еще выглядят бычьими, но сентябрь исторически слабый месяц для криптовалютного рынка. Хотя XRP ожидается выше $5, трейдерам нужно оставаться осторожными. Импульс пока шаткий. RSI на уровне 39 показывает слабый спрос. MACD висит чуть ниже нейтрали. Свечи рисуют волчки прямо на сопротивлении, обычно это намекает, что прорыв близко. Потенциальное движение к $10 очевидно в долгосрочке. Но сначала нужно пробить сопротивление на $3,66. Это тот ровень, от которого цену отбросило, прежде чем она снова нырнула под $3. Экосистема Hyperliquid запустила новый DeFi-проект HYLQ – уникальная компания, удерживающая на своем счету токены $HYPE. Этот шаг был сделан не случайно. Бизнес-компания теперь напрямую работает с криптовалютой и использует ее для своего развития. Главная цель HYLQ – открыть регулируемый доступ к экосистеме Hyperliquid. Рассмотрим, что это такое?HYLQ – современная DeFi-платформа, где цифровые активы можно не только изучать, но и применять в реальной финансовой среде. Почему она сейчас нам интересна? Акции компании позволяют следить за динамикой токенов, даже если вы сами их не покупаете. Это ваш прямой доступ к Hyperliquid. Также HYLQ показывает, как DeFi-инструменты работают в корпоративной среде. Проверяем новые технологии совместно.Компания торгуется на Canadian Securities Exchange. Значит, публикует отчеты и раскрывает данные, как и любой другой публичный бизнес. Прозрачность всегда привлекала трейдеров, и HYLQ может этим похвастаться.Давайте посмотрим еще шире. HYLQ – это отличный пример того, как классический фондовый рынок и криптомир начинают работать вместе. Через эту компанию инвесторы видят, как цифровые активы становятся частью стратегии реального бизнеса. Проще говоря, HYLQ дает возможность заглянуть в будущее. Она показывает, как криптотехнологии шаг за шагом входят в финансовую систему. И для инвесторов это шанс быть в центре развития рынка.

This analyst thinks so,https://finbold.com/can-xrp-rally-to-13-in-40-days-this-analyst-thinks-so/,"XRP could be on the verge of an explosive rally that might send its price to $13 within just 40 days, according to crypto analyst Tony Severino. That price target represents a 359% increase from XRP’s current level of $2.83. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold If reached, XRP’s market cap would surge to about $772 billion, potentially making it the second-ranked cryptocurrency, assuming Ethereum ( ETH ) records minimal growth during the same period. Severino’s outlook shared in a September 3 X post is based on Elliott Wave analysis, which highlights recurring structures in XRP’s long-term chart, where a corrective consolidation typically follows each impulsive upward move. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The analysis shows that past rallies in XRP unfolded over six-bar, 42-day windows, delivering massive gains. XRP past explosive growth For instance, XRP surged 1,903% in just 42 days during the 2017 cycle, and a similar setup appears to be forming again. Severino projects that XRP could climb from $2.83 to as high as $13 in a comparable timeframe, echoing historical patterns. Currently, XRP is seen breaking out of a fourth-wave triangle pattern, often a precursor to a parabolic fifth wave. If confirmed, this move could mark the peak of the current cycle before a larger bear market sets in. Severino also acknowledged the possibility of a bearish scenario once the rally concludes. It is worth noting that although the technical structure appears bullish, XRP will need support from broader market conditions, as it has recently traded in tandem with wider crypto trends. Regulatory developments will also play a crucial role, particularly potential approval by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), which could trigger significant institutional inflows into the asset.

MATIC Is Struggling, While Analysts Call MUTM the Stronger Candidate For Reasons",https://timestabloid.com/next-crypto-to-hit-2-mark-matic-is-struggling-while-analysts/,"MATIC once earned its place as Ethereum (ETH)’s scaling hero, bringing sidechain efficiency at a time when transaction fees were at their peak. But in today’s market, Polygon (MATIC) faces stiff competition from rising Layer-2s like Arbitrum and Optimism, leaving its momentum uncertain. Analysts following these trends are now pointing to a very different contender— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —as the token that will be positioned to hit the $2 mark while MATIC struggles to regain ground. MATIC Is Struggling Amid Market Pressures Polygon (MATIC) struggled, dropping 5.2% over the past week to trade at ~$0.71 as of September 1, 2025, with a 24-hour trading volume of $320 million. The decline aligns with broader market volatility, driven by macro pressures like U.S. tariffs and fading altcoin momentum. Technical indicators show MATIC testing $0.70 support, with RSI at 42 and resistance at $0.75. Despite Polygon’s role in Ethereum scaling and a 10% increase in DeFi TVL to $1.2 billion, whale sell-offs and reduced network activity weigh on sentiment. Social media reflects bearish sentiment, with concerns over Polygon’s competitiveness. Analysts project a $0.80 target if $0.75 clears, but a drop below $0.70 risks $0.65. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Revenue Model Built for Constant Activity The foundation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not based on network speed promises alone. Instead, it is being built as a decentralized hub where real demand will fuel growth. Unlike projects whose value depends on external hype cycles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designing a system where lending, borrowing, and trading will generate continuous protocol activity and sustained buy pressure. Users will soon be able to borrow or lend stablecoins, blue-chip assets like BTC and ETH, and even highly speculative meme tokens such as SHIB, FLOKI, and PEPE. By combining both conservative and high-risk markets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to deliver unmatched liquidity, attracting diverse participants who will reinforce the ecosystem. For anyone trying to understand what is going on with crypto today, the emergence of multi-market protocols like MUTM represents the kind of innovation that drives long-term adoption. The integration of stablecoins will be particularly important, ensuring predictable demand while locking value into the system. This will create token demand at the same time it rewards participants, a balance that analysts believe will push prices higher. The Stable Rate Model will also set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart, giving borrowers confidence in predictable repayment costs while adding safeguards to manage volatility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decision to build directly on Layer-2 will also ensure that all these activities will be executed with speed and affordability, avoiding the congestion issues that Layer-1 projects continue to face. Presale Strength and Analyst Outlook The presale numbers are already drawing attention. Phase 6 is live at $0.035, with $15.3 million raised, more than 15,950 holders, and 32% of tokens in this phase already sold. Once Phase 7 begins, the price will increase by 15%, giving latecomers higher entry costs while earlier participants lock in immediate value. Phase 1 buyers are already enjoying strong returns, and those who enter during Phase 6 are being told by analysts that a clear runway to $2 remains open. Beyond the presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has secured confidence through its security-first approach. The protocol completed a CertiK audit with an impressive 95.00 Token Scan score and has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program. In a market where security risks are a constant theme, this emphasis on trustworthiness is winning over investors who want safety along with growth. The roadmap will add further fuel. A beta launch is scheduled to go live at token listing, meaning users will immediately begin interacting with the platform rather than waiting for future upgrades. With expected exchange listings on major names like Binance, Coinbase, and KuCoin already in sight, visibility will expand quickly once trading begins. As analysts explain, this kind of dual push—utility at launch and high-tier exchange exposure—creates the conditions where exponential price growth is not only expected but accelerated. The buy-and-distribute tokenomics model will also give Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a decisive edge. Protocol revenue will be used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market and then distribute them back to stakers of mtTokens. This structure ensures continuous buy pressure while rewarding long-term participants, a combination that many established tokens fail to provide. Analysts have been direct in their comparisons. While MATIC remains a respected project, its growth curve is slowing, and its scaling narrative is facing more competition every day. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at $0.035, is presenting a pathway toward $2 because of its layered revenue streams, constant activity cycle, and early adoption phase. For investors scanning through crypto predictions and searching for the next breakthrough asset, this is the one that is standing out as the stronger candidate. The conclusion from market watchers is clear: MATIC’s best days may already be behind it, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is only beginning its climb. At just $0.035, it is offering the kind of entry point that has historically produced life-changing returns for early believers. Analysts are not asking whether MUTM will reach $2—they are suggesting it will get there faster than most expect.

KuCoin has just unveiled its innovative KuCoin cloud mining platform, marking a significant step towards making crypto mining more accessible to everyone. This groundbreaking service initially empowers users to mine popular digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) without the complexities of owning and maintaining physical mining hardware. What is KuCoin Cloud Mining and How Does it Simplify Mining? For many, traditional cryptocurrency mining has been a barrier due to its high costs, technical demands, and energy consumption. However, KuCoin cloud mining changes this narrative entirely. It allows individuals to purchase “hashrate” from large, professional mining farms, effectively renting computing power to mine cryptocurrencies. Simplicity: Users avoid the hassle of setting up and maintaining mining rigs. Accessibility: It offers a lower entry barrier for new and experienced crypto enthusiasts. Efficiency: Participants benefit from industrial-scale operations without the personal overhead. This means you can participate in the mining process directly through KuCoin’s platform, and your share of the mined coins is deposited into your account. It’s a streamlined approach designed for convenience and ease of use. Unlock BTC, DOGE, and LTC Mining Opportunities with KuCoin The initial rollout of the KuCoin cloud mining platform focuses on some of the most prominent cryptocurrencies in the market. Bitcoin (BTC) needs no introduction, being the pioneer of digital currency. Dogecoin (DOGE), known for its vibrant community, and Litecoin (LTC), often called the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” are also part of this exciting launch. Notably, for its DOGE and LTC mining operations, KuCoin has secured a substantial hashrate of 200 TH/s. To put this into perspective, this figure is equivalent to an impressive 10% of the total Dogecoin hashpower, showcasing KuCoin’s serious commitment to these offerings. This significant allocation aims to provide a robust and reliable mining experience for users interested in these altcoins. Moreover, the platform ensures transparency, allowing users to track their mining progress and earnings effortlessly. This level of detail is crucial for building trust and ensuring a positive user experience. Why Consider KuCoin’s Innovative Cloud Mining Platform? Choosing a platform for your crypto endeavors is a critical decision. KuCoin’s entry into the cloud mining space brings several compelling advantages. Firstly, it leverages KuCoin’s established reputation as a secure and reliable cryptocurrency exchange, extending that trust to its new mining service. Secondly, the platform is designed with user-friendliness in mind. From purchasing hashrate contracts to monitoring daily earnings, the entire process is intuitive. This makes KuCoin cloud mining an excellent option for those who want to dip their toes into crypto mining without the steep learning curve or significant upfront investment associated with traditional methods. Furthermore, by aggregating hashrate, KuCoin can offer competitive pricing and better overall efficiency compared to individual small-scale operations. This collective power translates into more consistent rewards for participants. Getting Started: Your Journey with KuCoin Cloud Mining Embarking on your KuCoin cloud mining journey is straightforward. Users typically need to register an account on KuCoin, complete any necessary identity verification, and then navigate to the dedicated cloud mining section. Here, you can browse available hashrate contracts for BTC, DOGE, and LTC, review their terms, and make a purchase. The platform provides clear details on contract duration, expected returns, and associated fees. This transparency helps users make informed decisions about their mining investments. Once a contract is active, the mining process begins automatically, and earnings are distributed according to the terms. It is important to remember that while cloud mining offers convenience, it still involves market risks associated with cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Always conduct your own research and understand the terms before committing. The Future Landscape of Crypto Mining with KuCoin The launch of KuCoin’s platform signifies a broader trend in the cryptocurrency industry: the continuous evolution towards greater accessibility and efficiency. As the crypto space matures, services like KuCoin cloud mining play a vital role in democratizing participation. They enable a wider audience to engage with the foundational processes of blockchain technology, moving beyond just trading. This innovation could encourage more individuals to understand the underlying mechanics of their favorite digital assets, fostering a more informed and engaged community. It also positions KuCoin as a comprehensive ecosystem, offering not just trading but also investment, staking, and now, mining solutions. In conclusion, KuCoin’s new cloud mining platform is a game-changer for crypto enthusiasts. By simplifying the mining process for BTC, DOGE, and LTC, it opens up new avenues for participation and profit. This initiative reinforces KuCoin’s commitment to innovation and accessibility in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Get ready to experience the future of mining with unparalleled ease.

This move saw the bears push the price back, resisting the campaign to hit $5,000. So far, the bears have remained in control, and it seems that this will be the case for a while, with technicals pointing toward a possible 10% crash that would send the price toward $4,000 again. Why Ethereum Price Is At Risk In an update to a previous analysis, Klejdi Cuni has forecasted a further decline for the Ethereum price, with bearish indicators being more prominent. The previous prediction, shared over the weekend, pointed out that the Ethereum price had been breaking down from a bearish triangle pattern. This had suggested a further move toward the $4,300 territory. Related Reading: Is XRP A Meme Coin? Analyst Reveals How Whales Are Playing The Game True to the forecast, the Ethereum price did indeed fall back, breaking below $4,300 briefly before bouncing again. This comes after the price broke down below the support at $4,490, putting the bears in charge of the Ethereum price once again. With the first part of the forecast fulfilled, then ETH could play out the full prediction from here. The crypto analyst had previously revealed that he expected the Ethereum price to suffer further drops; first to $4,335, then to $4,215, before finally landing at $4,081. This prediction was reiterated in the updated analysis, showing where the price could be headed next. Next on the list for the cryptocurrency is to test the resistance zone around $4,500. This has previously been a level at which the price was beaten back down, suggesting that a similar trend could play out. If the price does get rejected here, then it could signal a continuation of the bearish trend. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Active Addresses Crash Over 50% In 3 Months, What About SHIB Price? The analysis also ties in the performance of the Bitcoin price, which has continued to drive the entire market. So far, the Ethereum price has performed better during the recent market crash. However, if the Bitcoin price were to continue its decline, then the Ethereum price is likely to follow in the same direction. Add in the fact that the situation around the US dollar remains unclear, and the analyst sees a lot of risk during this time. There is also the possibility of the Ethereum price turning toward the positive once again. This has to do with the resistance at $4,650, serving as a make-or-break level. If the price is rejected from here, then it could mean more declines. However, if ETH bulls are able to reclaim it with strength, then it could serve as a bounce-off point for the next rally.

The latest market action shows a clear Chainlink (LINK) price surge, with bulls eyeing fresh highs, while the recent XRP price drop has traders questioning its near-term strength. Both tokens remain important in the market, but investors are now asking where the smarter money should go next. That’s where BlockDAG enters the conversation. With its massive presale traction, millions of users mining through its X1 app, and a gamified dashboard driving nonstop engagement, BlockDAG is building momentum before it even lists. For those hunting the best crypto to buy for 2025, the contrast between traditional price swings and BlockDAG’s presale growth couldn’t be clearer. BlockDAG X1 Goes Viral – 3 Million Phones, One Mining Army The X1 Miner App, hitting over 3 million users, is not just about adoption; it’s about a new kind of force forming in crypto. Each phone becomes a mining tool, and each user adds to a growing base of liquidity before BlockDAG even lists. This isn’t passive growth; it’s a community digging value out of their own devices and creating a presale storm that others can’t ignore. That scale matters. When millions are mining daily, the project doesn’t need hype from the outside; it generates its own. Anyone not joining in is missing out, while others are quietly stacking BDAG that could be worth much more at launch. BlockDAG is in batch 30 at $0.003 but available at $0.0013 until Oct 1st. The presale has already crossed $395 million. The gamified Dashboard V4 fuels competition through Buyer Battles, rewarding those who push hardest to secure tokens. It’s not just buying; it’s a live simulation of trading where wallets, charts, and leaderboards keep the adrenaline high. That constant activity feeds demand and ensures that BDAG isn’t sitting still while investors decide whether to get in. For anyone asking what the best crypto to buy for 2025 could look like, the answer is often tied to real community strength. BlockDAG isn’t just selling tokens; it’s training millions of miners to build the future value of the coin. That’s why missing out on this presale could be the costliest decision of all. Chainlink (LINK) Price Surge Gains Attention The Chainlink (LINK) price surge has been one of the stronger moves in the market lately, with bulls eyeing levels above $20 as the next major target. Recent partnerships and ecosystem upgrades have sparked optimism, giving LINK a push toward the resistance zone between $19.80 and $21.25. Trading volumes are steadily growing, and this renewed activity has fueled sentiment that LINK could finally be moving out of its longer consolidation period. After months of slower progress, the market is now watching closely to see if the current momentum can build into a stronger rally. Still, the Chainlink (LINK) price surge comes with some caution. While the token successfully broke past $16, analysts warn that further gains may not come quickly. Much of the upside will depend on whether network adoption continues at the same pace and whether LINK can hold key support levels if selling pressure returns. Compared to presale-driven projects that are delivering immediate growth, LINK’s gains may take longer to fully show. Even so, for investors tracking infrastructure tokens that support smart contracts and decentralized applications, LINK remains an asset worth monitoring closely. XRP Price Drop Tests Investor Confidence The recent XRP price drop has raised questions about whether the token can maintain momentum in the near term. From August 24 onward, XRP slipped sharply from $2.96 down to $2.84 before bouncing slightly, with $2.84 now acting as a critical support zone. Heavy trading volumes drove this move, signaling that investors were quick to react to market pressure. Resistance has formed around $2.94–$2.95, leaving XRP in a tight trading range while traders wait for the next breakout signal. Adding to the concern, futures open interest fell by about 30%, suggesting reduced speculative appetite. Macro factors, including Federal Reserve policy uncertainty, also weighed on sentiment, keeping pressure on prices. While indicators like RSI and MACD hint at possible stabilization, XRP still needs to push above the $3 level to rebuild confidence. For now, the XRP price drop highlights both its volatility and the challenge of sustaining long-term upside, especially when compared to projects that are fueling growth through community-led presales and new adoption models. Parting Thoughts Chainlink continues to build strength with the Chainlink (LINK) price surge pushing it toward the $20 mark, supported by partnerships and growing activity. At the same time, XRP has struggled with the recent XRP price drop, dipping to $2.84 before recovering slightly, leaving traders cautious about its short-term outlook. Both coins remain relevant, but neither has the same community-driven momentum that BlockDAG is showing right now. With over 3 million miners active on the X1 app and $395 million already raised in its presale, BlockDAG is creating its own demand before launch. The gamified dashboard and daily Buyer Battles only fuel the rush further. For investors asking what the best crypto to buy for 2025 is, BlockDAG’s mix of adoption, presale growth, and grassroots mining makes it stand out as the one not to overlook.

According to the official tally shared via Solana Status, 98.27% of stake voted Yes, 1.05% voted No, and 0.69% abstained, with 52% of total stake participating. Solana Slashes Finality By 100x “The community governance process for SIMD-0326: Alpenglow is complete. The proposal has passed: 98.27% Yes, 1.05% No, 0.69% Abstain; 52% of stake cast a vote,” Solana Status posted on X on September 2.

In practice, that architecture is what underpins the ~150–200 ms confirmation targets . Beyond raw speed, Alpenglow touches validator economics and fault tolerance. With vote transactions moving off-chain, Solana will eliminate per-slot vote fees and introduce a fixed Validator Admission Ticket (VAT)—initially 1.6 SOL per epoch—that is burned. The model aims to preserve economic friction against spam even as vote traffic leaves the ledger, while simplifying load on the network. Separately, the design targets a “20+20” resilience envelope: safety if up to 20% of stake is adversarial and liveness if an additional, disjoint 20% is offline. These mechanics were debated in the forum during the governance window and were reiterated in technical explainers ahead of the vote. Governance mechanics and timeline. The governance process followed the steps laid out on the Solana forum: discussion in epochs 833–838, stake weights captured in epoch 839, and voting in epochs 840–842, with passage defined as Yes ≥ two-thirds of (Yes + No) and a 33% quorum in which abstentions count toward quorum. Anza’s epoch-843 note simply marks the moment the chain passed the voting boundary on mainnet-beta. With the validator signal secured, Alpenglow now moves from governance to engineering reality. Whether it ultimately delivers stable ~150 ms finality at scale is a question only testnet and mainnet can answer—but the 98% approval makes clear the Solana ecosystem’s directional bet: real-time blockchain.

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/can-bitcoin-btc-sustain-its-rally-this-time-price-analysis,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a descending channel on Tuesday but upside progress thus far has been slow. Can Bitcoin sustain this rally, or will the bears bring this one back down just as has happened ever since the all-time high? $BTC higher high or back to support? Source: TradingView When one considers that the descending channel has come all the way down from the all-time high (top left of chart) and that this is the first serious breakout in that time, it does prompt the view that the $BTC price may finally have bottomed. If there is another leg down, and this takes the price to a lower low, it would most likely be market makers forcing one more flush out of the long positions before sending the price back up. As it stands, the breakout has occurred, it has been confirmed, and it might be expected that the price rises from here. The first big target for the bulls is a higher high which can be found at $113,500. This would provide a confirmation of the break of trend and would put all eyes back on Bitcoin again. That said, this may not happen quickly. The short-term Stochastic RSI indicators are generally at, or approaching the top of their range limits and this might be why the current rally could be starting to falter. The Stochastic RSI indicators in the 4-hour time frame are rolling over, as can be seen in the chart above, and so there might be some sideways and downwards price action that leads $BTC back towards the $108,300 support. One more dip according to Renko candles? Source: TradingView The Renko candles are used above in order to give an uncluttered view of the trends. The Renko candles aren’t affected by time, but by price, so this smooths out all the minor fluctuations. A red or green ‘brick’ will only be added if the predefined price amount is reached. As can be seen in the chart above, the price is currently in a downtrend. However, strong support is underneath. There is room for one or possibly two more red bricks to the downside, but as soon as a green brick is printed the odds would be in favour of a new trend. The Stochastic RSI also works with Renko candles, and it can be noted that the indicator lines are on their way back to the bottom. Looking left, one can see what happened the last time they started to rise back up. Enveloping candle or dip to $105,000? Source: TradingView The weekly time frame shows a reasonably sized green candle based from the horizontal support. It remains to be seen how this will look come the end of play on Sunday. If the candle continues to grow and is able to envelop the previous red candle, this would be extremely bullish and would no doubt bring the bulls back into control. Another scenario, and this could be more likely, is that the price just manages to hold above the support by the end of the week. This would give the Stochastic RSI indicators time to fully bottom, auguring the next upward impulse. Finally, the bear scenario is that this rally fails and that the candle becomes another red one. That said, even in this scenario, the Stochastic RSI indicator is still likely to signal upside momentum in the next couple of weeks or so. Could this mean that the $BTC price drops to $105,000 before that trend change? Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Yet, the performance of the US Dollar Outlook often acts as a foundational tremor, sending ripples through every asset class, including digital currencies. When the dollar steadies after a period of volatility, it’s not just a headline for forex traders; it signals shifting tides in global economic sentiment that can influence everything from investor risk appetite to commodity prices, ultimately impacting the crypto market’s liquidity and direction. Understanding these macro shifts is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the complex interplay of modern finance. The US Dollar Outlook: Unpacking Recent Stability Amidst Shifting Tides The mighty US Dollar, often seen as the world’s reserve currency and a safe haven during times of uncertainty, has recently shown a remarkable ability to steady itself. After a period of recouping some earlier losses, its current position reflects a delicate balance of competing forces. This isn’t merely about daily fluctuations; it’s a profound narrative unfolding in the global financial arena, shaped by intricate economic data, policy expectations, and geopolitical undercurrents. For those observing the Forex Market Analysis , the dollar’s resilience, even amidst headwinds, speaks volumes about its enduring strength and the challenges faced by other major currencies. What exactly contributes to this newfound steadiness? It’s a multifaceted answer, involving: Investor Sentiment: A cautious return to the dollar as a store of value, particularly when other economies show signs of weakness or increased risk. Economic Data: Stronger-than-expected US economic indicators, such as employment figures or consumer spending, which can bolster confidence in the dollar’s underlying strength. Central Bank Divergence: The Federal Reserve’s stance relative to other central banks, which can create interest rate differentials favorable to the dollar. Understanding these elements is vital, as the dollar’s trajectory has significant implications for international trade, commodity prices, and even the valuation of global corporate earnings. Its stability can provide a much-needed anchor in an otherwise turbulent financial sea. Decoding Interest Rate Bets: What’s the Federal Reserve’s Next Move? One of the most powerful drivers of currency valuations, particularly for the US Dollar, revolves around Interest Rate Bets . The market is constantly trying to anticipate the Federal Reserve’s next policy decision regarding the federal funds rate. Higher interest rates typically make a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns, thus increasing demand for that currency. Conversely, expectations of rate cuts can weaken a currency as its yield advantage diminishes. Currently, the narrative is heavily influenced by expectations of potential rate cuts. But why are these bets so significant, and what factors are influencing them? Inflation Data: The primary mandate of central banks like the Fed is price stability. If inflation appears to be cooling sustainably towards their target, it opens the door for rate cuts. Economic Growth: A slowing economy, or signs of an impending recession, can prompt the Fed to cut rates to stimulate economic activity. Labor Market: The strength of the jobs market is a key indicator. A weakening labor market could push the Fed towards a more dovish stance. The market’s anticipation of these moves creates considerable volatility. Traders constantly adjust their positions based on incoming economic data, speeches from Fed officials, and geopolitical developments. A misjudgment of the Fed’s intentions can lead to rapid shifts in dollar value, affecting everything from import costs to the profitability of multinational corporations. The exact timing and magnitude of these potential cuts remain a subject of intense debate and speculation, making the dollar’s future path highly dependent on the Fed’s communication and the evolving economic landscape. Addressing Fiscal Concerns Impact: A Shadow Over Dollar Strength? While interest rates grab headlines, the underlying health of a nation’s finances, particularly the Fiscal Concerns Impact , plays a critical, albeit often slower-burning, role in currency valuation. For the United States, concerns about the national debt and persistent budget deficits have been a recurring theme. When a government’s finances appear unsustainable, it can erode investor confidence, potentially leading to a weakening of its currency. How do these fiscal concerns manifest and impact the dollar? Debt Ceiling Debates: Periodic political standoffs over raising the debt ceiling can create uncertainty and briefly shake investor confidence in US government bonds, indirectly pressuring the dollar. Long-Term Sustainability: A persistently high and growing national debt raises questions about the government’s ability to service its obligations without resorting to inflationary measures or higher taxes, both of which can be detrimental to currency value. Credit Ratings: Downgrades of a nation’s credit rating, even if temporary, can send a strong signal to global markets about fiscal health, potentially leading to capital outflows. It’s a complex dynamic. While the US dollar benefits from its status as a reserve currency and the depth of its financial markets, persistent fiscal imbalances cannot be ignored indefinitely. Investors weigh the risks associated with mounting debt against the dollar’s traditional safe-haven appeal. A careful watch on government spending, tax revenues, and political will to address these issues is crucial for understanding the dollar’s long-term trajectory. The balance between short-term economic stimuli and long-term fiscal prudence is a tightrope walk for policymakers, with significant implications for the dollar’s standing. Navigating Global Economic Trends: The Dollar’s Role in a Connected World No currency exists in a vacuum, and the US Dollar’s performance is inextricably linked to broader Global Economic Trends . From the economic health of China and Europe to geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe or the Middle East, events across the globe can significantly influence the dollar’s strength. When global growth is robust, risk appetite generally increases, and capital might flow out of safe-haven assets like the dollar into more growth-oriented investments. Conversely, during periods of global uncertainty or economic slowdowns, the dollar often strengthens as investors flock to its perceived safety. Consider these interconnected factors: International Trade Dynamics: A strong dollar makes US exports more expensive and imports cheaper, impacting trade balances and corporate earnings for multinational companies. Commodity Prices: Many key commodities, such as oil and gold, are priced in US dollars. A stronger dollar can make these commodities more expensive for buyers using other currencies, potentially dampening demand and impacting inflation abroad. Emerging Markets: A strengthening dollar can put pressure on emerging market economies, especially those with dollar-denominated debt, making it harder to service their obligations. Central Bank Policies Abroad: The monetary policies of the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Japan (BOJ), and others directly influence the relative strength of their currencies against the dollar, creating competitive dynamics in the forex market. The dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency means it often acts as a barometer for global economic health. Its movements are not just a reflection of US domestic policy but also a reaction to the collective economic pulse of the planet. Investors and policymakers alike must keep a keen eye on these international developments to anticipate the dollar’s next significant move. Forex Market Analysis: Strategies for Navigating Dollar Volatility For active participants in the financial markets, particularly those involved in currency trading, robust Forex Market Analysis is paramount. The US Dollar’s recent steadiness, followed by periods of volatility, presents both challenges and opportunities. Understanding how to interpret market signals and apply effective strategies can make a significant difference in navigating these complex conditions. Key aspects of effective Forex market analysis include: Analysis Type Description Relevance to Dollar Fundamental Analysis Examining economic data, news events, and government policies to predict future price movements. Crucial for understanding interest rate bets, fiscal concerns, and global economic trends that drive the dollar. Technical Analysis Studying price charts and indicators to identify patterns and predict future price action. Helps identify support/resistance levels, trends, and entry/exit points for dollar-related currency pairs. Sentiment Analysis Gauging the overall mood of the market (bullish or bearish) through various indicators and news. Important for understanding short-term reactions to news and how traders are positioning themselves on the dollar. For investors, monitoring the Dollar Index (DXY) is essential. The DXY measures the dollar’s value against a basket of six major currencies (Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona, Swiss Franc). A rising DXY indicates dollar strength, while a falling DXY signals weakness. By combining these analytical approaches, traders can develop more informed strategies to capitalize on dollar movements, whether they involve direct currency trades or indirectly affect other asset classes like commodities or cryptocurrencies. What Actionable Insights Can Investors Glean from the Dollar’s Trajectory? Understanding the forces shaping the dollar isn’t just an academic exercise; it offers tangible insights for investment decisions. Here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches and minutes from Federal Reserve officials. Their hawkish or dovish leanings provide critical clues about future interest rate policy. Track Key Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on US inflation reports (CPI, PCE), employment data (Non-Farm Payrolls), GDP growth, and consumer confidence. These are direct inputs into the Fed’s decision-making process. Assess Global Risk Appetite: During periods of heightened global uncertainty, the dollar tends to strengthen as a safe haven. Conversely, when global growth is robust, riskier assets may outperform, potentially leading to dollar weakness. Consider Diversification: A strong dollar can impact the returns of international investments when converted back to local currency. Diversifying across different currencies and asset classes can help mitigate this risk. Review Fiscal Health: While slower to impact, ongoing developments in US fiscal policy, including budget debates and debt management, can signal long-term risks or stability for the dollar. These insights empower investors to make more informed decisions, whether they are trading forex, investing in international stocks, or assessing the broader market implications for assets like gold or even cryptocurrencies, which often react to shifts in global liquidity and risk sentiment. Challenges and Opportunities: Navigating the Dollar’s Uncertain Path The path ahead for the US Dollar is unlikely to be smooth. Several challenges and opportunities will shape its journey: Challenges: Persistent Inflation: If inflation proves stickier than anticipated, the Fed might be forced to keep rates higher for longer, potentially slowing economic growth and creating an environment of stagflation. Escalating Fiscal Deficits: Unaddressed, growing national debt could eventually undermine confidence in the dollar, leading to a loss of its reserve currency status in the very long term. Geopolitical Shocks: Unexpected global events, from conflicts to trade wars, can introduce sudden volatility, making the dollar’s trajectory unpredictable. Rise of Alternative Currencies/Digital Assets: While still nascent, the long-term potential for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or a more widespread adoption of major cryptocurrencies could subtly shift global financial power dynamics. Opportunities: Continued US Economic Resilience: If the US economy continues to outperform its peers, it will naturally support dollar strength, attracting capital inflows. Safe-Haven Demand: In an increasingly uncertain world, the dollar’s role as a primary safe haven is likely to persist, offering support during global crises. Monetary Policy Flexibility: The Fed’s ability to adjust interest rates, unlike some other central banks, provides a powerful tool to manage economic cycles and maintain dollar stability. Understanding these potential challenges and opportunities allows investors to better prepare for various scenarios, ensuring their portfolios are resilient and positioned for growth in a dynamic global financial landscape. Compelling Summary: The Dollar’s Enduring Dance with Global Forces The US Dollar’s recent steadiness, following a period of recouping losses, underscores its pivotal role in the global financial system. This stability is not a sign of stasis but rather a dynamic equilibrium shaped by the intricate interplay of Interest Rate Bets , primarily driven by the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions, and the looming shadows of Fiscal Concerns Impact , such as national debt and budget deficits. Furthermore, the dollar’s trajectory is deeply influenced by broader Global Economic Trends , reacting to everything from international trade flows to geopolitical tensions. For those engaged in Forex Market Analysis , understanding these forces is paramount, as they dictate the dollar’s strength against other major currencies and its indirect influence on asset classes like commodities and cryptocurrencies. While the immediate US Dollar Outlook points to a cautious balance, the future remains a complex tapestry woven from economic data, policy shifts, and unforeseen global events. Staying informed and agile will be key to navigating its fascinating and enduring dance with global forces.

When data from South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchanges Upbit and Bithumb are combined, Ethereum (ETH) and XRP took the top two places in total trading volume. Upbit dominated the Korean cryptocurrency market last week, maintaining higher trading volumes than Bithumb. Upbit's daily trading volume has typically exceeded $5 billion, peaking near $7.5 billion. In contrast, Bithumb's trading volume has been relatively modest, typically hovering between $1 billion and $2 billion daily. When it comes to altcoins, ETH and XRP clearly dominated both exchanges. On Upbit, ETH ($2.064 billion) led in trading volume, followed by XRP ($2.05 billion) and Cronos (CRO) ($1.82 billion). Solana (SOL -$1.56 billion) and Bitcoin (BTC -$1.21 billion) ranked fourth and fifth. Interestingly, PYTH, which the US Department of Commerce has partnered with for macroeconomic data, also showed remarkable growth in the Korean market, with weekly trading volume reaching $1.1 billion. On Bithumb, like Upbit, ETH ($1 billion) and XRP ($923 million) performed strongly. They were followed by USDT ($708 million) and SOL ($663 million). Bitcoin came in fifth with $612 million, while mid-cap tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethena (ENA), CRO, and PENGU were further down the list. However, they recorded lower volumes, according to Upbit. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ethereum (ETH) and XRP Gain Power on South Korean Exchanges!

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin has now firmly broken out of its long-drawn consolidation channel, which had been in place since mid-July. After gaining nearly 2% yesterday, $BTC hasn’t moved much so far today – and that could actually be a great sign. Why? Because on the daily chart, today’s candle is forming an inside bar, meaning the price is still trading within yesterday’s high-low range. This pattern is especially noteworthy right after a breakout (as is the case now), as it suggests $BTC is gathering strength before potentially continuing in the direction of the breakout. Even better? On the 4-hour chart, the 10 and 20 EMAs, which offer some of the earliest trend-change signals, are now stacked on top of each other in bullish order, i.e., the 10 above the 20. BRC-2.0 vs. Bitcoin Hyper: Which One Really Unlocks Bitcoin’s Future? September 3, 2025 • 10:07 UTC Yesterday, Bitcoin took a major leap with the BRC-2.0 upgrade . This enables Ethereum-style smart contracts directly on the Bitcoin network, letting developers build DeFi apps, NFTs, and programmable tokens directly on Bitcoin. While a big step forward, the solution doesn’t improve Bitcoin’s base layer speed or transaction throughput. Bitcoin still processes blocks roughly every 10 minutes , and its consensus mechanism remains unchanged. That’s why Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER ) is emerging as a more advanced alternative. With Solana-grade speed, native rollups, and zero-knowledge bridges, $HYPER is the first programmable Bitcoin layer 2 that doesn’t compromise speed, scalability, or security. The $HYPER presale is live and has raised $13.6M already in its bid to redefine what Bitcoin can be. Our crypto team predicts $HYPER could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025, a 28x gain from its final presale price, if the current momentum continues. Find out how to buy $HYPER now for a low $0.012845, before it hits the public exchanges. Crypto.com CEO Believes Crypto Could Explode in Q4 Due to Interest Rate Cuts: Bitcoin Hyper Nears $14M Raised in Presale September 3, 2025 • 10:07 UTC Kris Marszalek, Crypto.com CEO, said in a Bloomberg interview that crypto should experience upside in Q4 due to potential Fed interest rate cuts. He’s also betting that the Fed will announce a cut on September 17. CME Group estimates a 89.7% chance of a 25-point cut during the next Fed meeting . This should add more liquidity to crypto markets and encourage investors to make riskier plays. Crypto.com itself is planning to access the crypto prediction market space, currently dominated by Polymarket and Kalshi. Just last month, the company partnered with Trump Media and Technology Group to establish a Cronos treasury. All these moves, and a potential Fed rate cut this month, could send the market rallying up. Altcoins and new presales are bound to receive most of the love from avid investors looking for the next 100x coin. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is currently undergoing a $13.6M-strong presale, and it’s heating up as we speak. One whale bought $11.2K $HYPER yesterday , and the project has seen increased whale action lately.

Snorter Token Could Be the Next Crypto to Explode September 3, 2025 • 10:07 UTC Solana finally approved Alpenglow, the upgrade to beat all other upgrades. It promises to cut transaction finality from 12.8 seconds to around 100–150 milliseconds, which is an incredible leap. Almost all validators (98%) approved the upgrade after governance voting yesterday. At these speeds, Solana could realize Web2-level responsiveness with L1 finality, unlocking new use cases that require both speed and cryptographic certainty —Solana Foundation, Blog Post This immediately translated to positive performance for Solana as it jumped to over $200 in the last day. The 24h trading volume is also up by 36% as traders are rushing to get in on a rallying $SOL. Community sentiment lies at 85%, and many are seeing a race up for the token. This bodes very well for SOL-based presales like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , which is also aiming for speed, but in the trading bot arena. It plans to launch Snorter Bot, the cheapest and fastest trading bot on Solana that’ll be housed on Telegram. Investors have already added over $3.6M in this presale – see what Snorter Token is planning to do in our guide. The token is currently worth $0.1031, and you can also stake for 126%. See why our Snorter Token price prediction believes $SNORT could go up by 812% by the year’s end. $MAXI Tipped Next Crypto to Explode as Elon Musk’s Lawyer Leads Dogecoin’s Treasury September 3, 2025 • 10:07 UTC Elon Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, has taken the helm of Dogecoin’s new treasury.

Tipped as the next crypto to explode , it’s built lean, moves fast, and cuts through the market like a pre-workout buzz. Deflationary by design and engineered for high-leverage degenerates, $MAXI doesn’t wait for boardroom approvals; it front-runs the pump and flexes on every chart. Early Entry = Maximum Gains: Presale buyers get in before the public hype hits. That means lower entry price, higher upside, and first access to staking rewards and liquidity incentives.

The announcement, made Tuesday, clarified that regulated domestic and foreign exchanges are not restricted from listing spot crypto products, including those offering leverage and margin features. According to the statement, national securities exchanges (NSEs), designated contract markets (DCMs), and foreign boards of trade (FBOTs) are permitted to facilitate spot crypto trading. The agencies emphasized their readiness to review exchange filings, evaluate custody and clearing arrangements, and ensure that any new spot markets align with standards for investor protection, transparency, and market surveillance. Expanding Opportunities for Regulated Venues This development means that traditional financial venues such as Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, CME Group, and Cboe Global Markets could potentially enter the spot crypto trading market, offering products similar to those already available on crypto-native platforms like Coinbase and Kraken. Certain foreign boards of trade recognized by the CFTC may also qualify to list these products. The guidance follows the recommendations of the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which has consistently urged regulators to provide clearer frameworks for digital assets. In its July report, the group called on U.S. agencies to create regulatory clarity to encourage blockchain innovation within the country and limit the risk of capital flight to offshore markets. A Shift in U.S. Crypto Trading Policy The statement also reflects the broader shift in U.S. policy on cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump’s administration. Since January, both Congress and the White House have taken steps to establish more defined rules for digital assets. These efforts include stablecoin legislation such as the Genius Act, and the CLARITY Act, a market structure bill passed by the House of Representatives in July, which is now awaiting Senate review. By issuing this joint statement, the SEC and CFTC have provided a clearer path forward for exchanges interested in offering spot crypto trading. Market participants were encouraged to engage directly with the agencies to address any concerns or proposals, ensuring that future developments in the market remain aligned with U.S. regulatory standards.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Cardano (ADA) have come to the fore as names to watch. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance presale is now open and more than 30% of the tokens have already been scooped up. Getting in at this stage would set investors up for at least a 5x upside over the next few weeks and months. The platform has successfully raised more than $15.3 million and attracted more than 16,000 token holders. Cardano (ADA) has been busy building out its ecosystem but all attention is shifting towards the Mutuum Finance as it increases pace of development and builds momentum towards a possible market recovery. Cardano (ADA): Breaking Through the Noise for Long-Term Upside Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at about $0.80, with slight downward pressure on the cryptocurrency as it continues to trade near a narrow range between around $0.79 and $0.82. The correction comes after optimism caused by a potential Cardano ETF filing from Grayscale and the public review of its Ouroboros Leios protocol which lifted ADA by around 3% to $0.8333. Analysts are noting a descending wedge pattern that is pointing toward a breakout in Q4, with possible targets ranging from $1.20-$1.30 if resistance near $0.88 is breached. However, a break below $0.75 may have downside risk to $0.68. At the same time, investor interest is also starting to diversify to new DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance. Presale Stage 6 Milestone Mutuum Finance’s presale is still gaining momentum and the sixth stage is providing tokens at $0.0035. With the project already boasting over 16,000 token holders and having secured over $15.3 million in funding, FOMO is on the rise, paving the way for a robust launch and widespread adoption. Those who are entering now are setting up for a big return on the next bull cycle. Shaping the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance is developing a next-generation Decentralized Finance platform for retail and institutional services so as to become the leading player in the next wave of DeFi. With its innovative smart contract architecture and a focus on security and scalability, the project is setting itself apart from the competition. $100K Token Giveaway With this in mind, Mutuum Finance is announcing a $100,000 giveaway in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This project represents the project’s commitment to developing a long-term and active user community. Official Bug Bounty Program In partnership with CertiK, Mutuum Finance has officially launched a bug bounty program with rewards up to $50,000 USDT for reporting vulnerabilities. Rewards will be classified as critical, major, minor and low, and will be used to ensure the safety of the platform and the stability of the system. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance is a two-sided lending model which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. P2C uses smart contracts for automation of lending and P2P allows direct connections between lenders and borrowers with no intermediaries, which is very appealing for meme coin communities. Key Metrics and Protections The platform relies on Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to restrict borrowing and collateral while offloading liquidation limits to risky positions and rewarding liquidators. The reserve factor is a proxy for capturing elements of the interest in order to provide a cushion against default and extreme market conditions, with higher risk assets receiving higher reserves. With the market rallying, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming one of the big winners for investors hoping to see cryptocurrencies recover, ahead of many established altcoins such as Cardano (ADA).

51122791,572925,1756899004,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51122791.jpeg,"Ethereum Leads Market Rotation Amid Shifting Liquidity On Binance, Is A Rebound In Sight?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-leads-market-rotation/,"After days of downward pressure and decline, Ethereum , the leading altcoin, appears to be staging a comeback as it surges toward the $4,400 price level. Despite the period of bearish price action, the second-largest asset continues to see serious interest from investors, especially on the Binance crypto platform. Liquidity Migration, And Ethereum Is Dominating The Trend As the market turns bearish, liquidity flows and investor behavior on Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, are revealing a clear market rotation. In the midst of this crucial market shift is Ethereum, as the altcoin heavily dominates the trend. Following his analysis, Darkfost highlighted that ETH is gaining a disproportionate amount of trading activity on the Binance platform while capital moves across assets. This dominance of ETH indicates a renewed belief in the asset’s ongoing rally and long-term potential. According to the on-chain expert and author, a noticeable change in investor behavior occurred on Binance during the month of August, which marked the first of its kind since 2023. Meanwhile, Ethereum took the center stage with a massive increase in trading volume over other major assets. In addition to dominating other major assets listed on Binance, the altcoin outpaced Bitcoin ’s trading volume on the platform. This spike in interest coincides with ongoing market volatility, underscoring ETH’s developing position as the hub of momentum and liquidity in the exchange ecosystem. Data shared by Darkfost shows that ETH recorded nearly $550 trillion in trading volume on Binance in August alone. After calculating Binance’s trading volume, this figure represents roughly 54% of the total volume. Darkfost also highlighted that investor interest in the altcoin seems to have increased sharply on the Binance platform, which has triggered a clear liquidity rotation . With most cryptocurrencies still struggling and Bitcoin recently reaching a new all-time high around $123,000, this dynamic has largely driven the increased attention to ETH and contributed to its current outperformance. Historically, a portion of the capital has tended to shift into ETH following a robust bullish leg from BTC before spreading to the rest of the market. ETH Exchange Reserves Are Dropping Another metric that reflects this renewed wave of interest is the Ethereum Exchange Reserve on Binance. Despite ETH’s continuous decline in price after reaching a new all-time high, Crypto Sunmoon’s quick-take post shows that demand for the altcoin remains strong compared to Bitcoin . While Bitcoin reserves on the Binance platform have stayed comparatively constant, Ethereum reserves are exhibiting a persistent downward trend. According to the on-chain expert, this divergence implies that there is more demand for Ethereum than for Bitcoin, as market participants are actively accumulating ETH even during the present price consolidation phase. Also, a declining exchange reserve is an indication that investors are moving their holdings off centralized exchanges to long-term storage or cold storage. Such a trend points to growing conviction among investors, which typically reduces selling pressure on ETH.",Ethereum|Altcoin|binance|bitcoin|Bitcoin Exchange Reserve on Binance|Crypto Sunmoon|Darkfost|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Exchange Reserve on Binance|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 11:30:04

Cryptocurrency financial services powerhouse, Galaxy Digital, has embarked on an exciting new venture, beginning the issuance of its Solana-based tokenized company shares , known as GLXY. This innovative step allows shareholders to tokenize their existing GLXY shares on OpeningBell, a cutting-edge blockchain platform developed by asset management firm Superstate, marking a significant milestone in the convergence of conventional finance and blockchain technology. What Exactly Are Tokenized Company Shares? Many people might wonder what tokenized company shares truly are and why they matter. Simply put, tokenization is the process of converting real-world assets, like company shares, into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents a verifiable, fractional ownership of the underlying asset. This digital representation brings several advantages: Enhanced Accessibility: It can lower barriers to entry for investors. Increased Liquidity: Digital assets can be traded more easily and quickly. Fractional Ownership: Investors can own a small portion of a high-value asset. This method leverages blockchain’s transparency and security to create a more efficient and inclusive financial system. For instance, imagine owning a fraction of a blue-chip stock without needing to purchase an entire, expensive share. Galaxy Digital’s Pioneering Move with GLXY Tokenized Company Shares Galaxy Digital, a respected name in the crypto space, is not just talking about the future; they are building it. By issuing their own GLXY shares as tokenized company shares on the Solana blockchain, they are demonstrating a tangible application of this technology. The choice of Solana is notable due to its high throughput and low transaction costs, making it an ideal network for facilitating efficient asset tokenization. The OpeningBell platform, provided by Superstate, acts as the bridge. It enables existing shareholders to convert their traditional shares into digital tokens. This process means that ownership records are securely maintained on the blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent ledger. This development highlights a growing trend where established financial institutions are actively exploring and adopting blockchain solutions to modernize their offerings. Why This Matters: Benefits for Investors and the Market The introduction of tokenized company shares by a major player like Galaxy Digital offers a compelling glimpse into the future of investing. For investors, this could mean: Global Access: Potentially easier access to global markets, bypassing traditional geographical limitations. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets with fixed hours, blockchain-based assets can be traded around the clock. Reduced Costs: Lower intermediation fees and faster settlement times. Greater Transparency: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, enhancing trust and reducing fraud. From a market perspective, this innovation could unlock significant capital and foster a new era of financial products. It bridges the gap between traditional capital markets and the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, creating exciting new opportunities for growth and innovation. Navigating the Digital Frontier: Challenges and Future of Tokenized Company Shares While the benefits are clear, the path forward for tokenized company shares is not without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a significant challenge. Governments and financial authorities worldwide are still developing frameworks to oversee digital assets. Security is another paramount concern; while blockchain offers robust security, smart contract vulnerabilities and user error can still pose risks. However, the proactive steps taken by firms like Galaxy Digital suggest a strong belief in the long-term potential of this technology. As more institutions adopt and experiment with tokenization, we can expect to see clearer regulations, more robust security measures, and greater mainstream adoption. This pioneering effort by Galaxy Digital could pave the way for other companies to follow suit, fundamentally changing how we buy, sell, and own assets. In conclusion, Galaxy Digital’s move to issue Solana-based tokenized company shares is more than just a technical upgrade; it represents a significant leap towards a more open, efficient, and accessible financial future. By embracing blockchain technology for traditional assets, they are setting a precedent that could inspire widespread adoption and innovation across the global financial landscape. This is truly a groundbreaking development that warrants close attention from anyone interested in the evolution of finance.

Many staking-based altcoins inflate supply, dilute value, and eventually leave investors disappointed. Bitfrac positions itself differently by linking token rewards directly to real-world Bitcoin mining operations. Instead of speculation, it provides exposure to industrial-scale infrastructure and recurring profit streams. Stage 2 of the Bitfrac presale is now open. It offers retail investors a rare opportunity to earn monthly Bitcoin payouts without managing mining equipment or incurring tens of thousands of dollars in setup costs. The project blends accessibility with proven revenue generation. Why Passive Income Altcoins Are Gaining Traction The crypto market is maturing, and investors increasingly prefer yield-driven strategies over short-term speculation. Trading alone is unpredictable, while staking only altcoins often rely on unsustainable token inflation to pay rewards. This creates cycles where early participants benefit but long-term holders see diminishing returns. That’s where mining-backed tokens like Bitfrac come in. Instead of printing value from thin air, the project generates cash flow from Bitcoin mining operations. Industrial facilities, low-cost electricity, and state-of-the-art ASIC hardware create a foundation for consistent revenues. Token holders receive profit distributions directly in Bitcoin, which ties income to real economic activity rather than hype cycles. In contrast to traditional mining, which requires $50,000 or more in hardware and significant expertise, Bitfrac lowers the barrier to just $100. This model explains why passive income altcoins with genuine revenue connections are gaining ground among investors seeking reliable returns. How Bitfrac Combines Industrial Mining With Investor Rewards Bitfrac introduces a fractional ownership model, enabling retail investors to participate in large-scale mining without the need to build or maintain equipment. Each token represents a share of mining operations, providing holders with exposure to revenue that was previously available only to institutions. The platform’s dual revenue model strengthens profitability. Its primary stream comes from operating industrial ASIC miners, such as Bitmain’s Antminer S19 XP and MicroBT’s Whatsminer M50S. Facilities are strategically located to leverage electricity as low as $0.03 per kWh, ensuring operational efficiency. The secondary stream comes from hosting services, which add stability and diversification to income. Monthly profit distributions will begin in November 2025, delivered automatically to wallets through smart contracts. Beyond payouts, Bitfrac employs a 5% token buyback and burn mechanism, reducing supply and supporting long-term token value. For perspective, a $100 presale investment at Stage 2 pricing buys roughly 4,167 tokens. With the 20% early-bird bonus, this increases to 5,000 tokens. At projected future valuations, that stake could grow to $310, a 210% potential gain. This combination of real mining income and token growth creates a balanced path for generating passive income. Why Stage 2 Is the Best Time to Join Timing is critical in presales. Bitfrac’s token price is set to climb across stages: $0.017 in Stage 1, $0.024 in Stage 2, $0.042 in Stage 3, $0.062 in Stage 4, and $0.086 at listing. That means investors entering Stage 2 secure tokens before significant price increases. So far, $313,220 has been raised in Stage 2, filling 8.3% of its $3.5 million target. More than 2,000 investors have already joined, signaling early confidence in the project’s model. With the 20% bonus ending soon, Stage 2 represents the best crypto presale opportunity for higher token allocations at a lower entry point. Conclusion For investors seeking passive income, Bitfrac stands apart from inflationary altcoins. Its industrial Bitcoin mining foundation ensures rewards are tied to real output, not speculation. With Stage 2 presale live, the window is open to secure bonus tokens and position early for long term profit participation.

The crypto gallery is closely watching Sun if he eventually resorts to selling his WLFI. Wallets linked to Justin Sun are moving WLFI tokens, with some of them sent to the HTX exchange. HTX, which was acquired by Sun in 2022, may turn into one of the main hubs for WLFI activity. However, Sun’s wallets are closely watched for direct WLFI selling, as some early whales have depressed the market price soon after the unlocking. Sun only sent a partial amount of WLFI to the exchange, retaining over 600M unlocked tokens. In total, Sun has received 3B WLFI as an early participant, injecting $75M into World Liberty Fi. Previously, Sun reached an agreement with World Liberty Fi to avoid selling the early token allocation. The token remains a voting token and a potential DeFi collateral. Justin Sun just moved $1M worth of $WLFI to a CEX > He sent 4.9M tokens to HTX > He still holds 600M unlocked tokens, worth $135M Full details ↓ pic.twitter.com/fxHr1bVFYX — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) September 3, 2025 As of September 2, HTX offered a native Flexible Earn limited yield plan for WLFI, offering 20% annualized for deposits. The exchange offers a similar yield for Official Trump (TRUMP). The two tokens offer the highest returns on the exchange, even surpassing stablecoins. That’s why there are suggestions that the WLFI in transit may not be sold, but instead used as collateral. Justin Sun and whales closely monitored as WLFI stabilizes WLFI stabilized around $0.23 after the initial trading shock and whale selling. Big holders are retaining some of the unlocked tokens, and the remaining balance has been locked with a long-term schedule. World Liberty Fi just announced the burn of 47M tokens aimed at boosting the market price. Whales are still closely watched, as the token still accrues listings and is in a process of price discovery. Unlike Official Trump, WLFI tokens may be deliberately curated to avoid an unraveling price. Despite the WLFI publicity, TRUMP remains stagnant just under $9 , a reminder of the unsustainability perception around the celebrity meme token trend. WLFI still shows limited activity WLFI accrued $9.3M on its most active decentralized pair, despite its fully diluted value above $22.9B. Even the top whales have taken relatively small profits. The biggest seller locked in $491K after the initial pump. Compared to previous meme token launches, WLFI activity was subdued. WLFI buyers acquired the tokens as a form of support for TRUMP, and not all were crypto savvy or with trading experience. Another 100 wallets were exposed to malicious smart contracts, potentially losing their WLFI. WLFI started out with peak DEX activity on Uniswap, but saw an immediate slowdown to under $500K in daily volumes. | Source: Dune Analytics The token’s DEX activity also slowed down in the days after the initial launch. Following the initial rush to trade WLFI, Ethereum gas returned to normal prices under 1 gWei. World Liberty Fi announced the launch as a success, showing there were no team sales. Early buyers during discounted presales were also prioritized. Uniswap was the main venue for WLFI trading, as the token now awaits listings and centralized activity. After the initial rush to sell or re-buy lower, WLFI is settling with most of its volumes on Bybit and OKX.

On January 1, 2025, Arkham’s “BlackRock” entity showed 552,550 BTC ($51.16 billion at a spot of $92,595) and 1.07 million ETH ($3.59 billion at $3,354). By September 2, 2025, the same cluster reflected 737,350 BTC ($79.86 billion at $108,304) and 3.78 million ETH ($16.58 billion at $4,389). Over the period, Bitcoin holdings rose +184,800 BTC (+33.44%) while Ether holdings swelled +2.71 million ETH (+252.55%). On a percentage basis, ETH accumulation outpaced BTC by 7.6x, confirming a decisive tilt toward Ethereum by the asset manager. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Thus, in 2025, BlackRock bought Ethereum roughly seven-times faster than Bitcoin, by percentage growth in units held, an elite-scale rotation that strengthens ETH’s institutional adoption narrative. Ethereum dollar value increase Dollar changes tell the same story. Year-to-date, Arkham marks BlackRock’s BTC stack up +$28.69 billion and its ETH stack up +$12.99 billion. Prices did rise, Arkham showed BTC up +16.97% and ETH up +30.84% over the measurement window, but the increase in tokens held far exceeds price appreciation, indicating net purchases rather than mark-to-market alone. Put simply: most of the ETH growth is buying, not just beta. This acceleration has shifted the portfolio mix. At the start of 2025, ETH represented roughly 6.6% of the Arkham-tracked portfolio value ($3.59 billion of $54.83 billion). As of September 2, ETH accounts for about 17.2% ($16.58 billion of $96.44 billion). That +10.6 percentage-point jump in share underscores a strategic reweighting toward Ethereum even as Bitcoin remains the core position. Why it matters for markets is twofold. First, the scale: a +2.71 million ETH increase is meaningful against circulating supply and adds a large, steady bid into ETH liquidity. Second, the signal: institutional rebalancing toward ETH, alongside the maturation of ETH-linked products and flows supports the thesis that blue-chip allocators are broadening beyond a Bitcoin-only framework.

The platform confirmed later that it had restored services and recovered the $27 million worth of digital assets compromised in the incident. The disruption began when Venus identified suspicious activity linked to a phishing scam, which was also flagged by several cybersecurity firms. As reported by Cryptopolitan, blockchain analysts had mentioned irregular transactions in the platform’s Core Pool Comptroller contract, which routes user assets vUSDC and vETH. Venus called for an emergency vote to pause services in order to limit losses and allow security teams to assess whether the exploit compromised Venus’ infrastructure. Although users were unable to withdraw or liquidate positions during the hiatus, the protocol partially restored some functionality later the same day for them to repay debt and supply funds, actions that helped them protect their positions until normal operations could resume. Venus Protocol’s proposed plan for restoration approved Venus Protocol proposed a plan to its community to determine the immediate steps for handling the crisis. The four-stage plan was outlined as follows: partial restoration within five hours, recovery of stolen funds within seven hours, a full security review within 24 hours, and the eventual resumption of all services once checks were completed. Voting ended at around 5 PM UTC, with the community voting “100% to proceed,” the protocol announced. “We are so thankful for your support, and will proceed with the execution,” the team wrote on X. By 9:58 PM UTC, Venus confirmed that the plan had been completed successfully. “Venus Protocol has been fully restored, withdrawals and liquidations resumed. The lost funds have been recovered under Venus’ protection,” the platform said. Update: Venus Protocol has been fully restored (withdrawals and liquidations resumed) as of 9:58PM UTC. ✅ The lost funds have been recovered under Venus' protection. ✅ https://t.co/y2uUwPqmtb — Venus Protocol (@VenusProtocol) September 2, 2025 The exploit stemmed from a phishing incident that tricked a Venus user into approving a malicious transaction, which granted an attacker access to the user’s $27 million worth of digital assets. Phishing scams imitate trusted platforms with near-identical websites made to lure users into entering credentials or approving harmful transactions. According to Cyvers, a blockchain security firm, this particular attack was launched using a domain closely resembling a legitimate site. The small differences are, more often than not unnoticed when victims rush through approvals for token launches or airdrops. Once the user approved the transaction, their wallet was drained. Venus explained that its quick response prevented the attacker from moving the stolen assets out of their wallet. “Fortunately, the suspicious transaction was identified almost immediately, and Venus Protocol was paused. Because of this quick response, the stolen funds remain locked in the attacker’s wallet and this is why Venus is currently paused,” the platform wrote in its emergency update. Venus to publish full post-mortem after analysis Venus Protocol said it would publish a full post-mortem of the incident once investigations are complete. The platform also thanked its users for their trust and patience during the suspension of services. “Hackers have no place on Venus. Thank you for your patience, understanding, and continued trust as we work tirelessly to protect our users, safeguard our community, and uphold the integrity of the Venus Protocol. The community is the foundation of Venus, and we will always act in your best interest,” the team stated. Phishing attacks are still atop of the most common threats in decentralized finance, accounting for almost 20% of the $2.17 billion stolen from crypto services in 2025, according to Chainalysis’ mid-year report .

51068923,https://cryptonews.com/?p=416982,1756900800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51068923.jpeg,Chainalysis 2025 Global Index: India and U.S. Top Crypto Adoption Rankings,https://cryptonews.com/news/chainalysis-2025-global-index-india-and-u-s-top-crypto-adoption-rankings/,"The sixth annual Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index reveals a transformative year for digital assets, with India and the United States leading the world in overall adoption. Unlike earlier years, where crypto activity leaned heavily toward grassroots usage in emerging markets, 2025 showcases a more balanced picture: retail adoption remains strong, but institutional flows are now a critical driver of growth. The methodology remains rigorous. Chainalysis evaluates 151 countries using four sub-indices: on-chain value received by centralized services; retail-sized value received by those services; on-chain activity in DeFi protocols; and institutional-sized transfers. Each component is weighted by GDP per capita on a purchasing-power-parity basis, ensuring the rankings reflect economic context rather than raw transaction volume. This comprehensive approach highlights not just where crypto is popular, but where it is meaningfully integrated into financial systems. Shifting Methodology for a Maturing Market In 2025, Chainalysis introduced important methodological changes. First, the retail DeFi sub-index was removed, as internal data showed that while DeFi transaction volumes remain significant, grassroots engagement there is far smaller than on centralized platforms. By excluding retail DeFi as a standalone category, the index avoids overrepresenting a relatively niche behavior. Second, an institutional activity sub-index was added, reflecting the surge of large-scale transactions driven by traditional finance. Transfers above $1 million are now captured in the rankings, providing a clearer view of how hedge funds, custodians, ETFs, and banks are shaping the landscape. This shift is timely: with multiple U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs approved and greater regulatory clarity across key jurisdictions, institutions are no longer testing the waters—they are actively participating. Together, these changes create a more accurate lens. The index continues to focus on grassroots adoption but now incorporates top-down institutional flows, showing how deeply crypto has penetrated mainstream finance. India, the U.S., and the Rise of APAC The 2025 Index crowns India as the number one country for crypto adoption, ranking first across all four sub-indices. India’s dominance reflects both widespread grassroots use and growing integration with financial services. The United States ranks second overall, bolstered by strong institutional participation and the legitimizing effect of regulatory progress. Beyond these leaders, Pakistan (3rd), Vietnam (4th), and Brazil (5th) round out the top five, reflecting a blend of remittance-driven retail usage and rising institutional interest. Notably, APAC has emerged as the fastest-growing region, with on-chain activity rising 69% year-over-year to $2.36 trillion. Latin America follows with 63% growth, showing the region’s reliance on stablecoins for remittances and inflation hedging. When adjusting for population size, Eastern Europe stands out. Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia top the population-adjusted index, reflecting extraordinary levels of activity relative to population. Factors such as war, inflation, and banking restrictions have accelerated crypto’s role as both a hedge and a cross-border transaction tool. Stablecoins and Bitcoin Dominate On-Ramps Stablecoins remain at the heart of global crypto adoption. Between June 2024 and June 2025, USDT processed more than $1 trillion per month, while USDC peaked at $3.29 trillion. New entrants like EURC and PYUSD are also growing rapidly, with EURC volumes surging nearly 89% month-over-month as MiCA-compliant euro stablecoins gain traction in Europe. At the same time, Bitcoin continues to serve as the primary fiat on-ramp, accounting for over $4.6 trillion in inflows—more than double any other category. The United States leads by volume, with South Korea and the European Union trailing behind. These flows confirm that while altcoins and DeFi tokens are important, Bitcoin and stablecoins remain the central gateways into crypto. A Truly Global Wave Perhaps the most striking finding of the 2025 Index is that adoption is no longer confined to one region or income level. High-income countries are accelerating institutional rails, while lower- and middle-income nations continue to rely on crypto for remittances, dollar access, and mobile-first finance. This synchronicity suggests crypto adoption is now broad-based and durable, not episodic. The challenges ahead remain clear: fragmented regulations, fragile infrastructure in low-income countries, and the need for secure on-ramps. Yet the trajectory is undeniable. With India and the United States setting the pace, and the Global South demonstrating how crypto solves real-world problems, the 2025 Global Adoption Index shows one truth: crypto is no longer an experiment. It is becoming a core feature of the global financial system.

Built on the OP Stack, the London-based project is designed to let organizations run blockchain applications without exposing sensitive information, combining what it calls “programmable privacy” with scalability, performance, and regulatory alignment. The OP Stack is the open-source development stack that powers the Optimism blockchain. “Leveraging the OP Stack allows us to integrate into a robust and widely adopted Layer 2 ecosystem,” Applied Blockchain founder and CEO Adi Ben-Ari, said in the statement. A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain . Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems or separate blockchains built on top of layer 1s. The Superchain, an ecosystem of more than 30 Layer 2 networks, includes Coinbase’s Base, OP Mainnet, Kraken’s Ink, Sony’s Soneium, Uniswap’s Unichain, and World Chain. Silent Data is the first to introduce a privacy wrapper, enabling sensitive workloads to be executed on-chain without losing transparency or composability. The project recently launched with a library of privacy-enabled applications and is already being tested across several industries.

Bitcoin dominance has slipped from 61% to 57% in same period, indicating a bullish outlook for altcoins, coinciding with a slew of crypto treasury companies adoption altcoin accumulation strategies. Ether (ETH), up 1.1% since midnight UTC, and solana (SOL), 0.43% higher, have notched gains of 21% and 27.5%, respectively, over the 30-day period. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broad market, has gained 0.46% since midnight and is 1.7% higher than 24 hours ago, with all members rising over the latter period. Nick Forster, founder of on-chain options platform Derive.xyz, said in an email that ETH has a 44% chance of hitting $6,000 before the end of 2025. “Institutional adoption of ETH is building serious momentum. Last week alone, the number of ETH held by ETFs rose by 250K — from 6.5 million to 6.74 million,"" Forster wrote. Derivatives Positioning The total open interest across all perpetual instruments increased overnight to $114 billion, data from Laevitas show. A liquidations heatmap for the BTC-USDT pair on Binance shows that bitcoin is trading between two significant liquidation clusters. Above the current price, a $90 million cluster of liquidations sits around the $112,200 mark. To the downside, the largest cluster is valued at $76.6 million, located around $110,000. According to Deribit options data, the 24-hour BTC put-call volume is 26.4K contracts, with calls accounting for 51.6% of the total. The contract with the highest volume is the $108K strike price put expiring Sept. 26. That's followed by the call at a strike price of $114K expiring on the same day. The funding rate heatmap on Coinglass remains positive for most assets, indicating a general bullish sentiment. The one exception is TRX, which has a negative funding rate, reflecting a -10.2% APR. Token Talk By Oliver Knight Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, a key metric when assessing whether the crypto market is in ""altcoin season"" has ticked down another notch to around 58%, having been above 61% just 30 days ago. The drop-off demonstrates a change in trader behavior: Typically altcoins perform poorly when BTC enters a downtrend, this time, however, many have held their value while some have outperformed the market's largest asset. Bitcoin is down by 2.91% in the past 30 days while the likes of ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) are up by 21% and 27.5%, respectively. While the gains have been driven by the adoption of several altcoins in corporate treasuries, they can also be attributed to a recalibration of the entire market. During BTC's rise to a $124,000 record high last month, the narrative was solely focused on bitcoin and it's perceived correlation with the well-performing tech sector in equities. It's worth noting that in previous cycles bitcoin dominance slumped all the way down to 39%, indicating that the altcoin resurgence still has some way to go. However, as liquidity flowed into BTC, several altcoins fell to record lows against bitcoin, leading to a number being ""oversold"" on technical indicators like relative strength index (RSI).",Markets|Markets|Crypto Markets Today|market analysis|Derivatives|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-03 12:00:00

Bybit EU’s card supports spending in bitcoin, USDC and other cryptocurrencies and allows users to link the card to Apple Pay and Google Pay or withdraw cash at ATMs, according to a press release, Wednesday. The exchange says the card is designed under Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCAR) regulatory framework. To mark the rollout, Bybit is offering new customers a 20% cashback on purchases in September, provided they deposit at least $100 in crypto. The promotion also includes a 5 euro bonus for the first transaction and referral rewards. Beyond the launch campaign, the card features rebates on subscriptions like Netflix and Spotify, seasonal travel and lifestyle rewards, and no annual fees. Bybit says more than two million of its cards are already in circulation globally. Expanding into Europe positions the exchange to tap into a market where regulators have begun to set clearer rules for crypto finance. “There are months where decades happen, and the digital asset industry is having such a moment — thanks to increasing regulatory clarity and growing institutional as well as grassroots adoption,” said Mazurka Zeng, CEO of Bybit EU.",Finance|Bybit|Europe|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING|SPONSORED|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-03 12:00:00

The round was led by Red Dot Capital Partners with Nyca, Wing VC, DCG and Cerca Partners among investors also participating, extending the March Series A funding round to $40 million. Founded in New York and Tel Aviv, Utila provides a digital asset operations platform tailored for enterprises working with stablecoins. The system handles payments, treasury and trading functions, while offering compliance and continuity features for businesses. The firm's customers include payment providers, neobanks and asset managers, reflecting the growing use of dollar-pegged tokens in global finance. Stablecoins garnered attention this year from outside of crypto circles as the killer application of blockchain technology. The sector, currently a $270 billion market, have the potential to disrupt cross-border payments as a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional financial rails, proponents say. Major banks and global retailers like Walmart, Amazon are reportedly exploring using stablecoins. Payments firm Stripe acquiring stablecoin startup Bridge and USDC stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO were the ""bitcoin ETF moments"" for stablecoin adoption, Bentzi Rabi, co-founder and CEO of Utila said in an interview with CoinDesk. Utila did not actively seek new funding, but received inbound offers as stablecoin demand spiked, Rabi said. Since March, the firm has doubled its customer base and now processes over $15 billion in monthly transactions. With most of its original Series A capital still unused, Utila opted to extend the round to accelerate its expansion into fast-growing markets such as Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific, where stablecoins are increasingly central to financial infrastructure.

The Pepe Price Rally is gaining attention as the meme coin steadies near support, with the potential for a 15% rise. Meanwhile, the ETH Price Forecast hinges on whether Ethereum can hold the $4,000 mark while network activity sets new highs. Beyond these price debates, BlockDAG (BDG) is showing why infrastructure matters more than charts. With the Academy, Explorer, X1 Miner app, and Testnet already operational, the project is proving its system in real-time. Backed by $395 million raised and 25.7 billion coins sold, BlockDAG presents one of the Best Crypto investments in 2025 cases by focusing on tools and adoption before listing. Leave Patterns Behind, Watch the Infrastructure Build Price setups can spark short bursts, but lasting value comes from real products. BlockDAG is proving this by focusing on delivery instead of pure speculation. Already, it has released the BlockDAG Academy, which allows people to gain on-chain learning through simple, structured courses. This step emphasizes the focus on education and practical application. The BlockDAG Explorer is also live, offering clear and real-time tracking of its multi-branch DAG system. Alongside this, more than 3 million people use the X1 Miner app daily, demonstrating that activity is strong even before its launch. The Testnet rollout now puts the full system into action, providing users with a comprehensive framework ahead of listing. These steps support clear price goals. Levels like $1, $5, or even $10 are not random hopes. They are based on real tools that people already use. The system also supports dApps, smart contracts, staking, and future cross-chain links. Strong numbers match the progress. BlockDAG has raised $395 million, sold over 25.7 billion coins, and is now in Batch 30 at $0.03 per coin, with a limited-time offer of $0.0013. Early backers from Batch 1 already see a 2,900% surge. With 20 exchange listings confirmed, trading begins on day one, highlighting why many consider BlockDAG the best crypto investment in 2025. PEPE Price Rally: Setup Points Toward 15% Breakout Fresh momentum is centering on Pepe (PEPE) as it holds a key support level near 0.00001162. Analysts note that this area forms a consolidation phase, which may prepare for a Pepe Price Rally toward 0.00001533 and higher. Such a move represents a possible 15% breakout, giving chart followers a reason to pay closer attention. The repeated buying at every dip signals confidence among participants. This pattern of strong support has helped Pepe maintain stability even during wider market swings. Many traders view this as a positive sign, as it indicates that buyers are prepared to step in whenever the coin reaches this support level. If the current level is sustained, the growth path appears clearer. A push above resistance levels may open the door to extended gains. For observers watching meme coins, this rally may indicate that Pepe is not just a fad but a coin capable of forming structured price patterns that attract interest. ETH Price Forecast Holds Around $4,000 Support Ethereum is testing critical ground near $4,000 while its network activity climbs to record levels. On a 14-day average, more than 1.7 million daily transactions are processed, the highest since 2021. At the same time, active addresses are at three-year highs, showing strong use across the network. Additionally, volumes on decentralized exchanges are increasing, and the total value locked in Ethereum protocols is rising steadily. Upgrades like Dencun and Pectra have also kept transaction fees low, even with heavier traffic. These conditions show that network use is stronger than ever. The current ETH Price Forecast depends on whether Ethereum can protect the $4,000 mark. If it holds, analysts expect a rebound driven by actual usage rather than speculation alone. A drop below this point may invite short-term weakness, but holding above keeps the path open for growth. With on-chain signals this strong, Ethereum remains one of the most crucial projects to track closely. Wrap Up Short-term speculation may cause sudden price fluctuations, but lasting strength depends on actual delivery. Pepe may be poised for a breakout, and Ethereum exhibits record activity; yet, both still depend on how the market reacts. BlockDAG is different. It is already rolling out tools, growing its community, and proving that its system works in practice. The presale has already raised $395 million, with Batch 30 priced at $0.03 and a limited-time offer of $0.0013 still available. Early entries from Batch 1 are already enjoying a 2,900% surge, proving why this window is too good to ignore. With these results, BlockDAG is not just about what might happen in the future. It is already building and showing progress, making it one of the best crypto investment in 2025.

Approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs and clearer institutional rules legitimized crypto in mainstream finance, encouraging both retail and institutional adoption. This momentum ensured the US stood out as the region’s anchor. America’s Crypto Dominance Explained In fact, Chainalysis’ latest breakdown revealed that the country secured second place across multiple dimensions such as centralized services, DeFi usage, and institutional activity in the 12 months ending June 2025. Stats shared by Chainalysis revealed that the United States continues to dominate global fiat-to-crypto onramps. The country processed more than $4.2 trillion in volume during the same period. This figure is over four times higher than any other country. On the other hand, South Korea ranked second with just above $1 trillion, while the European Union trailed with slightly under $500 billion. Assets Purchased With Fiat. Source: Chainalysis Stablecoin volumes remain tremendous, but USDC’s trajectory indicates how much US policy is shaping the market. Monthly volumes ranged from $1.24 trillion to $3.29 trillion, and peaked in late 2024, amid surging demand. Unlike USDT’s global dominance, USDC’s rise has been linked to US-based institutional rails and regulated corridors. APAC Leaves North America Behind Outpacing North America’s gains, Asia-Pacific (APAC) recorded the strongest surge in on-chain crypto activity, as it posted a 69% annual increase in value received. The region’s transaction volume expanded from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion, owing to the widespread participation across key markets such as India, Vietnam, and Pakistan. Next up was Latin America, which achieved a 63% increase in crypto adoption, thanks to expanding interest across both retail and institutional segments. Sub-Saharan Africa wasn’t far behind, and grew 52% as digital assets continued serving as lifelines for remittances and daily spending. Together, these regions showcase how the “Global South” is emerging as a crucial frontier for crypto growth, propelled by functional, real-world use rather than pure investment motives.

Markets reacted fast. CleanCore’s share price fell about 60%, sliding from roughly $6.85 to near $2.69 after the arrangement was disclosed. That drop reflected investor worries about dilution, execution risk, and how public markets would view a corporate play centered on a meme token. Trading in the warrants and the conversion mechanics were flagged by analysts as key details investors will watch closely. Leadership And Governance Reports have disclosed a noteworthy lineup of people and advisors. Alex Spiro, who has been publicly identified as an attorney for Elon Musk, is named to serve as Chairman of the Board at CleanCore. Timothy Stebbing, Director at the Dogecoin Foundation and CTO of House of Doge, will join CleanCore’s board, while Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, is slated to act as CleanCore’s Chief Investment Officer.

His post emphasized the possibility of significant future gains, using technical indicators to outline possible price levels. The chart he published drew from Fibonacci levels, long-term cycles, and structural formations that have historically guided XRP’s movements. Amonyx noted that XRP may be positioned for an extended bullish cycle, with long-term projections suggesting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. His analysis highlighted how the token has historically followed repetitive structures, with each cycle providing clues for future direction. You have NO IDEA what’s about to hit this market… This chart is screaming a once-in-a-lifetime move. #XRP pic.twitter.com/Z62nz9tpYA — Amonyx (@amonbuy) September 2, 2025 Chart Structure and Key Levels The chart shared by Amonyx covers XRP’s price history stretching back to 2013. It identifies long-term patterns through an Elliott Wave and Fibonacci-based framework. The labeling shows cycles marked by points A, B, C, and D, outlining corrective phases followed by expansions. The most recent cycle appears to set the stage for another major rally, with Fibonacci projections indicating the possibility of a steep move upward. XRP formed Wave A after its previous all-time high of $3.36 in January 2018. Following this move, it experienced a share correction, reaching the low point of Wave B in 2020. It reached the peak of Wave C in 2021. However, it could not break out significantly due to price suppression caused by the Ripple lawsuit . The asset hit Wave D bottom in April after reaching its lowest point of 2025. Following this decline, XRP entered Wave E, the final wave, and began ascending. Wave E has already pushed the asset to a new all-time high of $3.65 , and Amonyx’s chart suggests that this climb is not over.

One notable figure on the chart is the projected gain of more than 6,700%. This estimate is anchored in past moves where XRP surged thousands of percentage points in a relatively short period. The closest target for XRP currently sits at $4.47, and this level could serve as support as it targets higher levels. Subsequent targets are $8.59 (Fib. 2.618), $17.65, $27.57, $56.66, $62.48, $94.63, and $181.86 (Fib. 3.618). With XRP’s price struggling at around $2.83, these targets suggest that a major rebound might be on the horizon, and the asset’s long-term trajectory is bullish .

According to CNBC, 600 US economists said they support Lisa Cook's independence and the Fed's institutional independence. “Sound economic policy requires a credible monetary policy institution, and a credible monetary policy institution requires the independence of the Fed. In this context, we support Lisa Cook and the institutional independence of the Fed. Trump's claim is based on unproven allegations. We believe this is an attempt to undermine the Fed's independence. Central bank independence has been a cornerstone of the U.S. economy's vitality for decades.

Global crypto exchange and Web3 AI powerhouse BingX announced a major promotional campaign to celebrate the spot listing of World Liberty Financial’s governance token, $WLFI. The $ WLFI Listing Carnival offers users the chance to secure a share of 900K $WLFI through a mix of guaranteed rewards, trading incentives, and referral bonuses. $WLFI Arrives on BingX The event marks the first major exchange listing for $WLFI, a decentralized finance token that gained international attention for its high-profile backers – notably President Donald Trump – and US-focused mission. The US President and his sons, Donald Jr, Eric, and Barron are among the co-founders of World Liberty Financial . $WLFI began as a crypto presale and a governance token, and originally it was not tradable. However, a July 16 vote saw 99.94% of $WLFI holders give a thumbs up to the token being made tradable. $WLFI aims to reshape the DeFi sector by pioneering USD-aligned stablecoin frameworks and applications. The initiative already launched $USD1, a stablecoin, and followed that up by making its $WLFI governance token tradable. According to its release plan, just 20% of $WLFI’s total supply is unlocked at launch , reinforcing long-term tokenomics and supply discipline. The project has also attracted headlines of support from Trump, positioning $WLFI as part of broader US efforts to dominate blockchain innovation and strengthen the role of the dollar in global digital finance. World Liberty Financial continues to promote Trump’s involvement in its initiatives. 900K $WLFI Up for Grabs Through the $WLFI Listing Carnival, BingX users can: Reserve $WLFI to guarantee a share of the reward pool Deposit $WLFI and hit trading volume milestones to unlock additional prizes Invite friends to participate for referral-based rewards and exclusive airdrops. The structure ensures that newcomers and seasoned traders alike can take part, with incentives designed to maximize adoption during the token’s early exchange debut. BingX: Fast-Mover in Token Listings Vivien Lin, Chief Product Officer at BingX, said the promotion underscores the platform’s commitment to delivering early access to the most sought-after digital assets. ‘With $WLFI gaining traction as one of the most talked-about token launches this year, BingX is committed to ensuring our users can engage with it early and meaningfully. Through this promotion, we’re combining timely access with generous rewards, continuing our mission to bring users closer to emerging opportunities in crypto trading.’ – Vivien Lin, BingX The campaign continues BingX’s recent trend of spotlighting emerging blockchain projects while strengthening its global reputation as a first-mover exchange. BingX’s Upward Trajectory Founded in 2018, BingX has grown into a leading platform serving more than 20M users worldwide. The exchange combines spot and derivatives trading with AI-powered services and a popular copy-trading system tailored for retail and professional traders alike. BingX’s global brand presence grew in 2024 when it became the official crypto exchange partner of Chelsea Football Club, signaling a bold step into mainstream sports sponsorship. And BingX’s $WLFI Listing Carnival is the latest in a series of initiatives highlighting BingX’s dual strategy of innovation and accessibility, ensuring its users stay on the front lines of digital finance. Head to BingX today to earn rewards in its $WLFI Listing Carnival. Remember, this isn’t financial advice. Be sure to always do your own research before making any investment.

Market trends hint at growing potential for some well-known names, alongside a lesser-known token trading below $1. Investors are now looking past the obvious, focusing on the next possible movers. Certain picks could surprise, with momentum signaling a possible shift in short-term demand. Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView DOGE has drifted between $0.20 and $0.23 in the past few days, slipping 2.15% over the week. Bulls and bears keep canceling each other out near the 10-day and 100-day average at $0.21, showing a pause after last month’s quick rebound. The wider view still leans positive. The coin is up 7.10% in a month and 6.35% in six months, hinting that buyers are slowly reclaiming ground. Momentum sits just above the middle line, while a high stochastic reading signals that traders are active but not yet exhausted. In short, DOGE is neither overbought nor oversold. The road map is clear. A push through $0.25 could unlock a fast 12% jump toward the next ceiling at $0.28. Above that, the chart opens for an extra 10% climb. Failure to clear $0.25, however, may drag the price back to the $0.19 floor. A break under $0.19 would expose $0.16, roughly 15% below current trade. For now, side-ways churn favors a slow grind higher, with risk tightly boxed in. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.005 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe trades between $0.0000090706 and $0.0000106446 after a shaky week. The token slipped 3.12% in 7 days and 6.62% in a month, yet it still shows a 42.98% jump over 6 months. Both 10-day and 100-day averages hover near $0.00000978, keeping price action tight. The chart leans slightly bullish. RSI at 54.51 shows balanced momentum, while a stout stochastic of 83.37 flags active buying. MACD stays positive. Clearing $0.0000116413 could unlock a run to $0.0000132153, offering roughly 18% then 34% upside from the mid-range. Support rests at $0.0000084933 and deeper at $0.0000069193, about 14% and 30% below current trade. Holding above the twin averages keeps the six-month uptrend alive. A bounce from support makes a 10-15% push toward first resistance plausible; slipping below it could drive a return to the lower band. Conclusion Amid the 2025 surge, DOGE and PEPE stay solid. XYZVerse, the first all-sport memecoin, targets 20,000% gain with a strong community, GameFi plans, and a live presale.

51124167,https://cryptonews.com/?p=417703,1756901445,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51124167.jpeg,Trump-Linked World Liberty Financial Begins WLFI Burn Campaign After 31% Price Drop,https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-linked-world-liberty-financial-begins-wlfi-burn-campaign-after-price-drop/,"World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the Trump-affiliated crypto venture, has initiated a token burn just days after its public debut, as the team looks to curb early volatility and revive sagging market confidence. Key Takeaways: WLFI burned 47 million tokens, or 0.19% of its circulating supply, in response to a sharp price drop after launch. The team plans a broader buyback-and-burn program funded by protocol fees, pending a community vote. Critics warn the move may offer short-term relief but highlights risks tied to celebrity-driven crypto launches. According to onchain data from Lookonchain , the project burned 47 million WLFI tokens on Wednesday, sending them to a verified burn address. The move comes amid a steep 31% decline in the token’s value since its launch on Monday, when it briefly traded at $0.331 before falling to just over $0.23. WLFI Burn Targets 0.19% of Circulating Supply as 25% of Tokens Unlocked The burn represents 0.19% of WLFI’s circulating supply, which currently stands at 24.66 billion tokens, roughly a quarter of the project’s original 100 billion supply, according to CoinMarketCap. Token burns are a common response to downward price pressure, reducing supply in hopes of increasing the value of remaining tokens. In this case, the WLFI team is using protocol-owned liquidity fees to fund a broader buyback-and-burn plan, which is still awaiting a community vote. In the proposal released Tuesday, the team argued that removing tokens held by “participants not committed to WLFI’s long-term growth” would benefit loyal holders by increasing their relative stake. While the burn may help offset some of the selling pressure from early investors cashing out, critics say it highlights the fragility of meme-fueled launches tied to public figures. The burn campaign may offer short-term relief, but it also raises long-term questions. As WLFI tries to pivot from hype to utility, market watchers will be looking for substance beyond token mechanics. WLFI( @worldlibertyfi ) burned 47M $WLFI ($11.34M) 8 hours ago. https://t.co/6RFU5aD933 pic.twitter.com/Jd0M3qgvY0 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 3, 2025 The official vote on the burn proposal is still pending, but initial community feedback has been largely supportive. The WLFI launch followed a July vote by investors to make WLFI tradable. Until then, the tokens functioned only as governance instruments, giving holders the right to weigh in on code changes and business adjustments. Early investors are permitted to sell up to 20% of their holdings, the company said. That first 20% unlock, estimated at 3 billion to 5 billion tokens sold at presale prices of $0.015 and $0.05, triggered a wave of selling . Trump Family’s Crypto Fortune Hits $6B as WLFI Token Debuts on Exchanges The Trump family’s wealth saw a sharp increase of up to $6 billion on Monday following the public launch of World Liberty Financial’s WLFI token. The debut allowed open-market trading for the first time, with over $1 billion in volume recorded within the first hour across major exchanges. Prices hovered between $0.24 and $0.30, aligning with prior futures market activity. The Trump family holds just under 25% of the total WLFI supply, though their tokens remain locked and cannot yet be sold. Despite that, the market debut gave the holdings a clear valuation, making WLFI the family’s most valuable asset according to the Wall Street Journal. World Liberty Financial was launched during Trump’s presidential campaign, with his sons listed as co-founders and Trump himself as “co-founder emeritus.” Since its inception, the platform has expanded into stablecoins and decentralized finance, aiming to bring retail users into crypto markets.

KuCoin claims the three-way partnership is meant to develop blockchain infrastructure, advance digital asset applications, and promote digital economic growth nationwide. “Vietnam is emerging as one of the world’s most dynamic hubs for blockchain and digital assets, fueled by a young, creative, and tech-savvy community ready to pioneer global innovations,” Damen Chen, Vice President and Head of Group Commercial at KuCoin told the press. KuCoin taps Vietnamese crypto groups for market expansion The Southeast Asian country’s pivot from an unknown legal stance on crypto to a framework proposal has opened doors for KuCoin to enter its jurisdiction. At Da Nang Finance and Tech Week earlier this year, Chen talked about the trading platform’s compliance measures like real-time order book data, regular proof-of-reserves reporting, and independent audits to combat fake volumes. The trading platform aims to be part of the first crypto businesses to operate under Vietnam’s digital technology law that was approved by the government in June. The law, slated to take effect in January 2026, could help the country achieve its 150,000 crypto startup economy by 2035, as proposed by the state-sponsored “Make in Vietnam” initiative. KuCoin, VBA to improve Vietnam’s AML compliance In Vietnam, KuCoin is working through its investment arms, KuCoin Labs and KuCoin Ventures, to fund early-stage blockchain projects and, with universities, to develop local talent. The VBA, established under Decision No. 343/QD-BNV by the Ministry of Home Affairs in April 2022, is Vietnam’s first official organization dedicated to blockchain technology. Its mission includes research, standardization, evaluation, and the promotion of blockchain adoption across sectors. Together with 1Matrix, the VBA is helping the country strengthen its position in the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) rankings, the global body that sets standards against money laundering and terrorism financing. Vietnam is currently on the FATF “ gray list ” because of its lack of anti-money laundering laws, particularly in regulating virtual assets. On July 25, the association announced its new name: Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Assets Association will replace its previous title, the Vietnam Blockchain Association. At its General Meeting, the VBA approved the addition of eight new executive committee members, increasing its leadership body to 28. Chairman Phan Đức Trung was appointed alongside three vice chairpersons: Nguyễn Vân Hiền, Nguyễn Trọng Khang, and Phan Chiến Thắng. Danang launches crypto payment project KuCoin’s MoU comes against the backdrop of the People’s Committee of Danang approving Basal Pay, the nation’s first crypto asset conversion project. Operated within the city’s controlled fintech sandbox to test blockchain asset service provisions under Resolution No. 57/NQ-TW. Basal Pay was developed by AlphaTrue Solutions JSC, a VBA member, in compliance with the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule. According to the National Statistics Office, the city welcomed nearly 11 million tourist arrivals this year, which pushed service revenues to an estimated VND18 trillion ($682.7 million).

Raises $55 Million to Expand Bitcoin Treasury,https://thecoinrise.com/cimg-inc-raises-55-million-to-expand-bitcoin-treasury/,"Digital health and sales development company CIMG Inc. has raised $55 million in a share sale to strengthen its crypto reserves, becoming the latest firm this week to expand into Bitcoin. The company announced Tuesday that it issued 220 million common shares in exchange for 500 BTC as part of its broader financial management strategy. Commitment to Long-Term BTC Holdings CIMG said the shares were sold at $0.25 each, and the acquired BTC is currently valued at $55.5 million, according to CoinMarketCap. The company’s board further explained that the purchase is part of a long-term Bitcoin holding plan aimed at creating a stable foundation of value for investors. Chairman and CEO Wang Jianshuang noted that CIMG’s digital asset strategy would not be confined solely to Bitcoin. “The Company intends to continue to increase its digital asset reserves and pursue collaborations across AI and crypto ecosystems, such as Merlin Chain,” he said. Despite the move, CIMG’s stock closed Tuesday’s trading session on the Nasdaq at $0.25, down 3.53% for the day, according to Google Finance. Still, executives see Bitcoin reserves as a way to strengthen the company’s financial positioning while aligning with the growing trend of corporate BTC adoption. Broader Momentum Among Bitcoin Treasury Firms CIMG’s announcement comes amid significant activity from other major corporate Bitcoin holders. MicroStrategy recently acquired 4,048 BTC for $449.3 million between August 25 and September 2. The purchase was made at an average price of $110,981 per BTC, funded through proceeds from four at-the-market equity offerings. MicroStrategy remains the world’s largest public BTC holder, with a total of 636,505 BTC. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet also advanced its Bitcoin strategy after securing shareholder approval to restructure its capital base, enabling billions in potential fundraising for future BTC purchases. Metaplanet has already accumulated 20,000 BTC , ranking it as the sixth-largest public Bitcoin treasury, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The post CIMG Inc.

The upgrade will also enhance the KYC flow by embedding it directly into the smart contract, along with an interesting feature. “While the native Pi KYC solution continues to verify Pioneers, the protocol will allow the KYC authority to be assigned to other trusted entities in the future. This offers a more distributed, community-driven KYC process while maintaining compliance at the protocol level.” ETP Product on the Nordic Market Adding further fuel to the flame, the Pi Network team continued with the novel feature publications, sharing the news that the native token is now available on the Spotlight Stock Market, which is headquartered in Stockholm and offers exposure to 140 companies and 66 ETPs.

Global Event Sponsor As announced yesterday on the social media platform X, Pi Network will be a gold sponsor at Token 2049, the world’s largest crypto event, which will be held in Singapore this year. Part of the sponsor line-up includes industry heavyweights Circle, Coinbase, and Bitget, along with numerous other institutions. This will not only allow the community to meet with the team but also be a part of an event featuring thousands of companies and hundreds of exhibitors, showcasing the most recent developments in the crypto ecosystem. More Unlocks As per tradition, there will be another wave of Pi token unlocks today, around 5.3 million, which will be valued at roughly $1.8M. The highest amount that will be dispersed this month will be on Saturday, the 6th, which will see over 12 million tokens being released, with an estimated price of over $4M. Still, this is far from the largest-ever unlock, which happened on July 4th, with over 19 million tokens issued in circulation. Overall, for the next 30 days, we will see over 153 million in token unlocks.

For an astonishing third consecutive year, India crypto adoption has topped the charts, securing the number one spot in the 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, as reported by Cointelegraph. This remarkable achievement highlights a powerful and sustained embrace of digital assets across the nation, positioning India as a true leader in the evolving digital economy. What Propels India’s Phenomenal Crypto Adoption? The latest report confirms India’s leading position, not as a fleeting trend, but as a testament to deep-rooted, grassroots engagement with cryptocurrencies. The Chainalysis index meticulously ranks countries based on their genuine, everyday use of digital currencies, utilizing comprehensive blockchain and web traffic data. This focus on “grassroots” adoption means the index captures how ordinary people, rather than just large institutions, are integrating crypto into their lives. Several factors contribute to this sustained dominance: Digital-First Mindset: India boasts a burgeoning young population, widespread smartphone penetration, and increasingly affordable internet access. This combination creates a fertile ground for digital innovation and rapid adoption of new technologies. Quest for Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies offer new avenues for financial participation, particularly for individuals in regions with limited access to traditional banking services. They provide alternative ways to save, invest, and transact. Vibrant Innovation Hub: India’s thriving tech ecosystem fosters a culture of innovation. Numerous startups are actively exploring blockchain and Web3 technologies, developing localized solutions that resonate with the Indian user base. Remittance Flows: Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being explored for cross-border remittances, offering potentially faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional channels, which is particularly relevant for India’s large diaspora. This widespread engagement is a key differentiator, demonstrating that ordinary Indians are actively integrating crypto into their financial lives, whether for investments, remittances, or simply exploring new digital frontiers. How Does India’s Crypto Adoption Compare Globally? While India holds the coveted top spot, the global landscape is dynamic and diverse. The United States, for instance, made a significant leap, climbing two places to secure the second position. This rise is largely attributed to the introduction of spot Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and the development of a more favorable, albeit still evolving, regulatory environment, which has attracted institutional interest and mainstream investors. In contrast, South Korea, another major economic power with a strong tech presence, found itself ranked 15th. This comparison reveals varying levels of mainstream acceptance and regulatory approaches across different nations. The Chainalysis index’s emphasis on grassroots adoption helps explain these differences, showing that while some countries might have significant institutional activity, everyday use by the general public can vary greatly. The diverse rankings reflect a global mosaic of regulatory clarity, technological infrastructure, and cultural attitudes towards digital assets. India’s consistent performance suggests a unique blend of these factors driving its sustained lead in India crypto adoption , proving that a bottom-up approach can be incredibly powerful. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for India Crypto Adoption? Despite its leading position, the path for India crypto adoption is not without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a significant area of focus. While discussions are ongoing within government bodies, a clear, comprehensive, and supportive framework could further bolster confidence, attract more investment, and facilitate greater institutional participation. Key Challenges to Navigate: Regulatory Uncertainty: The absence of a definitive legal framework can create hesitation for both individual users and businesses looking to fully commit to the crypto space. User Education and Awareness: Ensuring widespread understanding of crypto’s inherent risks, as well as its benefits, is crucial for sustainable and responsible growth. Combating misinformation is also vital. Infrastructure Scaling: As adoption continues to surge, ensuring robust, secure, and scalable technological infrastructure becomes paramount to handle increased transaction volumes and user demand. However, these challenges also present immense opportunities. A well-defined and forward-looking regulatory approach could unlock even greater innovation and investment, solidifying India’s role as a global crypto hub. Furthermore, leveraging blockchain technology for various sectors—from supply chain management and land records to digital identity and financial services—could offer significant economic and social benefits. India has the potential to not only lead in adoption but also in shaping the future of decentralized technologies globally. India’s third consecutive year at the top of the global crypto adoption index is a monumental achievement, showcasing the nation’s proactive engagement with digital assets. This grassroots movement, driven by a digitally savvy population, a quest for financial inclusion, and a vibrant innovation ecosystem, positions India as a crucial and influential player in the evolving global crypto narrative. As the crypto landscape continues to mature and global policies take shape, India’s journey will undoubtedly offer valuable lessons and inspire future trends for the rest of the world. The nation’s sustained leadership underscores a powerful message: the future of finance is increasingly decentralized, and India is at its forefront. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

As of Wednesday, the 30-year bond yield reached 3.286%, its highest point in over twenty years. The 20-year yield hit 2.695%, a level last seen in 1999. The 10-year benchmark bond is sitting at 1.633%, marking its highest level since 2008, while the 40-year yield rose to 3.506%, almost 90 basis points up since January. What’s driving this brutal surge? The Bank of Japan is trying to cool things down. But three years of consumer prices staying above the 2% inflation target have made that job nearly impossible. The central bank has started to raise short-term policy rates and cut back its bond-buying, but it’s not working fast enough. The real policy rate in Japan is still buried at -2.6%, meaning inflation-adjusted interest rates remain far below zero. Foreign investors unload bonds while BOJ tries to maintain stability Foreign demand for Japanese bonds is falling fast. Japan Securities Dealers Association data showed that total foreign bond purchases dropped 6% in July, down to 7.66 trillion yen compared to April. Many overseas investors are backing away from bonds and pouring into Japanese equities instead, chasing big gains in the stock market. The appeal of long-term bonds is weakening fast, especially when inflation is still hanging around and the BOJ hasn’t made its next big move clear. At the same time, domestic politics is adding more noise. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s coalition got slapped in the July upper-house elections, as opposition parties calling for consumption tax cuts made gains. Ishiba, speaking Tuesday, told reporters he has “no intention at all of clinging” to his position. If he steps down, Japan could face multi-party gridlock and more pressure to boost spending, which will keep bond yields climbing. Barclays analysts say the 30-year bond market is already pricing in tax cuts worth 1-2 percentage points, and warned that if deeper cuts are pushed through, the pressure on yields could grow worse. Capital starts flowing back home but full repatriation not expected Some domestic investors are returning. David Roberts, head of fixed income at Nedgroup Investments, said his firm has already pulled money from the U.S. and the UK and bought Japanese bonds, for the first time in decades. “This is the first time since I started managing funds in the 1990s I have bought Japanese bonds,” Roberts told CNBC. But the enthusiasm is selective. Rong Ren Goh, fixed income portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments, said most investors are still focusing on shorter-duration bonds, while staying cautious on long-term ones. “Investors [will be] in no major hurry to aggressively leg into duration even as valuations appear more compelling,” he said. Barclays’ Kadota pointed out that inflows back into Japan won’t be serious until the BOJ ends its rate-hiking cycle . Right now, the central bank is still in tightening mode, so buyers are waiting it out. Banks still have plenty of yen parked at the BOJ that they could use to buy bonds before even thinking of dumping U.S. assets. Meanwhile, Japan’s government is asking for more money. A lot more. Budget requests for the fiscal year starting April 2026 have hit a record ¥122.4 trillion ($822 billion). That’s up from ¥117.6 trillion the previous year. The Defense Ministry alone wants ¥8.8 trillion, as the country tries to raise military spending to 2% of GDP by 2027. On top of that, ¥32.4 trillion is now needed just to finance existing debt, the highest ever recorded. That’s what rising yields do, they make it way more expensive to keep the system running. As usual, the Finance Ministry will trim the numbers before finalizing the budget. Last year, they cut the initial ¥117.6 trillion request down to ¥115.2 trillion. But with interest payments climbing, political noise increasing, and investors ditching long-dated bonds, the pressure is already baked into the system.

For millions of PayPal and Venmo users, a significant opportunity has just emerged, bridging both realms: early access to Perplexity’s highly anticipated Comet AI browser and a complimentary year of Perplexity Pro . This isn’t just another tech giveaway; it’s a strategic alliance poised to redefine how users interact with information and manage their digital subscriptions, directly impacting their financial and informational ecosystems. What is the Buzz Around the Comet AI Browser ? Invites to Perplexity’s new AI-powered web browser, Comet, have quickly become a coveted digital asset. Initially, access was limited to the AI firm’s high-tier Max users and a select group of invitees. Now, a broader pathway to this innovative tool has opened. Launched in July, Comet is designed to revolutionize online browsing with an integrated AI assistant, providing AI-generated summaries of search results, comprehensive product comparisons, and a suite of other advanced features. This intelligent browser aims to streamline information discovery and decision-making, offering a more efficient and personalized web experience. The demand for Comet underscores a growing appetite for AI-native browsing solutions that move beyond traditional search engines. Unlocking Your Free Perplexity Pro Subscription Beyond early access to Comet, PayPal’s announcement includes an even more substantial benefit: a free year’s subscription to Perplexity’s premium service, Perplexity Pro . Valued at $200 per year, this premium offering enhances the AI experience with additional capabilities, faster processing, and potentially more extensive data access. For users eager to dive deep into AI-powered research and content generation, this free subscription represents significant value. To claim this offer, PayPal and Venmo users simply need to access it directly within their respective apps. It’s important to note that the offer is limited to one invite per PayPal account and is not available to existing Perplexity Pro customers, ensuring new users can experience the full benefits without prior commitment. The Strategic Alliance: Why PayPal Venmo Matters While co-marketing partnerships are common, this collaboration between PayPal and Perplexity warrants close attention due to its scale and strategic implications. PayPal’s vast reach, with millions of U.S. customers and plans for global expansion, positions Comet and Perplexity Pro directly in front of a massive user base. For PayPal, this partnership offers a compelling incentive to draw users to its platforms, leveraging the allure of cutting-edge AI tools. It also strategically highlights PayPal’s newer subscriptions hub feature, a centralized destination where users can view and manage their recurring subscriptions with greater ease. Alongside this, PayPal is running a promotion offering $50 to customers who link and pay for at least three subscriptions through its service, further incentivizing engagement with its platform. Meanwhile, Perplexity gains unprecedented exposure at a critical juncture in the AI landscape. As AI agents compete for user attention and AI-powered browsers challenge the dominance of established players like Chrome, this partnership provides a significant competitive edge. The influx of new users, introduced through a trusted financial platform like PayPal, could also lead to a substantial increase in paid users, as individuals may either continue their subscriptions after the free year or actively choose to stay subscribed due to the perceived value. Navigating AI Subscriptions with Ease The integration of the Perplexity Pro offer within PayPal’s ecosystem is a testament to the growing importance of subscription management in our digital lives. PayPal’s subscriptions hub feature provides a streamlined way for users to track and control their various recurring payments, including the increasing number of AI subscriptions . This centralization offers greater simplicity and convenience, empowering users to navigate their financial lives with more clarity. As more services, especially in the AI sector, transition to subscription models, tools that simplify management become invaluable. This initiative by PayPal not only offers a premium AI service but also reinforces its commitment to providing comprehensive financial management solutions. The Future of Free AI Tools and Digital Payments This partnership between PayPal, Venmo, and Perplexity signals a significant trend towards the integration of advanced AI capabilities into everyday digital platforms. By offering free AI tools like a year of Perplexity Pro and early access to Comet, these companies are democratizing access to powerful technology, potentially accelerating mainstream adoption of AI browsers and intelligent assistants. This move could reshape user expectations for web interaction, making AI-powered features a standard rather than a luxury. Diego Scotti, general manager of the Consumer Group at PayPal, emphasized this vision, stating, “Our partnership with Perplexity gives PayPal and Venmo customers early access to one of the most anticipated AI browsers and dynamic subscriptions. It’s exciting to deliver offers and tools that our customers request most, meeting their needs and helping them navigate their financial lives with greater simplicity, added convenience, and even more rewards.” The offer is valid through the end of 2025 and will roll out to international markets later in the month, after its initial U.S. launch, underscoring the global ambition of this collaboration. The alliance between PayPal, Venmo, and Perplexity marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of digital finance and artificial intelligence. By offering exclusive access to the Comet AI browser and a complimentary year of Perplexity Pro, this partnership delivers substantial value to millions of users. It strategically benefits both companies, enhancing user engagement for PayPal and providing massive exposure for Perplexity in the competitive AI market. As AI tools become more integral to our daily digital interactions, initiatives like this pave the way for a future where advanced technology is not only accessible but seamlessly integrated into our financial and informational routines.

The company's revenue and profitability remain volatile as it shifts away from Bitcoin mining, with meaningful returns expected only after 2025 as new data centers come online. Recent IPO financing and strong liquidity provide a solid runway, but current valuation suggests further downside until fundamentals stabilize and growth initiatives mature. Technical indicators and peer comparisons support a neutral outlook, with consolidation likely around $2 per share until catalysts or operational progress emerge. Introduction & Investment Thesis I am rating Bit Digital as a Hold Inc. (NASDAQ: BTBT ) driven by the Bit Digital shift to Ethereum and High-performance computing. The company has quadrupled its Ethereum stake to 121,075 ETH so far. While this remains a leverage point for the company, I am rating this stock as a hold because as soon as the shift announcement was made, its price immediately returned to cross the S&P 500 . However, after the hype, the stock returned to trading below the S&P 500, with a current difference of about 180%. The company’s price return has not been doing well YTD and has been volatile, which, to me it means that there is potential for upside from the shift, but not now. Seeking alpha After the shift to ETH, the break-even point is estimated to be reached within a 1-year timeframe, which means that investors have to wait until around this time to see meaningful returns. On the other hand, the company is still expanding its revenue base, which includes investment in HPC . I believe that the sale of 27,043,747 shares of its subsidiary, which raises approximately $145.1 million , supports my view that the fundamentals are still in the early stage of generating income, hence my hold rating. Let’s get to the depth of this below. Company Brief Bit Digital Inc. operates digital infrastructure and asset sectors. The company and its subsidiaries are investing in Ethereum staking and high-performance computing (HPC) data centers to provide colocation and hosting services along with cloud-based GPU solutions. These services are also tailored to host machine learning applications and AI. Bit Digital is also engaged in practices such as positioning itself as an intersection of blockchain technology and advanced computing. The company was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in New York. On The Journey But Not Yet To The Destination I will first draw your attention to the 18% upside Bit Digital experienced after the shift and provide you with this picture. This shows that the upside was driven by Ethereum’s potential. I believe that this upside was driven by the Ethereum price prediction of around $2,400 by 2030. THEBIT Journal This upward projection is driven by a myriad of activities in the US investment market, as top asset managers , including Ark Invest, BlackRock and Grayscale, are applying for Ethereum ETFs. This expansion of the Ethereum network is projected to lead to upside potential above. However, since Bit Digital is still in the early stages of recording returns from its stake, the Ethereum staking calculator indicates an annual return rate of around 4% in one year. This makes the shift to Ethereum not a short-term investment but a long-term one. Blocknative calculator From this observation, I believe that the stock will remain within its current price for a while before the shift starts to record sizable revenues from compounding stake YoY, as demonstrated above. The company is still planning to close its bitcoin mining operations to transition to an Ethereum-focused strategy. This suggests that the transition phase is still ongoing and, therefore, the full benefits of shifting to Ethereum have yet to be fully realized. BTBT The company is considering Ethereum’s versatility over Bitcoin due to its ability to earn rewards such as those offered by various blockchain s and DeFi applications, as well as its programmability and long-term value. However, while Ethereum has an optimistic upside potential from 2025 through 2030, Bit Digital’s early investment in this digital coin is based on a long-term outlook rather than a short-term one. On the other hand, I am also examining the IPO , which saw Bit Digital retaining 74.3% of WhiteFiber shares after raising $145.1 million . The company is funding its HPC through IPO financing, which, in my view it’s a sustainable expansion financing. I believe so because this move in my view balances capital infusion with strategic control. That is so because it is exploring long term growth without overleveraging or sacrificing core assets. By transferring its entire HPC business into WhiteFiber and securing 24 months transition service agreement, I think the company preserves operational stability and scalability because the funding will finance growth and the 74% retained stake ensures governance continuity. The structure avoids debt burdens hence enabling the company to seek long term growth without long term financial obligations. Nevertheless, this investment is also still in the early stages because the company’s MTL-3 and MTL-2 data centers are expected to commence operations by the fourth quarter of 2026, and NC-1 is scheduled for early 2026. In this shift to data centers, Bit Digital enters the category of Bitcoin mining companies, exploring how to repurpose their GPU-rich centers into Data centers. There is an opportunity in the data center market to generate revenues from the overall $7 trillion in capital outlays by 2030, making it a lucrative market for Bit Digital to enter while it’s still in its infant stages. The global demand for data centers is yet to triple by 2030, which could possibly lead to a deficit. There is also a rise in AI workloads, which are expected to drive approximately 70% of data center growth, accounting for $5 trillion of the $7 trillion overall data center capital. This is driven by a 2.7x increase in demand for data centers from 82 in 2025 to 219 in 2030, which reveals that the sector is rapidly growing and prepares Bit Digital to capture the market. McKinsey Therefore, both Shift to Ethereum and investing in HPC are yet to provide a stable and consistent cash flow though they are promising initiatives. I believe this is why the stock is trailing the S&P 500. Therefore, as Ethereum compounding rewards continue to consolidate, along with the commencement of MTL-3 and MTL-2 operations in Q4’2025. For this reason I think a hold rating is justified Financials In terms of financials, Bit Digital’s annual revenues increased significantly between 2023 and 2024, primarily due to gains from the appreciation of Bitcoin’s value. Except for 2022, when Bitcoin was selling at an average of $20,000, resulting in a negative revenue growth of 66.39%. From FY2023 to date, the revenue increase has been in excess of double-digits. However, since the company started shifting from bitcoin mining to Ethereum, the quarterly revenue YoY has been declining from 266.45 in Q1’2024 to an average of negative 15% revenue growth YoY. Stock Analysis This indicates that the shift has not yet started generating income due as the reorganization is still in the early stage. The expectation of revenue generation is expected around Q4’2025, which is why I am holding this stock. Regarding profitability, a good reflection of volatility is seen in companies’ quarterly net profit records. The company exhibits inconsistency at this phase, which is why you should hold this stock until the net income generation stabilizes. Since 2022, when bitcoin began a steep upside move, when the revenues have consistently been rising as noted above, the company has been recording net loss except for 2024, through TTM recording net profits and net loss sequentially. Stock Analysis This volatile net income reveals that volatility due to shift results in inconsistencies at the reorganization stage. This can also be seen in the change of gross profit margin which has been very turbulent. Seeking Alpha All this volatility is a reflection of the company’s ongoing reorganization which is expected in the short term and likely to improve if the plans being executed become fruitful. Overall, when I look at the HPC plan , it is a promising venture. This is because it is targeting a booming $581 billion AI and HPC market by 2035. IDTechEx Research Given the upcoming data centres like MTL-2, MTL-3 and NC-1 are poised to go live, this plan aligns with the rising demand for exascale computing and Ethereum native services. However, as I mentioned earlier, the company is currently undergoing a major reorganization. For example, for the first time it entered into a debt arrangement with the Royal Bank of Canada for approximately $43.8 million in debt financing. The debt proceeds will finance MTL-2 and MTL-1 data centers. These pointers show that the company is currently in a state that can be described as a restructuring phase. I believe this company may see potential upside in mid-2027, after recording revenue of $172.04 million in FY2026, when it is expected to have settled its shift plans, focusing more on profitability. Most importantly, despite its new loan facility, the company is still in a firm financial footing given its strong liquidity of $181.2 million in cash and ST investments. This compared to its total debt of $43.8 million translates to a net cash of $137.4 million. Assuming its trailing total operating expenses of $91.1 million, the net cash has a runway of about 1.51 which translates to a runway of more than 1 and a half years which I think is solid and takes us past the 2026 FY where a substantial revenue is expected to start streaming in from ongoing plans. Valuation & Technical View Taking the P/S metric and comparing Bit Digitals to that of its competitors, Similarweb Ltd. (NYSE: SMWB ) and Docebo Inc. (NASDAQ: DCBO ), the valuation shows my early concern. The P/S ratio of BTBT is 4.62x, and this has gone down from 7.21x after the company announced its shift. This indicates that the hype created by the shift led to a 7.21x return after which there has been a market correction. Given that BTBT is still ahead of its competitors, SMWB’s P/S ratio of 3.20x and DCBO’s P/S ratio of 4.06x indicate that BTBT has high growth expectations. Seeking Alpha When I take this further and look at the BTBT’s trailing revenue growth of 13.30% YoY compared to DCBO’s and SMWB’s 15.11% and 16.06% respectively, I can see that the current market correction was justified and this stock could see another slight decline to take the P/S to between 3x-4x where it has been in the past before the hype. I am simply saying the market correction is not yet over and it could stop within the region I have mentioned. Given that the ongoing initiatives are more of a speculative play now, looking at the technical indicators can solidify the outlook of this stock. Having said that, I will look at both the MACD and the RSI for a comprehensive conclusion. The MACD is currently facing downwards with the MACD below the signal line an indication of that the current downtrend is still on. However, looking at the RSI which has been trending downwards signaling the ongoing correction appears to be flattening. Seeking Alpha To me this shows a potential neutral plateauing of this stock in the near future which aligns with my previous outlook of the P/S. I expect this stock to fall to about $2 which is its strong support and enter a consolidation phase which is already being hinted by the RSI being at around 40 which is a sign of a neutral outlook and by it showing signs of flattening. I believe when the stock falls to this stage there will by minimal movement unless another catalysts perhaps news pops up and triggers a rigorous activity which could also correct in the short term. Until the current initiatives pays off, I don’t see any notable support for an immediate and sustainable uptrend and this can be confirmed by the weak momentum. As such, I recommend holding this stock. Seeking Alpha Risks Advancing technology - Blockchain and AI increased risks. Bit Digital’s HPC investment from miners using high-speed HPCs. Regulatory risks – The cryptocurrency taxes and rules surrounding anti-money laundering may impact Bit Digital, directly impacting how it will continue to stake digital assets. Cryptocurrency volatility – The fluctuation in Ethereum prices may impact Bit Digital’s revenue generation, potentially delaying its gains from the current projects. Conclusion I am reiterating my hold rating on BTBT, driven by the ongoing shift activities that are still underway, as the company transforms into a complete Ethereum staking and data center service provider. The revenue returns for this shift have not been fully received, which currently places the company as a Hold.",BTBT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-03 13:38:41

The agreement supports the nation’s broader National Blockchain Strategy (2025–2030) and reflects KuCoin’s continued focus on emerging markets. The partnership is designed to facilitate the growth of Vietnam’s digital economy by leveraging KuCoin’s global technical expertise, 1Matrix’s on-the-ground infrastructure capabilities, and VBA’s policy advocacy and standardization efforts. Key initiatives include the development of pilot trading platforms, digital payment systems, e-identity solutions, and tools for risk management aligned with international standards. Under the terms of the MoU: KuCoin will lead the transfer of advanced blockchain technologies and global best practices. 1Matrix will handle implementation and infrastructure management within Vietnam. VBA will drive policy support, community engagement, and the formation of technical standards. This tripartite framework is intended to create a transparent, secure, and sustainable digital financial ecosystem, while also enabling Vietnamese startups to access international markets and foster broader economic inclusion. “Vietnam is emerging as one of the world’s most dynamic hubs for blockchain and digital assets, fueled by a young, creative, and tech-savvy community ready to pioneer global innovations,” said Damen Chen, Vice President and Head of Group Commercial at KuCoin. “Through this strategic partnership with VBA and 1Matrix, KuCoin is excited to co-develop blockchain technology and commit to long-term collaboration in building community trust, advancing digital asset education, and nurturing Vietnam’s blockchain startup ecosystem. Our shared goal is to create a transparent, secure, and internationally competitive market, elevating Vietnam as a pivotal landmark on the global blockchain map.” KuCoin’s emphasis on compliance, transparency, and user protection remains central to its operations. During his remarks at the Da Nang Finance and Tech Week, Chen highlighted the exchange’s real-time order book transparency, ongoing proof-of-reserves reporting, and independent audits, measures designed to combat inflated volumes and reinforce trust. KuCoin was also among the first major exchanges to implement mandatory KYC and AML procedures, and it continues to participate in regulatory dialogues, sandbox environments, and policy formulation efforts worldwide. In Vietnam, KuCoin Labs and KuCoin Ventures are actively investing in early-stage blockchain projects and collaborating with universities and developer communities to support talent development and adoption of technologies such as tokenization and DeFi. Phan Duc Trung, Chairman of both VBA and 1Matrix, underscored the significance of the collaboration, stating that it will help boost Vietnam’s digital asset sector, support international integration, and contribute to building a transparent and sustainable financial future. The Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Assets Association (VBA) was officially established under Decision No. 343/QD-BNV by the Ministry of Home Affairs in April 2022. It functions as Vietnam’s first national organization focused on blockchain advocacy, standardization, and education. 1Matrix, a member of VBA, plays a key role in the development of blockchain infrastructure in the country. It leads the creation of the Vietnam Blockchain Multi-Chain Service Network (VBSN), a platform that supports layer-1 blockchain deployment, digital identity, and data governance for public-sector and enterprise use. The MoU lays the groundwork for a new operational model in Vietnam’s blockchain industry and reinforces the country’s ambition to become a leader in digital transformation on the global stage.

The ranking highlights how regulatory momentum and the rapid uptake of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have accelerated mainstream access to crypto in the US. India, however, retained the top spot for the third year running, cementing its role as the world’s biggest market for digital assets. The report, published on Wednesday, also revealed that the Asia-Pacific region is now the fastest-growing hub for crypto, while Eastern Europe showed the highest adoption on a per-capita basis. US jumps to second with $54.5 billion ETF inflows The US rose from fourth in last year’s Chainalysis report to second place, with much of the growth tied to regulatory clarity and institutional products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $54.5 billion in inflows since their launch in January 2024, according to Farside Investors . The bulk of these investments occurred between June and July 2025, highlighting how traditional financial institutions and retail investors are embracing crypto through regulated channels. The momentum did not stop with Bitcoin. Investment advisers and hedge funds began accumulating Ether ETFs in the second quarter of 2025. Data reported by Bloomberg showed advisers purchasing $1.3 billion in spot Ether ETFs, while hedge funds added $687 million. These developments demonstrate how clearer rules in the US have given large corporates and institutional players confidence to engage with digital assets without the same reputational and compliance concerns as before. India leads global adoption, pushing APAC growth to $2.36 trillion India maintained its position as the world’s largest crypto adopter, ranking first across all four Chainalysis subindexes. A tech-savvy population and widespread use of crypto for remittances played a significant role in its dominance. The report noted that grassroots adoption continues in markets where digital assets provide practical solutions, such as payments, remittances, and savings in inflation-prone economies. As a result, the Asia-Pacific region saw crypto value received increase by 69% year-on-year to $2.36 trillion, led by India, Pakistan, and Vietnam. The Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand also secured spots in the top 20. This growth underscores how APAC’s diverse markets are using crypto to address both individual and institutional financial needs. Latin America also showed resilience, posting a 10% increase in growth, with Brazil and Argentina ranked among the top 20. Eastern Europe ranks highest on per-capita adoption While overall value places India and the US at the top, Eastern Europe emerged as a leader when adjusted for population size. Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia took the top three positions for per-capita adoption, with several others in the region, including Latvia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Estonia, and Belarus, also ranking in the top 20. Economic instability, low trust in banking systems, and high levels of technical literacy have made crypto an attractive option across Eastern Europe. For many, digital assets represent a way to preserve wealth, bypass banking restrictions, and facilitate cross-border transactions. Bitcoin inflows surpass $4.6 trillion globally The Chainalysis findings also highlighted Bitcoin’s role as the leading entry point into crypto. It accounted for more than $4.6 trillion in fiat inflows during the period reviewed. Layer 1 tokens, excluding Bitcoin and Ether, were the second-largest category, with more than $4 trillion in inflows. Stablecoins followed with nearly $1 trillion, while memecoins attracted approximately $250 billion. The US was the largest contributor, generating $4.2 trillion in on-ramp volume, while South Korea followed with $1 trillion. In the UK and the EU, Bitcoin maintained a particularly strong presence, with nearly half of all fiat purchases directed toward it.

51127970,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/blockchain-and-provably-fair-dice-game,1756907138,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/51127970.jpeg,Blockchain And Provably Fair Dice Game,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/09/blockchain-and-provably-fair-dice-game,"While many of us are fans of online gambling, there are those casting doubt over its fairness. There are players out there who can't be convinced that the games are not rigged. Traditional casinos have no other than to tell people to trust them, while the years remain wary of their honesty. Knowing this, it is a good thing that we have blockchain these days. It aided casinos in creating a system in which dice games and other casino titles and their outcomes can be checked by anyone. The system blockchain uses is simple: you don't have to take the casino's word for each outcome, see it for yourself. Thanks to blockchain technology we today have what's called provably fair games. Thanks to it, the players see dice games and other casino titles with different eyes. It is just one of many crypto innovations and it has altered the way we approach online gambling and see the most popular casino games. Online Gambling Trust Issues For all of you unaware, before blockchain many dice games have worked over central servers. The casinos generated random numbers, and told the player whether he lost or won. For players, the games were appealing, yet not being able to know whether the results were fair was frustrating. When the numbers were against you it was hard to trust the casino. The worst part was that later on the players found out that some online casinos were scamming them. Even when outcomes were fair, the lack of proof was still a thorn in players' palms. The online casinos of the early days had issues with transparency and it hurt their business. It was all promises and no facts. Enter Blockchain & Provably Fair Games Thanks to the provably fair method of creating games on blockchain, players these days can check out every outcome. Thanks to cryptography and the way each outcome is formed, there is no way to alter the result once it is out. This is good to know when you love to play Bitcoin casino dice games. Here's how it works: Server Seed: The casino starts each round by creating a random string of letters and numbers. The full seed is not visible to the player, but what you do get is a hash of it. You need to look at it like it's your fingerprint, one of a kind. There is no way to guess the original seed based on your hash, but you can see if the result was real later on. Client Seed: Each player, in each round, is in charge of providing one random seed to each outcome. Due to this, a player has an input in the roll too. Nonce: It is a number that changes with every bet. To blockchain and online casinos, this number is the key for proof of work, it is semi random, and always used only once. These three things together are what creates the final dice roll. When the round is over the online casino of your choice reveals the server seed. The hash that was shown to you can be used even before the bet, and you can see if it matches. In 99% of times it does, and that's how you know the outcomes were not rigged. Provably far games are what made outlets such as Bitcasino stand out among the crowd. Why Blockchain Strengthens This System Provably fair system is not existent without blockchain. Instead, it is powered by it. The blockchain technology is what makes it bulletproof. It all starts with transparency. Everything is recorded on the blockchain, so there are no secrets. Every outcome can be traced back to its origin. What's even better than transparency is immutability. It means that once the data is written on the blockchain it can't be changed. There is no editing of results. With blockchain and online gambling things only get better. As if transparency and immutability weren't enough, blockchain is also decentralized. Dice games of old couldn't be run without a central server. With blockchain everything is handled by smart contracts starting with the roll, through the bet, and the final payout. Lastly, when you play a dice game created on blockchain you do not have to trust the casino at all. Each process on blockchain is recorded and it runs on an open code, available for anyone's inspection. Smart Contacts & Dice Games In essence, smart contracts are programs. They can run on blockchain systems such as Ethereum for example. What they do best is following the rules. What is written is executed. Once you deploy a smart contract, there's no going back, unless you stated so, and designed it with susceptibility to updates. As far as dice games of, this is what smart contracts do for them: Accepting bets. Using a random number source that can be verified later on. Providing a win/loss decision. Create payments in case of a win. When you know that the entire process runs without a middleman you need to state that you love blockchain and probably fair games it creates. The money you could win or lose is tied to the smart contract and the moment you win, you get an instant payout. With a system designed this way, chances of fraud are almost non existent. Blockchain & Randomness Blockchain is not quite similar to your standard random number generator. It is deterministic to a fault. To give you an outcome, each of its nodes need to be on the same page regarding the result. It can't generate a random number on the chain, as the focus of randomness will not be identical across all computers. Yet, this is not something that should worry the players all that much. When you play the dice games, the following oracles and commit reveal schemes are used: Oracles- The oracles are external services tied to the blockchain that are in charge of creating randomness. The most famous example of an oracle is called Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function). It gives the random numbers to the blockchain when you play and they can be verified later on. Commit reveal- A simple method where a smart contract is made that the player and the contract itself are going to commit to seeds that are hidden. When both reveal their seeds the randomness is born out of the mix of the two. Thanks to these methods one can play dice games on a blockchain without having to worry about a single party having control. Why Players Care About Provably Fair Games The answer is simple, confidence. Players want to trust the game provider whether it's a casino or a third party. Being able to check out every outcome creates this trust. People who avoided casinos due to fear of a scam can now play freely without interruptions. If you were a fan of cryptocurrencies earlier, then the games created on blockchain suit your mindset. Those who love digital currencies also love the control, transparency, and independence that provably fair games provide. Shared values always attract each other. Also, there is a social side to it too. There are players who simply have an urge to verify each outcome. When they do, they tend to share the results, and discuss them in online gambling communities. This does wonders for provably fair gaming as the good word about it gets spread around by genuine users. What Lies Ahead? The best lies ahead. The blockchain dice games are merely just taking off. In the future we can expect them to get more sophisticated, faster, easier to play, and more creative. It is expected that on chain betting will get more practical in the future with solutions such as rollups, and Layer 2. Also, in no time we might start seeing cross chain dice games that are shared across different blockchains. As crypto has shown us so far, the options in some case might just be limitless. While we look forward to what future brings our way, the present is not all too shabby as the main focus of blockchain dice games remains the fact they are provably fair. As long as players get a fair roll, there's not much more to give them but that. Thanks to blockchain, fair games are already here, and with dice you won't judge an outcome ever more.

Traditional online casinos often left players skeptical about the randomness of outcomes. Enter blockchain technology, which has dramatically transformed the landscape of online gambling through provably fair systems. The Mechanics of Provably Fair Systems Blockchain technology supports a transparent mechanism where players and casinos can verify the fairness of each game in real-time. This system crucially depends on three components: Server Seed: Casinos generate a random seed and provide a hash of it to the player, ensuring each game's outcome is unique and tamper-proof. Client Seed: Players contribute their own seed, influencing the game's result, which adds another layer of fairness and engagement. Nonce: This is a one-time number that changes with each bet, securing the integrity of the game further. These elements work together to ensure each roll of the dice is fair and can be independently verified by players, enhancing trust in the platform. For instance, in platforms like Bitcoin casino dice games, players can see the transparency and fairness firsthand. Benefits of Blockchain in Dice Games Blockchain introduces several revolutionary advantages to online gambling: Transparency: Each transaction and game outcome is recorded on a public ledger, ensuring that every player can verify the results independently. Immutability: Once data is entered into the blockchain, it cannot be altered, thus securing the integrity of each game and preventing fraud. Decentralization: Traditional dice games relied on a central server, but blockchain operates on a decentralized network, eliminating any single point of failure and reducing the risk of manipulation. Smart contracts automate processes and guarantee that the terms of the game are carried out without bias. The decentralized nature of blockchain means that these contracts are executed without any need for intermediary oversight. Why Blockchain Matters in Gambling The incorruptible nature of blockchain ensures that each game on platforms like Bitcasino is fair, which is crucial for gaining player trust. With smart contracts, every aspect of the game, from betting to payout, is regulated automatically, providing a seamless and transparent gaming experience. Future Prospects As blockchain technology evolves, we can anticipate more advanced features in online dice games. Innovations such as rollups and Layer 2 solutions promise to enhance scalability and efficiency, paving the way for more complex and secure gaming experiences. Moreover, the potential for cross-chain games could expand the ecosystem, providing more diversity and connectivity among different blockchain platforms. Blockchain has not only improved the security and fairness of online dice games but also significantly boosted player confidence. As the technology continues to advance, the future of gambling looks more promising and reliable, fulfilling the core promise of provably fair gaming.

In a Truth Social post shared early Wednesday while China hosted its largest military parade in years, Trump claimed the three leaders were “conspiring against the United States of America.” “Whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and ‘blood’ that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader,” Trump posted . “Many Americans died in China’s quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice! May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.” Trump watches as Putin and Kim join Xi in Beijing Xi stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Putin during the parade, where they were seen chatting and laughing, as fighter jets roared across Beijing’s skies, and tanks, missile carriers, autonomous vehicles all rolled through the square. Soldiers goose-stepped past, and the spectacle ended with doves and balloons released into the air. China’s parade, described as the “80th anniversary of the country’s victory against Japanese aggression and the world’s victory against fascism,” showed off a range of new, domestically-built military tech. Kim made a surprise visit to the event and brought along his daughter, Kim Ju Ae, who stood behind him during key moments. Cheong Seong-Chang, vice president of South Korea’s Sejong Institute, said her presence proved her growing role, saying, “Kim Ju Ae continues to receive the protocol treatment equivalent to North Korea’s ‘second-in-command’ even when abroad.” Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi, greeted her directly. Her appearance followed rising diplomatic movement between Pyongyang, Beijing, and Moscow. Kim and Putin had already been in Tianjin for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit days earlier. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not stay for the parade but appeared in a widely shared video laughing with Xi and Putin during the summit’s informal sidelines. South Korea’s president rejected the invitation entirely, while eight Southeast Asian leaders showed up. Western officials were nearly absent. China pushes military strength while eyeing global leverage Xi didn’t directly mention Taiwan, but he stressed the military’s job in defending national sovereignty and unity. Meanwhile, parade commentators highlighted China’s efforts in cybersecurity and information control as part of its national defense push. While the United States was left out of the diplomatic spotlight, China’s reach in Asia appeared to be deepening. Neil Thomas, a China politics fellow at the Asia Society, said China’s ability to draw Putin and Kim to Beijing underlined its expanding influence in regional diplomacy. He added that this comes at a time when it’s not clear whether the United States even wants trade and investment agreements with Asia anymore. Despite Trump’s post, Thomas said the presence of Putin and Kim was unlikely to impact the U.S.-China trade talks, which had been improving after a rocky spring filled with steep tariffs. Both countries agreed to pause most duties through mid-November, and a possible Trump-Xi meeting has been floated. The drama didn’t end there. North Korea has reportedly deployed troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. China has refused to label Russia’s invasion as such and instead pushed for peace talks. The United States has accused Beijing of backing Russia’s military efforts, a charge that China denies. Xi’s parade speech was not the only time he’s used this platform to showcase China’s long-term power goals. In 2019, he stood in the same spot to commemorate 70 years of Communist Party rule, declaring, “no force can stop the Chinese people.” Xi, who became president in 2013, scrapped presidential term limits in 2018, tightening his grip on the nation’s leadership. Putin previously attended a similar Chinese parade in 2015, which marked 70 years since the end of World War II. That event drew major world leaders like then–South Korean President Park Geun-hye, representatives from France and the United States, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

That future is now here, thanks to Ondo Finance. Ondo Finance, in collaboration with the Ondo Foundation, has just unveiled a groundbreaking initiative: the launch of over 100 tokenized stocks and ETFs . This significant move is set to redefine how investors interact with traditional financial markets, initially deploying on the Ethereum blockchain. Plans are already in motion to expand this offering to Solana and BNB Chain, making these innovative assets even more accessible. By the end of the year, this offering is expected to surge to approximately 1,000 assets, truly expanding the horizon for global investors, as reported by The Block. What Exactly Are Tokenized Stocks and ETFs, and Why Do They Matter? Tokenized stocks and ETFs are digital representations of traditional securities on a blockchain. Think of them as a digital twin of a share in a company or a unit of an exchange-traded fund. These tokens allow investors to gain exposure to traditional assets while leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology. Here’s why they are so important: Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy a fraction of a stock or ETF, making high-value assets more accessible. Increased Liquidity: Blockchain platforms can facilitate 24/7 trading, potentially enhancing market liquidity. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering greater transparency. Global Access: They break down geographical barriers, allowing more people worldwide to participate in global markets. This innovation democratizes access to financial instruments that were once out of reach for many, especially those in emerging markets. Who Can Access These Innovative Tokenized Stocks and ETFs? Ondo Finance is rolling out its tokenized stocks and ETFs to eligible investors across various regions. Specifically, individuals in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, South America, and Africa can trade these tokens on Ondo Global Markets. This broad geographical reach underscores Ondo Finance’s commitment to global financial inclusion. Moreover, accessibility is further enhanced through strategic partnerships. Bitcoin World previously reported that the popular self-custody wallet, Trust Wallet, is partnering with Ondo Finance to support its tokenized offerings. This collaboration means that investors can manage their newly acquired digital assets directly within a familiar and secure wallet environment, simplifying the investment process significantly. What Benefits Do Tokenized Stocks and ETFs Bring to Investors? The introduction of tokenized stocks and ETFs offers a compelling suite of advantages for the modern investor. Beyond the aforementioned fractional ownership and global accessibility, these digital assets bring several other benefits: Lower Entry Barriers: By enabling fractional ownership, tokenization allows investors with smaller capital to access premium stocks and diversified ETFs. Enhanced Trading Hours: Unlike traditional markets with fixed hours, blockchain-based assets can potentially be traded 24/7, offering greater flexibility. Reduced Intermediaries: The blockchain infrastructure can streamline processes, potentially reducing the number of intermediaries and associated fees. Portfolio Diversification: Investors can easily diversify their portfolios by gaining exposure to a wider range of global assets without the complexities of traditional cross-border investing. These benefits collectively contribute to a more efficient, inclusive, and dynamic investment landscape. Navigating the Future of Tokenized Stocks and ETFs: Challenges and Opportunities While the potential of tokenized stocks and ETFs is immense, it is also important to consider the evolving landscape. The regulatory environment for digital assets is still developing globally, and navigating these frameworks will be crucial for sustained growth. However, the innovation brought forth by Ondo Finance represents a significant step towards bridging traditional finance with the decentralized world. The planned expansion to Solana and BNB Chain, along with the target of 1,000 assets by year-end, demonstrates a clear vision for scalability and broader adoption. This forward momentum indicates a strong belief in the transformative power of tokenized assets to reshape global investment strategies. Conclusion: A New Era for Global Investment Ondo Finance’s launch of tokenized stocks and ETFs marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. By offering unparalleled access, flexibility, and transparency, these digital assets are set to empower a new generation of investors across the globe.

Anderson shared this view in a recent episode of his Bullrunners show. Notably, he compared XRP’s recent price action to Amazon’s stock history. He emphasized that AMZN traded sideways for about 3,800 days—more than 10 years—starting from the year 2000. Anderson pointed out that Amazon’s stock finally broke out in a massive cup-and-handle pattern in 2010. Following the breakout, AMZN entered a consolidation phase before skyrocketing from $5 to $200—a staggering 3,900% rally. He noted this explosive run unfolded over 15 years, from 2010 to 2025. XRP to Hit $100 - $200Interestingly, he suggested that XRP has mirrored AMZN’s performance over the years and that the third-biggest token is currently in a similar consolidation phase. Like AMZN did before its massive rally, Anderson claims XRP is using its previous high as support. With XRP trading around $2.75 at the time of the analysis, he emphasized that the token is not far from the point — $5 — where AMZN began its rally. As XRP continues to mirror Amazon’s performance, Anderson speculated that the token could theoretically reach $100-$200, just like Amazon. However, he noted that it would take years for XRP to achieve this milestone. Notably, the analyst believes many long-term holders, particularly those within the age of 30, could become wealthy if XRP climbs to a minimum target of $100. He assumes that by the time XRP reaches $100, these young investors will have turned 45 to 50 years old. He estimates that if XRP reaches $100, a holding of 10,000 tokens would be valued at $1 million. XRP Short-Term Target While expecting the forecast to take several years to materialize, Anderson predicted that XRP could soar to around $5 to $30 in the current cycle. After this cycle’s rally, Anderson anticipates a major crash, which would eventually pave the way for “true adoption.” By 2030 and beyond, he expects to see strong price appreciation that will ultimately propel XRP’s price to the $100-$200 level. According to him, XRP could attain the ambitious $100-$200 target faster than expected, especially if it sees massive liquidity – similar to what happened before the 2017 surge. Meanwhile, the $100 price target is not new to XRP. As reported earlier, community commentators such as Linda Jonas and Moonshilla have predicted XRP’s spike to a lofty target. In the meantime, the price of XRP is up 0.94% over the past 24 hours as it trades at $2.83.

Based on this, he predicted that the meme coin could soon break above the psychological $0.00002 level, which could pave the way for higher prices. Shiba Inu Confirms Descending Channel Breakout In an X post, Carter said that the Shiba Inu descending channel breakout has been confirmed. He noted that the meme coin has successfully broken above the descending channel and is currently consolidating just below the MA 50 on the daily timeframe. Based on this, the analyst indicated that SHIB could record a rally of over 100%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Set For 650% Expansion To $0.00009 ATH If This Happens This came as Carter stated that a move above this MA could trigger an explosive rise toward targets at $0.00001400, $0.00001750, $0.00002050, and $0.00002500. Meanwhile, his accompanying chart showed that Shiba Inu could rally further to $0.000033 if it successfully breaks above $0.000025. However, the $0.000033 level will mark a huge resistance for the meme coin. Notably, crypto analyst Javon Marks recently predicted that Shiba Inu could record a rally of over 163% to the $0.00003 range. He stated that the SHIB price had formed a bullish pattern in a regular bull divergence, which the MACD Histogram confirmed. Based on this, he declared that a reversal was on the horizon, with the meme coin rallying to the upside. These bullish predictions come amid a bearish sentiment toward the Shiba Inu price. The meme coin has underperformed the broader crypto market and is down over 42% year-to-date (YTD). However, crypto analyst Shib Spain is still bullish on the meme coin. He stated that the longer the meme coin’s accumulation continues, the more powerful the explosion will be. SHIB At Crossroads At The Moment In a TradingView post, crypto analyst CobraVanguard suggested that the Shiba Inu price is at a crossroads at the moment. This came as he highlighted a triangle pattern, which he stated would break in the direction it is breached, and the price would then move in that direction. His accompanying chart showed that $0.000012251 is the key level to watch out for as the meme coin decides its next move. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Recover? What To Expect In September A breakdown below this price level could send Shiba Inu to as low as $0.000011269. Meanwhile, a successful break above this level could send the meme coin to as high as $0.000014183 in the short term. This marks one of the price levels that Carter mentioned as SHIB eyes a rally above the psychological $0.00002 level. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001240, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

51128440,573145,1756908029,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51128440.jpeg,Dormant Bitcoin Supply Awakens: Swapping BTC For ETH On Hyperliquid,https://bitcoinist.com/dormant-bitcoin-supply-awakens-swapping-btc-for-eth/,"Bitcoin is entering a new phase after months of dominance and sustained gains. For the first time since late 2022, BTC is lagging behind while Ethereum and several altcoins begin to show strength. This shift has caught the attention of investors, as Bitcoin has long been the main force driving the broader market’s momentum. Now, with Ethereum taking the crown, the spotlight has temporarily shifted away from BTC. Top analyst Darkfost points out that old Bitcoin whales are becoming active again, adding to the uncertainty. Among them is one whale who continues to swap BTC for ETH on Hyperliquid. According to Darkfost, this whale is most likely a miner, as evidence links their activity to the Bixin platform, which mined its last block back in 2019. Such movements suggest that early holders and miners may be diversifying their portfolios, contributing to the growing capital rotation trend. This dynamic reflects a key moment in the cycle, where Bitcoin’s leadership is challenged while Ethereum builds momentum through both institutional demand and whale accumulation. The coming weeks will determine whether BTC can reclaim its dominance or if ETH continues to drive the next stage of the market. Old Bitcoin Whales Drive Market Uncertainty According to Darkfost, old Bitcoin whales have played a major role in the recent increase of dormant BTC being moved and sold, raising red flags across the market. These wallets, often tied to early miners and long-term holders, are becoming active once again, fueling speculation about their motives. Historical trends suggest that whenever such activity picks up, it tends to coincide with overheated markets and often marks the beginning of corrective phases. Darkfost highlights the Spending Binary CDD (Coin Days Destroyed) as a crucial indicator in the current cycle. This metric, which tracks the movement of older coins, has reached critical levels once again—levels that in past cycles consistently preceded market corrections. The reasoning is simple: when coins that have remained untouched for years are suddenly sold, it signals distribution by early investors and introduces additional supply into the market at sensitive points. The current environment mirrors this exact setup. Bitcoin’s price action shows consolidation and fading bullish momentum, while Spending Binary CDD reinforces the likelihood of continued downside pressure. Darkfost warns that unless demand rises significantly—or these old BTC stop being moved—it will remain extremely difficult for Bitcoin to break out of its current consolidation phase. If demand does not offset this increase in selling pressure from old wallets, Bitcoin may face deeper corrections before finding stability. On the other hand, a pause in whale distribution could open the door for BTC to regain strength. Either way, the behavior of these old holders will heavily influence Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Price Action Details Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $111,255, showing signs of recovery after a sharp decline that pushed it near the $108K region. The chart highlights how BTC recently bounced off the 200-day moving average (red line), a key long-term support level that has historically provided stability during corrections. Holding above this line is crucial for maintaining the broader bullish structure. On the upside, BTC faces immediate resistance at the 100-day SMA (~$115,740) and the 50-day SMA (~$114,356). Both moving averages are trending above current price levels, creating a potential confluence of resistance that could limit short-term upside momentum. Unless BTC can break and sustain above these averages, the market may see continued consolidation between $108K and $115K. The yellow line at $123,217 remains the critical resistance point to watch, representing the last major high before the recent correction. A successful reclaim of this level would signal renewed bullish momentum and could reset the trajectory toward new highs.

Ethereum is struggling to maintain support after over 430,000 ETH worth $1.8 billion was dumped by whales within two weeks, threatening to drag the price below $4,000. Pi Network, once hailed for grassroots excitement, is now down 87 percent from its peak, with weak accumulation and tight resistance caps defining its technical outlook. Against this uncertain backdrop, BlockDAG is gaining momentum through clear progress. The project’s Batch 30 presale has raised $395 million at $0.03 per coin, with a limited-time offer of $0.0013, selling 25.5 billion units and delivering a 2,900 percent ROI. Its mobile-first X1 Miner app recently crossed 3 million downloads, and its X10 hardware demo showcases infrastructure readiness. These execution metrics set it apart as a true bullish crypto contender for 2025. Ethereum Market Risk Amplified by Whale Exodus A surge in Ethereum whale sell-offs has sparked renewed market anxiety. According to CryptoPotato, large holders offloaded over 430,000 ETH—worth $1.8 billion—within 14 days, putting the $4,000 support level at risk. If this critical level breaks, analysts warn of a fall to $3,800 or lower. This pressure stems from a lack of clear institutional demand, combined with broader macro instability that makes high-beta assets vulnerable. This wave of distribution reflects weakened confidence among Ethereum’s largest participants. While ETH remains foundational in DeFi, NFTs, and L2 development, price is driven by sentiment as much as utility in the near term. Without a visible reversal in whale behavior, buyers may hesitate. As investors seek bullish crypto coins for 2025, Ethereum’s path appears contingent on a rebound in macro liquidity and a decisive return of smart money. For now, Ethereum’s market risk profile remains elevated. Pi Network’s Price Outlook Remains Weak Pi Network’s price structure reflects fragility. AMBCrypto reports that PI is down 87 percent from its February 2025 highs near $3, now hovering around $0.368. Short-term gains aside, Pi’s long-term outlook is capped by weak accumulation and a lack of exchange availability. The top 100 wallets hold 96.37 percent of the supply, leaving the token highly vulnerable to sell-offs. Despite a brief breakout above $0.37, technical indicators show minimal buyer strength. RSI and OBV remain weak, and trading volume lacks follow-through. Unless Pi secures new listings or ecosystem utility, upside remains constrained. Bears could reclaim control if the $0.368 level fails again. Investors eyeing bullish crypto coins in 2025 should question whether Pi has the infrastructure, accessibility, and capital support needed to rebound. Right now, its trajectory remains speculative, not structural. BlockDAG: X1 & X10 Live Demo Showcases Bullish Strength BlockDAG continues to demonstrate long-term value by executing against clear milestones. The Batch 30 presale has reached $395 million, with 25.5 billion coins already sold at $0.03, alongside a limited-time offer of $0.0013. Investors who joined earlier batches have seen a delivered ROI of 2,900 percent. This strong capital formation reflects confidence in the project’s foundation and differentiates BlockDAG from speculative tokens with limited utility. User participation is expanding rapidly. The X1 crypto mining app has surpassed 3 million downloads, transforming smartphones into accessible mining tools. The X10 hardware rig offers a more powerful alternative for users who want dedicated mining capacity. Both tools are showcased through the X1 and X10 Live Demo, which allows users and developers to interact with BlockDAG’s functioning network. This demo environment confirms the project’s hybrid DAG and Proof of Work design, as well as its ability to deliver high transaction throughput with low latency. BlockDAG is fully EVM compatible, which allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts using existing Ethereum tools. This compatibility reduces the time needed to build on the platform and encourages cross-chain dApp migration. Developers gain access to fast confirmations, robust architecture, and a reliable test environment prior to mainnet launch. To support ecosystem growth, BlockDAG is investing in hackathons, wallet integration, and decentralized exchange tooling. These efforts aim to accelerate smart contract deployment and foster a vibrant development community. This approach positions BlockDAG as more than just a presale success. It is building the foundations for lasting utility and network effects. Final Take Ethereum’s risk profile has worsened as whales reduce exposure and price stability erodes. Without renewed capital inflows, it may struggle to retest highs. Pi Network continues to drift downward, with structural weakness, token concentration, and exchange limitations preventing meaningful recovery. BlockDAG delivers a different story. Its $395 million presale, 25.5 billion tokens sold, and 2,900 percent ROI reflect robust investor engagement. The 3M X1 Miner milestone and X10 Live Demo confirm real traction. Among bullish crypto coins for 2025, BlockDAG offers clarity, execution, and unmatched upside potential.

Key Takeaways: Trimont is using JPMorgan’s Kinexys blockchain to automate and accelerate $730B in loan payment processing. The system cuts settlement times from two days to minutes by identifying and routing payments automatically. Kinexys reflects a growing shift toward programmable, 24/7 blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The Atlanta-based firm tapped into JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments network for the first time in August and plans to expand its usage over the next year, CEO Bill Sexton told Bloomberg . Kinexys Slashes Loan Payment Processing Time from Days to Minutes The Kinexys system streamlines payment workflows by identifying incoming payments, verifying amounts, and distributing funds to lenders, tasks that previously took up to two days and can now be completed in minutes. “There is significant financial benefit to our clients being able to receive the payments two days earlier,” Sexton said. This partnership highlights a growing trend among corporations exploring blockchain as a faster, more efficient alternative to traditional banking rails. While banks have tested blockchain applications for years, broad adoption has been slow, and most projects remain limited in scope. JPMorgan’s Kinexys, launched in 2019, currently processes about $3 billion in transactions daily, a small slice compared to the bank’s $10 trillion daily volume. Still, interest is picking up, especially as new regulations around digital assets and stablecoins emerge. Companies are increasingly drawn to the idea of 24/7 programmable payments that can bypass the constraints of traditional banking hours. The Kinexys network began supporting programmable payments in 2023, allowing firms to automate cash movement based on pre-set conditions. “It’s the ability to embed software in money and make money smart,” said Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys. Blockchain’s real value, Mallela noted, lies in making money behave more like data—fast, flexible, and intelligent. Trimont’s adoption of the technology could signal a broader move within commercial finance toward digital payment infrastructure that matches the pace of modern business. As blockchain continues to mature beyond the crypto headlines, real-world implementations like Trimont’s may offer a glimpse into how financial rails will evolve in the decade ahead. Payments Companies Push into Crypto In May, crypto payments platform Mesh unveiled its Apple Pay integration , which allows merchants partnered with Mesh to accept crypto payments via Apple Pay. Mesh’s partnership with Apple Pay came as payments companies continue to expand into digital assets. In April, global payments giant Stripe said it is developing a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin aimed at companies operating outside the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. The announcement came after Stripe’s regulatory approval to acquire Bridge, a stablecoin payments network designed to rival traditional banking systems and SWIFT-based transfers. Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and outspoken Bitcoin advocate, publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey’s call was echoed by David Marcus, former president of PayPal and current CEO of Lightspark, who stated that “all non-transactional apps should connect to Bitcoin.” The comments reflect a growing sentiment among Bitcoin advocates to reposition BTC not just as a store of value, but as a practical payment tool.

Market commentator MoonBlitz has highlighted what he calls one of the “cleanest setups in the market right now,” pointing to XRP’s current price action and mounting speculation around a potential U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund (ETF). “XRP at $2.80 is not weakness, it’s accumulation,” MoonBlitz emphasized, framing the cryptocurrency’s recent consolidation as a sign of strength rather than exhaustion. On the charts, XRP appears to be carving out a classic cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish formation that often precedes significant upward moves. The critical resistance level to watch is $3.55, identified as the breakout “wall” that could unlock further upside momentum. Therefore, a decisive break above $3.55 would confirm the cup-and-handle pattern and potentially trigger a new phase of price discovery for XRP. Historically, such breakouts have sparked rapid rallies as sidelined buyers re-enter and momentum traders accelerate the move. Adding fuel to the bullish case is growing chatter around an XRP ETF, with odds being floated as high as 87% by Polymarket . An ETF approval would be a landmark for Ripple and the XRP ecosystem, giving institutions regulated, direct access to the asset. This could unlock a surge in demand while cementing XRP’s position in the expanding digital finance landscape. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.86, according to CoinGecko data. The SEC & CFTC Greenlight Spot Crypto Trading: XRP Positioned for ETF Momentum In a landmark move for the digital asset industry, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have jointly approved spot cryptocurrency trading on U.S. exchanges. This decision marks a turning point for mainstream adoption, clearing the path for regulated ETFs and solidifying crypto’s place within the financial system. Regulatory uncertainty has long hindered institutional adoption of digital assets. Futures-based products existed, but spot approval was the missing link to align crypto with traditional markets. With both agencies now granting approval, exchanges can list spot products under clear rules, curbing manipulation risks and strengthening investor confidence. The implications for XRP are profound. Long recognized for its utility in cross-border payments, Ripple’s token is now positioned as a prime candidate for institutional adoption. Therefore, an ETF approval removes a key regulatory hurdle, opening the door for compliance-focused investors to gain direct exposure through regulated products, potentially accelerating demand and solidifying XRP’s market role. Conclusion The joint approval from the SEC and CFTC marks a watershed moment for crypto, signaling the transition from speculative markets to regulated financial infrastructure. As the pathway to spot ETFs opens, assets with real-world utility like XRP are uniquely positioned to capture institutional and retail demand.

Bitcoin Whales Start Selling Before Fed Cuts,https://cryptopotato.com/btc-price-warning-sign-bitcoin-whales-start-selling-before-fed-cuts/,"TL;DR Long-term Bitcoin holders show heavy activity, historically seen near market tops or correction periods. Whale balances drop to levels last seen in 2018, suggesting continued quiet distribution. Bitcoin breaks multi-week downtrend, but profit-taking and whale exits raise short-term caution. Long-Term Holders Begin Moving Coins Recent data shows that wallets holding Bitcoin for long periods have started to move their BTC. This is tracked through the Long-Term Holder Binary Spending Indicator, which is now showing increased activity from these older wallets. In the past, similar spikes have taken place near price peaks and before broader corrections. WHALES ARE DUMPING #BITCOIN , A SIGN OF TROUBLE AHEAD?

Historically, these movements have preceded major market corrections, signaling a… pic.twitter.com/c3Xx78Up9v — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) September 3, 2025 Bitcoin is currently trading near local highs. Market watchers note that the timing of this behavior may be linked to expectations around potential policy changes by the Federal Reserve. As shared by Bitcoinsensus, “whales might be anticipating a market-wide correction once the Fed begins cutting rates.” The pattern is being closely watched, given its history of aligning with key turning points in BTC’s price. Notably, Bitcoin’s net realized profit and loss data show that many holders have been selling at a profit. July and August saw multiple spikes in realized gains, which took place during price increases. These periods match recent highs in the market and suggest holders may have been reducing exposure as prices climbed. Source: CryptoQuant At the time of writing, Bitcoin was priced at around $111,200, with moderate gains over the past 24 hours and the past week. Most transactions still appear to be happening above cost, meaning selling is not coming from loss-driven exits. The tone in the market seems calm but cautious, with more participants choosing to take profits. Average Whale Holdings Continue to Drop The average Bitcoin balance held by large entities is now at its lowest level in nearly seven years. According to Glassnode, wallets holding between 100 and 10,000 BTC currently hold about 488 BTC on average. This is a level last seen in December 2018. The decline began in November 2024 and has continued into the present. Consequently, this steady decrease shows that larger holders have been gradually reducing their positions. Whether this trend continues will depend on upcoming market conditions and external factors like macroeconomic policy and capital rotation. Price Breaks Out of Downtrend On the chart, Bitcoin has closed above a downward trendline that had held since early August. The move was pointed out by Rekt Capital, who noted , “BTC has Daily Closed above its multi-week Downtrend.” Source: X This breakout might indicate that the downtrend is weakening. Going further up from this point will rely on the ability of Bitcoin to hold above the trendline. Holding this level on a retest might strengthen short-term recovery possibilities. Failing that, buyer momentum could resume. The post BTC Price Warning Sign?

This brings the investment firm’s total holdings to almost 500,000 ETH, worth around $2.19 billion at today’s price. The addition comes amid a particularly exciting time for Ethereum accumulation, something which has helped the Ethereum price climb to $4,372 , marking a 23% increase in a month and a 74% increase in the past year. And given Ethereum’s almost peerless fundamentals, it’s likely that the coin will continue to attract institutional over the coming months, pushing its price even further. Ethereum Price Prediction: Wall Street-Backed Fund Adds 150,000 ETH – Institutions are Buying Now The Ether Machine has been accumulating Ethereum since late July, when it announced a purchase of 15,000 ETH , becoming the third-largest holder of the coin among publicly listed companies. Well, now it has announced a new raise of 150,000 ETH, with prominent Ethereum investor Jeffrey Bern investing the tokens in the company. Good morning, Machinists. We just raised another 150,000 #ETH in August ($654M). This is the largest follow on investment of any crypto treasury company thus far, bringing our total committed capital up to >$2.5B — The Ether Machine (@TheEtherMachine) September 2, 2025 This reinforces its position as the third-largest Ethereum holding company, behind Bitmine and SharpLink, and it also boosts the bull case for Ethereum itself. Ethereum has enjoyed a spree of corporate and institutional investment over the past couple of months, with the latest CoinShares report indicating that extant ETH ETFs have assets under management of $37.9 billion. And if we look at the Ethereum price chart today, we see that the alt is maintaining its momentum, which may be strengthening again. For instance, its relative strength index (yellow) has bounced off the 50 line and has resumed rising. Source: TradingView On the other hand, its MACD (red, green) is still declining from an overbought position, so there remains a chance that we could continue to see falls over the coming month. However, Ethereum’s fundamental position is so strong that we can expect a strong end to the year, especially if the SEC gives the green light to the current backlog of alt ETF applications. This could instigate another alt season, which Ethereum is likely to lead, given its position as the biggest layer-one blockchain (by quite some margin ). Based on these factors, Ethereum could slip closer to $4,000 over the next one or two weeks before mounting a recovery.

Bitcoin Hyper Raises $13.6 Million As Presale Hots Up: Next Big L2? It seems hard to argue against Ethereum leading any incoming alt season, yet ETH certainly won’t be the only alt to watch out for in the coming weeks. It’s also worth keeping an eye on newer altcoins, including presale tokens, since these can often outpace the market when they gain new exchange listings. A strong example of a coin currently holding its presale is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two network for Bitcoin . With the fastest Bitcoin L2 in history. Hyper is ALWAYS hitting a bullseye. https://t.co/VNG0P4FWNQ pic.twitter.com/3NzEi9SVcU — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) September 2, 2025 It has raised a very impressive $13.6 million in its presale, while its official X account has garnered more than 14,000 followers . This is a promising sign of Bitcoin Hyper’s future, with the project attracting investors by dint of its roadmap. It will launch a dedicated, smart contract-enabled layer-two network for Bitcoin, offering BTC holders lower fees and higher speeds. Making use of Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM) and zero-knowledge rollups, Bitcoin Hyper offers unsurpassed speed, scalability, security and privacy. It aims to develop a wide-ranging ecosystem of DeFi protocols and dapps, which will enable investors to tap into Bitcoin’s value for extra profit.

At this point, while the FED's 25 basis point interest rate cut at its September 17 meeting is priced in at 91.7%, Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek stated that the FED will most likely cut interest rates and the cryptocurrency market will have a strong fourth quarter. Speaking to Bloomberg, the CEO of Crypto.com made a bold prediction. He said he expects the Fed to cut interest rates in September, which would trigger a major crypto rally in late 2025. Marszalek argued that the Fed's potential interest rate cut on September 17 would provide much-needed liquidity to the crypto market, lower borrowing costs, and increase demand for risky assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. “Every time the Fed cuts interest rates, cryptocurrency markets feel the impact almost immediately. We've seen this before. When the Fed lowered interest rates from 5.5% to 4.5% between September and December last year, the cryptocurrency market gained 57% in four months. I believe the fourth quarter of 2025 will be no different.” Marszalek also spoke about the exchange's native token, Cronos (CRO), and referred to the partnerships the exchange and CRO established with Trump's company, Trump Media & Technology Group, this year. Stating that this partnership news is positive for CRO, the famous CEO said that the CRO price gained 150% value after the partnerships were announced. “Although CRO has seen a very good rally in a short time, investors are targeting the all-time high of $0.96 in 2021. And these kinds of partnerships build long-term credibility for CRO,” Marszalek said. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Rally Statement from Famous Stock Exchange CEO!

Bitcoin’s drop to a new August low exacerbated altcoin weakness. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s pullback following the expiration of billions of dollars in options triggered a broad cryptocurrency sell-off. DOT Miners, a UK-based cloud computing service platform, has gradually attracted attention from cryptocurrency enthusiasts after officially launching dedicated applications for XRP and BTC. Its core advantage lies in the fact that it requires no mining hardware and no technical skills, and simply requires holding the cryptocurrency to earn on-chain returns. This model is very attractive to ordinary cryptocurrency holders, especially those who prefer their assets to generate income rather than just sit idle. Ripple (XRP) fluctuates greatly, but the returns shown by users after using it are very stable, which is really reassuring. Some users even posted in the community: I used to only want to gain room for growth, but now I pay more attention to stability. Why does DOT Miners attract XRP users? The DOT mining machine has quickly become popular among XRP users not only because of its stable returns, but more importantly, it provides on-chain cloud computing and an automatic settlement mechanism that is unaffected by price fluctuations. Even in a period of Even if the market falls and fluctuates, the returns remain stable, which allows investors to shift from high-risk speculation to stable asset allocation. Currently, DOT Miners supports deposits on major blockchains such as XRP, DOGE, USDT, and BTC. Users can choose cloud contracts with different periods and yields based on their financial situation. Some users have achieved daily on-chain returns of up to $9,800 using advanced contracts, attracting many veteran cryptocurrency players to this more stable strategy. Three steps to start passive income: 1、Register an account: Complete registration within a few seconds, new users can receive a $15 trial credit, and can start the contract experience without recharging; 2、Choose an income plan: A variety of cycles and amounts are available, and income is linked to investment, which can flexibly match different financial conditions; 3、Enjoy daily settlement: The system automatically distributes income every day, and users can log in to the backend to check at any time; the contract automatically returns the principal when it expires, and there is no need for manual redemption. Why choose DOT Miners? Compliance background: Headquartered in the UK, subject to local financial supervision; contract information is transparent and traceable; Easy to operate: No need to buy a machine or wire, even novice users can participate with one click; Green energy drive: Nordic and African data centers, 100% renewable energy; Multi-currency support: USDT, XRP, BTC, ETH, BNB and other mainstream currencies can participate; Strong industry endorsement: Bitmain provides strategic and technical support, and the supply chain is stable; Multiple security mechanisms: The platform adopts Cloudflare, EV SSL, dual authentication and other mechanisms to fully protect the security of user assets. In addition to income, there is also a “social asset network” growing. The platform not only encourages individual participation, but also designs a promotion rebate mechanism. Every time you invite a friend to successfully register and participate in the contract, you can get a lifetime rebate of 4.5% of the other party’s investment amount. The rebate is credited in real time, with no limit on the number of people, and gradually build your own “digital income network”. About DOT Miners DOT Miners is a cloud mining platform focusing on blockchain computing power infrastructure, dedicated to providing compliant and secure cloud computing power contract services to global users. The platform now covers more than 100 countries and regions, and has served more than 5 million users in total.

Erste Tests beginnen noch dieses Jahr, der große Start folgt 2026. Das könnte die Blockchain nicht nur für Entwickler, sondern auch für normale Nutzer spannender machen. Kryptowährungen haben oft das Image, langsam und kompliziert zu sein. Solana will dieses Problem nun mit einem großen Upgrade lösen. Mit Alpenglow soll das Netzwerk bis zu fünfmal schneller werden und damit zeigen, dass Blockchain-Technologie auch im Alltag reibungslos funktionieren kann. Ein Update, das neugierig macht Die Community von Solana hat entschieden: Das Upgrade mit dem Namen Alpenglow kommt. Ganze 98 Prozent der sogenannten Validatoren, also der Betreiber der Infrastruktur im Netzwerk, haben zugestimmt. Für Solana ist das ein starkes Signal und für viele Nutzer ein spannender Ausblick in die Zukunft. JUST IN: Alpenglow, the most significant consensus upgrade proposal in @Solana 's history, aiming for 150ms block finality, has passed governance. 98.27% voted 'Yes', 1.05% voted 'No', with 52% of the Network stake participating. pic.twitter.com/T2IbPW0UeT — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) September 2, 2025 Denn im Kern geht es darum, dass Transaktionen künftig viel schneller bestätigt werden sollen. Statt wie bisher rund einer Sekunde könnte es bald unter 200 Millisekunden dauern. Das klingt technisch, bedeutet aber praktisch: Warten beim Bezahlen oder Handeln wird fast nicht mehr spürbar sein. Warum das wichtig ist Heute dauert es oft über zwölf Sekunden, bis eine Transaktion wirklich endgültig verbucht ist. Für viele Anwendungen ist das zu lang – man denke nur an schnelle Käufe oder Börsengeschäfte. Mit Alpenglow soll diese Zeit auf ein Fünftel schrumpfen. 1/ Next week, the Alpenglow vote goes live. If passed, Solana finality will drop to ~100–150ms. That's ultralight speed compared to peers, and on par with centralized systems like Visa. pic.twitter.com/SLiYGrSvOL — DeFi Dev Corp. (DFDV) (@defidevcorp) August 22, 2025 Das ist nicht nur für Profis interessant. Auch normale Nutzer profitieren, weil Apps flüssiger reagieren und Zahlungen zügiger bestätigt werden. Solana möchte damit den Sprung schaffen von einer guten zu einer wirklich alltagstauglichen Blockchain. So läuft der Plan ab Die Entwickler wollen Alpenglow bereits im Dezember im Testnetz ausprobieren. Passend dazu findet auch die Breakpoint-Konferenz statt, ein wichtiges Treffen für die Szene. Dort sollen erste Ergebnisse vorgestellt werden. Wenn alles gut läuft, soll Anfang 2026 der große Start im Hauptnetz erfolgen. Bis dahin wird das Update unter realen Bedingungen getestet, damit Fehler rechtzeitig gefunden und behoben werden können. Ziel ist, dass der Übergang so reibungslos wie möglich klappt. Mehr als nur Technik Viele Experten sagen, dass Alpenglow nicht einfach ein kleines Update ist, sondern ein echter Wendepunkt. Kyle Samani von Multicoin Capital etwa glaubt, dass damit die Grundlage für völlig neue digitale Märkte gelegt wird. Seine Vision: Stablecoins könnten bald direkt in Smartphones integriert sein – so selbstverständlich wie Apps. Schon jetzt werden Ethereum und Solana als mögliche Kandidaten für staatlich geförderte Stablecoins gehandelt. Für die Community von Solana ist das ein wichtiger Meilenstein. Schon lange versuchen Entwickler, die Grenzen der Blockchain-Technologie auszuloten. Alpenglow ist für viele ein großer Schritt in Richtung einer Zeit, in der Millionen Transaktionen pro Sekunde möglich sind. Solana im Wettstreit Natürlich bleibt Solana nicht allein. Ethereum, Avalanche und andere Netzwerke arbeiten ebenfalls an Verbesserungen. Doch mit Alpenglow könnte Solana erstmals ernsthaft an die Geschwindigkeit klassischer Finanzsysteme herankommen. Und das wäre ein enormer Vorteil im Wettbewerb. Schon heute konnte Solana in Tests 100.000 Transaktionen pro Sekunde verarbeiten. Das zeigt, dass die technischen Grundlagen vorhanden sind. Für Investoren und Entwickler ist das ein klares Signal: Hier passiert etwas Großes. Der Blick aufs Geld Neben der Technik schauen viele auch auf den Kurs von Solana, der mit dem Kürzel SOL gehandelt wird. Aktuell liegt er bei rund 207 US-Dollar. Analysten erwarten, dass er durch die Aussicht auf Alpenglow bis Ende des Jahres auf bis zu 250 US-Dollar steigen könnte. Zum Vergleich: Das Allzeithoch liegt noch knapp 30 Prozent darüber. Sollte Alpenglow wirklich so erfolgreich starten wie erhofft, könnte Solana auch finanziell zu den großen Gewinnern zählen. Für Anleger und Fans ist das Upgrade also doppelt spannend. Pepenode – Mining trifft Meme-Kultur Kryptos gibt’s wie Sand am Meer – aber Pepenode sticht heraus. Warum? Weil hier nicht stumpf gekauft und gehofft wird, sondern echtes „Mine to Earn“ im Mittelpunkt steht. Jeder startet mit einem leeren virtuellen Serverraum, baut sich Stück für Stück seine Mining-Station auf und optimiert diese nach Belieben. Keine teuren Stromrechnungen, keine lärmenden Hardware-Rigs – nur cleveres Tüfteln, Strategie und ein Hauch Community-Wettbewerb. So entsteht ein Ökosystem, das nicht nur belohnt, sondern auch unterhält. $PEPENODE – der Coin mit Augenzwinkern Der $PEPENODE Token ist mehr als ein reines Investment – er trägt die DNA eines Memes in sich. Was aus Internet-Humor geboren wurde, verwandelt sich hier in ein ernstzunehmendes DeFi-Spielzeug. Dank Gamification, Staking-Rewards und Leaderboards ist Pepenode keine stille Anlage, sondern ein interaktives Erlebnis. Und das Beste: Die Meme-Herkunft sorgt für Leichtigkeit und Spaß, während die Tokenomics für Stabilität und Nutzen stehen. Kurz gesagt: Wer die nächste Meme-Legende im Portfolio haben will, kommt an der Pepenode Presale kaum vorbei.
