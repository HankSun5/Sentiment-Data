According to CNBC, Warren Buffett, who led the merger that created the food giant in 2015, said on Tuesday that he’s “disappointed” in the breakup. He also said the merger itself was “not a brilliant idea” and that splitting Kraft Heinz apart won’t fix the real issues. The new move divides Kraft Heinz into two separate businesses. One now handles sauces, spreads, and shelf-stable meals. The other is left with U.S. household brands like Kraft Singles, Lunchables, and Oscar Mayer. The announcement was made early Tuesday, and Warren’s comments came later that day in an interview with Becky Quick. Shares dropped more than 7% after his interview aired. Berkshire stays put as Kraft Heinz breaks apart Warren has kept Berkshire Hathaway’s 27.5% stake untouched since the merger. The company hasn’t trimmed or added to the position at all since teaming up with 3G Capital a decade ago to form Kraft Heinz. But now, with 3G already out, having quietly exited in 2023, Warren and his incoming successor, Greg Abel, are left holding the investment solo. Abel, who will take over from Warren at the end of this year, has also expressed his disappointment in how Kraft Heinz is being handled. Since the merger, Kraft Heinz has lost serious ground. Its shares have collapsed nearly 70% since 2015, shrinking its market value to just $33 billion. The decline came after U.S. sales dropped and consumer behavior changed. Shoppers started avoiding processed foods, opting instead for fresh items around the outer edges of grocery stores. The brands under Kraft Heinz, despite being household names like Velveeta and Oscar Mayer, started to lose relevance. Analysts blame some of the collapse on 3G Capital’s aggressive cost-cutting, which prevented the company from investing in its brands at the time they needed it most. Kraft Heinz ended up selling off big pieces of its portfolio, including its Planters nuts and parts of its cheese business. At the same time, it tried to revive a few brands like Capri Sun and Lunchables by investing more heavily in them. Back in May, executives at Kraft Heinz admitted they were thinking about strategic changes and even possible deals. This split is the result of that process. The company didn’t say if more breakups or asset sales are coming, but it’s clear the structure from 2015 isn’t working anymore. Despite the mess, Warren hasn’t walked away. He told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway will do whatever is best for the firm. He also made one thing clear: if anyone comes forward to buy their stake, Berkshire won’t accept a private block deal unless every other shareholder is offered the same exact terms. That means no backroom discounts or side deals. Warren also admitted during a rough quarter back in 2019 that Berkshire “overpaid” for Kraft. Still, unlike other investors who bailed out years ago, he hasn’t sold. Whether that patience pays off after this new split remains to be seen. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Its Hydra upgrade and steady improvements have made it one of the most respected blockchains. But as markets gear up for the next cycle, many traders see ADA as slow-moving compared to other projects. Analysts suggest that while ADA could climb in 2025, bigger returns may come from alternatives such as Hedera (HBAR), Stellar (XLM), and the meme-fueled newcomer Layer Brett (LBRETT). Hedera (HBAR) and real-world adoption Hedera has been marketed less as a retail coin and more as an enterprise solution. Its hashgraph consensus allows for high throughput, low cost, and strong security. Instead of promising ideas on paper, Hedera has already signed major companies as governing council members. Brands in tech, telecom, and finance are helping shape the network, a sign of real-world interest. Developers are turning to Hedera for tokenization, payment rails, and supply chain tracking. Cardano also pushes innovation but takes a more academic route. For investors, the contrast is clear: ADA has credibility in theory, while HBAR is gaining credibility through use cases. If enterprise blockchain adoption grows, Hedera could easily outpace ADA’s growth rate. Stellar (XLM) and global payments Stellar was designed with a simple purpose: to make moving money across borders faster and cheaper. With financial institutions, fintech firms, and even central banks testing its rails, XLM continues to build relevance in payments. Its low-cost transactions and partnership activity make it a candidate to benefit from the rise of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Cardano has leaned on a vision of slow but steady upgrades. Stellar, by comparison, has aimed straight at the money-transfer industry. This clear focus on payments has given XLM a path to adoption that ADA doesn’t directly address. If blockchain-powered remittances expand in 2025, Stellar could see the kind of growth that makes it one of the top alternatives to Cardano. Layer Brett (LBRETT) and speculative momentum Then there’s Layer Brett , the newcomer drawing buzz. Unlike most meme coins, it isn’t built on hype alone. It runs on Ethereum Layer 2, giving it fast speeds, low fees, and the ability to connect with Ethereum dApps. This makes it practical for actual use while still carrying the viral appeal of a meme token. The presale has caught fire, thanks in part to staking rewards reported in the thousands of percent APY. That has pulled in both small buyers and early whales. A clear roadmap adds to the interest: NFT tie-ins, gamified staking, and plans for cross-chain features. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, scarcity is locked in, giving traders another reason to stay interested. Compared to ADA, which is already a large-cap coin, Layer Brett starts from a tiny market base. Even moderate demand could produce outsized multiples. Analysts speculate that if momentum continues, it could rival past meme coin stories, with returns far beyond what ADA might deliver. Final thoughts Cardano remains a cornerstone project, respected for its security and research-driven approach. But in 2025, alternatives may offer more upside. Hedera could capture enterprise clients. Stellar is pushing into global payments. And Layer Brett brings meme energy backed by real infrastructure. For investors, it comes down to risk preference. ADA looks set for steady gains, but those chasing bigger multiples may find opportunities in HBAR, XLM, or LBRETT. Each offers a different path, and together they highlight where capital may flow as the next cycle takes shape.

The first investors will receive a guaranteed minimum return of 300% when MUTM token goes live. The project has already raised over $15.25 million and over 15,950 investors on board. As traders look forward to a potentially bullish Q4, Mutuum Finance stands out as a next-generation decentralised finance (DeFi) protocol that is building a real-world use case and ecosystem all in one. Shiba Inu Resist Market Volatility The current market price of SHIB is close to $0.00001245 with a slight negative weekly impact of 6-7%. Despite this impact on the sentiments in the meme coin world, the SHIB ecosystem is continuing to grow through projects such as token burning and Shibarium. At the same time, DeFi projects related to utilities such as Mutuum Finance are gaining more and more attention from investors. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Mutuum Finance is at presale Stage 6 for $0.035 per token. Cost will go up 14.29% to $0.04 in next phase. With more than 15,950 investors involved and having successfully raised over $15.25 million, the presale is off to an incredible start, and enjoys significant confidence from early adopters. USDT Stablecoin on Ether Mutuum Finance will release an overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum The stablecoin is intended for daily use, for decentralised applications and for long-term portfolio stability, increasing usability and trust in the platform. Dual-Lending: DeFi Infrastructure Future-Proof Mutuum Finance is a dual-lending protocol that may be run with automation and user interaction for maximum efficiency. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending smart contracts dynamically change their interest rates (in real time) based on market supply and demand using self-executing smart contracts. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending: This form of lending allows lenders and borrowers to transact directly, eliminating intermediaries and offering more flexibility and transparency. This dual approach positions Mutuum Finance as a secure, future-resistant infrastructure that ensures financial inclusion, high returns, and opportunities for both retail and institutional investors. Its focus on security, transparency, and scalability forms the foundation for a sustainable and expansion-ready DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Protocol Overview Mutuum’s dynamic interest rate another smart contract solution for liquidity management. Borrow rates are determined by utilisation, with low rates providing incentives to borrow (and enhance capital efficiency) when capital is plentiful, and higher rates (with accompanying deposit incentives) promoting repayment and drawing deposits during times of scarcity. Stable rates can be used for resource borrowers who are looking for predictability. These fees will usually be higher than variable ones but can be tweaked if the market conditions change to a drastic extent. Only sufficiently liquid assets can be used as collateral to obtain stable-rate borrowing. The protocol promotes a strong risk management based on parameterised assets. Borrowers must over-collateralize and liquidators are rewarded for smoothing under-collateralized loans. Secondary markets enforce limits, including restrictions such as collateral requirements (expressed in terms of high-risk tokens), deposit and borrow constraints to limit exposure to volatile or illiquid asset classes. Improved Borrowing Capacity: Correlated assets predict even greater borrowing capacity, and LTVs limit borrowing based on collateral themselves. Liquidation thresholds and penalties are necessary to keep the protocol solvent and reserve factors are there to generate some interest (so it doesn’t default and causes market extreme conditions). Price discovery is based on solid oracle infrastructure. Permissions data stream will provide reliable pricing for USD and native assets like, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX on a chainlink data feed. Aggregated feeds, oracle standards/fallbacks, and on-chain DEX metrics serve to further sanitise, ensuring valuations are reliable and arrive in a prompt and accurate fashion for downstream collateral management & liquidation operations. Stability and Security Measures Mutuum Finance has established an official Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward pool, rating vulnerabilities as critical, major, minor, and low in severity. The project is also running a $100,000 community giveaway , where 10 investors will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. While SHIB struggles near $0.00001245, Mutuum Finance is attracting significant attention from early adopters. The project is already taking the lead as the next big player in the crypto market.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $111,170 (+2%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $111,564 24-hour low $109,147 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $ 111,170 Price Prediction $ 117,109 (+6.56%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.01% Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 116,091 200-Day SMA $ 95,954 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faces bullish surge above $111K Resistance for BTC is at $113,624 Support for BTC/USD is at $107,078 The BTC price analysis for 2 September confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price moves above $111K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bullish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces a move above $111K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bullish pressure as it hovers above $111K. Currently, the market is facing buying domination around resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.41 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $111,391, surging by over 2% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 45.98, hinting that a correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $112K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.84, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $113,624, it will fuel a bullish rally to $121,729. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $107,078, beginning a bearish trend to $99,908. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as buyers pushed the price above Fib levels. The recent lows triggered strong accumulation. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Metaplanet announced that it purchased 1,009 BTC, worth around $112 million. Its total holdings reached 20,000 BTC, making the company the sixth largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin. Bitcoin price prediction September 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $125,000, making August its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction September 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-02 22:00:00
51092254,572057,1756850402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51092254.jpeg,Here’s How Much The TRUMP Meme Coin Will Be With The Market Cap Of Dogecoin,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-with-doge-market-cap/,"The Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin stormed into the crypto scene in January 2025 with a rally that pushed its price from below $1 to a $73.43 peak in a matter of days. This rally placed it among the top twenty digital assets, but today, it is trading far below those heights. Nonetheless, Official Trump is still one of the biggest n ames among meme coins, and investors are still looking towards another rally. A way to measure the potential rally is by asking what would happen if TRUMP reached the same market capitalization as Dogecoin, the leading meme coin. What If TRUMP Reached Dogecoin’s Market Cap? At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading at $8.41, down by 7.2% in the past 24 hours but up by 1.4% in a seven-day timeframe. The meme coin has a market cap of about $1.683 billion. Dogecoin, the most established meme coin and the benchmark of the category, is currently valued at $0.2135 per token, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The leading meme coin has a market cap of about $31.85 billion. When comparing the two side by side, TRUMP’s market cap is just a fraction of Dogecoin’s size. According to calculations from the MarketCapOf tool, TRUMP’s current market value is only about 0.05× that of Dogecoin. Therefore, if TRUMP were to achieve the same market capitalization as the current price of Dogecoin, its price would have to climb to about $160.99 per token, which would represent a 19.21x increase from where it stands today. Dogecoin’s All-Time High The comparison is even more different when considering Dogecoin’s all-time high. At its all-time high of $0.7316 in May 2021, Dogecoin’s market capitalization reached roughly $88.79 billion on the back of the meme coin mania at the time. If TRUMP were ever to match that market cap high, its price would need to increase to about $444.23 per token. That would equate to an extraordinary 53.01x increase from its current price. However, these calculations only take into account the current circulating supply of these cryptocurrencies. TRUMP currently has a circulating supply of 199,999,973 tokens out of a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. Dogecoin, on the other hand, currently has a circulating supply of 150.748 billion tokens with an uncapped maximum supply. TRUMP has arguably had the best meme coin performance this cycle. Its astonishing run in January was reminiscent of similar meme coin rallies in 2021, which the market has been missing this cycle. After its launch on January 17, 2025, the TRUMP meme coin’s value soared by over 300% in under a day, reaching approximately $64 per token on the same day. By January 19, the meme coin had reached a peak of $73.43.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Marketcapof|Trump,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 22:00:02

Analysts say the cryptocurrency’s recent rally is largely driven by Binance whales. Ethereum Rally Driven By Large-Scale Binance Orders According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, Ethereum whales are now dominating order flows on the Binance exchange. The analyst highlighted the average ETH order size on the platform as evidence. Related Reading: Ethereum Demand Stays Strong As Exchange Reserves Keep Falling – Details Crazzyblockk shared the following chart showing different phases of average ETH order size on Binance. Retail-driven phases, highlighted in red, dominated much of 2023–24, when small orders drove up ETH’s price but left it vulnerable to corrections. These retail-driven periods were followed by neutral phases, shown in gray, which reflected indecision among ETH investors. This phase was characterized by fragmented participation and sideways trading behavior. Fast-forward to mid-2025, whale orders – highlighted in green – are firmly in control. Average order sizes have now surged past $3,000 per trade, signaling accumulation by institutional and large-scale investors. The CryptoQuant analyst noted that this whale dominance reflects renewed institutional confidence in ETH, aligning with its rapid price appreciation in recent months. Larger average orders suggest fewer fragmented trades and stronger directional conviction. Binance was chosen for the analysis not only as the world’s largest exchange but also because it is the “epicenter of ETH capital flow.” Crazzyblockk concluded: ETH’s latest rally isn’t just retail speculation – it’s being powered by whales on Binance. With large-scale players setting the tone, Ethereum’s market structure looks increasingly robust, and Binance remains the hub where these decisive flows shape price performance. Is ETH Getting Ready For A Rally? While Bitcoin (BTC) has tumbled 4.1% over the past 30 days, ETH is up 23.4% in the same period, indicating that large-scale investors may be in the middle of capital rotation from BTC to ETH over the past month. Related Reading: Ethereum Will ‘Likely 100x From Here,’ Says Joe Lubin Analysts predict ETH may have further room to grow for the remainder of 2025. Ethereum contracts are seeing a sharp resurgence in 2025, setting the stage for a potential rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $5,000 towards the end of the year. Ethereum fundamentals are also strengthening, with as much as 36 million ETH staked on the blockchain, raising the possibility of a supply crunch. That said, despite whale accumulation, some analysts caution that ETH could dip to $4,000. At press time, ETH trades at $4,316, down 2.8% in the past 24 hours.

With Bitcoin consolidating around key levels, attention is shifting to altcoins that could deliver outsized returns before the next big pump. Analysts say a handful of tokens are attracting both retail and institutional demand, and for good reason. One of them, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has become a hot topic after its presale nearly sold out, reminding investors of the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin when those who moved quickly saw exponential gains. XRP Eyes a Return to Strength Ripple’s XRP remains a favorite for investors betting on utility and adoption. Its cross-border payment network continues to expand, with growing partnerships in Asia and the Middle East. After recent price pressure, traders are watching whether XRP can reclaim momentum, with forecasts suggesting it could push toward new yearly highs if the market turns risk-on. Solana’s Speed Still a Major Draw Solana (SOL) has recovered from multiple setbacks, proving its resilience in the competitive Layer-1 space. With transaction speeds that rival traditional financial systems and a growing DeFi ecosystem, SOL is seen as one of the strongest contenders for long-term growth. If institutional flows extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana could be one of the top beneficiaries. MAGACOIN FINANCE Heating Up While established names dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly building one of the strongest early-stage communities of 2025. Its presale is moving at record speed, with allocations vanishing quickly as whales and retail buyers compete for a spot. Analysts point out that early investors could see as much as 40x returns if MAGACOIN FINANCE mirrors past breakout performances from other meme-powered projects. With a countdown now live and the presale almost sold out, this could be one of the last chances to enter before the next pump phase begins. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Gains Serious Traction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has quickly become a favorite in the decentralized trading space. With near-zero fees and growing daily volumes, the project is winning over traders who demand performance and scalability. As its ecosystem develops, many see HYPE as one of the most undervalued opportunities in the market today. Dogecoin Refuses to Fade Despite new meme coins popping up every week, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to command loyalty. Its massive community, strong branding, and new use cases in payments keep it relevant. DOGE has historically surprised skeptics, and if history repeats itself, another major rally could be around the corner. Cardano Pushes Toward Long-Term Adoption Cardano (ADA) has taken a slower but steady path, focusing on peer-reviewed development and scalability. With Hydra scaling technology rolling out, ADA is preparing to handle thousands of transactions per second. This foundation could power new adoption in DeFi, identity solutions, and enterprise-level blockchain applications. Analysts suggest ADA could benefit from the next wave of institutional attention, making it a coin to watch in the coming months. Conclusion As Bitcoin holds its ground, the real action could soon shift to altcoins. XRP and Solana are positioning for institutional inflows, Dogecoin and HYPE keep expanding their reach, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting records with its fast-selling presale. With the countdown nearly finished, investors looking for the next explosive opportunity may not want to wait much longer.

Solana (SOL) whales are not only fueling Solana’s own rally but also rotating into Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) , signaling a broader appetite for high-utility altcoins ahead of October. Alongside Ethereum (ETH) and XRP , a new player, MAGACOIN FINANCE , is capturing attention as investors look for early-stage opportunities with breakout potential. Together, these five tokens stand out as the top altcoins to watch into October . Solana Whales Drive Market Rotation Despite a surge to $215, Solana has seen 2 million SOL ($432M) deposited onto exchanges in just three days, creating caution about sell pressure. Still, whales remain active, and analysts point to critical levels: Support: $200, aligned with the on-chain MVRV mean. Next Resistance: $280, marked by the +0.5σ MVRV band. Upside Potential: Sustained whale demand could lift Solana toward $300 and beyond . The fact that whales are also loading up on AVAX and DOT suggests Solana whales are positioning broadly across Layer-1 ecosystems. Avalanche (AVAX) Gains Momentum With Government Adoption Avalanche posted 66% transaction growth in a week , surpassing 11.9 million transactions across 181,300 active addresses. Government Catalyst: The U.S. Department of Commerce announced it will publish GDP data directly on Avalanche, among other blockchains — a historic step for decentralized data. ETF Progress: Grayscale has updated its filing for an AVAX spot ETF , potentially unlocking new institutional inflows. These developments are driving renewed demand, with AVAX trading around $23.64 and investors eyeing further growth as adoption widens. Polkadot (DOT) Gains ETF Tailwinds Polkadot (DOT) has joined the growing list of tokens with ETF applications. Grayscale filed registration statements for both DOT and ADA trusts, signaling institutional interest is spreading beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ticker Plans: DOT would list on Nasdaq as a single-asset ETF. Market Impact: ETF filings validate DOT’s role as a next-gen blockchain for cross-chain applications and scalability. As whales rotate into DOT, the token could benefit from heightened visibility and new flows from traditional finance. Ethereum (ETH) Remains a Whale Favorite Whales continue to rotate billions from Bitcoin into Ethereum. $2.59B Rotation: A single whale shifted BTC into a $2.2B ETH spot and a $577M perpetual long. $456M Purchases: Nine addresses added hundreds of millions more. Validator Concerns: Over 1M ETH ($5B) is queued for withdrawal, but institutional inflows are absorbing supply. Trading near $4,300 , ETH remains a top pick among whales betting on DeFi and enterprise adoption. XRP Eyes ETF-Driven Breakthrough XRP is riding speculation that an XRP ETF could attract $5B in inflows during its first month if approved. Price: Currently trading near $3.00. Impact: ETF approval would bring hedge funds, pensions, and sovereign investors into XRP. Outlook: Analysts see potential for XRP to push into double-digit territory. Institutional adoption could cement XRP’s role as a utility-driven digital asset. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Emerging Altcoin to Watch Whales are now quietly accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE as its transparent team and audited contracts give confidence. With limited tokens available in its early-access stage and significant upside, early investors see MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to get in before it gets listed by exchanges. XRP and Solana investors are shifting focus toward MAGACOIN FINANCE’s breakout, seeking early exposure before wider adoption, exchange listings, and institutional attention ignite massive growth potential. As whales diversify into Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot, smaller but promising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the surprise outperformers in October . Analysts now expect 51x gains in the coming months of 2025. Final Thoughts Whales are reshaping the altcoin landscape by driving liquidity not just into Solana, but also into Avalanche and Polkadot. Alongside Ethereum’s continued dominance and XRP’s ETF-driven momentum, these tokens represent the top five altcoins to watch as October approaches. But the story isn’t only about large caps. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers investors a unique early-stage opportunity with strong community backing and growing utility — making it a wildcard that could join the ranks of the top-performing altcoins in the next cycle.

According to the analysis, a large portion of the supply of many popular altcoins is held by just the top 10 wallets. According to the data, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the highest centralization rate. The top 10 wallets control 62.3% of SHIB's total supply, followed by Uniswap (UNI) with 52.2% and Ethereum (ETH) with 51.0%. The situation for other prominent altcoins is as follows: Tether (USDT): 40.5% Pepe (PEPE): 39.4% Chainlink (LINK): 31.5% Dai (DAI): 31.0% USD Coin (USDC): 28.6% Related News: Another Altcoin Launches Token Sale Project for Companies in the US and China Santiment stated that this data has revived discussions about “centralization,” particularly for investors. The intense dominance of large wallets over supply is considered a risk factor, as it could lead to sharper price fluctuations. It's also noteworthy that three of the seven altcoins on the list are stablecoins. However, it's important to note that the list only includes altcoins from the Ethereum ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

According to CoinMarketCap , the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X . The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy , shared earlier in June, that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multi-year reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The Foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making it the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. Tuesday’s announcement comes as ETH price has skyrocketed, reaching an all-time high in late August at $4,866.

European Union regulators have postponed the antitrust fine that was expected to be imposed on Alphabet’s Google due to concerns about the United States’ tariff actions. The European Union’s fine against Alphabet’s Google has been delayed Three sources reported that the European Commission , which is responsible for antitrust enforcement, has chosen not to move forward with its penalty against Google. The Commission has decided to stay the fine while waiting on the United States to follow through on its promised reduction of tariffs on European cars. Car duties have been one of the most debated issues in the trade talks between the two sides. Brussels has so far been pushing for the duties to be eased in exchange for concessions on industrial goods. Just last week, the Commission proposed eliminating tariffs on imported U.S. industrial goods. It now expects Washington to announce a cut in tariffs on European cars, reducing duties from 27.5% to 15%. The timing of the delayed fine has raised questions about whether the EU’s competition enforcement is being used as a bargaining chip in economic talks. According to one of the sources , the postponement is not expected to exceed a month. The three sources named the EU’s Trade Commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, who reportedly sought clarifications on the antitrust decision taken by EU competition chief Teresa Ribera, as a factor in the delay. The postponement was announced days after Google was told to expect the fine announcement on Monday. Independence of enforcement The potential link between the EU’s antitrust enforcement to trade talks with the United States has drawn criticism. Germany’s Monopolies Commission, an independent advisory body, stated that the delay sets a worrying precedent. Tomaso Duso, the chairman of the Commission, warned against letting the protection of competition become a “pawn of the Trump administration” in a statement. President Donald Trump has previously threatened retaliation against European authorities if they move too aggressively against American tech companies. The Commission’s decision to delay the fine is being viewed by some analysts as a strategic step to avoid triggering tensions during sensitive trade negotiations. People familiar with the matter also said the fine would be modest compared with earlier penalties levied on the company. The European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podesta told reporters at a daily briefing that the Google investigation is still ongoing and declined to provide further details. Google itself also hasn’t commented on the matter. The fine is a result of a four-year investigation into Google’s advertising technology practices, which started after a complaint from the European Publishers Council. Google has been accused of unfairly favoring its own services over those of rivals in the online advertising market. The eventual decision of the U.S. government concerning the duties on the automotive sector is important as the sector employs millions across the bloc and is central to the economies of Germany, France, and Italy. The fine against Google is symbolically important, but it does not carry the same economic weight as the duties. It is expected that once trade talks are concluded, the Commission will proceed with its decision. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Bitcoin has managed a modest 1.5% gain in the past 24 hours, yet other major tokens have either slipped or failed to move today. However, there are some very good trading opportunities in the market, including several presale and new tokens that could rally very strongly in the coming weeks. These are Maxi Doge, PEPENODE and Wall Street Pepe, which are among the best meme coins to buy now, and we’ll explain why in this article. Best Meme Coins to Buy Now Under $1 Maxi Doge (MAXI) Updating the Dogecoin template with a new, hyper-bullish attitude, Maxi Doge (MAXI) is an Ethereum-based meme token that has raised $1.7 million in its presale. This is a hugely encouraging number, especially given that Maxi Doge opened its presale only a few weeks ago. Caffeine in the veins, $MAXI in the wallet. pic.twitter.com/WMBH0v5SSa — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) September 1, 2025 It suggests that the token is quickly attracting new investors and supporters, something we also see from its follower count on X , which recently rose above 10,000. The reason for Maxi Doge’s growing popularity is that it has taken the whole meme token paradigm to a new level. It’s doing this in two ways, with the first being that it’s building an online community focused on trading. To this end, its Telegram and Discord channels will host regular trading competitions, inviting community members to outperform each other and post the biggest returns. Winners of these contests will earn prizes, something which will encourage greater encouragement with Maxi Doge and its ecosystem. Secondly, Maxi Doge extends the meme coin formula via its use of a Maxi Fund, which will equal 25% of its max supply (150.24 billion MAXI). It will use this fund to finance new partnerships and ad campaigns, which together will raise awareness of the project and help attract new investment. Holders of MAXI will also be able to stake the token, earning staking yields on top of any price appreciation. Investors can buy it now by going to its official website , where MAXI currently costs $0.000255. Visit the Official Website Here PEPENODE (PEPENODE) One of the newest meme tokens in the market, PEPENODE (PEPENODE) is a ‘mine-to-earn’ coin that opened its presale at the beginning of last month. It has already raised just over $500,000, with the ‘mine-to-earn’ meme coin turning heads by virtue of its unique approach to staking. Instead of offering an entirely passive system, PEPENODE is gamifying staking, enabling holders to participate in a mining game whereby they building virtual mining nodes and facilities. The idea is to encourage engagement, with users who participate more fully in PEPENODE’s gamified staking system receiving greater staking rewards. Other interesting features include tiered node incentives, in that the earliest adopters receive the most powerful virtual mining rigs, thereby enabling them to receive more staking rewards. There’s also a referral system, whereby community members can earn greater rewards by recruiting more users. This all has the potential to make PEPENODE one of the most profitable new projects for investors. They can get in early by going to the official PEPENODE website and joining its presale. PEPENODE is currently available at a price of $0.0010407, but this will rise in just under three days. Visit the Official Website Here Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Having had one of the biggest presales of 2024, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is in the process of undergoing a major revamp. Launching on Solana You can buy early Every dollar buy on $SOL = burns $WEPE on ETH Once ETH $WEPE hits $0.001 → $SOL Peg goes 1:1 Sol buy = Eth burn New site, new plans, the Solana expansion begins pic.twitter.com/c3GBYJZliX — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) August 19, 2025 Namely, it will be launching a Solana-based version of its WEPE coin, having already launched its Ethereum-based version after the closure of its presale last year. The idea is to take advantage of Solana’s superior scalability, with the coin inviting holders of its ERC-20 token to replace their holdings with Solana-based equivalents. In fact, its protocol will burn Ethereum-based WEPE at a 1:1 ratio whenever investors buy the new Solana-based version, ensuring a stable supply of the coin. More generally, Wall Street Pepe is another trading-focused meme coin that has built a community of cryptocurrency traders, who share tips and strategies on the coin’s channels. Yet Wall Street Pepe’s platform also provides trading signals and insights, helping community members to stay ahead of the market. It has grown considerably since its launch late last year, with its X account now having more than 67,000 followers. The Ethereum-based WEPE token has risen by 275% since late May, with its current price of $0.00005602 also representing a 14% gain in a fortnight. Such momentum is why WEPE is one of the best meme coins to buy at the moment, and the launch of its Solana version should only help its cause. Investors can buy the Solana-based WEPE at the Wall Street Pepe website for a price of $0.001.

The plunge came during a brutal four-day losing streak, cutting Nvidia’s market value by more than $340 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. That dip happened as investors started walking away from big AI names, and Nvidia is right at the center of that exit. The company’s four-day decline now totals over 7%, and this comes right after it delivered a soft revenue forecast last week, raising fresh doubts about how fast the AI boom is actually growing. Even with the sharp selloff, Nvidia’s still up 78% from its April low, holding on to a $4.1 trillion market cap, still ahead of Microsoft, which sits at $3.72 trillion. But that’s not helping calm nerves. Traders now worry the hype has peaked at least for now. Traders eye $160 as next key level for Nvidia Buff Dormeier, the chief technical analyst at Kingsview Partners, said Tuesday’s close below the 50-day average is a clear sign things are slowing down. “This shows how the momentum has broken down, and it makes me concerned about the stock over the short term,” Buff said . He’s now watching $160 as the next support, and if that fails, it’s $145, the same level where Nvidia bounced back in June. “If it breaks under $145, I’d be really concerned about its prospects,” Buff added. The selloff didn’t just hit Nvidia. The entire equity market came under pressure, with investors worrying about global tension and bloated tech valuations. That combination made it easier for fund managers to rotate out of high-flying AI stocks. Nvidia was a natural target. Despite recent gains, the stock has gone nearly vertical this year, making it vulnerable to even the slightest negative trigger. And that trigger came fast. Last week’s earnings guidance didn’t deliver the confidence Wall Street was hoping for. Analysts didn’t panic, but the tone definitely changed. Many are still forecasting over 25% upside based on average price targets, but no one’s pretending like the next leg up is guaranteed. As Buff put it, “There’s still long-term opportunity, but it seems like it has peaked for the short or intermediate term.” China builds its own AI chips as Nvidia faces pressure from both sides While Nvidia struggles to hold investor trust amid the rapidly growing AI market, China is pushing hard on its AI Plus plan, which will supposedly embed artificial intelligence across nearly every industry by 2030. This is backed by massive investment into homegrown chips, high-bandwidth memory, and a nationwide supercomputing buildout. Leading that effort is Cambricon, a local chipmaker that’s calling itself China’s Nvidia alternative, but Beijing doesn’t need Cambricon’s Siyuan chips to beat Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra. What it wants is “good enough” tech that can support the country’s AI ambitions without relying on U.S. suppliers. The country’s political class isn’t chasing performance. It wants control. And Cambricon gives it just that. That puts Nvidia in a nasty spot. The company is caught between Washington’s export restrictions and China’s push for chip independence. Trying to keep both sides happy is backfiring. Nvidia’s now serving two masters and satisfying neither, a problem that’s only going to get harder as the tech war and geopolitical pressure continue.

Data revealed that just 1,127 NFTs were recorded on August 1, 2025. This figure is the lowest in the network’s history. Ethereum NFT Collapses In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant noted that this sharp decline demonstrated how far the sector has fallen since the 2021-2022 boom, when NFTs dominated headlines and trading volumes soared. Even as crypto markets showed signs of recovery in 2024 and 2025, NFTs remained unable to capture the same momentum. Analysts attribute the collapse to several factors, such as fading investor enthusiasm, an oversupply of low-quality collections, and a decisive liquidity shift toward newer narratives such as Layer 2 DeFi innovations and real-world asset tokenization. Ethereum is long considered the central hub for NFTs. Hence, the consequence of this historic low could be significant, which could affect not only Ethereum’s fee generation but also the sustainability of NFT marketplaces and the outlook for long-term holders. The bleak August figures follow a surprisingly positive July. NFT July Resurgence DappRadar had recently revealed that NFT activity levels surpassed DeFi in July for the first time in months. Trading volume within the sector jumped 96%, and climbed to $530 million, although the total number of sales slipped by 4% to 5 million. Interestingly, the average price of an NFT increased significantly, more than doubling from $52 in June to $105 in July, as demand for established, high-value collections intensified. On Ethereum, Blur accounted for as much as 80% of daily trading activity during the same period, owing to professional traders and lending services through its Blend platform. On the other hand, OpenSea strengthened its position as the go-to platform for broader participation, as it averaged 27,000 daily traders and maintained strong cross-chain support. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s Layer 2 network, Base has also emerged as one of the hottest ecosystems for NFTs since its launch two years ago. Since January, Base NFTs have amassed $122 million in trading volume across 6.7 million sales.

Both agencies have had tensions in the past, primarily due to overlapping jurisdictions and opposing regulatory approaches, particularly where cryptocurrencies are concerned. Regulators encourage more crypto listing markets The SEC and CFTC shared their proposed collaboration on Tuesday in a joint statement released via official channels. The effort is to be carried out in furtherance of the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint. It was reportedly facilitated by the President’s Working Group, which urged both agencies to coordinate oversight in order to promote regulatory clarity and keep blockchain innovation within the United States. As part of this mandate, the SEC and CFTC divisions plan to issue guidance on the listing of leveraged, margined or financed spot retail commodity transactions involving digital assets. According to the joint statement, the divisions will collaborate to provide regulatory clarity while reducing jurisdictional overlap. The statement pointed out that the current law allows SEC- or CFTC-registered exchanges to facilitate the trading of certain spot crypto asset products, and invited market participants to engage directly with staff via filings, registrations or requests for relief. The coordination is founded on prior guidance, including the SEC’s digital asset framework and the CFTC’s market advisories. However, it differs in that it focuses on the harmonization of regulatory approaches rather than enforcement actions alone. In the statement, the clearing and settlement, market surveillance, and public dissemination of trading data as priorities for joint attention was also highlighted. This plan to work together is proof that the agencies are now ready to provide clearer compliance pathways. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said: “Market participants should have the freedom to choose where they trade spot crypto assets.” CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham said: “Under the prior administration, our agencies sent mixed signals about regulation and compliance in digital asset markets, but the message was clear: innovation was not welcome. That chapter is over.” The announcement has triggered euphoria on social media as crypto natives expect further clarity and increased adoption as a result of the collaboration. CFTC will allow spot crypto contracts on federally regulated exchanges The joint statement from the SEC and CFTC comes weeks after it revealed a program that would let established exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , which are CFTC-registered Designated Contract Markets, to list and trade spot contracts for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. 🚨 The NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE, CME, etc, will soon have spot trading for BTC, ETH, and more. https://t.co/qZo3YsYDQA — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) September 2, 2025 Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, commented on the statement, highlighting that “the NYSE, Nasdaq, CBOE, CME, etc, will soon have spot trading for BTC, ETH, and more.” By settling in the actual token rather than cash and reflecting the current price of the underlying cryptocurrency asset, these contracts have the potential to improve market integrity and price transparency. These established exchanges listing crypto would also signal mainstream acceptance of crypto. They are venues known to be highly regulated and trusted by institutional and retail investors, which means BTC, ETH, and other assets will be more accessible to traditional investors who may have been hesitant to engage with crypto-specific platforms like Coinbase or Binance.

With Wall Street recognition, real-world use, and better approval odds, experts believe the XRP ETF could be one of the most successful crypto ETF launches yet. Expert Expectations Rise For XRP ETF Launch Canary Capital has shared some of the boldest expectations for the XRP product. Steven McClurg, a leading executive at the firm, states that XRP is now the second-most recognized cryptocurrency on Wall Street, after Bitcoin. The Wall Street status is essential because institutional investors would often prefer assets with which they are already familiar and have a clear understanding. McClurg, the CEO of Canary Capital, predicts that XRP ETFs could generate $5 billion in inflows within the first 30 days. That is more than the $3.26 billion Bitcoin ETFs got in their first month. It is also much stronger than Ethereum ETFs, which had a very weak start. McClurg says this shows the trust and interest that professional investors already have in XRP. The strength of XRP in the EFT market, he explains, comes from its real-world utility. Financial institutions and banks have utilized the digital asset for a long time to transfer money across countries faster and at lower costs. In this context, he notes that XRP differs from many digital assets that serve solely speculative purposes. Because the token already integrates into parts of the existing payment system, experts argue that investors will view it as a more reliable option for long-term exposure, backed by an ETF. Expert Points To Catalysts For XRP ETF Success Another reason the expert is hopeful is the strong XRP community, also known as the “XRP Army.” This community could generate substantial trading volumes immediately after launch. Its strength may also protect the ETF from problems that other products have faced. For example, Ethereum ETFs had a very tough start in July 2024. They lost $483 million in the first month alone. Significant withdrawals from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust exacerbated the problem, and investor confidence declined. The Canary CEO believes that the XRP ETF will perform better due to its real-world utility, rather than speculation . Regulation is also moving in a positive direction . The chances of approval for the XRP ETF have gone up from 86% to 87%. While it may not seem like a significant leap, experts believe it is still progress and anticipate that more assets, such as Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin, could receive ETF approval by the end of 2025. Futures-based XRP products already exist, which makes it easier for regulators to approve a spot ETF . With strong community support and rising approval chances, the XRP ETF could outperform earlier crypto ETF products.",XRP|XRP ETF|XRP ETFs|XRP experts|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-02 23:00:10

After years of uncertainty, sentiment around adoption and real-world payments is improving. The core question for traders and long-term holders is simple: can XRP finally make a run to 10 dollars in 2025? While Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to pull most of the institutional flow, some investors are diversifying beyond the leaders. That’s why early-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE are getting attention as potential high-upside complements to a portfolio built around top assets. Why XRP Could Target $10 The path to double digits needs three things to line up: stronger liquidity, rising utility in payment corridors, and a supportive macro environment. If capital keeps rotating from majors into high-cap altcoins, XRP could benefit from deeper order books and tighter spreads, which historically supports larger price moves. More banks and fintechs testing tokenization and instant settlement can also lift on-chain activity, a key signal for sustained rallies. What must go right First, momentum from Bitcoin staying strong above six figures tends to expand risk appetite for altcoins. Second, steady growth in cross-border volume would reinforce XRP’s use case and help market price in future demand. Third, cleaner global rules around digital assets would encourage bigger participants to step in, improving liquidity and helping price discovery. The Rising Crypto Star In the middle of all this market action, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been flagged by early adopters as a high-potential bet. Presale allocations have been moving quickly, with growing wallet participation and a community focused on long-term utility, not just hype. The appeal is straightforward: limited early access , ongoing development, and a push to reward holders as the ecosystem expands. For investors building a barbell strategy – established large caps on one side, carefully chosen early-stage tokens on the other – MAGACOIN FINANCE is being watched as a possible breakout . XRP Price Scenarios for 2025 Bullish case: a strong altcoin season, rising payment volumes, and improved exchange liquidity could create the conditions for a breakout toward $10. This would likely need persistent weekly closes at higher highs, consistent volume expansion, and supportive macro headlines. Base case: if adoption and liquidity improve at a steady pace but the market rotates more slowly, XRP could grind into the $6 to $8 range, setting the stage for a later attempt at double digits. Bearish case: if Bitcoin dominance stays elevated or macro risk flares up, XRP might top out between $3 and $5 and wait for a better window. Sharp pullbacks are common in bull markets, so managing entries and avoiding heavy leverage near resistance becomes important. Conclusion A run to $10 is not guaranteed, but for the first time in years the setup looks achievable if utility, liquidity, and market conditions align. For investors who want both stability and shot-at-moon potential, combining a core position in large caps like XRP with a selective early-stage pick such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is one way to play 2025’s bull market.

Analyst Outlines Potential For Explosive Growth,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/wlfi-the-next-cult-coin-analyst-outlines-potential-for-explosive-growth/,"The recent debut of the World Liberty Financial token (WLFI) in the cryptocurrency market has generated considerable buzz, despite facing notable price retracements within just 24 hours of trading. Despite WLFI’s 25% price retrace in the 24-hour time frame, one market analyst believes that the cryptocurrency has the potential to emerge as this year’s “cult coin,” with significant price potential for the remainder of the bull cycle. Could WLFI Soar 330% In 2025? In a detailed post on X (formerly Twitter), analyst Virtual Bacon drew comparisons to previously called cult coins, such as XRP in 2017 and Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2021, suggesting that WLFI could follow a similar price trajectory in 2025. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Could Start On September 13, Analyst Predicts The circulating supply of WLFI currently stands at 24.6 billion tokens, with approximately 6.9% actively tradable. A key point raised by Bacon is the transparent unlock schedule for various stakeholder tokens. While 20% of the supply is designated for public sale investors and 2.8% is allocated for liquidity and exchanges, the team and investor tokens remain locked. This contrasts with the circumstances surrounding other tokens which experienced a dramatic crash due to a high fully diluted valuation (FDV) and a limited float. Bacon argues that WLFI’s model is healthier, featuring a fair distribution of liquidity across exchanges and gradual unlocks that mitigate the risks associated with sudden price drops. Notably, the analyst’s price target for WLFI is set at $1, which he believes would bring the token’s fully diluted valuation to $100 billion and its market cap to $24.6 billion. As of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.23. That potential scenario could mean a 330% price increase. That could also propel the token toward 11th place among the top cryptocurrencies, positioning it alongside Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA). Catalysts That Could Drive Token Growth And Market Surge Virtual Bacon also addressed comparisons to the TRUMP memecoin launched earlier this year, acknowledging that while WLFI may eventually face an 80% drop like many altcoins, it is fundamentally different. Unlike TRUMP, which experienced a rapid ascent beyond $70 before entering a major downtrend, the analyst notes that WLFI boasts “real integrations,” ties to US Treasuries, and institutional backing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mirrors Historical Pullback Ranges – Healthy Correction Or Trouble Ahead? Virtual Bacon identified key catalysts that could drive WLFI’s growth. These include the development of a retail app for and payment solutions, a lending and borrowing platform, and the anticipation of a social media post from President Donald Trump regarding WLFI, which could significantly boost its visibility and market activity. The analyst also mentioned that interest in the recently launched cryptocurrency has outperformed that of major altcoins, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), which he believes indicates a potential cult following that could drive liquidity. Ultimately, Virtual Bacon argues that WLFI’s fair tokenomics, transparent supply structure, strong institutional support, and growing retail momentum position it favorably for the future and strong performance in the upcoming months.

ETF decisions and technical setups suggest upside may still be on the table. Yet as XRP gears up for its next move, a rising star called MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention, positioning it as one of the most exciting altcoin stories for 2025. XRP Bullish Breakout Targets $5.50 The latest XRP price analysis today points toward a short-term rally in the $4.30–$4.50 range, triggered by a completed cup-and-handle pattern above $3.20. If ETF approval aligns with this setup, analysts expect XRP to ride that momentum higher. A mid-cycle push toward $5.00 becomes increasingly possible with the launch of the leveraged ProShares Ultra XRP ETF. In this case, institutional inflows could act as the spark that transforms the XRP price forecast 2025 into a sustained bull run. From there, the XRP bullish breakout target remains $5.50, with RippleNet adoption and liquid staking support forming the backbone of this projection. For long-term traders, this level is not just psychological—it aligns with the expected benefits of XRP ETF momentum as multiple SEC decisions approach. Grayscale XRP ETF decision: October 18, 2025 21Shares XRP ETF decision: October 19, 2025 Bitwise XRP ETF decision: October 20, 2025 These back-to-back rulings could confirm whether XRP joins the list of the best altcoins with ETF potential , a category investors increasingly track as part of their XRP investment forecast strategies. MAGACOIN FINANCE Targets Major ROI in 2025 While the focus has been on Ripple ETF speculation, traders are also shifting attention toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. The project has set ambitious projections, with analysts targeting a 1200% ROI . Retail excitement is snowballing, with FOMO levels pushing demand higher week after week. In terms of positioning, MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform many rivals in the crypto ETF momentum 2025 narrative. While XRP has the ETF-driven setup, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers that under-the-radar opportunity that many see as a chance to catch an early wave. For investors asking, “Can XRP reach $5.50 with ETF momentum?” the answer may still be yes—but a portion of capital is now flowing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, where traders see asymmetric upside. The Bigger Market Outlook Ahead The XRP market outlook remains strong with $5.50 on the horizon, but it is not the only token riding the ETF narrative. The push for approvals has expanded across multiple assets, making XRP bullish prediction compared to other ETF-linked cryptos a central debate in the altcoin space. As for XRP price prediction with ETF-driven growth , the technical path looks favorable, with retail and institutional demand aligning. Still, investors searching for explosive growth are finding MAGACOIN FINANCE hard to ignore.

51095852,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81439,1756855938,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Sends September Warning to XRP Holders. Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/expert-sends-september-warning-to-xrp-holders-heres-what-to-expect/,"Crypto Jack (@That_CryptoNerd), a crypto enthusiast and multi-millionaire, has issued a cautionary note for crypto investors looking to engage with the market this month. He warned of persistent bearish conditions, suggesting that XRP could decline toward $2. His comment follows a sharp pullback in late August that continued into the start of September , reinforcing concerns that the token might not be immune to broader market weakness this month. The community has often observed September as a difficult period for digital assets, and XRP appears to be following that pattern once again. Market volatility in recent weeks has placed additional pressure on the asset, and some traders are preparing for further downside before any recovery takes place. SEPTEMBER WARNING Expecting bearish markets, $XRP to dip to $2.00~ After that, alt season kicks off in Q4. What is your plan? — Crypto Jack (@That_CryptoNerd) September 1, 2025 Possibility of a Strong Q4 Despite the warning for September, Crypto Jack also expressed optimism for later in the year. Altcoin markets tend to recover strongly toward the end of the year, and suggest that the fourth quarter could mark the start of renewed growth. XRP experienced a major surge in late 2024, rising over 500% between November 2024 and January 2025. One of the major contributors to that surge was the highly anticipated Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts , as the market expects a cut on September 17 . If the Fed cuts rates, it could set the stage for renewed momentum in XRP during Q4. Lower interest rates generally drive investors toward risk assets, and digital currencies often benefit from the resulting liquidity shift. Given that XRP’s last significant rally was closely tied to a similar policy move, many in the market believe another cut could trigger renewed inflows and support a strong Q4 performance, especially if altcoin season materializes . Community Responses The post generated a range of reactions from the XRP community. One user dismissed the $2 outlook, arguing that the asset would hold closer to $1.3 or $1.5 instead, and expressed frustration at repeated predictions of steep drops. He also called XRP a scam and stated that the community would have to wait four years, tying XRP’s performance to the post-halving bullish cycle. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member took a different perspective, noting that while September has historically been a bearish month, last year’s performance suggested the pattern may be changing. Data from CryptoRank shows that XRP has closed September on a positive note every year since 2022. With interest rate cuts on the horizon, the asset could maintain this streak in 2025.

The price of Solana is still close to $200, but technical resistance could stop it from going up any more. SUI crypto is having a hard time with supply unlock pressure, even though the ecosystem is growing. Analysts say that in this situation, the new project Remittix (RTX ) is stealing the show and is the best altcoin to buy right now because it is being used in the real world and has huge upside potential. The price of Solana stays at $200, but there are still risks The price of Solana is currently holding steady between $198 and $200, which is in the middle of a rising channel that has been guiding gains since spring. Last week, buyers defended the $190–$195 zone. On-chain data showed that $86.9 million worth of coins left exchanges, which meant that people were buying more coins. The recent launch of stablecoin USD1 on Solana could make liquidity even better and increase DeFi activity. But technicals say to be careful. If this area isn’t cleared, the price could go back down to $185 or even $195. A daily close above $202 to $205 would give bulls back control and set targets at $212 to $222. Analysts say that the Solana price is still good for the next few months, but if momentum doesn’t pick up, the price could be very volatile in September, which could test investors’ patience. SUI Crypto Faces Supply Pressure Amid Growth After a year of ups and downs, SUI crypto is now trading near $3.27. It went up to over $5 before going back down. Monthly token unlocks are still a big deal because they add new supply and often cause short-term sell-offs. For example, in August 2025, a planned release caused the token to drop sharply, showing how easily SUI crypto can be diluted. Despite these problems, Sui’s DeFi ecosystem has grown slowly but surely, drawing in users through connections with Bitcoin-related products and decentralized exchanges. SUI crypto is popular with developers because its flexible architecture is made for games, payments, and tokenizing assets. But there is a lot of competition from Solana and Ethereum, and analysts say that demand needs to grow quickly to make up for the pressure on supply. If adoption picks up, SUI crypto could test its early-2025 highs again. On the other hand, a bearish case says it could fall back to early-2024 levels. Why Remittix Leads As Best Altcoin To Buy Today There is a lot of talk among traders about the future of the Solana price and SUI crypto, but many analysts are saying that Remittix (RTX) is the best altcoin to buy right now for the best return on investment. Remittix is different from speculative tokens because it is building in the PayFi sector. It lets you send money directly from one cryptocurrency to a bank in more than 30 countries with flat fees, real-time FX quotes, and a Pay API that merchants can use. Remittix has already raised more than $23.2 million and sold more than 639 million tokens. Right now, the price is only $0.103. It has been listed on BitMart and LBANK, and a beta version of its wallet is set to come out in the third quarter of 2025. It will support more than 40 cryptocurrencies and more than 30 fiat currencies. These milestones in adoption, along with its payments-first strategy, give it a real-world use case that Solana price action and SUI crypto volatility can’t match in terms of risk and reward. Key Highlights Driving Remittix Momentum $23.2 million raised BitMart and LBANK listings confirmed Q3 2025 wallet beta with 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiats Transparent fees with real-time FX quotes Merchant-ready Pay API for freelancers and businesses Conclusion The price of Solana looks good, but it is being held back by resistance near $210. On the other hand, SUI crypto is still at risk of dilution even though the ecosystem is growing. Remittix, on the other hand, is becoming known as the best altcoin to buy right now because it has exchange listings, adoption milestones, and a clear roadmap. Analysts say that RTX offers the kind of early-stage upside that Solana and Sui no longer do, making it a good choice for investors looking for the best return on investment in 2025.

A rare divergence pattern is fueling speculation of a massive reversal, with analysts eyeing a potential rally that could stretch as high as $0.000081. But can SHIB really sustain the momentum for such an explosive rally? Bullish Divergence Sparks Hopes Of A Reversal In a recent update shared on X, Javon Marks revealed that Shiba Inu has confirmed a bullish pattern through a regular bullish divergence on the MACD histogram. This technical development signals a notable shift in momentum that could mark the beginning of a major reversal for SHIB, with buyers slowly regaining control of the market structure. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Forms Double Bottom At Demand Zone — What To Expect Javon Marks further explained that this signal points to a possible 163% surge, which could lift SHIB back into the $0.00003 range. Such a move would not only signal renewed bullish strength but also mark an important recovery from the recent periods of consolidation and price weakness that have kept the token under pressure. The analyst also stressed that this projection may represent only the first leg of a much larger rally, suggesting that the token is preparing for a sustained upward move rather than a short-lived bounce. Looking further ahead, Javon Marks outlined an even more ambitious scenario for SHIB. If bullish momentum continues to build, the breakout pattern could fuel an extraordinary 570% run, potentially driving the price toward the $0.000081 target. Such a move would dramatically reshape SHIB’s long-term outlook, establishing it as one of the most aggressive rebound moments in the crypto market. Shiba Inu Key Technical Outlook Presently, the first significant resistance sits near $0.000017, a level that has acted as a barrier in recent sessions. A successful close above this zone could open the door toward $0.0000204, and potentially drive SHIB toward the $0.0000263 mark. Breaking through these levels would confirm renewed bullish momentum and could encourage further accumulation by buyers. Related Reading: How High Can Shiba Inu Climb In 2025? Analyst Gives Candid Outlook On the downside, SHIB has immediate support around $0.0000080, which aligns with recent lows. A deeper pullback could test the $0.0000065 region, where the 100-day moving average currently provides backup. If bears manage to push the price below this level, SHIB risks revisiting the $0.00000534 support area, which would likely increase selling pressure. For now, Shiba Inu remains in a wait-and-see zone. A decisive break above resistance could spark a bullish continuation, while failure to hold above near-term support might expose the token to further downside.

At the same time, an early-stage altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is catching attention from investors searching for the next high-growth opportunity. This move highlights how the market narrative is changing from Bitcoin dominance to a broader focus on yield, utility, and scarcity plays. Bitcoin Correction Sparks Rotation Bitcoin recently fell from highs above $124,000 to the $108,000 – $114,000 range. Analysts note that this wasn’t caused by one single event but by a combination of weak macroeconomic data, stock market declines, and whale sell-offs. On-chain data showed one long-time holder unloading over 100,000 BTC, sparking further selling and exposing just how powerful these players remain in driving short-term price action. Ethereum Gains Whale Confidence Ethereum has become the key winner in this shift. With the approval of spot ETFs and greater clarity under the CLARITY Act, ETH has grown far more accessible for institutions. Its staking yields also attract investors seeking passive income, while its robust DeFi and smart contract ecosystem provide clear growth potential. A single whale transaction of $217 million from BTC into ETH emphasized just how much conviction big players now have in Ethereum’s future. The Hidden Gem of 2025 Beyond Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout option for those looking to get in early. Presale rounds have been selling out at record speed, and early buyers have already seen returns surpassing 7,800% . With limited allocations left and growing demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a reputation as one of the rare altcoins offering both scarcity and exponential upside potential . Analysts suggest it could mirror the kind of breakout growth only seen in the earliest days of past market leaders. The Road Ahead Bitcoin remains the market anchor, but its role is changing. Whales and institutions are clearly diversifying into assets that offer yields, utility, and room for explosive growth. Ethereum’s strength and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity play show how investor strategies are shifting, signaling that the next phase of the bull run may be defined less by Bitcoin dominance and more by high-growth alternatives.

Each coin has strong community backing, ongoing upgrades, or breakout potential, making them attractive to traders searching for affordable entries. These names dominate retail sentiment, though some analysts argue that newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are starting to attract the kind of attention that previously powered Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. SHIBA INU (SHIBA) — Burn Events and Breakout Potential Shiba Inu is maintaining its place as one of the most visible meme coins, thanks to a combination of supply reduction strategies and sustained community energy. Priced near $0.00001322, SHIBA has delivered bullish chart patterns in recent weeks that analysts view as precursors to another breakout run. The introduction of Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution, has added to this optimism by enabling faster transactions and strengthening Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. With increased use cases and ongoing development, the project is positioning itself as more than just a meme-driven token. Market forecasts point toward the possibility of SHIBA reaching $0.000081 in the coming cycle. This kind of upside, combined with large-scale token burns and retail accumulation, keeps it firmly on the list of best cryptos under $10. Its established brand power and improving fundamentals make it a candidate for sustained growth if momentum carries forward. ADA (Cardano) — Network Expansion and Institutional Interest Cardano, trading under $1 at around $0.87, continues to attract attention as a top-tier blockchain platform. Often compared to Ethereum, ADA benefits from its emphasis on scalability, governance, and academic-driven development. Analysts say this disciplined approach has given Cardano one of the strongest foundations among altcoins under $10. Institutional interest has risen throughout 2025, as upgrades to the network have expanded Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. Notably, hundreds of millions in value are now locked across its DeFi applications, and developer activity continues to trend upward. This growth is building confidence that Cardano can remain competitive in the next cycle. Undoubtedly, ADA’s appeal lies in accessibility for retail investors. The crypto token’s relatively low price point, combined with consistent ecosystem progress, makes it an affordable way to gain exposure to smart contract adoption. Analysts highlight that its blend of institutional support and grassroots developer engagement keeps ADA attractive for both long-term holders and active traders. BONK — Solana’s Meme Coin Power Play Among Solana-based tokens, BONK has emerged as a standout. Priced below $0.01, it has gained traction as one of the most liquid meme coins tied to the network. Whale-driven trading has helped it sustain high activity, while liquidity support has prevented the extreme volatility seen in some smaller meme assets. BONK’s strength also comes from its integration into Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Unlike many meme coins that exist in isolation, BONK has been connected to lending, trading, and liquidity platforms across Solana. This level of use-case integration makes it more resilient than meme coins built purely on hype. Investors see BONK as a high-beta way to track Solana’s overall expansion. If Solana continues to secure institutional flows and DeFi adoption, BONK is well-positioned to capture that momentum. BONK remains one of the most promising options for traders seeking sub-$10 assets with both meme appeal and network relevance. PEPE — High-Risk, High-Reward Momentum PEPE has solidified its reputation as a high-risk, high-reward play. Still priced under $0.01, the meme coin thrives on viral attention and waves of speculative buying. Its growth this year has been tied closely to social sentiment, with rallies often sparked by retail campaigns on social media platforms. Analysts caution that volatility is the defining trait of PEPE, making it a coin that can deliver explosive upside or sharp reversals. For many traders, that risk is precisely what makes it attractive, particularly as they seek meme-driven cycles capable of producing outsized returns. Despite the risks, PEPE’s growing holder base and consistent trading volume highlight continued interest. Its place among the best cryptos under $10 is secured by its role as one of the most active meme coins in 2025, even if it appeals mainly to investors with a higher tolerance for uncertainty. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Best Crypto to Buy Under $10 Among the crowded field of low-cost tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being singled out by analysts as the best crypto to buy under $10 in 2025. Still priced around fractions of a cent, it offers investors a chance to secure exposure at levels that could multiply dramatically once exchange listings arrive. What is driving the excitement is the scale of its forecasted upside. Analysts project potential gains of up to 12,000% in the next cycle, a figure that has fueled comparisons to the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Retail investors are rushing to lock in allocations, while whales have also begun rotating into the project, signaling growing conviction in its breakout potential. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the rare combination of low entry point and high forecasted return that defines life-changing crypto opportunities. With momentum building fast, it has become the sub-$10 token attracting the strongest FOMO across the market this year. Conclusion — Retail Favorites and Newcomer Opportunities The best cryptos under $10 in August 2025 continue to be led by SHIBA, ADA, BONK, and PEPE, each offering unique appeal through community support, institutional adoption, or meme-driven speculation. They remain accessible entry points for investors looking to participate in the market without the high costs of Bitcoin or Ethereum. At the same time, newer meme projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are beginning to command attention, offering the kind of exponential upside that established names may no longer provide. So, the focus is no longer on the known names within the crypto community as only projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE can produce the life-changing returns.

51097100,572160,1756857658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51097100.jpeg,"Banks Won’t Trust Ripple And XRP, SWIFT CIO Says",https://bitcoinist.com/banks-wont-trust-ripple-and-xrp-swift-cio-says/,"Ripple and XRP were thrust into the spotlight after SWIFT chief innovation officer (CIO) Tom Zschach delivered a pointed critique on LinkedIn—widely read as a jab at the company and its XRP token—over what actually constitutes “resilience” for banks and how institutional trust is earned. The exchange began under a comment praising Ripple’s regulatory endurance, where Zschach countered bluntly: “Surviving lawsuits isn’t resilience. Neutral, shared governance is. Institutions don’t want to live on a competitor’s rails.” He followed by rejecting the notion that a single firm’s rapport with watchdogs equals compliance, writing: “And compliance isn’t about one company convincing regulators it should be allowed to operate. It’s about an entire industry agreeing on shared standards that no single balance sheet controls.” Ripple Vs. SWIFT Zschach then broadened the frame in a longer post about how banks actually adopt technology. “Every major shift in finance begins the same way. Technology lays the foundation but trust decides when the building opens.” He recalled that previous “next big things” in finance stalled not on throughput, but on the absence of compliance and security. The parallel he drew to public blockchains in 2025 was explicit: they are becoming too consequential to ignore—“Tokenized treasuries. Collateral on-chain. Cross-border payments that actually settle”—yet raw technical performance is not the finish line. They think the public chain itself is the solution. It isn’t,” he argued, calling public networks “the base environment for execution,” powerful for deterministic, programmable settlement but insufficient without the “trust layer” of legal enforceability, compliance, and privacy. Without that layer, he warned, a public chain is “a fast engine with no cockpit.” Crucially, Zschach’s critique drew a governance boundary that cuts to the heart of Ripple’s pitch to banks without naming the company. He re-centered the conversation on neutrality and shared control, rather than on the courtroom durability or regulatory narratives of any single firm. In his words, institutions want “shared standards that no single balance sheet controls,” and they will resist depending on “a competitor’s rails.” He extended the caution to consortia as well: “If a bank joins a chain owned or controlled by another bank then they are accepting someone else’s governance, incentives and rules of the game. In today’s environment is that a form of dependency that banks will be comfortable with?” The throughline is that institutional adoption hinges less on whether one vendor has outlasted enforcement actions and more on whether the infrastructure is credibly neutral, co-governed, and enforceable in law. Zschach’s taxonomy of public chains as “substrate” underscores how he expects the industry to evolve. In biology, computing, and construction, a substrate is foundational; what matters for banks is what gets layered above it. He urged builders not to “fight the public chains” but to harness them while solving for compliance from day one and for privacy “without killing transparency.” That is where he believes the “opportunity lies,” with finance ultimately “absorbing the best of public chains on its own terms.” The open question he posed back to the market—“When will banks and financial institutions truly trust public blockchains and at what pace will that trust build?”—puts the burden of proof on governance design and standards alignment, not on marketing milestones. For Ripple and XRP, the implication is clear even if Zschach never typed the name in his critique: the bar for bank adoption isn’t surviving litigation or securing green lights for a specific product stack; it is convincing the industry that the rails they ride are neutral, shared, and not controlled by any single company’s balance sheet (like Ripple’s escrow still controlling more than 35% of all XRP). In that lens, resilience is measured in how power is distributed, how rules are enforced, and how privacy and compliance are engineered—precisely the dimensions Zschach says decide “when the building opens.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.77.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|Ripple vs SWIFT|SWIFT|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-03 00:00:58

51096951,https://timestabloid.com/?p=81441,1756857752,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s XRP Likely Price If 10% of Supply Is Burned,https://timestabloid.com/heres-xrp-likely-price-if-10-of-supply-is-burned/,"Analysts continue to explore how XRP’s value could respond to a whopping reduction in supply. While the XRP Ledger (XRPL) already has a built-in burn mechanism, projections suggest that a more substantial burn event, such as eliminating 10% of the total tokens, could lead to a notable shift in XRP’s price trajectory. How the Burn Mechanism Works Every transaction on the XRPL requires a small fee, which is permanently destroyed rather than redistributed. This process was introduced not as a method of creating scarcity, but as a measure to discourage spam transactions. Since the ledger went live more than 13 years ago, just 14.19 million XRP have been burned. This figure represents only about 0.014% of the total maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. At the current burn rate , which averages around 600 tokens per day due to reduced network activity, it would take more than a millennium to destroy even 1% of the supply. This slow pace has led some community members to argue for accelerated methods of removing tokens. However, the broader impact of a larger-scale burn remains a subject of debate. XRP Projected Price if 10% of Supply Burned To examine the potential outcome of a more aggressive burn scenario, Google Gemini modeled what might happen if 10 billion XRP, equivalent to 10% of the total supply, were removed from circulation. At the time of press, XRP trades around $2.79 with a circulating supply of approximately 59.48 billion tokens, giving it a market capitalisation of roughly $166 billion. If the supply were reduced to 49.48 billion tokens while the market cap remained constant, the price would increase to $3.25. Market Reactions and Short-Term Effects Google Gemini emphasized that markets are unlikely to respond mechanically to such a major event. A sudden burn of this magnitude could attract investor attention, drive buying interest, and increase speculative activity. In that case, XRP might initially rally toward the $4 to $5 range as traders respond to the deflationary shock. The AI model further suggested that breaking past XRP’s historical peak of $3.84 would be probable under these circumstances. This could establish a new baseline for the asset and generate stronger momentum in the medium term. XRP Long-Term Projections In a sustained scenario of higher demand combined with a reduced circulating supply, Gemini projected that XRP could stabilize within the $10 to $15 range . At those levels, the market capitalization would stand between $495 billion and $742 billion. Such a valuation would place XRP among the top global digital assets. However, achieving and maintaining these levels would require consistent adoption and liquidity growth.

Modeling by Google Gemini indicates that a 10% reduction could initially push XRP above $5 and potentially position it for a longer-term range between $10 and $15. Still, the actual impact would depend heavily on investor behaviour, market conditions, and the broader adoption of Ripple’s technology.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7256 Market cap $766.95M Trading volume (24-hour) $21.87M Circulating supply 1.057B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.7283 24-hour low $0.7049 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 5.69% 50-day SMA $0.8267 14-Day RSI 38.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6600 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is still trending down on the daily chart. The 4-hour chart shows a bounce attempt but capped by $0.73–$0.75. XTZ’s key support zone remains at $0.69–$0.70. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos ($XTZ) remains in a clear downtrend as of September 3, with lower highs and lower lows pressing price toward the lower Bollinger Band near $0.69. Today’s candle shows hesitation after a small relief bounce, but momentum remains weak as the MACD stays negative and RSI lingers around 45, below neutral. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView Immediate resistance is stacked at $0.79–$0.89, while $0.69 is the nearest support level. Unless XTZ reclaims $0.79, the structure favors further downside or sideways consolidation. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, XTZ has shown a short-term bounce off $0.69–$0.70 support, pushing back toward the $0.72–$0.73 area where the 21 SMA is also pressing down. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume picked up on the move higher, but the rejection just below $0.73 highlights resistance, with stronger supply likely around $0.74–$0.75. Losing $0.70 would reopen downside to $0.69 or lower, while clearing $0.74 would start shifting momentum in favor of buyers. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6986 BUY SMA 5 $0.7457 SELL SMA 10 $0.7825 SELL SMA 21 $0.8168 SELL SMA 50 $0.8267 SELL SMA 100 $0.7036 BUY SMA 200 $0.6600 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7985 SELL EMA 5 $0.7789 SELL EMA 10 $0.7272 SELL EMA 21 $0.6863 BUY EMA 50 $0.7122 BUY EMA 100 $0.8034 SELL EMA 200 $0.8751 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Unless buyers reclaim the $0.74 price level with positive volume momentum, XTZ is more likely to stay range-bound or revisit $0.70, with $0.69 acting as the decisive support level. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos XTZ August Roundup 🌟 August was a big month for Tezos.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before correcting to an average of $0.72 in February, then consolidated below $0.70 from March through May with a combined average of about $0.66. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it saw an average price of $0.7232. The coin kicked off August at $0.7605 and maintained an average price of $0.8212 throughout the month.

Following multiple price swings this year, the prevailing question is whether the meme coin can still push upwards to its all-time high price. Amidst the volatility, Dogecoin briefly climbed above $0.22 before it succumbed to bearish pressure. With the leading meme coin showing signs of recovery, many are asking if Shiba Inu and BONK can replicate the upward push too and deliver 40% gains to holders. As the conversation continues, MAGACOIN FINANCE has slipped in as a cheap early-stage meme token, offering investors a high upside potential in the coming bull cycles. Dogecoin’s Short-Term Path For now, Dogecoin seems stuck in a holding pattern. Analysts see the coin trading between $0.21 and $0.27 through September, with forecasts averaging around $0.26. That may not sound like fireworks, but given DOGE’s reputation for sharp swings, even small moves keep it on traders’ radar. However, whales are still making waves. A single 900 million DOGE transfer last month sent prices sliding 5% in just 24 hours. That said, network health looks solid, with mining hashrates sitting near all-time highs — a sign the backbone of DOGE remains strong. Year-End Targets Looking ahead to December, predictions are all over the map. Conservative models peg DOGE between $0.20 and $0.25, basically keeping it flat. On the other hand, bullish scenarios stretch as high as $0.70, hinging on ETF approvals and wider adoption for payments. Most forecasts settle somewhere in the middle, around $0.28, which suggests modest growth with plenty of volatility along the way. And with companies like Bit Origin pledging up to $500 million in Dogecoin treasuries, institutional demand may prove to be a wild card. Will SHIB and BONK Tag Along? Shiba Inu is grinding in a tight range, but the technical picture is starting to look brighter. A Golden Cross on the charts—where the 50-day average crosses above the 200-day—has bulls watching for a potential breakout. If SHIB clears resistance near $0.0000145, history suggests the move could run 30–40%. BONK, meanwhile, is buzzing again in Solana circles. While still a speculative play, analysts think it could ride the same meme-coin tide if DOGE keeps its momentum. In other words, if Dogecoin runs, BONK could sprint. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Low Entry, Clock Ticking As the three dominant meme coins navigate the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting early traction from a growing number of investors. Historically, every market cycle produces an early-stage token that explodes beyond estimation . Analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as the next. Already, thousands of investors have taken advantage of its low price to position themselves. On-chain data shows that even whale investors joined in the buying frenzy, and analysts say retail investors will soon follow. Outlook Dogecoin reclaiming $0.22 has breathed life back into the meme-coin market. Whether SHIB and BONK can deliver the same kind of gains remains to be seen, but technical setups suggest the potential is there. And with new players like MAGACOIN FINANCE catching early interest, it is clear the appetite for high-reward tokens isn’t fading anytime soon. The next few weeks will tell if this bounce is just a blip — or the start of another meme-coin rally.
